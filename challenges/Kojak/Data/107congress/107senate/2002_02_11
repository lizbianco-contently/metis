Mr. President, I rise to speak to my colleagues about \nour trade policy with Mexico and a very specific dispute we have with \nthem, a dispute that affects agriculture, definitely, and, within \nagriculture, the production of corn.\n  Few trade policy developments in recent years have been more \nsignificant for the United States than our flourishing economic \npartnership with Mexico, a partnership that results from trade \nagreements that have been worked out and are working very well for both \ncountries. The comprehensive free trade agreement, in which we both \nparticipate and which has contributed so much to the prosperity and \neconomic freedom in both countries, stands as a model of hemispheric \ncooperation.\n  I am greatly troubled by a recent Mexican action that targets the \ncorn-refining industry. I fear this may disrupt and even seriously \ndamage our bilateral trade relations.\n  On January 1 of this year, Mexico, through congressional action--\nmeaning their Congress--imposed a totally unwarranted discriminatory \ntax of from 10 to 20 percent on soft drinks sweetened with high \nfructose corn syrup. The United States is a major supplier of high \nfructose corn syrup. We export\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\nit directly to Mexico, and it is produced in Mexico by wholly owned \nsubsidiaries of U.S. firms. These companies have invested hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in Mexico, providing many jobs to Mexican workers.\n  Much of the corn used to produce high fructose corn syrup is grown in \nmy own State of Iowa. We are No. 1 of the 50 States in the production \nof corn, as well as soybeans.\n  I do not like to attribute bad motives to my neighbors, including \nMexico, but we not do these sorts of retaliatory things like are being \ndone in Mexico. So I don't suppose I should attribute bad motives to my \nneighbors because we don't do that to our neighbors in Iowa. Obviously, \nI don't like to do it to a country with which we share a hemisphere and \na rich cultural heritage, considering the fact that such a high \npercentage of the American population is Hispanic.\n  I want to get back to strictly the facts. The fact is that Mexico \napplies this new tax only to soft drinks containing high fructose corn \nsyrup, not soft drinks containing sweetener from cane sugar. Cane sugar \nis something that Mexico produces in great abundance. Those soft drinks \nare exempt from this tax that is applied just to soft drinks made with \nhigh fructose corn syrup.\n  In my judgment, this discriminatory application of the tax clearly \nviolates Mexico's World Trade Organization national treatment \nobligations. If the Mexican tax stays on the books for the rest of the \nyear, the corn growers and corn refiners in Iowa and throughout the \nUnited States are going to be badly hurt. I fear that some of them may \nhave income and their income will go down and, obviously, will \njeopardize their farms and at least their livelihoods.\n  Now, estimates are that corn refiners will lose about $244 million \njust this year alone. Our farmers will lose another $66 million in the \nsale of corn. As surplus high fructose corn syrup production mounts, \nother losses will pile up as well.\n  So even though President Vicente Fox brings progressive political \nleadership to Mexico--a leadership that I greatly admire and respect--\nit looks as if some nonprogressive members of the Mexican Congress are \nstill employing the old, tired politics of the past, the old politics \nof protectionism.\n  The Mexican congressional motto is: If you can't compete fairly or \nefficiently, try to muscle your competition out of the market. This is \njust the sort of ``beggar thy neighbor'' trade policy of the past that \nwe have worked so hard to overcome, both with the creation of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and with the creation of the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  So it is very discouraging, then, just as we start the real work on a \nnew round of World Trade Organization trade negotiations, in which we \nhope to further liberalize world trade, and especially trade in \nagricultural products, to suddenly find ourselves fighting a harmful \nprotectionist measure imposed by one of our closest neighbors and \ntrading partners, and a neighbor that we want to call ``friend.''\n  Currently, Mexico is our third largest agricultural export market. \nThis market grew an astounding 15 percent just last year. If the \npresent trade continues, Mexico will probably surpass Canada as our \nsecond largest agricultural market within 2 or 3 years.\n  I know this robust growth in competitive agricultural exports has \ncaused some friction between our two countries, but we cannot and must \nnot handle our differences by resorting to the ``beggar thy neighbor'' \npolicies of the past.\n  One response to Mexico's unfair and illegal tax on high-fructose corn \nsyrup would be to enact a similar tax on a Mexican product, the drink \nreferred to as Mezcal. So far, I have not pursued this sort of \nretaliation. I still hope that Mexico will respect its international \ntrade commitments and repeal this legislation, and repeal it \npermanently.\n  Mr. President, let me make this very clear. I think it is legitimate \nthat my patience and the patience of the agricultural interests in the \nUnited States is limited. It ought to be that way.\n  Minister Luis Derbez, who is Mexico's secretary of the economy, \nstated that his government is committed to resolving this issue by \nFebruary 15. That is this week. I accept Minister Derbez's word, but \nnow is the time for the congressmen and the ministers of the cabinet of \nMexico to resolve this issue, before we do any more damage to America's \nhard-working farming families and our trade relations with our friend, \nthe country of Mexico.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S574-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S574-S577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GENERAL PERVEZ MUSHARRAF'S SPEECH TO THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on January 12, Gen. Pervez Musharraf of \nPakistan spoke to his people at a moment of great danger. Half a \nmillion Indian troops were massing on the border over the contentious \nissue of Kashmir, unresolved for over 50 years, and the December 13 \nterrorist attack on the Indian Parliament. Memories were still fresh of \n100,000 demonstrators in the streets after September 11, praising Osama \nbin Laden and burning effigies of Musharraf and President Bush.\n  The speech was given to the nation of Pakistan, but it was followed \nclosely by India and the West.\n  He made the choice facing Pakistan very clear. In his words, the \n``day of reckoning'' had come. His nation must choose between the \nKalishnikov culture of religious extremism and a progressive Islamic \nstate. He made his case in terms far different than Western secular \nleaders. Speaking to his Muslim nation, he invoked the name of the \nProphet Mohammad, the Koran and Islamic history and tradition.\n  If Osama bin Laden could find justification for his hate-filled \nextremism in a corruption of Islamic belief, Musharraf found tolerance, \nuniversal brotherhood and peace in Islam.\n  When we met with him 2 days later in the Presidential residence, he \nrepeated the message in his speech that Islam teaches not only an \nobligation to God--Haqooq Allah--but also an obligation to others--\nHaqooq Al-ebad. And beyond the rhetoric of tolerance, he calls for a \nhistoric change in the madrassas, Islamic religious schools, so often \nidentified with the memorization of the Koran, little or no education, \nand a breeding ground for hatred.\n  Pakistan's new jihad against illiteracy and poverty will require the \nmadrassas to be religious schools, with a recognized curriculum, \nregistered with the state; accredited in math, science and English, \nwith trained teachers and foreign students deported if they are not \nlegally in the country.\n  And he went further. All mosques are to be registered. Newer mosques \nrequire government permission and the loudspeakers outside the mosque, \nused traditionally for a call to prayer, cannot be used to incite \nhatred or extremism.\n  Musharraf told us that the public response to his revolutionary \nmessage has been positive, even among the Muslim clergy who met with \nhim before it was given.\n  He believes that Pakistan, in his words, the ``Citadel of Islam,'' \ncan show the world that the Muslim faith is consistent with the values \nof this new century.\n  If real peace and progress are to come to the Islamic world, we must \nhelp him succeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nPresident General Pervez Musharaf's Address to the Nation, January 12, \n                                  2002\n\n       I begin in the name of God, the most Beneficent, the most \n     Merciful.\n       Pakistani Brothers and Sisters!\n       As you would remember, ever since I assumed office, I \n     launched a campaign to rid the society of extremism, violence \n     and terrorism and strived to project Islam in its true \n     perspective. In my first speech on October 17, 1999, I had \n     said and I quote; ``Islam teaches tolerance, not hatred; \n     universal brotherhood, not enmity; peace, and not violence. I \n     have a great respect for the Ulema and expect them to come \n     forward and present Islam in its true light. I urge them to \n     curb elements which are exploiting religion for vested \n     interests and bringing a bad\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\n     name to our faith''. After this, I initiated a number of \n     steps in this regard. First, in the year 2000, I started \n     interacting with the Taliban and counseled them to inculcate \n     tolerance and bring moderation in their ways. I also told \n     them that those terrorists who were involved in terrorist \n     acts in Pakistan and seeking refuge in Afghanistan should be \n     returned to us. Unfortunately, we did not succeed.\n       In the year 2001, I think it was January, we sealed the \n     Pak-Afghan borders and I gave directions that no students of \n     any Madarissah (religious seminaries) should be allowed to \n     cross into Afghanistan without relevant documents. After \n     this, I despatched a number of delegations to meet Mullah \n     Omar. I continued to advise them tolerance and balance. \n     Later, on February 15, 2001, we promulgated the Anti-\n     Weaponisation Ordinance. Through this law, we launched a de-\n     weaponisation campaign in Pakistan.\n       On 5th of June, on the occasion of the Seerat Conference, I \n     addressed Ulema belonging to all Schools of thought and spoke \n     firmly to them against religious extremism. On the 14th of \n     August 2001, we finally took a very important decision to ban \n     Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Muhammad and placed Sipah-e-\n     Sahaba and TJP (Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan) under observation. \n     In addition, on a number of occasions, I called Ulema and \n     Mashaikh and held extensive consultations with them.\n       The objective was to take them on board in our campaign \n     against terrorism and extremism. These measures have been \n     continuing since our government assumed office in 1999. I am \n     explaining all this to you in great detail only because of \n     the fact that the campaign against extremism undertaken by us \n     from the very beginning is in our own national interest. We \n     are not doing this under advice or pressure from anyone.\n       Rather, we are conscious that it is in our national \n     interest. We are conscious that we need to rid society of \n     extremism and this is being done right from the beginning.\n       This domestic reforms process was underway when a terrorist \n     attack took place against the United States on the 11th of \n     September. This terrorist act led to momentous changes all \n     over the world. We decided to join the international \n     coalition against terrorism and in this regard I have already \n     spoken to you on a number of occasions. We took this decision \n     on principles and in our national interest.\n       By the grace of God Almighty our decision was absolutely \n     correct. Our intentions were noble and God Almighty helped \n     us. I am happy to say that the vast majority of Pakistanis \n     stood by this decision and supported our decision. I am proud \n     of the realistic decision of our nation. What really pains me \n     is that some religious extremist parties and groups opposed \n     this decision. What hurts more was that their opposition was \n     not based on principles. At a critical juncture in our \n     history, they preferred their personal and party interests \n     over national interests.\n       They tried their utmost to mislead the nation, took out \n     processions and resorted to agitation. But their entire \n     efforts failed. The people of Pakistan frustrated their \n     designs. As I have said, I am proud of the people of Pakistan \n     who support correct decisions and do not pay heed to those \n     who try to mislead them.\n       I have interacted with the religious scholars on a number \n     of occasions and exchanged views with them. I am happy to say \n     that our discussions have been very fruitful. A majority of \n     them are blessed with wisdom and vision and they do not mix \n     religion with politics.\n       Some extremists, who were engaged in protests, are people \n     who try to monopolise and attempt to propagate their own \n     brand of religion.\n       They think as if others are not Muslims. These are the \n     people who considered the Taliban to be a symbol of Islam and \n     that the Taliban were bringing Islamic rennaissance or were \n     practising the purest form of Islam. They behaved as if the \n     Northern Alliance, against whom the Taliban were fighting, \n     were non-Muslims! Whereas, in fact, both were Muslims and \n     believers. These extremists were those people who do not talk \n     of ``Haqooqul Ibad'' (obligations towards fellow human \n     beings). They do not talk of these obligations because \n     practising them demands self-sacrifice. How will they justify \n     their Pajeros and expensive vehicles? I want to ask these \n     extremists as to who was responsible for misleading thousands \n     of Pakistanis to their massacre in Afghanistan? These misled \n     people were let down by the very people in whose support they \n     had gone. All of us should learn a lesson from this. We must \n     remember that we are Pakistanis. Pakistan is our identity, \n     our motherland.\n       We will be aliens outside Pakistan and be treated as \n     aliens. Pakistan is our land. It is our soil. If we forsake \n     it, we will face difficulties. This lesson we must learn.\n       Sectarian terrorism has been going on for years.\n       Every one of us is fed up of it. It is becoming unbearable. \n     Our peace-loving people are keen to get rid of the Klashinkov \n     and weapon culture. Every one is sick of it. It was \n     because of this that we banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and \n     Sipah-e-Muhammad. Yet little improvement occurred. The day \n     of reckoning has come.\n       Do we want Pakistan to become a theocratic state? Do we \n     believe that religious education alone is enough for \n     governance or do we want Pakistan to emerge as a progressive \n     and dynamic Islamic welfare state? The verdict of the masses \n     is in favour of a progressive Islamic state. This decision, \n     based on the teaching of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) \n     and in line with the teachings of Quaid-e-Azam and Allama \n     Iqbal will put Pakistan on the path of progress and \n     prosperity.\n       Let us honestly analyse what the few religious extremists \n     have attempted to do with Pakistan and Islam.\n       First, with regard to Afghanistan, they indulged in \n     agitational activities. Look at the damage it has caused! \n     Pakistan's international image was tarnished and we were \n     projected by the international media as ignorant and \n     backward. Our economy suffered. A number of export orders \n     already placed with Pakistani industry were cancelled and no \n     new orders materialised. This led to closure of some \n     factories and unemployment. The poor daily wage earners lost \n     their livelihood. Extremists also formed a Pakistan-\n     Afghanistan Defence Council! Apart from damaging Pakistan, \n     they had negative thinking and had no idea of anything good \n     for Afghanistan. Did they ever think of bringing about peace \n     to Afghanistan through reconciliation among the Taliban and \n     Northern Alliance? Did they counsel tolerance to them? Did \n     they ever think of collecting funds for the welfare, \n     rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war-ravaged \n     Afghanistan, or to mitigate sufferings of the poor Afghan \n     people? Did they think of a solution to the hunger, poverty \n     and destruction in Afghanistan? To my knowledge, only Maulana \n     Abdul Sattar Edhi, God bless him, and some foreign NGOs and \n     the UN organisations were providing the Afghans with food and \n     medicines.\n       These extremists did nothing except contributing to \n     bloodshed in Afghanistan. I ask of them, whether they know \n     any thing other then disruption and sowing seeds of hatred? \n     Does Islam preach this?\n       Now, let us see their activity outside Afghanistan.\n       They initiated sectarian feuds.\n       Sects and different schools of thought in Islam have \n     existed since long. There is nothing wrong with intellectual \n     differences flowing from freedom of thought as long as such \n     differences remain confined to intellectual debates. Look at \n     what this extremist minority is doing? They are indulging in \n     fratricidal killings. There is no tolerance among them.\n       Quaid-e-Azam declared that Pakistan belonged to followers \n     of all religions; that every one would be treated equally. \n     However, what to speak of other religions, Muslims have \n     started killing each other.\n       I think, these people have declared more Muslims as Kafirs \n     (infidels) than motivating the non-Muslims to embrace Islam. \n     Look at the damage they have caused?\n       They have murdered a number of our highly qualified \n     doctors, engineers, civil servants and teachers who were \n     pillars of our society. Who has suffered? The families of the \n     dead, no doubt. But a greater loss was inflicted on Pakistan \n     because, as I said, we lost the pillars of our society. These \n     extremists did not stop here. They started killing other \n     innocent people in mosques and places of worship.\n       Today, people are scared of entering these sacred places of \n     worship. It is a matter of shame that police have to be \n     posted outside for their protection. We claim Islam as Deen \n     or a complete way of life.\n       Is this the way of life that Islam teaches us? That we \n     fight amongst ourselves and feel scared of fellow Muslims, \n     scared of visiting our places of worship where police have to \n     be deputed outside for protection? Mosques are being misused \n     for propagating and inciting hatred against each other's sect \n     and beliefs and against the Government, too.\n       I would like to inform you that a number of terrorist rings \n     have been apprehended. In Karachi, the Inspector General of \n     Police, while briefing me, informed that the leader of one of \n     these groups is the Pesh Imam (Prayer Leader) of a Mosque in \n     Malir. The Imam has confessed to murdering many people \n     himself. This is the state of affairs. To what purpose are we \n     using our mosques for? These people have made a state within \n     a state and have challenged the writ of the government.\n       Now, I would like to dwell upon the subject of Madaris or \n     Religious Schools in some detail. These schools are excellent \n     welfare set-ups where the poor get free board and lodge. In \n     my opinion, no NGO can match their welfare aspects. Many of \n     the madaris are imparting excellent education. In addition to \n     religious teachings, other subjects such as science education \n     and computer training are also being imparted there.\n       I am thankful to them for undertaking excellent welfare \n     measures without State funding. I would also like to say that \n     I have projected madaris internationally and with various \n     heads of states time and again.\n       I think no one else in Pakistan has done so much for their \n     cause. However, there are some negative aspects of some \n     madrassahs. These few impart only religious education and \n     such education which produces semi-literate religious \n     scholars. This is a weakness.\n       Very few madaris, I repeat very few of them, are under the \n     influence of politico-religious parties or have been \n     established by them. I know that some of these promote \n     negative thinking and propagate hatred and violence instead \n     of inculcating tolerance, patience and fraternity.\n       We must remember that historically, the madarasa was a \n     prestigious seat of learning. They were citadels of knowledge \n     and beacon of light for the world.\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\n       When Islam was at its zenith, every discipline of learning \n     e.g.: mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and \n     jurisprudence were taught at these institutions. Great Muslim \n     luminaries such as Al-Beruni, Ibn-e-Sina (Avesina) and Ibn \n     Khuldoon, were the products of these same madaris.\n       And if we study history, we see that from the 7th to 15th \n     century AD, transfer of technology took place from the \n     Muslims to the rest of the world. Look at Muslims' condition \n     today. Islam teaches us to seek knowledge, even if it \n     involved travel to China. I am sure you are aware that the \n     Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) had told prisoners of war in the \n     Battle of Badar that they would be set free if each of them \n     imparted education to ten Muslims. Quite obviously, this \n     education could not have been religious education as the \n     prisoners were non-Muslims. So the Prophet (Peace Be Upon \n     Him) was actually referring to worldly education. If we do \n     not believe in education, are we following the teachings of \n     Islam or violating them? We must ask what direction are we \n     being led into by these extremists?\n       The writ of the government is being challenged.\n       Pakistan has been made a soft state where the supremacy of \n     law is questioned. This situation can not be tolerated any \n     more. The question is what is the correct path? First of all, \n     we must rid the society of sectarian hatred and terrorism, \n     promote mutual harmony. Remember that mindsets can not be \n     changed through force and coercion. No idea can ever be \n     forcibly thrust upon any one. May be the person changes \n     outwardly but minds and hearts can never be converted by \n     force. Real change can be brought about through personal \n     example, exemplary character and superior intellect. It can \n     be brought about by Haqooq-ul-ibad (Obligation towards fellow \n     beings).\n       Have we forgotten the example of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be \n     Upon Him) where Islam was spread by virtue of his personal \n     conduct, true leadership and that is how changes in the world \n     took place at that time. We have forgotten the teaching of \n     revered personalities of Islam like Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh, \n     Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Fareed Ganj Shakar, Baha-uddin \n     Zakria etc.\n       Was Islam spread by them through force and coercion?\n       No. They preached Islam by personal example. I give these \n     examples because it hurts me to see where we have relegated \n     ourselves now. We must restore that status of Madaris to what \n     it originally was. We have to change the state of affairs and \n     take them on the path of improvement.\n       The second thing I want to talk about is the concept of \n     Jehad in its totality. I want to dilate upon it because it is \n     a contentious issue, requiring complete comprehension and \n     understanding. In Islam, Jehad is not confined to armed \n     struggles only. Have we ever thought of waging Jehad against \n     illiteracy, poverty, backwardness and hunger? This is the \n     larger Jehad.\n       Pakistan, in my opinion, needs to wage Jehad against these \n     evils. After the battle of Khyber, the Prophet (Peace Be Upon \n     Him) stated that Jehad-e-Asghar (Smaller Jehad) is over but \n     Jehad-e-Akbar (Greater Jehad) has begun. This meant that \n     armed Jehad i.e. the smaller Jehad was now over and the \n     greater Jehad against backwardness and illiteracy had \n     started.\n       Pakistan needs Jehad-e-Akbar at this juncture.\n       By the way we must remember that only the government of the \n     day and not every individual can proclaim armed Jehad. The \n     extremist minority must realise that Pakistan is not \n     responsible of waging armed Jehad in the world. I feel that \n     in addition to Haqooq Allah (Obligations to God), we should \n     also focus on Haqooq-Al-ebad (Obligations towards fellow \n     human beings). At Schools, Colleges and Madaris, Obligations \n     towards fellow beings should be preached. We know that we \n     have totally ignored the importance of correct dealings with \n     fellow human beings. There is no room for feuds in Islamic \n     teachings. It is imperative that we teach true Islam i.e. \n     tolerance, forgiveness, compassion, justice, fair play, amity \n     and harmony, which is the true spirit of Islam. We must adopt \n     this.\n       We must shun negative thinking.\n       We have formulated a new strategy for Madaris and there is \n     need to implement it so as to galvanize their good aspects \n     and remove their drawbacks. We have developed a new syllabi \n     for them providing for teaching of Pakistan studies, \n     Mathematics, Science and English along with religious \n     subjects. Even if we want these Madaris to produce religious \n     leaders they should be educated along these lines. Such \n     people will command more respect in the society because they \n     will be better qualified. To me, students of religious \n     schools should be brought in to the mainstream of society. If \n     any one of them opts to join college or university, he would \n     have the option of being equipped with the modern education. \n     If a child studying at a madrasa does not wish to be a prayer \n     leader and he wants to be a bank official or seek employment \n     elsewhere, he should be facilitated.\n       It would mean that the students of Madaris should be \n     brought to the mainstream through a better system of \n     education. This is the crux of the Madrasa strategy.\n       This by no means is an attempt to bring religious \n     educational institutions under Government control nor do we \n     want to spoil the excellent attributes of these institutions. \n     My only aim is to help these institutions in over coming \n     their weaknesses and providing them with better facilities \n     and more avenues to the poor children at these institutions.\n       We must check abuse of mosques and madaris and they must \n     not be used for spreading political and sectarian prejudices. \n     We want to ensure that mosques enjoy freedom and we are \n     here to maintain it. At the same time we expect a display \n     of responsibility along with freedom. If the Imam of \n     mosques fail to display responsibility, curbs would have \n     to be placed on them.\n       After this analysis, now, I come to some conclusions and \n     decisions:\n       First, we have to establish the writ of the Government. All \n     organizations in Pakistan will function in a regulated \n     manner. No individual, organization or Party will be allowed \n     to break law of the land. The internal environment has to be \n     improved.\n       Maturity and equilibrium have to be established in the \n     society. We have to promote an environment of tolerance, \n     maturity, responsibility, patience and understanding. We have \n     to check extremism, militancy, violence and fundamentalism. \n     We will have to forsake the atmosphere of hatred and anger. \n     We have to stop exploitation of simple poor people of the \n     country and not to incite them to fueds and violence. We must \n     concern ourselves with our own country. Pakistan comes first. \n     We do not need to interfere and concern ourselves with \n     others. There is no need to interfere in other countries.\n       Now I turn to other important issues. In my view there are \n     three problems causing conflict and agitation in our minds. \n     They include: first the Kashmir Cause; secondly all political \n     disputes at the international level concerning Muslims; and \n     thirdly internal sectarian disputes and differences.\n       These are the three problems which create confusion in our \n     minds. I want to lay down rules of behaviour concerning all \n     the three.\n       Let us take the Kashmir Cause first. Kashmir runs in our \n     blood. No Pakistani can afford to sever links with Kashmir. \n     The entire Pakistan and the world knows this.\n       We will continue to extend our moral, political and \n     diplomatic support to Kashmiris. We will never budge an inch \n     from our principle stand on Kashmir. The Kashmir problem \n     needs to be resolved by dialogue and peaceful means in \n     accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people and the \n     United Nations resolutions. We have to find the solution of \n     this dispute. No organization will be allowed to indulge in \n     terrorism in the name of Kashmir. We condemn the terrorist \n     acts of September 11, October 1 and December 13. Anyone found \n     involved in any terrorist act would be dealt with sternly.\n       Strict action will be taken against any Pakistani \n     individual, group or organization found involved in terrorism \n     within or outside the country. Our behaviour must always be \n     in accordance with international norms.\n       On this occasion, as President of Pakistan, I want to \n     convey a message to Prime Minister Vajpaee: If we want to \n     normalize relations between Pakistan and India and bring \n     harmony to the region, the Kashmir dispute will have to be \n     resolved peacefully through a dialogue on the basis of the \n     aspirations of the Kashmiri people.\n       Solving the Kashmir Issue is the joint responsibility of \n     our two countries. Let me repeat some of the observations \n     made by you, Mr. Vajpayee, some time back, and I quote: \n     ``Mind-sets will have to be altered and historical baggage \n     will have to be jettisoned.'' I take you on this offer. Let \n     us start talking in this very spirit.\n       Now as Commander of the Armed Forces of Pakistan, I wish to \n     convey another message. The Armed Forces of Pakistan are \n     fully prepared and deployed to meet any challenge. They will \n     spill the last drop of their blood in the defence of their \n     country. Let there be no attempt of crossing the border in \n     any sector as it will be met with full force. Do not \n     entertain any illusions on this count.\n       I would also like to address the international community, \n     particularly the United States on this occasion. As I said \n     before on a number of occasions, Pakistan rejects and \n     condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestation. \n     Pakistan will not allow its territory to be used for any \n     terrorist activity anywhere in the world. Now you must play \n     an active role in solving the Kashmir dispute for the sake of \n     lasting peace and harmony in the region. We should be under \n     no illusion that the legitimate demand of the people of \n     Kashmir can ever be suppressed without their just resolution. \n     Kashmiris also expect that you ask India to bring an end to \n     state terrorism and human rights violations. Let human rights \n     organizations, Amnesty International, the international media \n     and U.N. peacekeepers be allowed to monitor activities of the \n     Indian occupation forces.\n       Now we come to the second problem, which causes confusion \n     in our minds and is of our particular concern. It relates to \n     conflicts involving Muslims. Our religious leaders involve \n     themselves in such conflicts without giving serious thought \n     to them. I don't want to talk at length on this.\n       It is for the government to take a position on \n     international issues. Individuals, organizations and \n     political parties should restrict their activities to \n     expression of their views. I request them to express their \n     views on international issues in an intellectual spirit and \n     in a civilized manner through force of argument.\n       Views expressed with maturity and moderation have greater \n     convincing power. Expressing views in a threatening manner \n     does not create any positive effect and anyone who indulges \n     in hollow threats is taken as an unbalanced person by the \n     world at large.\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\n       I would request that we should stop interfering in the \n     affairs of others. First, we should attain the strength and \n     the importance where our views carry weight when we express \n     them.\n       Now we come to internal decisions.\n       The third issue causing conflict in our minds relates to \n     sectarian differences. As I have already pointed out that \n     writ of the Government will be established. No individual, \n     organization or party will be allowed to break the law of \n     the land. All functioning will be in a regulated manner \n     and within rules.\n       Now I come to the extremist organizations. Terrorism, and \n     sectarianism must come to an end. I had announced a ban on \n     Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Mohammad on 14 August last \n     year. On that occasion, I had pointed out that Sipah-e-Sahaba \n     and TJP would be kept under observation.\n       I am sorry to say that there is not much improvement in the \n     situation. Sectarian violence continues unabated. We have \n     busted several gangs involved in sectarian killings. You \n     would be astonished to know that in year 2001 about 400 \n     innocent people fell victim to sectarian and other killings.\n       Many of the gangs apprehended include people mostly \n     belonging to Sipah-e-Sahaba and some to TJP. This situation \n     cannot be tolerated any more. I, therefore, announce banning \n     of both Sipah-e-Sahaba and TJP. In addition to these, TNSM \n     (Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi) being responsible for \n     misleading thousands of simple poor people into Afghanistan \n     also stands banned.\n       This organization is responsible for their massacre in \n     Afghanistan. The Government has also decided to put the Sunni \n     Tehreek under observation. No organization is allowed to form \n     Lashkar, Sipah or Jaish. The Government has banned Jaish-e-\n     Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n       Any organization or individual would face strict punitive \n     measures if found inciting the people to violence in internal \n     or external contexts.\n       Our mosques are sacred places where we seek the blessings \n     of God Almighty. Let them remain sacred. We will not allow \n     the misuse of mosques. All mosques will be registered and no \n     new mosques will be built without permission. The use of \n     loudspeakers will be limited only to call for prayers, and \n     Friday Sermon and Vaaz.\n       However, I would like to emphasise that special permission \n     is being given for ``Vaaz'' (Sermon). If this is misused the \n     permission will be cancelled.\n       If there is any political activity, inciting of sectarian \n     hatred or propagation of extremism in any mosque, the \n     management would be held responsible and proceeded against \n     according to law.\n       I appeal to all Pesh Imams to project the qualities of \n     Islam in the mosques and invite the people to piety. Talk of \n     obligations towards fellow beings, exhort them to abstain \n     from negative thoughts and promote positive thinking. I hope \n     that all Nazims, Distt. Police officers and Auqaf Department \n     officials will take quick action against violators of these \n     measures.\n       On Madaris, a detailed policy will be issued through a new \n     Madressa Ordinance. The Ordinance will be issued in a few \n     days. I feel happy that the Madressa policy has been \n     finalized in consultation with religious scholars and \n     Mashaikh. I have touched on the merits and shortcomings \n     prevailing in the Madaris. Merits have to be reinforced while \n     shortcomings have to be rooted out. Under the Madressa \n     policy, their functioning will be regulated. These Madaris \n     will be governed by same rules and regulations applicable to \n     other schools, colleges and universities. All Madaris will be \n     registered by 23rd March 2002 and no new Madressa will be \n     opened without permission of the Government.\n       If any Madressa (religious school) is found indulging in \n     extremism, subversion, militant activity or possessing any \n     types of weapons, it will be closed.\n       All Madaris will have to adopt the new syllabi by the end \n     of this year. Those Madaris which are already following such \n     syllabi are welcome to continue. The Government has decided \n     to provide financial assistance to such Madaris. The \n     government will also help the Madaris in the training of \n     their teachers. The Ministry of Education has been instructed \n     to review courses of Islamic education in all schools and \n     colleges also with a view to improving them. So far as \n     foreign students attending Madaris are concerned, we have set \n     rules for them. Foreign students who do not have proper \n     documents would be required to comply with the formalities by \n     23rd March 2002; otherwise they can face deportation.\n       Any foreigner wanting to attend Madaris in Pakistan will \n     have to obtain required documents from his/her native country \n     and NOC from the government. Only then, he or she will get \n     admission. The same rules will apply to foreign teachers.\n       Some Ulema were of the view that some poor people who come \n     to Pakistan for religious education should not be deported to \n     the countries of their origin.\n       I agree that this is a genuine demand but such people \n     should regularize their stay in Pakistan through their \n     respective embassies. As I have said, all such activity has \n     to be regulated and the writ of the Government must be \n     established.\n       With a view to ending conflict, I have explained to you at \n     great length the three areas causing confusion in our minds. \n     Making rules, regulations and issuing ordinances is easy but \n     their implementation is difficult. However, I feel all the \n     measures I have announced are of utmost importance. We have \n     to implement them. In this regard, the law enforcement \n     agencies including police must perform their duty.\n       We are introducing reforms in the police with a view to \n     improving their efficiency. A great responsibility lies on \n     their shoulders.\n       I have directed the police to ensure implementation of the \n     steps announced by the government and I have no doubt they \n     will be motivated to perform their duty.\n       After reforms we expect they will be better trained and \n     equipped to discharge their duty. Rangers and civil armed \n     forces will be in their support.\n       We are also taking steps in consultation with the judiciary \n     for speedy trial of cases relating to terrorism and \n     extremism. Anti-terrorist courts are being strengthened and \n     necessary orders will be issued in a few days.\n       Apart from these issues, I would also like to inform you, \n     my brothers and sisters, that we have been sent a list of 20 \n     people by India.\n       I want to clear our position on this. There is no question \n     of handing over any Pakistani. This will never be done. If we \n     are given evidence against those people, we will take action \n     against them in Pakistan under our own laws. As far as non-\n     Pakistanis are concerned, we have not given asylum to any \n     one. Any one falling under this category will be proceeded \n     against whenever one is found.\n       My Brothers & Sisters, Pakistan is an Islamic Republic. \n     There are 98 percent Muslims living in this country. We \n     should live like brothers and form an example for rest of the \n     Islamic countries. We should strive to emerge as a \n     responsible and progressive member of the comity of nations.\n       We have to make Pakistan into a powerful and strong \n     country. We have resources and potential. We are capable of \n     meeting external danger. We have to safeguard ourselves \n     against internal dangers. I have always been saying that \n     internal strife is eating us like termite. Don't forget that \n     Pakistan is the citadel of Islam and if we want to serve \n     Islam well we will first have to make Pakistan strong and \n     powerful.\n       There is a race for progress among all nations.\n       We cannot achieve progress through a policy of \n     confrontation and feuds. We can achieve progress through \n     human resource development, mental enlightenment, high moral \n     character and technological development. I appeal to all my \n     countrymen to rise to the occasion. We should get rid of \n     intolerance and hatred and instead promote tolerance and \n     harmony.\n       May God guide us to act upon the true teachings of Islam. \n     May He help us to follow the Quaid-e-Azam's motto: ``Unity, \n     Faith and Discipline''. This should always be remembered. We \n     will be a non-entity without unity.\n       And I would again like to recite a couplet from Allama \n     Iqbal.\n       Fard Qaim Rabte Millat Say Hai Tanha Kuch Naheen.\n       Mauj Hai Darya Main Aur Baroon-e-Darya Kuch Naheen.\n       (Amongst the Community Do Individuals Survive; Not Alone; \n     Like Waves That Exist in Rivers Out of Water Are Not Known.)\n       Pakistan Paindabad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S577-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2843 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2843 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to provide livestock \n          feed assistance to producers affected by disasters)\n\n       On page 126, before line 1, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1.  LIVESTOCK ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 194 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \n     Reform Act of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 6933) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 194. LIVESTOCK ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--the Secretary shall carry out a program \n     to provide livestock feed assistance to livestock producers \n     affected by disasters.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $500,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal year 2003 through 2008.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment that would \npermanently authorize the Livestock Assistance Program.\n  The Livestock Assistance Program at the moment is an ad hoc program \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Farm \nService Agency. It is available to livestock producers in counties that \nhave been declared disaster areas by the President or the Secretary of \nAgriculture. It provides financial relief to livestock producers that \nare experiencing livestock production loss due to drought and other \ndisasters. My amendment permanently authorizes this program, thereby \nacknowledging that drought is a recurring situation, much like low \nmarket prices, which the rest of the farm bill addresses--usually in \nemergency situations for which we provide some funding in advance. The \nLivestock Assistance Program is one of those areas where we have not \ndone that. We want to change it so that we recognize it and then budget \nfor it and then later appropriate for this great need that recurs \nfrequently in the United States. It is just good accounting when you \nknow something is going to happen and then provide for it in advance \ninstead of providing for it at the tail end.\n  Let me tell you a little about the history of the Livestock \nAssistance Program. It began in 1999 as an ad hoc program to assist \nranchers in drought-stricken areas buy feed. Until fiscal year 2002, it \nhad been tacked onto yearly appropriations bills and funded. The outcry \nin my State was loud when the Livestock Assistance Program wasn't \nfunded this year. We will be voting tomorrow on the emergency funding \nof the Livestock Assistance Program for fiscal year 2002. In years of \ndrought, which seem to be every year in Wyoming lately, my ranchers \ndepend on Livestock Assistance Program money to help pay for \nskyrocketing feed costs. They need to know they can depend on our \nassistance when they need it.\n  This buys feed so they can keep the herd alive, which is kind of a \nhumane thing to do.\n  Livestock producers in my State of Wyoming have been hard hit by \ndrought. In fact, some ranchers in my State tell about the grass in \ntheir pastures being destroyed as their cattle walk over it. There is \nnot enough moisture to keep what grass there is rooted in the ground. \nThe drought outlook for this year isn't optimistic. Recently, Wyoming's \nState climatologist reported that a third year of drought is possible. \nAfter Wyoming's warmest summer in 107 years, a normal year would be a \nrelief, but it wouldn't be enough.\n  We need about 180 percent of our normal moisture to get to the \naverage for the year. Unless rains of 125 to 175 percent of normal fall \non my State, my ranchers will be facing a third year of drought. We are \nnot talking about a lot of rain. Wyoming's average rainfall is only 18 \ninches a year. But we are not anywhere near that this year. People who \nare feeding cattle at this time of year during the cold weather are \noften finding that there isn't enough moisture in the ground. At this \ntime of year the ground would normally be frozen, and it would be easy \nto get across the ground. When they dropped off the feed, the feed \nwould still be on top of the ground and the cattle would be able to get \nat it. They have to move their feed every day just to get around.\n  This last weekend I was at the stock show in Denver. It is a big \nnational event. All of the ranchers come in for that during this time \nof year and hold a number of important meetings. When I left that \nmeeting to go to Wyoming, I was in a duststorm. I was in a duststorm \nthat was as bad as any blizzard we have in Wyoming. The visibility was \nextremely limited. You could only see taillights about 100 feet ahead \nof you because the dirt was blowing off the fields. The fields are dry. \nThey haven't had enough moisture so it can freeze and thaw so the dirt \ndoesn't blow away.\n  The past years tell us that we will always fight drought. I still \nbelieve that the forward-looking solution is to provide livestock \nproducers with livestock insurance. They have risks inherent in a \nbusiness that depends on weather. Livestock producers don't have this \ntool. The USDA recently introduced pilot programs to explore this \noption, but until livestock insurance is available to manage risk, we \nshould assist when risk becomes fact.\n  The chart behind me displays how many states have drought \nproblems. It is color coded. If the States are in blue, there isn't a \ndrought problem at the moment. If the States are in red, the entire \nState has already been declared a disaster area. The ones in orange \nhave been partly declared disaster areas, depending on the part of the \nState which submitted applications and were accepted as having the \ndifficulty. The States in yellow have some counties that have emergency \ndesignations because of being contiguous to the other counties that \nhave already been designated.\n\n  You can see that almost the entire United States has this problem. \nFor us to ignore it would be a tragedy.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture designated counties in each of these \nStates as drought disaster areas for 2001.\n  You can see that the pattern is pretty widespread throughout the \nUnited States. If we don't pass this amendment, we are saying, yes, we \nhave a program. It has been a great program. It has saved livestock \nfrom dying in the past. It saved people from having to sell off their \nherds. If we do not fund this program, if we do not put it on the books \nas a permanent program, if we do not show that it has some importance, \nthen it is like a bad joke in our programs.\n  Many of you may not realize that drought begins during the winter \neven when the snow is on the ground. It is born when the snowpack is \ntoo thin. It reaches its full size during the dry summers. And drought \nflexes its full strength in the fall when ranchers are searching for \nwinter feed.\n  My amendment authorizes this program so that we can consider the full \nimpact of drought before it is too late. We are doing our country a \ndisservice by waiting until the Agriculture appropriations bill is \npassed each year to garner support for assisting drought-stricken \nranchers.\n  I am not asking my colleagues to support risky ventures. The poorly \nmanaged ranches went out of business in the first year of drought. \nBesides, the money these ranchers receive isn't enough to save their \nplaces; it is enough to feed the cattle and sheep.\n  I am asking my colleagues to adopt this amendment and assist \ndedicated livestock producers and their families who have persevered \nthrough hardship and continue to fight to stay in business.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming if he will respond to questions in a colloquy about the \nimportant amendment he has offered?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am pleased to respond, Madam President.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask the Senator, is it his intent to \nbring about an authorization for this so-called LAP program, which \nleads to this point, as the Senator has pointed out, that it has \nusually been the result of the appropriations process and a disaster \nbill on an ad hoc basis?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. My purpose is to move it from a last-minute measure to \nan authorized program so that it would go through the normal process \nand be a part of our normal planning.\n  Mr. LUGAR. To be a permanent program?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes, a permanent program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. As I understand the amendment, it does not have mandatory \nfunding attached to the program. It simply is an authorization. As the \nSenator pointed out, therefore, there is some planning, some attention \nthat could be given to the livestock industry throughout the year in \npreparation for the appropriations process.\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes. Our hope is definitely that it becomes a part of the \nnormal planning process, that it becomes a part of the appropriations \nthrough that mechanism rather than always coming in as an emergency, an \nemergency after the fact. It would be before the fact.\n  So I appreciate the question and the attention that is being given to \nit to make it a full-fledged program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Does the Senator have a recollection of how frequently \ndrought has occurred in Wyoming or, for that matter, the surrounding \nStates? Is this an annual situation or perhaps it has occurred 1 out of \n3 years? How would the Senator characterize the dilemma?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, at the present time, we are in the third \nyear of a drought. We normally do not have it every year, although we \nmay have a county or two that would have it--not the same county even--\nbut it is usually on a county-by-county basis. One county may have a \ndrought this year; another county might have a drought next year.\n  But at the moment, our entire State is having a drought, as is \nMontana. They have already gotten their designation. We have not gotten \nour full State designation yet, and it probably would not even be \nnecessary because of some of the surrounding county designations that \nwe pick up that same way.\n  But ever since I got to the Senate, I have been concerned that we \nhave come in with emergency proposals for things that happen on a very \nregular basis and what we know will happen. We do not know where it \nwill happen, but we know it will happen. Wherever it happens in the \nUnited States, we ought to take it into consideration, plan for it, \nbudget for it, and prepare for it before it happens so we can do what \nwe said we would do.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Just on a historical basis, obviously, the ranching \nindustry has been a large one in the Senator's State for many years, \nand I suspect that drought has frequently come. I am just simply \ncurious, as a matter of historical record, how have cattlemen survived \nthese droughts? Has it been really through annual or these ad hoc \nappropriations or is there sort of a law of averages? How would you \ndescribe why people decide to have grazing in Wyoming and how some, at \nleast, have thrived or they would not be in business even to this day?\n\n  Mr. ENZI. We have had the cattle industry in Wyoming since before \nWyoming was a State. We have had some horrible losses before. The \noriginal losses were by people from other countries who were raising \ntheir cattle in Wyoming. They had enough money to get into business to \nbegin with, and they had enough money to survive.\n  We have now gotten more to the point where they are family \nbusinesses, family ranches. The reason this becomes an extreme problem \nis, for example, this is the third year of drought for us. The program \nis even set up so if you receive money in 1 year, you cannot receive \nmoney in the next year. That will create some problems.\n  But the purpose of the program was not to pay for losses they had but \nto provide enough feed to keep them in business. With the cattle \nindustry and the sheep industry, if you have breeding stock, and the \nweather gets really bad--really dry--and you know you are going to be \nin bad shape, and you sell off your breeding stock, you have just gone \nout of business. So mostly what this does is provide the feed supply \nfor the breeding stock itself so that they can keep the herd going year \nafter year. If it was only cattle they were raising on an annual basis, \nthen they would just sell off that cattle.\n  One of the happenings in the past in Wyoming--and in the surrounding \nStates--is ranchers have had to go out of business, and they have had \nto find a way to get back in business at a later time. Of course, \nduring a drought, the people who are buying cattle recognize there is a \ndrought, so they are kind of fire-sale prices that people get. They do \nnot get full compensation for their herd at that time. Part of that is \nbecause there are more cattle being sold off at that time than normal. \nWhen you have an oversupply, the price goes down.\n  So we are trying to keep things together so there can be economic \nplanning on the part of the ranchers as well as on the part of \nGovernment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate the Senator's responses that fill out a very \nfine initial presentation of the bill with the Senator's own \nexperience.\n  Obviously, he speaks not only for the State that he represents so \nwell but for other cattlemen, those who are involved in this process. \nThe chart that he has presented is a comprehensive chart of the entire \nUnited States. There are many problems; therefore, the merits of the \nSenator's amendment really pertain to all of these Americans in \naddition to those he represents in the State of Wyoming.\n  I thank the Senator for his responses. I like the idea, and I would \nplan to support his amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for a period of time not to \nexceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords are printed in Today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2837\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment on the \nfarm bill. I offered this second-degree amendment to the Craig \namendment to clear up any concerns raised by the opposition regarding \nthe word ``control'' in the original Johnson-Grassley amendment banning \npacker ownership of livestock.\n  The new language reads that a packer may not own or feed hogs or \ncattle ``through a subsidiary, or through an arrangement that gives the \npacker operational, managerial, or supervisory control over the \nlivestock, or over the farming operation that produces the livestock, \nto such an extent that the producer is no longer materially \nparticipating in the management of the operation with respect to the \nproduction of livestock.''\n  What we are trying to do is clear up a little blue smoke that has \nbeen raised about the amendment that Senator Johnson and I offered \nprior to the holidays. It was adopted 51 to 46. So we want to clear up \nwhat the word ``control'' means. We do that through the phrase \n``materially participating.''\n  A farmer who materially participates in the farming operation must \npay self-employment taxes. Those who do not materially participate do \nnot have to pay self-employment taxes. The phrase has appeared in the \nIRS Code, section 1402(a), since 1956, and there is a full hopper of \ncase law clarifying the definition. So the words we use to explain what \nwe mean or do not mean by the word ``control'' have a lot of case law \nbehind them.\n  For those who were worried about excessive lawsuits and the actual \nenforcement of the provision being tied up in\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\nthe courts, rest assured that the perceived problem has been fixed.\n  I know that the lobbyists for the American Meat Institute will dream \nup some red herring argument that might attack me, as they have on this \namendment, but that is OK. They do not represent the independent \nproducers; they represent just the packers, bottom line.\n  For those producers who manage their risk through forward contracts \nand marketing agreements, the new language will not affect contractual \nrelationships. Almost all producers who sell hogs or cattle under \nmarketing agreements or forward contracts materially participate in the \nmanagement of the operation and, thus, pay self-employment taxes. These \nindependent producers will not have to change their business practices \nat all.\n  The revised amendment I have offered will inject greater competition, \naccess, transparency, and fairness into the livestock marketplace. \nSmall and medium-sized livestock operations will gain greater access to \nmarkets that will have greater volume and be subject to less \nmanipulation. The revised bill clarifies that arrangements that do not \nimpose control over the producer can still provide all the benefits of \ncoordination and product specification.\n  I have worked on the second-degree amendment with the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and also \nwith Senator Johnson, the original cosponsor with me of the original \nlanguage before the holidays, and the Iowa Farm Bureau and the American \nFarm Bureau Federation. We are all confident this amendment does \nexactly what we claim, which is to limit packer ownership but avoid \nimpacting risk-management tools available for independent producers.\n  I will read, for my Senate colleagues, a letter from the American \nFarm Bureau Federation that states, with confidence, we have \naccomplished our goal and have overcome the blue smoke that the \nAmerican Meat Institute and the packers have raised against the \noriginal Johnson-Grassley amendment:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports Senator \n     Grassley's amendment to clarify the issue of ``control'' \n     under the packer ownership prohibition. This would allow \n     producers to forward contract, pursue marketing arrangements, \n     develop branded products, schedule animals to their plants, \n     and to receive value-based premiums. We urge you to support \n     the Grassley amendment to clarify ``control.''\n       Packer ownership has resulted in an increase in packer \n     market power by allowing the packers the opportunity to stay \n     out of the cash market for extended periods of time, often \n     reducing farm gate demand and driving down prices paid to \n     producers. This has resulted in the inability of independent \n     producers to access the market. These transactions concerning \n     packer-owned livestock are not part of the publicly-reported \n     daily cash market. Narrowing the volume in the market makes \n     it more subject to manipulation and often results in lower \n     prices paid to producers.\n       We urge you to oppose the Craig amendment and support the \n     Grassley amendment calling for clarification to the \n     prohibition of packer ownership included in the Senate farm \n     bill.\n  I can't lay it out much more clearly than the statement I just read \nfrom the American Farm Bureau. I should also state that in addition to \nthe Farm Bureau, over 135 other organizations have also signed a letter \nin support of my second degree amendment. Just a few of those groups \nare the Livestock Marketing Association, National Farmers Union, \nNational Farmers Organization, National Family Farm Coalition, R-CALF \nUSA, Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of \nAmerica, United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society, \nNational Catholic Rural Life Conference, and the Organization for \nCompetitive Markets.\n  The packers are an important piece in the rural economy, but only a \npiece, not the whole pie. The question we need to ask ourselves is \nwhether packers should be packers or packers should also be products. \nIs it our intent to let packers compete with producers on an even \nplaying field? Is there any question who will lose?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The reason we keep sows in farrowing stalls is to protect the \npiglets. Sows are extremely important for the health and well-being of \nthe piglets, but if we let the sow out of the crate we stand the chance \nof getting the piglets crushed by the sheer weight of the sow, or \nworse, and watch the sow grow fatter. Let us build a strong farrowing \nstall for the packers and facilitate the health and well being of our \nindependent producers.\n  Support the Grassley second-degree tomorrow.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2542\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak as a cosponsor of an \namendment by my colleague, Senator Santorum, regarding puppy mills. \nThis amendment is based on legislation we introduced last October, S. \n1478, known as the Puppy Protection Act.\n  For more than three decades, Congress has given the responsibility of \nensuring minimum standards of humane care and treatment of animals to \nthe Department of Agriculture, under the Federal Animal Welfare Act.\n  The current guidelines within the Animal Welfare Act do not go far \nenough to protect puppies at large breeding facilities, they merely \nprovide for water and food, and that is questionable. By amending the \nAnimal Welfare Act our amendment will better control the practices of \npuppy breeding in large facilities and address cruel puppy treatment.\n  In these large facilities, puppies are often kept in cramped, dirty \ncages, sometimes stacked on top of each other, exposed to the elements \nin extreme cold and heat, forced to breed incessantly; and deprived of \nadequate food, water, veterinary care, and any semblance of loving \ncontact. I have a chart that outlines the top 10 violations committed \nby commercial dog breeding facilities according to the USDA. These 10 \npoints underscore the fact that something has to be done to stop the \ncruel treatment of puppies. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my \nchart, and a letter from the Humane Society of the United States be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DURBIN. This inhumane treatment has a direct bearing on the \nphysical and mental health of dogs in these facilities. Often, after \nthese puppies join a family, they turn out to have serious health and \npsychological problems that cause them pain, cause their owners great \ndistress, and require expensive medical care.\n  I believe our amendment will address these problems, by filling gaps \nin the current law and encouraging stronger enforcement by USDA to \ncrack down on chronic violators.\n  Our amendment has three components: socialization, breeding, and a \nthree strikes policy. First, it will require commercial breeders to \nprovide socialization for dogs at their facilities. Socialization is \nimportant for puppies during their first few weeks of life because if \nthey're isolated from people and other dogs during those key weeks, \nthey could face a lifetime of serious problems. Second, our amendment \nestablishes some very modest restrictions to prevent extreme over-\nbreeding of dogs by commercial operators. The dogs must be at least \none-year-old before they're bred, and they can't have more than 3 \nlitters during a 24-month period. Third, our amendment contains a \n``three strikes and you're out\" provision to strengthen enforcement of \nthe Animal Welfare Act by cracking down on commercial dog dealers who \nkeep violating the law. If there are three violations during an 8-year \nperiod, the facility will lose its license, unless the Secretary makes \na written finding that revocation is unwarranted because of \nextraordinary extenuating circumstance\n  I've heard from many of my constituents in Illinois, who are deeply \nconcerned about the puppy mill problem and want this legislation \nenacted. Our amendment is supported by national animal protection \norganizations, such as The Humane Society of the United States and the \nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ASPCA, which \ncollectively represent more than 8 million Americans.\n  In addition, more than 860 animal shelters, animal control offices, \nand other state and local organizations across the country have \nendorsed this legislation. In my home State, they include 23 groups in \nIllinois, ranging from the Cook County Department of\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\nAnimal and Rabies Control to the Peoria Animal Welfare Shelter to the \nIllinois Federation of Humane Societies, based in Urbana.\n  I've been pleased to join with Senator Santorum and a number of our \ncolleagues in obtaining additional funds for USDA to improve its \nenforcement of the Animal Welfare Act. We've had terrific support in \nthis effort from Appropriations Chairmen Byrd and Kohl, along with \nRanking Member Cochran, for which I'm very grateful. This amendment \nwill complement those ongoing efforts by strengthening USDA's authority \nto crack down on the bad actors.\n  This amendment will ensure that any commercial dog breeder licensed \nby the Federal Government is meeting basic humane standards of care. We \nowe at least this much to the animals that have earned the title \n``man's best friend.'' We're talking about establishing a safety net to \nprotect dogs, puppies, and the consumers who care about them against \nthe poor treatment practices of the really bad dealers, the ones who \nprovide no interaction; the ones who go against industry norms when it \ncomes to over-breeding. And the ones who repeatedly violate the law \ngoverning the humane care of dogs. The good dealers, however, should be \nrecognized for their work.\n  In closing, it is just unfortunate that it is the good dealers who \nsuffer at the hands of the bad ones, the ones that give the industry a \nbad reputation. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this \nissue, and I urge their support for the Santorum-Durbin amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        Top 10 Violations by Commercial Dog Breeding Facilities\n\n       Here are the most common violations found by USDA in \n     reported enforcement actions of 2000 (in order of frequency):\n       1. Failure to maintain clean and dry enclosures (remove \n     excrement, food waste or corpses on a daily basis);\n       2. Failure to provide veterinary care to animals in need of \n     care;\n       3. Failure to provide outdoor housing with adequate \n     protection from the elements;\n       4. Failure to establish or maintain program to prevent \n     infestation of pests;\n       5. Failure to provide dogs with adequate space;\n       6. Failure to clean and sanitize food receptacles;\n       7. Failure to ensure that enclosures did not have sharp \n     edges that could injure animals;\n       8. Failure to provide water and food;\n       9. Failure to allow USDA inspectors to conduct a complete \n     inspection of facility; and\n       10. Failure to ensure dogs were older than eight weeks of \n     age before delivering them for transport.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The Humane Society\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Support the Santorum-Durbin amendment to the farm bill\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 7 million members \n     and constituents of The Humane Society of the United States \n     (HSUS) and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty \n     to Animals (ASPCA), we urge you to support the Santorum-\n     Durbin amendment to S. 1731 (the Farm Bill). This amendment, \n     which has broad bipartisan support, tracks closely with S. \n     1478, the ``Puppy Protection Act,'' introduced by the \n     amendment authors. The amendment is designed to crack down on \n     so-called ``puppy mills.''\n       The Santorum-Durbin amendment will improve USDA enforcement \n     of the Animal Welfare Act at commercial dog breeding \n     operations in three ways:\n       (1) Encourage swift and strong enforcement against repeat \n     offenders by creating a ``three strikes and you're out'' \n     system for chronic violators.\n       (2) Address the need for breeding females to be given time \n     to recover between litters, and to be at least one year old \n     before they are bred.\n       (3) Require that dogs be adequately socialized with other \n     dogs and with people, enhancing their well-being and helping \n     to prevent behavior problems in the future.\n       Mistreatment of dogs is a chronic problem at puppy mills. \n     Dogs at puppy mills are often overcrowded, subjected to \n     intense over-breeding, denied proper veterinary care, and \n     maintained in substandard and unsanitary housing. Despite \n     public awareness of these problems, the conditions persist. \n     Strengthening the federal Animal Welfare Act to resolve these \n     problems is a warranted and overdue response.\n       Mill dogs are treated as breeding machines. They are kept \n     there for one reason: to produce puppies non-stop, beginning \n     at a very young age, when they are still just puppies \n     themselves. Over-breeding causes serious health problems for \n     the mother and puppies.\n       Consumers are defrauded, believing they are purchasing \n     healthy animals. Because of overbreeding and poor \n     socialization, new puppies from pet stores and large-scale \n     breeding facilities often face an array of behavioral and \n     health problems--with illnesses often requiring consumers to \n     absorb costly veterinary treatment.\n       USDA data reveal that there are at least 3,000 commercial \n     dog breeding facilities operating throughout the country. The \n     Santorum-Durbin amendment will provide USDA with better tools \n     to crack down on chronic law-breakers and to address the \n     important issues of socialization and over-breeding.\n       We anticipate scoring this legislation in the 2001 Humane \n     Scorecard, either by cosponsorship or recorded vote. Please \n     support the Santorum-Durbin amendment to the Farm Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wayne Pacelle,\n       Senior Vice President, Communications and Government \n     Affairs, HSUS.\n     Lisa Weisberg,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public \n     Policy, ASPCA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Q & A on Puppy Protection Act, S. 1478\n\n     Won't this legislation affect ``hobby breeders'' and bring \n         anyone who sells a puppy under federal regulation?\n       Those who maintain three or fewer breeding female dogs and \n     sell their offspring for pets or exhibition are exempt from \n     the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). This means that they do not \n     need to obtain a license, nor are they subject to the AWA's \n     humane care requirements or inspections.\n       Nothing in the Puppy Protection Act changes this ``de \n     minimus'' exemption. Only those who are subject to the rest \n     of the Animal Welfare Act will be subject to the new \n     requirements regarding socialization and overbreeding and to \n     the ``three strikes'' enforcement provision.\n       According to the American Kennel Club's (AKA) records for \n     1997, the overwhelming majority of its registrants--almost \n     97%--had 3 or fewer breeding female dogs.\n       If it becomes necessary to adjust the de minimus threshold \n     because of pending litigation, this can and should be \n     addressed through the regulatory process, with input from all \n     affected parties.\n     Under the ``three strikes'' provision, will breeding \n         facilities be shut down for non-compliance with minor \n         technical rules?\n       The legislation expressly provides that a dealer's license \n     need not be revoked if the Secretary finds that ``the \n     violations were minor and inadvertent, that the violations \n     did not pose a threat to the dogs, or that revocation is \n     inappropriate for other good cause.'' This waiver language is \n     broad enough to cover a range of situations for which \n     revocation might be considered too severe a penalty, such as \n     the scenario cited by opponents involving ``three minor \n     violations. . .even if immediate corrections were made and \n     the dealer was in full compliance with the law.''\n       The legislation further guarantees the licensee a hearing \n     before an Administrative Law Judge within 30 days, to \n     consider whether license revocation is unwarranted.\n     Why cover commercial breeders who supply dogs for research?\n       There are no standards currently covering socialization or \n     overbreeding of any dogs (those destined for research or for \n     the pet trade). The Puppy Protection Act addresses this gap \n     in the Animal Welfare Act.\n       Dogs who will be used for research--and may suffer and give \n     their lives to serve human health needs--are certainly no \n     less deserving of humane care in their first few weeks than \n     those who will become pets.\n       Congress has recognized this moral obligation by providing \n     additional--not lesser--protections for dogs destined for \n     research, in other portions of the Animal Welfare Act.\n       Poor socialization renders dogs fearful and aggressive when \n     they come in contact with people. It is not in the interest \n     of researchers to have dogs who bite and are unmanageable.\n       Breeding female dogs every single heat, beginning when they \n     are too young, seriously compromises their health and the \n     health of their puppies, leavingthem weak and susceptible to \n     disease. The scientific integrity of medical research is \n     undermined if animal subjects are not healthy.\n       If puppies are produced at facilities that chronically \n     violate basic humane standards (for food, water, veterinary \n     care, etc.), their health and their value as research \n     subjects are likely to be compromised. As former Senator Bob \n     Dole said, ``It is obvious that good animal care is essential \n     to ensuring good quality research.''\n       Less than .3% of all animals used in research are dogs, so \n     the impact of this bill on research will be slight. \n     Furthermore, it is not researchers, but the breeding \n     facilities that supply dogs to them, who will be subject to \n     the Puppy Protection Act's requirements, which will in turn \n     benefit the researchers by ensuring healthier dogs.\n     Shouldn't Congress stay out of the business of regulating dog \n         breeding practices?\n       Female dogs at some breeding facilities are made to produce \n     litters every cycle (typically, twice a year) until they are \n     ``spent,'' beginning when they are as young as 6 months old. \n     Such relentless overbreeding causes severe nutritional \n     deficiencies and impairs a dog's immune system, leading to\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\n     increased risk of infections, illness and organ failure. \n     These concerns go to the heart of humane treatment, and are \n     as appropriate for Congress to address as other areas already \n     covered by the AWA, such as adequate veterinary care, food, \n     water, sanitation, ventilation, and shelter from harsh \n     weather.\n       Opponents concede that the legislation's restrictions on \n     breeding are so modest that ``most breeders have much higher \n     standards than the ones called for'' in the Puppy Protection \n     Act; the bill will only affect truly ``bad actors.''\n     If Congress puts restrictions on breeding of dogs, won't this \n         lead to breeding restrictions for livestock?\n       The ``slippery slope'' argument ignores the fact that \n     Congress will only go as far as it considers necessary and \n     acceptable, and is not bound to extend any law.\n       Congress has historically afforded dogs extra protections \n     under the Animal Welfare Act and other federal laws (such as \n     banning the sale of dog fur and restricting military research \n     on dogs), in recognition of the special relationship between \n     dogs and people. Livestock are not even subject to the \n     protections of the Animal Welfare Act.\n     Why not us a ``performance-based standard'' rather than an \n         ``engineering standard'' for socialization?\n       When performance-based standards have been used elsewhere \n     in the Animal Welfare Act (to meet the requirement for \n     promoting psychological well-being of primates), they have \n     proven vague, ineffective, and very difficult to enforce. \n     This approach leaves it up to each facility to figure out how \n     to achieve the desired result, and forces inspectors to make \n     subjective judgments. Conversely, an engineering standard \n     clearly specifies what steps a facility needs to take to \n     comply with the law. The facilities know what is expected of \n     them, and the inspectors know what to check for in \n     determining compliance.\n     Shouldn't industry experts have a say in developing the \n         socialization standard?\n       The legislation provides that minimum requirements for the \n     socialization of dogs will be developed by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture as part of the regulatory process, ensuring that \n     commercial breeders will have ample opportunity to influence \n     the standard-setting. The legislation does not dictate the \n     specific socialization requirements.\n     Why not just focus on better enforcement of existing law and \n         catching those who breed dogs illegally without a \n         license?\n       The sponsors of S. 1478, along with animal protection \n     organizations, are actively involved in obtaining increased \n     funding for USDA to do a better job enforcing the Animal \n     Welfare Act. In the past few years, Congress has appropriated \n     an additional $13 million to enable USDA to track down more \n     unlicensed facilities, conduct more inspections, and improve \n     follow-up enforcement efforts. Opponents of S. 1478, who \n     argue that Congress should direct its attention to better \n     enforcement of existing law, have done little or nothing to \n     secure additional funds toward that end.\n       While Congress is making progress addressing the AWA budget \n     shortfall, it is also important to address gaps in the law to \n     better protect dogs and consumers. All the funding in the \n     world will not resolve the problems that the socialization \n     and breeding provisions of the Puppy Protection Act address.\n\n\n                      multi-lender risk management\n\n  Senator LEAHY. Mr. President, section 541 of S. 1731 makes certain \ntechnical adjustments to the current authority of farm credit system \ninstitutions to participate with non-system lenders in certain multi-\nlender risk management transactions. The system's multi-lender risk \nmanagement authorities have been very successful in achieving the \nobjectives of the 1992 authorizing legislation, as described on page 73 \nof the committee's report.\n  Is it the chairman's understanding that the provisions of S. 1731 \nwill facilitate these partnership arrangements between commercial \nlenders and the system to spread risk among lenders and improve the \navailability of capital for the agricultural and food system, \ncommunication and related technology service companies and utility \nsystems?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S582-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S582-S585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATIONS OF MICHAEL J.

ZAINEY, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE \n   UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to executive session to consider Executive \nCalendar Nos. 670 and 676, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Michael J. Melloy, of \nIowa, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, and Jay \nC. Zainey, of Louisiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 15 \nminutes to be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the nominees' home \nState Senators for working with us on this nomination and by commending \nthe majority leader and our assistant majority leader for bringing this \nmatter to successful conclusion today.\n  I also want to thank Senator Cantwell for chairing the hearing in \nJanuary that laid the groundwork for today's confirmation of Judge \nMichael Melloy as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. That confirmation hearing was held on the second day of \nthis session of Congress and was the twelfth confirmation hearing for \njudicial nominees since the majority shifted last summer. Judge Melloy \nand the five district court nominees included in the hearing that \nSenator Cantwell chaired are the first judicial nominees to receive a \nconfirmation hearing during January since at least 1995.\n  Those nominees were all promptly considered by the committee at our \nbusiness meeting last Thursday and, today, due to that unusually fast \nstart by the committee, Judge Melloy's nomination is being considered \nby the Senate for final action.\n  Last year I noticed our first judicial nominations hearing within 10 \nminutes of the Senate being permitted to reorganize. We held that first \nhearing last session on the day after committee members were assigned. \nIn fact, during the past 7 months we have held 12 hearings involving \njudicial nominees. That is more hearings involving judicial nominees \nthan were held in all of 1996, 1997, 1999 or 2000 and a more rapid pace \nthan in either 1995 or 1998. Unlike the preceding six and one-half \nyears in which no hearings were held in 30 of the months, since the \nCommittee has reorganized last summer, we have held at least one \nhearing for judicial nominees every month. In fact, we held two in \nJuly, two unprecedented hearings during last summer's August recess, \ntwo in December and three in October. With the hearing at which Judge \nMelloy appeared, we now have held at least one hearing for judicial \nnominees every month since we were permitted to reorganize last summer \nafter I became chairman of the committee and the Democrats became the \nmajority party in the Senate.\n  Judge Melloy's confirmation fills a judicial emergency vacancy. That \nseat on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which includes \neight States--Iowa, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North \nDakota and South Dakota--has been vacant since May 1, 1999. I recall \nthat it was not so long ago, in 2000, when the Senate was under \nRepublican control, that another nominee to this very seat on the \nEighth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell, did not receive the courtesy of a vote \nby the committee following the hearing on her nomination. She did not \nreceive a vote due to the previous policy of allowing anonymous holds \nto be placed on nominees, even though in her case, both of her home \nState Senators, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, supported \nher nomination. Bonnie Campbell, the former Attorney General of Iowa, \ndid not receive the courtesy of a vote, up or down, during the 382 days \nbetween her nomination by President Clinton and the time that the Bush \nAdministration withdrew her name.\n  In contrast, we moved expeditiously to consider and report Judge \nMelloy's nomination to the Eighth Circuit. He participated in the first \nconfirmation hearing this year, and his nomination was favorably \nreported by the Committee last week, during the first full week of this \nsession. Judge Melloy's confirmation will eliminate the judicial \nemergency vacancy in that circuit caused, in part, by the committee's \nfailure to act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and the confirmation process.\n  Since the change in majority last summer, we have already moved ahead \nto confirm another new member of the Eighth Circuit. Judge Melloy will \njoin Judge William J. Riley of Nebraska as the second judge considered \nand confirmed to the Eighth Circuit since the\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nsummer. Both nominees were supported by well-respected home-state \nSenators from both parties.\n  Judge Melloy will be the seventh Court of Appeals nomination \nconfirmed by the Senate in the last seven months. That is seven more \nCourt of Appeals judges than a Republican majority confirmed in the \n1996 session, and as many as were confirmed in all of 1997 and in all \nof 1999.\n  During our consideration of Judge Melloy's nomination to be elevated \nto the Eighth Circuit, we learned that Judge Melloy has a reputation \nfor decisions that are fair, well-reasoned and well-written, without \neditorial comment or ideological bent. Judge Melloy was nominated to \nthe Northern District of Iowa in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush and \nconfirmed by the Senate. He previously served for six years as a United \nStates Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Iowa. While \nserving on the District Court for these past 9\\1/2\\ years, Judge Melloy \nalso sat by designation on the Eighth Circuit on several occasions and \nwrote a number of appellate opinions.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  With today's confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed five \nadditional judges since returning late last month. The Senate will have \nconfirmed 33 judges since the change in majority last summer. More than \none-quarter of the judges confirmed have been for judicial emergency \nvacancies, nine so far. Unfortunately, the White House has yet to work \nwith many home-state Senators to send nominees for 14 other judicial \nemergency vacancies.\n  I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a \nshort month with a week's recess. The Committee has not held two \nhearings in the month of February in four years, since 1998.\n  I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited \na frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last \nseveral years. I have already laid out a constructive program of \nsuggestions that would help in that effort and help return the \nconfirmation process to one that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I \nhave included suggestions for the White House, that it work with \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, that it encourage rather than \nforestall the use of bipartisan selection commissions, that it consider \ncarefully the views of home State Senators. Working together, we can \nmake significant progress in filling judicial vacancies.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering today \nthe nominations of two very well-qualified nominees for the Federal \ncourts.\n  Our circuit nominee is Judge Michael Melloy, who has been nominated \nfor a position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \nJudge Melloy has impeccable credentials for this position: He has \nserved for the past decade as a Federal District court judge in Iowa, \nand he served as a bankruptcy court judge for six years before then. In \nhis capacity as a district judge, he has had the honor of having been \ninvited to sit by designation with the Eighth Circuit. I am certain \nthat his distinguished experience will serve him well as he makes the \nmove to join the Eighth Circuit on a permanent basis.\n  Today's district court nominee is Jay Zainey, whom we are considering \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana. Mr Zainey is an experienced \nprivate practitioner who has earned the respect of his colleagues, as \nreflected in his election as president of the Louisiana State Bar \nAssociation. One of the remarkable achievements during his tenure as \nPresident was the creation of the first state bar committee in the \nnation to provide legal referral services for the disabled. He will \nundoubtedly be a welcome addition to the Eastern District bench.\n  I have every confidence that both of these nominees will serve on the \nfederal courts with distinction. I commend President Bush for selecting \nthem, and I thank Chairman Leahy for holding hearings and committee \nvotes on them.\n  I do note that five other district court nominees were unanimously \nvoted out of committee last week along with Judge Melloy and Mr. \nZainey. Given this strong endorsement, I urge the Senate to give their \nnominations timely consideration as well.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to briefly address our \nprogress on judicial nominees so far during this session of Congress. I \nbegan this session on an optimistic note about our opportunity to \naddress the vacancy crisis that plagues the federal judiciary. Nearly \n100 seats on the federal bench are presently empty. High numbers of \nvacancies in the federal judiciary can only result in delay of the \nadministration of justice. And, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once \nstated, and as some of my Democratic colleagues have observed in the \npast, ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' There is simply no viable \nalternative to confirming judges if we are to make a bona fide effort \nto fill the vacancies in our Federal judiciary.\n  Despite some of the negative rhetoric and distortions of the record I \nhave heard over the last couple of weeks, I am still optimistic about \nour chances for success. As I have mentioned before, we are off to a \ngood start. But we still have much work left to do. Last May, President \nBush nominated 11 extremely well-qualified nominees to the circuit \ncourt of appeals, but only 3 of them have had hearings thus far. Less \nthan one-third of the administration's total appellate nominees have \nhad hearings. So while we are off to a good start, there is much work \nleft to be done.\n  In 1994, President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 judicial nominees. I am confident that, with diligence \nand determination, we can replicate that feat this year. I pledge to \nwork with my Democratic colleagues to get hearings and confirmation \nvotes for our pending judicial nominees.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to endorse my \ngood friend Jay Zainey for Federal District Court Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. I must commend President Bush for this \nnomination. He has chosen a man who will bring professionalism, \ndignity, and respect to the Federal bench.\n  I cannot say enough about Jay. He has had a stellar legal career, \npracticing law in Louisiana for more than 25 years--the bulk of that \ntime in solo practice in Metarie, LA, helping people draft wills, start \nbusinesses, and giving them sound, sage, and accurate legal advice for \nvirtually any situation. In addition to his own practice, Jay has \nserved as a judge and hearing officer in some of our local courts.\n  His close connection to the community informed the work he did as \nLouisiana State Bar Association President. Jay established a community \ninvolvement committee of the Bar Association to get Louisiana's 18,000 \nlawyers working on direct service projects like helping out at homeless \nshelters and soup kitchens. He saw a need in not only his community, \nbut others around the state and used human resources of the bar \nassociation to help bring some relief.\n  What is even more special about Jay is the humanity he has brought to \nthe Bar and the practice of law in our state. Let me tell you about a \nvery special initiative Jay started as State Bar Association president. \nHe established a special committee dedicated to providing legal \nservices for the disabled--the first State bar association in the \ncountry to do this. If a family has a disabled child or adult living \nwith them and they need help understanding the Americans with \nDisabilities Act or they are having trouble sorting through the \nrequirements for SSI eligibility, they can call the State Bar \nAssociation for a referral to a lawyer trained in disability issues.\n  This effort came from Jay's heart. He and his wife Joy are the \nparents of a disabled child. And while their son Andrew is a source of \nhappiness and pride for their family, Jay also understands the legal \nchallenges families such as his face. His heart moved him to use his \nprofessional talents and skills to help disabled Louisianians, \nimproving the quality of life in our State.\n  I must also acknowledge his wonderful family. He and his wife Joy \nhave a daughter Margaret and two sons, Christopher and Andrew. His \nfamily means the world to him and they will inspire his service on the \nFederal bench.\n  Mr. President, we need more people such as Jay Zainey on the Federal \nbench, someone who recognizes that our judicial system is there to help\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\npeople. It is a powerful tool for the powerless. I heartily endorse his \nnomination and urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad that we have an opportunity to \nvote on judges today. One of the judges scheduled to be voted on today \nis Judge Michael Melloy, who has been appointed by the President and \nwho will hopefully be confirmed by the Senate to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  First of all, before speaking about Judge Melloy, I thank Senator \nLeahy, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nfor bringing the nomination to the committee in the form of a hearing \nlast month and accommodating me on changing the date of the hearing so \nit could be convenient for me to be there and for immediately putting \nit on the agenda of the committee.\n  I thank also all the committee members, each of whom had an \nopportunity to hold over this nomination for another meeting--under the \nrules that is an automatic holdover--for not doing it so that this \nnomination could be advanced very quickly.\n  For my colleagues who aren't on the Judiciary Committee, I would like \nto say a few words about Judge Melloy so you can see what an excellent \ncandidate we are putting on the federal appellate bench.\n  Judge Melloy, who originally hails from Dubuque, IA, has had a very \ndistinguished legal career. He graduated magna cum laude from Loras \nCollege in Dubuque, and received his law degree from the University of \nIowa. After practicing at an Iowa law firm Judge Malloy was appointed \nUnited States Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Iowa, a \nposition be held for approximately 6 years.\n  In 1992, he was appointed to the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Iowa. Here Judge Melloy has served as a fine \njudge. He has also been active on numerous legal committees, including \nthe Eighth Circuit Judicial Counsel, the Gender Fairness Task Force of \nthe Eighth Circuit, and the Bankruptcy Administration Committee of the \nJudicial Conference.\n  As you can see, Judge Melloy has excellent legal qualifications and \nexperience, and he has been a dedicated public servant. He possesses \nall the qualities that we want to see in a federal judge, intellect, \ntemperament, judgement, and a true commitment to the rule of law. He \ncomes highly recommended by his peers. I know for a fact that Judge \nMelloy will serve our country well as a judge on the eighth Circuit \ncourt.\n   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Judge Michael Melloy's \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there now remain 2 \nminutes on the Republican side and 6 minutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then, to be fair to everybody, I ask that the time I \nspoke be taken off our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was counted.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Michael J. Melloy, of Iowa, to be United \nStates Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit? On this question, the yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Miller) and \nthe Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Reed), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nRhode Island (Mr. Reed) would vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES.

MELLOY, OF IOWA, TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT \n JUDGE FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT, AND JAY C. ZAINEY, OF LOUISIANA, TO BE \n   UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to executive session to consider Executive \nCalendar Nos. 670 and 676, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Michael J. Melloy, of \nIowa, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, and Jay \nC. Zainey, of Louisiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 15 \nminutes to be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the nominees' home \nState Senators for working with us on this nomination and by commending \nthe majority leader and our assistant majority leader for bringing this \nmatter to successful conclusion today.\n  I also want to thank Senator Cantwell for chairing the hearing in \nJanuary that laid the groundwork for today's confirmation of Judge \nMichael Melloy as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. That confirmation hearing was held on the second day of \nthis session of Congress and was the twelfth confirmation hearing for \njudicial nominees since the majority shifted last summer. Judge Melloy \nand the five district court nominees included in the hearing that \nSenator Cantwell chaired are the first judicial nominees to receive a \nconfirmation hearing during January since at least 1995.\n  Those nominees were all promptly considered by the committee at our \nbusiness meeting last Thursday and, today, due to that unusually fast \nstart by the committee, Judge Melloy's nomination is being considered \nby the Senate for final action.\n  Last year I noticed our first judicial nominations hearing within 10 \nminutes of the Senate being permitted to reorganize. We held that first \nhearing last session on the day after committee members were assigned. \nIn fact, during the past 7 months we have held 12 hearings involving \njudicial nominees. That is more hearings involving judicial nominees \nthan were held in all of 1996, 1997, 1999 or 2000 and a more rapid pace \nthan in either 1995 or 1998. Unlike the preceding six and one-half \nyears in which no hearings were held in 30 of the months, since the \nCommittee has reorganized last summer, we have held at least one \nhearing for judicial nominees every month. In fact, we held two in \nJuly, two unprecedented hearings during last summer's August recess, \ntwo in December and three in October. With the hearing at which Judge \nMelloy appeared, we now have held at least one hearing for judicial \nnominees every month since we were permitted to reorganize last summer \nafter I became chairman of the committee and the Democrats became the \nmajority party in the Senate.\n  Judge Melloy's confirmation fills a judicial emergency vacancy. That \nseat on the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which includes \neight States--Iowa, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North \nDakota and South Dakota--has been vacant since May 1, 1999. I recall \nthat it was not so long ago, in 2000, when the Senate was under \nRepublican control, that another nominee to this very seat on the \nEighth Circuit, Bonnie Campbell, did not receive the courtesy of a vote \nby the committee following the hearing on her nomination. She did not \nreceive a vote due to the previous policy of allowing anonymous holds \nto be placed on nominees, even though in her case, both of her home \nState Senators, one a Democrat and the other a Republican, supported \nher nomination. Bonnie Campbell, the former Attorney General of Iowa, \ndid not receive the courtesy of a vote, up or down, during the 382 days \nbetween her nomination by President Clinton and the time that the Bush \nAdministration withdrew her name.\n  In contrast, we moved expeditiously to consider and report Judge \nMelloy's nomination to the Eighth Circuit. He participated in the first \nconfirmation hearing this year, and his nomination was favorably \nreported by the Committee last week, during the first full week of this \nsession. Judge Melloy's confirmation will eliminate the judicial \nemergency vacancy in that circuit caused, in part, by the committee's \nfailure to act on Bonnie Campbell's nomination when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and the confirmation process.\n  Since the change in majority last summer, we have already moved ahead \nto confirm another new member of the Eighth Circuit. Judge Melloy will \njoin Judge William J. Riley of Nebraska as the second judge considered \nand confirmed to the Eighth Circuit since the\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nsummer. Both nominees were supported by well-respected home-state \nSenators from both parties.\n  Judge Melloy will be the seventh Court of Appeals nomination \nconfirmed by the Senate in the last seven months. That is seven more \nCourt of Appeals judges than a Republican majority confirmed in the \n1996 session, and as many as were confirmed in all of 1997 and in all \nof 1999.\n  During our consideration of Judge Melloy's nomination to be elevated \nto the Eighth Circuit, we learned that Judge Melloy has a reputation \nfor decisions that are fair, well-reasoned and well-written, without \neditorial comment or ideological bent. Judge Melloy was nominated to \nthe Northern District of Iowa in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush and \nconfirmed by the Senate. He previously served for six years as a United \nStates Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Iowa. While \nserving on the District Court for these past 9\\1/2\\ years, Judge Melloy \nalso sat by designation on the Eighth Circuit on several occasions and \nwrote a number of appellate opinions.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  With today's confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed five \nadditional judges since returning late last month. The Senate will have \nconfirmed 33 judges since the change in majority last summer. More than \none-quarter of the judges confirmed have been for judicial emergency \nvacancies, nine so far. Unfortunately, the White House has yet to work \nwith many home-state Senators to send nominees for 14 other judicial \nemergency vacancies.\n  I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a \nshort month with a week's recess. The Committee has not held two \nhearings in the month of February in four years, since 1998.\n  I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited \na frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last \nseveral years. I have already laid out a constructive program of \nsuggestions that would help in that effort and help return the \nconfirmation process to one that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I \nhave included suggestions for the White House, that it work with \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, that it encourage rather than \nforestall the use of bipartisan selection commissions, that it consider \ncarefully the views of home State Senators. Working together, we can \nmake significant progress in filling judicial vacancies.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are considering today \nthe nominations of two very well-qualified nominees for the Federal \ncourts.\n  Our circuit nominee is Judge Michael Melloy, who has been nominated \nfor a position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. \nJudge Melloy has impeccable credentials for this position: He has \nserved for the past decade as a Federal District court judge in Iowa, \nand he served as a bankruptcy court judge for six years before then. In \nhis capacity as a district judge, he has had the honor of having been \ninvited to sit by designation with the Eighth Circuit. I am certain \nthat his distinguished experience will serve him well as he makes the \nmove to join the Eighth Circuit on a permanent basis.\n  Today's district court nominee is Jay Zainey, whom we are considering \nfor the Eastern District of Louisiana. Mr Zainey is an experienced \nprivate practitioner who has earned the respect of his colleagues, as \nreflected in his election as president of the Louisiana State Bar \nAssociation. One of the remarkable achievements during his tenure as \nPresident was the creation of the first state bar committee in the \nnation to provide legal referral services for the disabled. He will \nundoubtedly be a welcome addition to the Eastern District bench.\n  I have every confidence that both of these nominees will serve on the \nfederal courts with distinction. I commend President Bush for selecting \nthem, and I thank Chairman Leahy for holding hearings and committee \nvotes on them.\n  I do note that five other district court nominees were unanimously \nvoted out of committee last week along with Judge Melloy and Mr. \nZainey. Given this strong endorsement, I urge the Senate to give their \nnominations timely consideration as well.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to briefly address our \nprogress on judicial nominees so far during this session of Congress. I \nbegan this session on an optimistic note about our opportunity to \naddress the vacancy crisis that plagues the federal judiciary. Nearly \n100 seats on the federal bench are presently empty. High numbers of \nvacancies in the federal judiciary can only result in delay of the \nadministration of justice. And, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once \nstated, and as some of my Democratic colleagues have observed in the \npast, ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' There is simply no viable \nalternative to confirming judges if we are to make a bona fide effort \nto fill the vacancies in our Federal judiciary.\n  Despite some of the negative rhetoric and distortions of the record I \nhave heard over the last couple of weeks, I am still optimistic about \nour chances for success. As I have mentioned before, we are off to a \ngood start. But we still have much work left to do. Last May, President \nBush nominated 11 extremely well-qualified nominees to the circuit \ncourt of appeals, but only 3 of them have had hearings thus far. Less \nthan one-third of the administration's total appellate nominees have \nhad hearings. So while we are off to a good start, there is much work \nleft to be done.\n  In 1994, President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 judicial nominees. I am confident that, with diligence \nand determination, we can replicate that feat this year. I pledge to \nwork with my Democratic colleagues to get hearings and confirmation \nvotes for our pending judicial nominees.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to endorse my \ngood friend Jay Zainey for Federal District Court Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Louisiana. I must commend President Bush for this \nnomination. He has chosen a man who will bring professionalism, \ndignity, and respect to the Federal bench.\n  I cannot say enough about Jay. He has had a stellar legal career, \npracticing law in Louisiana for more than 25 years--the bulk of that \ntime in solo practice in Metarie, LA, helping people draft wills, start \nbusinesses, and giving them sound, sage, and accurate legal advice for \nvirtually any situation. In addition to his own practice, Jay has \nserved as a judge and hearing officer in some of our local courts.\n  His close connection to the community informed the work he did as \nLouisiana State Bar Association President. Jay established a community \ninvolvement committee of the Bar Association to get Louisiana's 18,000 \nlawyers working on direct service projects like helping out at homeless \nshelters and soup kitchens. He saw a need in not only his community, \nbut others around the state and used human resources of the bar \nassociation to help bring some relief.\n  What is even more special about Jay is the humanity he has brought to \nthe Bar and the practice of law in our state. Let me tell you about a \nvery special initiative Jay started as State Bar Association president. \nHe established a special committee dedicated to providing legal \nservices for the disabled--the first State bar association in the \ncountry to do this. If a family has a disabled child or adult living \nwith them and they need help understanding the Americans with \nDisabilities Act or they are having trouble sorting through the \nrequirements for SSI eligibility, they can call the State Bar \nAssociation for a referral to a lawyer trained in disability issues.\n  This effort came from Jay's heart. He and his wife Joy are the \nparents of a disabled child. And while their son Andrew is a source of \nhappiness and pride for their family, Jay also understands the legal \nchallenges families such as his face. His heart moved him to use his \nprofessional talents and skills to help disabled Louisianians, \nimproving the quality of life in our State.\n  I must also acknowledge his wonderful family. He and his wife Joy \nhave a daughter Margaret and two sons, Christopher and Andrew. His \nfamily means the world to him and they will inspire his service on the \nFederal bench.\n  Mr. President, we need more people such as Jay Zainey on the Federal \nbench, someone who recognizes that our judicial system is there to help\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\npeople. It is a powerful tool for the powerless. I heartily endorse his \nnomination and urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad that we have an opportunity to \nvote on judges today. One of the judges scheduled to be voted on today \nis Judge Michael Melloy, who has been appointed by the President and \nwho will hopefully be confirmed by the Senate to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  First of all, before speaking about Judge Melloy, I thank Senator \nLeahy, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nfor bringing the nomination to the committee in the form of a hearing \nlast month and accommodating me on changing the date of the hearing so \nit could be convenient for me to be there and for immediately putting \nit on the agenda of the committee.\n  I thank also all the committee members, each of whom had an \nopportunity to hold over this nomination for another meeting--under the \nrules that is an automatic holdover--for not doing it so that this \nnomination could be advanced very quickly.\n  For my colleagues who aren't on the Judiciary Committee, I would like \nto say a few words about Judge Melloy so you can see what an excellent \ncandidate we are putting on the federal appellate bench.\n  Judge Melloy, who originally hails from Dubuque, IA, has had a very \ndistinguished legal career. He graduated magna cum laude from Loras \nCollege in Dubuque, and received his law degree from the University of \nIowa. After practicing at an Iowa law firm Judge Malloy was appointed \nUnited States Bankruptcy Judge for the Northern District of Iowa, a \nposition be held for approximately 6 years.\n  In 1992, he was appointed to the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Iowa. Here Judge Melloy has served as a fine \njudge. He has also been active on numerous legal committees, including \nthe Eighth Circuit Judicial Counsel, the Gender Fairness Task Force of \nthe Eighth Circuit, and the Bankruptcy Administration Committee of the \nJudicial Conference.\n  As you can see, Judge Melloy has excellent legal qualifications and \nexperience, and he has been a dedicated public servant. He possesses \nall the qualities that we want to see in a federal judge, intellect, \ntemperament, judgement, and a true commitment to the rule of law. He \ncomes highly recommended by his peers. I know for a fact that Judge \nMelloy will serve our country well as a judge on the eighth Circuit \ncourt.\n   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Judge Michael Melloy's \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Kelly Clark, \nthe snowboarder from West Dover, VT, who on Sunday earned, for the \nUnited States, the first gold medal of the 2002 Winter Olympics in the \nwomen's halfpipe event.\n  That is not ``half pint.'' That is ``halfpipe.'' One has to know the \nskiing history to understand what a halfpipe is.\n  Kelly's enthusiasm and tremendous skill and ambitious drive are \nequaled only by her beaming smile. Kelly's achievement on Sunday was \nmore than athletic ability. It means more than pride to her fellow \nVermonters. A gold medal in an Olympic event brings people together, \nespecially when they need it most. When have Americans needed someone \nto root for more than we do right now?\n  I am especially pleased, of course, that the focus of our attention \nand congratulations is an 18-year-old from southern Vermont. Thank you, \nKelly, for giving your best, for making us proud, and for winning the \ngold.\n  I do not know how many have watched these events, but snowboarding is \nsomething which really started pretty much in Vermont. It has been \nperfected there, and now it is all over the world.\n  Today is Kelly Clark's day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S585-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S585-S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my Maryland \nconstituents and millions of Americans in celebrating African-American \nHistory Month this February. Since 1926, February has been designated \nas a time to recognize a crucial part of our diversity: the vast \nhistory and legacy that African-Americans have contributed to the \nfounding and building of our Nation. While we have much to celebrate in \nthe achievements of many African-Americans, and the great strides this \ncountry has made towards true equality, there is also much work to be \ndone.\n  This year's theme, designated by The Association for the Study of \nAfrican-American Life and History, ASALH, is ``The Color Line \nRevisited: Is Racism Dead?'' The fact that this question can even be \nposed indicates the progress that our society has made in race \nrelations over the past 50 years. We must attribute this progress to \nthe sacrifice, vision and commitment of thousands of African-Americans \nand others who proved that the true strength of our Union lies in the \ndiversity of our population.\n  One such visionary is Marion Wright Edelman, the founder and \npresident of the Children's Defense Fund. Recently I had the \nopportunity to hear Ms. Edelman speak at the Annual Martin Luther King, \nJr. Memorial Breakfast at Anne Arundel Community College in Maryland. \nMarion Wright Edelman shares Dr. King's vision of a unified and equal \nNation, and acknowledges the great strides that have been made in \nworking towards this vision. Through her work at the Children's Defense \nFund, Marion Wright Edelman is helping to ensure that all children in \nAmerica get a healthy, fair and safe start in life.\n  Yet despite the great strides that have been made toward eliminating \nracism and inequality, Ms. Edelman stressed that many disparities still \nexist. The Children's Defense Fund reports that nearly one in three \nAfrican-American children are poor in America, compared with 13 percent \nof white children. Many children are educated in substandard schools. A \ndisproportionate number of African-American children are without health \ninsurance. And African-American juveniles are over-represented on every \nlevel of the criminal justice system.\n  But there is hope, Marion Wright Edelman and the Children's Defense \nFund are working hard to correct these inequalities. The Children's \nDefense Fund acts as a voice for children in America who cannot speak \nfor themselves, and Marion Wright Edelman has been a tireless advocate \nfor children who are suffering and need a helping hand.\n  There is much that we in Congress can do to continue to improve the \nquality of life for African-Americans and for all Americans. We can \nhelp the parents of working families by raising the minimum wage. We \nhave already passed the ``Leave No Child Behind'' education reform bill \nthat will provide new standards for schools and teachers, and will help \nmake quality education available to all Americans. We can work on \nelection reform to ensure that all voters are properly registered, and \nevery vote is counted. And we need to make health care available and \naffordable for African-Americans and all Americans. With these and \nother reforms we will move further down the path to equality dreamed of \nby Dr. King.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11 left us shocked and wounded, \nyet we found once again that the strength of this Nation lies within \nits people and its diversity. In the months that have passed since that \nday, we have shown the world how people of all races, colors, religions \nand nationalities create the fabric of our Nation, a fabric that is \nricher because of our differences. This month we honor the special \ncontribution African-Americans have made to that fabric. Through \nAfrican-American History Month, we celebrate how far this country has \ncome, and remind ourselves of how far we have to go.\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, while we are celebrating \nBlack History Month, I want to rise to honor a man named York, arguably \nthe first black American to make a significant contribution to, and \ncast a vote in, my home State of Oregon.\n  Most Americans know very little about York, Captain William Clark's \n``servant,'' as Clark called him, who made the journey to Oregon with \nthe Lewis and Clark expedition in 1803. Despite his important role in \nopening the West, it is unfortunate that York has not been remembered \nalong with other early black Americans who helped shape our nation's \nhistory.\n  William Clark's lifelong slave companion, York was roughly the same \nage as Clark, and by all accounts the two were friends for most of \ntheir lives. York was bequeathed to Clark by his father, John Clark, in \na will dated July 24, 1799, and on October 29, 1803, he joined Clark \nand Captain Meriwether Lewis on a journey into history.\n  York, when he is remembered, is often remembered best for the \ncuriosity he aroused in Native Americans he met during the journey. \nApparently, York so fascinated the people he met that there exist \nnumerous stories of women attempting to wash his skin white. According \nto journal accounts, he sometimes used their fascination to the \nexpedition's advantage, intimidating Arikaras tribesmen, for example, \nwith fantastic tales of his wild youth as a cannibal.\n  Perhaps because of such stories, York is often described in an \ninaccurate, negative manner. However, common characterizations more \naccurately reflect the racial biases of historians than they do York's \nactual contributions to the expedition. Judging from the journals kept \nby members of the expedition, York was a reliable and indispensable \npart of the expedition. During a time when most black Americans were \ndenied access to firearms, York was counted on as a skilled hunter. \nYork also served as a cook, a confidant, and a nurse, as did each \nmember of the party from time to time. One account has York charging \ninto a flash flood, fearing for the safety of Clark, the famed \ntranslator Sacagawea, her son, and her husband, Toussaint, who had not \nyet made it to safety.\n  The most telling example of York's role in the expedition occurred in \nNovember 1805, when the group decided to winter in Oregon. Finding \nlittle game on the northern bank of the Columbia\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nRiver, the group had to decide whether to winter there or cross the \nriver in search of a more hospitable setting. Lewis and Clark took a \nvote on the matter, and the final tally included the votes of \nSacagawea, a woman, and York, a black man. That winter, York and the \ngroup built Fort Clatsop, the westernmost outpost of the United States \nGovernment at the time, and one of our Nation's major claims on the \ndisputed Oregon country.\n  It is odd that York is not commonly honored as an American who made \npossible the western expansion of our nation. The Lewis and Clark \nexpedition, which will soon celebrate its 200th anniversary, is a \nseminal event in American history, and a black American who contributed \nsignificantly to that historic endeavor remains unknown to a nation \nwhich owes him a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S586-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LLOYD KIVA NEW\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman who through his dedication and vision made a significant difference \nin the lives of many people in my home state of New Mexico and around \nthe country. Lloyd Kiva New passed away last Friday in Santa Fe at the \nage of 85.\n  A Cherokee from Oklahoma, Lloyd Kiva New was a graduate of the School \nof the Art Institute of Chicago. He became the first American Indian to \nobtain a degree in arts education from the institute in 1938. After \nserving in World War II, he established a fashion design studio in \nArizona. He was also instrumental in developing several progressive \neducational projects, including the Southwest Indian Arts Project.\n  In 1962, Lloyd Kiva New co-founded the Institute of American Indian \nArts, an innovative school located in Santa Fe. He became the IAIA's \nArt Director and eventually its President. He retired as full-time \npresident of the institute in 1978. He was known for his novel approach \nto the arts in which he sought to reawaken artistic traditions that had \nbeen a primary mode of Indian expression for centuries. He continually \nurged students not to be bound by existing notions of artistic \nexpression and to reject stereotypical ideas of American Indian art and \nculture. In part because of his vision, IAIA has been influential is \nsending art from Indian artist all over America, enriching Indian and \nmainstream cultures in the process.\n  The recipient of numerous awards, Lloyd Kiva New also served on the \nIndian Arts and Crafts Board and the National Council of the Museum of \nthe American Indian. In addition, he was named President Emeritus of \nthe IAIA, was honored as a Living Treasure of Santa Fe, and received \nthe New Mexico Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts.\n  I wish to extend my deepest sympathies for his passing to his family \nand loved ones. His wife, two children, and five grandchildren survive \nhim.\n  Many people were inspired and encouraged by Lloyd Kiva New over the \nyears. He has left a great legacy and his absence will be deeply felt \nin the American Indian communities and in the hearts of many \nindividuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S586-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 30, 1992 \nin Elk Grove, IL. A gay man was assaulted by two men after being \ninvited to go out with them. One of the assailants, Robert F. Braschko, \n19, of Rolling Meadows, was charged with criminal damage to a vehicle, \nbattery, and a hate crime in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S586-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S586-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S586-5", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATION DISCHARGED\n\n  The following nomination was discharged from the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs pursuant to the order of December 20, 2001:\n\n\n                         Department of Defense\n\n       Joseph E.

A bill to amend section 222 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to require affirmative written consent by a customer to the \nrelease of customer proprietary network information; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto require telecommunications firms to receive explicit written consent \nfrom consumers prior to sharing their customer proprietary network \ninformation, or CPNI, with other entities. This is a simple bill that \nwill provide consumers with the privacy protection that they deserve to \nhave and that I believe should already be required under the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n  The 1996 Communications Act established as law that CPNI is \nconfidential personal information, requiring customer approval before \nits release or being shared with others. Congress and the American \npeople count on the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, to carry \nout that mandate and to protect the privacy of American consumers who \nuse the country's telecommunications system. Therefore, I believe it \nshouldn't really even be necessary to introduce this legislation, \nclarifying that approval should mean ``express written consent'' or, in \nother words, an ``opt-in'' approach to protecting privacy. But I share \nthe concern of consumer advocates and 39 State attorneys general that \nthe FCC, which is currently taking comment on the matter, could \notherwise adopt an ``opt-out'' approach to privacy as it relates to \nCPNI. In my view, and in the view of the consumer advocates and the \nstate attorneys general, an opt-out approach cannot adequately protect \nconsumers'' privacy and would not meet Congress's intent in passing the \n1996 Communications Act.\n  An opt-out approach would put the unfair burden on consumers to \nprotect their own confidential personal information that is in the \npossession of large telecommunications companies, protect it from being \nshared by those companies with other entities. This can be information \nof the most sensitive kind, including lists of phone numbers dialed and \nthe duration and timing of calls. An opt-out approach presumes consumer \nconsent that such information could be shared unless the customer goes \nthrough an unduly burdensome and uncertain process to request that the \nprovider not share it.\n  In recent months in Minnesota, for example, Qwest notified customers \nthat the company would begin to share customer information unless the \ncustomers notified Qwest that they did not want it shared. The company \nnotice was often overlooked by customers, and it was difficult to \nunderstand for many customers who did try to read it. Furthermore, \nnumerous customers reported problems getting through to the company's \n800 number, or in navigating the options for opting out of the \ninformation sharing scheme. Due to customer complaints, and to the \ncompany's credit, Qwest recently reversed its position and will not \nshare any customer information until the FCC issues a final CPNI rule. \nMeanwhile, however, Qwest and other telecommunications carriers have \nbeen advocating heavily for adoption by the FCC of an ``opt-out'' \napproach.\n  I am not telling anyone whether they should want their CPNI shared \nand made available to marketers. That is up to consumers themselves. I \ndo want to leave that choice to consumers. I believe that means that \nthey must have the opportunity to give their express consent on what \npersonal information and to whom it will be shared before such \ninformation is shared.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1929. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security to permit \nKentucky to operate a separate retirement system for certain public \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto add Kentucky to the list of States that are permitted to offer \n``divided retirement'' plans under the Social Security Act.\n  Three weeks ago, I was contacted by Brian James, president of the \nLouisville Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, and Tony Cobaugh, president \nof the Jefferson County FOP. These two law enforcement leaders called \nmy attention to a problem that could jeopardize the retirement security \nof many of our community's police, fire, and emergency personnel.\n  In November of 2000, the citizens of Jefferson County and the City of \nLouisville, KY voted to merge their communities and respective \ngovernments into a single entity, which will be known as Greater \nLouisville. As one might expect, combining two large metropolitan \ngovernments in such a short time frame cannot be done without \nencountering a few difficulties along the way. Jefferson County and the \nCity of Louisville currently operate two very different retirement \nprograms for their police officers. When these two governments merge on \nJanuary 6, 2003, current Federal law will require the new government to \noffer a single retirement plan that could dramatically increase the \ncost of retirement for both our dedicated public safety officers and \nthe new Greater Louisville government.\n  Thankfully, when the FOP's leaders called this problem to my \nattention, they also suggested a simply solution, let the police \nofficers and firefighters choose for themselves the retirement system \nwhich best meets their needs.\n  I rise today to offer legislation that will provide retirement \nstability to our public safety officers by allowing Kentucky to operate \nwhat is known as a ``divided retirement system.'' I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Congressman Ron Lewis and Congresswoman Anne \nNorthup who will soon introduce similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\n  With passage of my legislation and similar legislation by the \nKentucky General Assembly, Louisville's and Jefferson County's police \nofficers would decide whether or not they want to participate in Social \nSecurity or remain in their traditional retirement plan. While future \nemployees will be automatically enrolled in Social Security, no current \nofficers would be forced into a new retirement system as a result of \nthe merger without their approval.\n  Current Federal law allows twenty-one states the option of offering \ndivided retirement systems. Unfortunately, Kentucky is not one of these \ntwenty-one States. The legislation I am offering today would change \nthat by adding Kentucky to list of states designated in the Social \nSecurity Act.\n  It is critical that the Senate provide this retirement stability to \nthe brave men and women who protect the citizens of Louisville and \nJefferson County everyday. There is extensive precedent for granting \nKentucky this authority, and my legislation enjoys the broad, bi-\npartisan support of policemen, firefighters, local and state officials. \nI look forward to working with this coalition, as well as my colleagues \nin the Senate, to see that this urgently needed legislation is enacted \ninto law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Louisville \nFOP, Jefferson County FOP, Louisville Firefighters Union, and State \nFinance and Administration Cabinet, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                           Louisville Lodge 6,\n\n                                  Louisville, KY, January 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Louisville, KY.\n       Dear Mr. McConnell: Following a referendum held \n     approximately one year ago the voters in our community \n     approved a government merger of the City of Louisville and \n     Jefferson County Kentucky. Currently officers employed by the \n     City of Louisville working for the Louisville Division of \n     Police do not pay into Social Security, due to having been \n     exempted from making such payments by a previous law. On \n     January 06, 2003 when our new government become effective the \n     Louisville Police Officers who I am elected to represent will \n     no longer be excused from Social Security participation.\n       I would like to see our new government offer a ``Divided \n     Referendum'' vote that would allow each individual officer \n     the opportunity to choose his or her own preference in \n     participating in Social Security. This would make for a \n     smoother transition as it relates to our members and the new \n     government. For this to be possible there has to be federal \n     legislation sanctioning Kentucky as a ``Name State''. There \n     are currently twenty-one states that have such designation. \n     Also there has to be changes in the Kentucky. Revised \n     Statutes to allow for the ``Divided Referendum'' vote.\n       It is my hope that you would assist our organization in \n     making the necessary changes at both the federal and state \n     levels during this years Congressional Session as well as \n     Kentucky's Legislative Session.\n       If you have any questions regarding this issue please do \n     not hesitate to call me. Thank you in advance for any \n     consideration you can give this matter. I am looking forward \n     to seeing you in 2002.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      David James,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                Jefferson County Lodge No. 14,\n\n                                 Louisville, KY, January 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Louisville, KY.\n       Dear Mr. McConnell: The voters of Louisville and Jefferson \n     County approved the referendum for a consolidated government \n     over one year ago. Now the monumental task of organizing that \n     future government is quickly upon us. As the leader of this \n     labor organization, I must focus on those labor-related \n     issues that affect my membership.\n       The biggest issue raised to this point is the area of \n     social security. Louisville police officers do not \n     participate in Social Security. However, Jefferson County \n     police officers do participate. Both FOP lodges are working \n     closely on the very probable police merger that will most \n     likely follow the government merger.\n       Both FOP lodges believe that the members should have the \n     opportunity to decide their futures in reference to Social \n     Security through a ``divided referendum''. It is our \n     understanding that a change must occur on the state and \n     federal level. Will you help us by changing Kentucky to a \n     ``Name State''? Hopefully, we can count on your support for \n     enabling changes at the state or federal level during the \n     2002 United States Congress or at the Kentucky General \n     Assembly.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Anthony J.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Louisville KY.\n       Dear Mr. McConnell: Following a referendum held \n     approximately one year ago, the voters in our community \n     approved a government merger of the city of Louisville and \n     Jefferson County, Kentucky. An issue has come up concerning \n     Social Security, involving police and fire fighters. Due to a \n     previous law exempting fire fighters, we do not pay into \n     social security. On January 6, 2003 when our new government \n     becomes effective, the members of the Louisville Professional \n     Fire Fighters, Local #345 will no longer be excused from \n     Social Security participation.\n       I would like to see our newly formed metro government offer \n     a ``Divided Referendum'' vote that would allow each \n     individual the opportunity to choose his or her own \n     preference in participating in Social Security. For this to \n     be possible there has to be federal legislation sanctioning \n     Kentucky as a ``Name State''. There are currently twenty-one \n     states that have such legislation. In addition,there has to \n     be changes in the Kentucky Revised Statutes to allow for the \n     ``Divided Referendum'' vote. If ``Name State'' status is not \n     obtained, the new government will be forced to match the \n     Social Security, contribution made by more than 1,300 of its \n     employees, including the fire fighters, who currently do not \n     pay into the Social Security, System.\n       It is my hope that you would assist the Louisville \n     Professional Fire Fighters in making the necessary changes at \n     both the federal and state levels during this years US \n     Congressional Session as well as Kentucky's Legislative \n     Session.\n       If you have any questions concerning this issue; please do \n     not hesitate to call me. Thank you in advance for any \n     consideration you can give this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n                                  Michael J. ``Howdy'' Kurtsinger,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                                     Office of the Controller,\n\n                                  Frankfort, KY, February 6, 2002.\n     Hon. A.M. ``Mitch'' McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: The Kentucky Division of Social \n     Security is responsible for administering the social security \n     and Medicare program for all public employees in the \n     Commonwealth. This includes not only state employees, but \n     also the employees of all political subdivisions such as \n     school boards, counties, cities, libraries, water districts, \n     etc.\n       Those public employees who are participating in an employer \n     provided retirement system and not covered for social \n     security and Medicare may join the program via an employee \n     referendum. There are several steps that must be taken during \n     this process, but, under current federal and state statutes, \n     it boils down to a simple majority of the eligible employees \n     approving coverage for all employees of a coverage group.\n       There is, however, a second mechanism available to certain \n     states that are specifically named in the federal Social \n     Security Act. A referendum of the employees is also \n     conducted, but the outcome of the election differs in that \n     those employees voting for coverage become eligible for \n     participation in the social security and/or Medicare program. \n     Those employees voting against social security coverage are \n     exempt. This is referred as ``divided coverage''.\n       Last November, the voters of Jefferson County voted to \n     merge the governments of the City of Louisville and Jefferson \n     County, effective January 6, 2003. The success of the merger \n     efforts, however, also present a problem that must be \n     resolved, that is, the social security and Medicare coverage \n     of several groups of public servants.\n       Some of the City of Louisville Police and firefighters \n     contribute only the Medicare program, not social security. \n     Other city police and firefighters contribute to neither. The \n     Jefferson County Police and corrections employees contribute \n     to both social security and Medicare. When the merger become \n     effective next year all these coverage groups will be \n     considered as a single group for social security coverage \n     purposes.\n       The new government, under the current legal situation, will \n     face the dilemma of adversely affecting the employee benefits \n     (eliminating social security coverage) of some of these \n     public servants or bring an additional financial burden on \n     the second group (forcing them to contribute to social \n     security) as well as on the new government (additional \n     employer contributions to social security).\n       The preferred remedy to this situation is to utilize \n     divided coverage. This would allow each employee to decide \n     for his or herself whether to pay into social security. All \n     new employees hired after a divided referendum is conducted \n     would automatically be enrolled in social security.\n       The Commonwealth of Kentucky is not included as a ``named'' \n     state in the Social Security Act and, therefore, its public \n     employers cannot utilize the divided coverage option. We \n     requesting support for federal legislation amended 42 U.S.C. \n     418 to include Kentucky as a ``named'' state and enable \n     Greater Louisville and their employees to take advantage of \n     the divided coverage concept. This would add Kentucky to a \n     list of 21\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\n     states included in section 218(d)(6)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act that are currently permitted to conduct divided \n     referendums. The Kentucky General Assembly is proceeding with \n     amendments to the Kentucky Revised Statutes to authorize a \n     divided referendum, contingent upon federal legislative \n     changes.\n       If should also be noted that providing the Commonwealth \n     with the ability to conduct divided coverage would in no way \n     effect the members of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement \n     System. State statutes prohibit social security coverage \n     under the Commonwealth Section 218 agreement with the Social \n     Security Administration to any individual covered by KTRS.\n       The Commonwealth of Kentucky and the citizens of Jefferson \n     County need your support for designating Kentucky as a \n     ``Named State'' by the Congress. I will be glad to answer any \n     questions you may have.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Patrick L.

The success of the merger efforts, however, requires \n     that certain issues involving the social security and \n     Medicare coverage of several groups of public servants be \n     resolved.\n       Some of the City of Louisville Police and firefighters \n     contribute only to the Medicare program, not social security. \n     Other city police and firefighters contribute to neither. The \n     Jefferson County Police and corrections employees contribute \n     to both social security and Medicare. When the merger becomes \n     effective next year all these coverage groups will be \n     considered as a single group for social security purposes.\n       The preferred remedy to this situation is to utilize what \n     is termed a ``divided referendum''. This would allow each \n     employee to decide for his or herself whether to pay into \n     social security.

A bill to promote the production of energy from wind; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to promote \nthe development of wind energy production across our Nation. My ``Wind \nEnergy Promotion Act of 2002'' would provide incentives and clear \nregulatory hurdles to allow this economically feasible and \nenvironmentally friendly electricity source to help meet our National \nenergy needs.\n  As the Senate begins work to enact a comprehensive National energy \npolicy, we must take advantage of the enormous potential that wind \nenergy offers. Wind is an abundant an inexhaustible renewable resource \nacross our country. North Dakota alone has the potential to produce \nmore than 460,000 megawatts of electricity from wind annually, the \nhighest potential in the Nation.\n  Wind production costs have fallen dramatically over the last two \ndecades, making production affordable, investment logical, and \nelectricity consumption from wind economical for our Nation. Production \ncosts have declined more than 80 percent since the 1980s, from an \naverage of 38 cents per kilowatt-hour to an average of 3-6 cents per \nkilowatt-hour today. These costs are predicted to fall even lower in \nthe near future. In addition, wind energy produces no pollution, \nproviding a clean, environmentally friendly power option for the \nNation.\n  However, wind energy development faces a number of obstacles, which \nmy legislation is designed to overcome. First, my bill will extend the \nvaluable wind energy tax credit for five years. The credit expired at \nthe end of last year, and renewal is simply crucial to the industry. \nHundreds of millions of dollars of investment in wind energy in my \nState of North Dakota are on hold because the Senate has not yet acted \nto extend this credit. It is time to extend the credit now, for a full \nfive years, in order to ensure substantial investment in the industry \nacross the Nation.\n  Further, my legislation makes it easier for farmers and ranchers to \ndevelop wind energy resources. It provides grants and loans to farmers \nand ranchers and allows producers to put wind turbines on CRP lands. \nAnd, because better technology will make investing in both large and \nsmall wind harnessing operations more attractive, my bill authorizes \nmore than $500 million over the next four years for wind energy \nresearch. My bill also calls for breaking down federal regulatory \nbarriers to wind energy development. The Federal Government should \nhelp, not hinder the development of the Nation's wind potential. \nBecause North Dakota and other western States contain large tracts of \npublic lands that contain great wind energy potential, my bill would \nallow for the development of facilities on public lands. Finally, my \nlegislation would authorize studies on several aspects of developing \nthe Nation's wind energy potential, including one to determine the best \npossible way to overcome the barriers to adequate transmission of power \ngenerated from wind.\n  My bill is not only a key component to providing energy security for \nthe country; it would provide a much-needed economic stimulus to rural \nAmerica.\n  According to the American Wind Energy Association, every 100 \nmegawatts of wind energy development will produce 500 job years of \nemployment. In addition, payments to farmers and ranchers could equal \n$4 million for every 2,000 megawatts of wind energy production, money \nour Nation's producers would get simply for allowing wind development \non their land. This would be a critical boost to our Nation's rural \neconomy.\n  Wind energy development would also play a key role in the economy of \nNorth Dakota. Extending the production tax credit alone will mean more \nthan $100 million in sales for DMI Industries, LM Glasfiber, and other \nindustry participants in my state in the next year. Using only \nconservative estimates, the wind industry has the potential to add a \nhalf billion dollars to North Dakota's economy in 2002, but only if the \nSenate acts soon to extend the wind energy production tax credit, the \nmost important component of the legislation I am introducing today.\n  The Senate will be taking up energy legislation this week. As this \ndebate begins, I will be working to include the provisions of my wind \nenergy legislation in a comprehensive energy policy that our Nation \nseriously needs. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \ndevelopment of wind energy in the United States through the provisions \nof my Wind Energy Promotion Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nBy Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. Snowe, \n                           and Mr. Cochran):\n\n  S. 1931. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove patient access to, and utilization of, the colorectal cancer \nscreening benefit under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Colon Cancer \nScreen for Life Act of 2002.'' I am pleased that my colleagues Senators \nCollins, Torricelli, Snowe and Cochran have joined me in introducing \nthis very important bill.\n  As many of my colleagues know from personal experience, colon cancer \nis a devastating disease. Nearly 57,000 people die each year from colon \ncancer. It is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and \nwomen and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in \nAmerica.\n  But colon cancer can be combated, controlled and potentially \nconquered if it's caught in the earliest stages. In fact, colon cancer \nis a rare form of cancer in that it can even be prevented through \nscreening, if pre-cancerous polyps are quickly identified and removed.\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\n  The survival rate when colon cancer is detected at an early, \nlocalized stage is 90 percent. But only 37 percent of such cancers are \ndiscovered at that stage. The later the disease is caught, the lower \nthe survival rate.\n  That's why in 1997, Congress led the fight against colon cancer by \nmaking screening for the disease a covered benefit for every Medicare \nrecipient. That is especially significant because the risk of colon \ncancer rises with age.\n  Heightened awareness and greater access to treatment are working. \nOver the last 15 years, we've seen steady, if slow, annual declines in \nboth incidence rates and mortality rates tied to colon cancer.\n  But we can do more, because barriers to screening still exist. Modern \ntechnology has blessed us with extremely accurate screening tools, in \nparticular the colonoscopy, which results in higher colon cancer \nidentification rates and better long-term survival rates due to early \ndetection. A consultation with a doctor before a colonoscopy is \nrequired to ensure that patients are properly prepared before they \nundergo the procedure.\n  Unfortunately, Medicare does not pay for that consultation before a \nscreening, creating an obvious obstacle to preventive treatment for \nmany men and women. The Colon Cancer ``Screen for Life'' Act would \ncover these medical visits so that more Medicare beneficiaries will \nhave easy access to screening.\n  Further, with this legislation, just as Congress has done for \nscreening mammography, screening colonoscopy will not count toward a \nsenior's Medicare deductible. This will remove additional financial \ndisincentives to screening.\n  Finally, with this bill, we're breaking through another big barrier \nto early detection and treatment.\n  The medical reality is that colonoscopy procedures are invasive and \nrequire sedation to perform, making it safer for them to be conducted \nin the hospital or an outpatient setting, where safety standards and \nemergency procedures are in place, rather than in a private doctor's \noffice. But when doctors perform colonoscopies for Medicare patients in \nan outpatient setting, they take a hit on cost, because reimbursement \nfor the procedure performed there has decreased by nearly 36 percent \nsince 1997, while reimbursement for the procedure performed in a \ndoctor's private office has increased by 52 percent.\n  As a result, to balance their budgets, doctors and hospitals are \ntypically forced to space out their Medicare patients, creating long \nwaits for and limited access to these vital screenings. That financial \nincentive structure is indefensible.\n  The job of medical services should be cutting cancer, not cutting \ncosts. Unfortunately, today something as critical as colon cancer \nscreening is moderated not by the real needs of patients and their \nmedical doctors, but by market incentives.\n  To address the problem, the ``Screen for Life'' Act would increase \nthe payment rates for colonoscopies performed in hospitals and \noutpatient facilities by 30 percent. The result will be more access to \nearly detection and treatment and thousands of lives saved.\n  Colon cancer is a formidable foe, but we can make a difference in the \nfight against it. Early detection and treatment is our first line of \ndefense.\n  With the help of the Colon Cancer ``Screen for Life'' Act, I hope \nthat in a decade we'll have fewer cancer cases to contend with and more \nsurvivors to celebrate the simple fact that screening saves lives.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Lieberman, \nTorricelli, Snowe, and Cochran in introducing the Colon Cancer Screen \nfor Life Act of 2002 to improve patients' access to the colorectal \ncancer screening benefit under Medicare.\n  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related \ndeaths in the United States for both men and women: more than 57,000 \nAmericans will die from this disease this year, yet it is a disease \nthat many of us feel uncomfortable discussing.\n  The sad irony is that cancer of the colon is probably the most \ntreatable and survivable of all cancers, but only if it is caught \nearly. If detected and treated early, colon cancer is curable in more \nthan 90 percent of diagnosed cases. Conversely, if the cancer is \ndetected in an advanced stage, death rates are high. As many as 92 \npercent of these patients will die within five years.\n  Despite the fact that we have extremely effective screening tests for \ncolon cancer, our screening rates for colon cancer, even among those \nAmericans who are most at risk, are woefully low. Moreover, even the \naddition in 1998 of a new Medicare benefit covering these services has \nnot improved the situation.\n  In 2000, the General Accounting Office, GAO, conducted a review of \nclaims data to determine the extent to which this new preventive health \nservice has been used. According to the GAO, only 3.8 percent of \nMedicare patients received either a screening or diagnostic colonoscopy \nin 1999, far below the recommended use rates and just a one percent \nincrease over the rate in 1995.\n  Clearly we must find ways to heighten public awareness about the \nimportance of colon cancer screening and remove any remaining barriers \nthat may be preventing Medicare beneficiaries from receiving these \ncritically important services. While the GAO identified a lack of \npatient awareness, understanding and inclination as the most \nsignificant factors inhibiting the use of colorectal cancer screening \nservices, it also found that physician practices affect rates of \nscreening. One factor is the inadequate Medicare reimbursement rates to \ncover the costs involved.\n  Medicare reimbursement rates for this procedure have declined in \nrecent years and are almost universally lower than reimbursements under \nprivate insurance. Moreover, in many States, the Medicare rates are \nlower than Medicaid rates. Our legislation will therefore increase the \nMedicare payment rates for colonoscopies performed both in hospitals \nand outpatient settings. Specifically, the payment rates in hospitals \nand outpatient facilities would be increased by 30 percent, while \npayment for procedures done in physicians' offices would be increased \nby 10 percent.\n  Our legislation will also require Medicare to provide reimbursements \nfor pre-procedure consultations to ensure that beneficiaries are \nproperly prepared and educated before they undergo a screening \ncolonoscopy. Medicare currently only pays for the pre-procedure \nappointment prior to a diagnostic colonoscopy. This pre-procedure visit \nis no less necessary in the case of a screening colonoscopy and should \nbe covered.\n  Finally, under our legislation, the normal Part B deductible will not \napply for screening colonoscopy, just as it does not apply for \nscreening mammography. This will remove a financial disincentive for \nseniors to seek screening and increase the likelihood that they will \nundergo screening colonoscopy.\n  The Colon Cancer Screen for Your Life Act of 2002 will not only help \nto ensure the safety of colorectal cancer screenings, but it will also \nincrease Medicare patients' access to this life-saving procedure, and I \nurge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/11/senate-section/article/S590-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2843.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of the farm bill immediately following the prayer \nand the pledge at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow; that there be 40 minutes for \ndebate on Senator Grassley's second-degree amendment, No. 2837, to \nSenator Craig's amendment, No. 2835; that following the use or yielding \nback of that time, there then be 15 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form in relation to each of the following amendments: the \namendment of Senator Crapo, amendment No. 2533, and the amendment of \nSenator Baucus, amendment No. 2839; that the amendments be debated in \nthe above order; that at the conclusion or yielding back of time the \nSenate vote in relation to the Grassley second-degree amendment; that \nupon the conclusion of that vote, Senator Reid be recognized to move to \ntable the amendment of Senator Crapo; that at the conclusion of that \nvote, the Senate vote in relation to the Baucus amendment with no other \namendments in order prior to those ordered votes; and that if any \namendment in this agreement is not disposed of at the conclusion of \nthese votes, it shall remain debatable and amendable.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \ncommend the distinguished floor leader for working with both sides of \nthe aisle to provide a good structure for our debate tomorrow and for a \nconclusion of the farm bill debate. I simply wanted to indicate that on \nour side of the aisle, we have worked closely with the leader and that \nwe have an excellent format. Therefore, I will not object and commend \nwhat is occurring and will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, two things: One, on the unanimous consent \nagreement I first offered, I want to make sure the time is 3 p.m. not 2 \np.m. I think I said 3 p.m.\n\n  I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, I have spoken to Senator \nCrapo and have indicated to him that on my second-degree amendment that \nis pending, I am going to modify that in the morning. So this amendment \nshould have no bearing on that.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is my understanding.\n  Once again, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, \nSenator Santorum's amendment has been withdrawn from this list. He is \nmodifying the amendment. It may be that amendment can be accepted in \ndue course. If not, it will come in the normal rotation for debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will simply say, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Lugar have worked very hard on this farm bill--not for days or \nweeks but for months. I think we are now seeing the light at the end of \nthe tunnel. Senator Daschle has asked me to indicate he would very much \nlike to finish this bill tomorrow. It is a very heavy task because \nduring the middle of the day we have the time for the two party \nconferences, but it can be done, and we are going to do everything we \ncan to work with both sides to see if we can get that done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
