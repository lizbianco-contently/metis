Madam President, I am joined by Senator Dayton from \nMinnesota and the occupant of the Chair. We come to the floor this \nmorning because we want to communicate a respectful, sincere, and \nhonest message to each and every one of our colleagues.\n  It has been my experience in the Senate over the past 12 years that \nsometimes you just have to fight for people--not with acrimony, but you \nhave to fight for people. In Minnesota, 17\n\n[[Page S7244]]\n\ncounties have been declared Federal disaster areas due to tremendous \nfloods last month. As a result, Northwest Minnesota, a rich \nagricultural region, has been devastated. According to the Minnesota \nFarm Service Agency at least $370 billion in damage to the agriculture \nsector has been caused, due to these floods. We tried to include \ndisaster relief in the supplemental bill. Unfortunately we could not do \nit because the administration said don't even try, no way. While there \nis some help for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is \nimportant, FEMA cannot help the farmers and the Small Business \nAdministration cannot help the farmers.\n  This is a case of ``there but for the grace of God go I.'' I said \nthis to my colleagues yesterday, and I want to say it again today. I \nhave never voted against disaster relief assistance for anybody in the \ncountry, be it a hurricane, tornado, fire, drought, or flooding. If, \nGod forbid, it happens to others, we want to help.\n  This administration has said no to any emergency disaster assistance \nfor agriculture. The President has said any emergency assistance for \nagriculture must come out of the farm bill. The farm bill is about loan \nrates, dairy, conservation and fair prices for farmers. The farm bill \nis about economic assistance, not natural disasters.\n\n  So our message today is this: We are going to look at every \nappropriations bill, and if any appropriations bill comes out on the \nfloor and there is assistance for fire or any other emergency that has \nhappened--be it for Arizona, or for flooding in Texas, or anywhere \nelse--we will slow up that bill. In fact, we will stop that bill if we \nneed to until we get the commitment that there will be the funding for \nemergency disaster assistance for the farmers in Minnesota, or for the \nfarmers in Nebraska, for the people we represent.\n  Time is not neutral. People need help now. We intend to make the \nSenate address this issue. I yield to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I thank the Senator for graciously \ntaking the Chair so Senator Nelson could join with the Senator from \nMinnesota and myself. I know the Senator from Michigan, who is \npresiding, has strong support for this disaster assistance as well. I \nwant to say to my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, I am proud to stand with him today, and I am proud to follow \nhis leadership on this disaster assistance legislation.\n  The Senator and I both serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nalong with our colleague from Nebraska. The Senate Agriculture bill had \ndisaster assistance funding in it. The House and the administration \nwould not agree to the inclusion of disaster assistance in the package, \nwhich came out of the conference committee and was enacted into law.\n  As the Senator said, it is imperative that the Senate and the House \nand the administration join together, given what happened in Minnesota, \nwith 17 counties declared a disaster area because of excessive flooding \nin June. During a recent visit, I saw whole fields of crops \nunderwater--giant lakes created by torrential rains one week, and again \nthe week following. It is hard to see people, many of whom lost their \ncrops last year, struggling again this year.\n  I asked Secretary of Agriculture Veneman last week in a committee \nhearing: Where is this money that is purportedly available in the \nlegislation that was passed for disaster aid? And she could not \nidentify any.\n  I join with my colleague in saying we must have this assistance. The \nSenate did it right in its version of the Farm bill. Unfortunately, the \nHouse and the administration have blocked disaster aid. We have to try \nagain because farmers are going under if we do not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan for exchanging positions for a moment so I have an opportunity \nto make a statement about the importance of having disaster relief in \nthe soonest possible timeframe.\n  Over the last several years in developing a farm policy, we have gone \nfrom virtually no help to a new farm program that is designed to help \nget agriculture on its feet, but it is designed to do that in a time \nwhen we would expect normal conditions. It is not designed to take care \nof disaster situations we are facing today for the livestock industry \nin particular.\n  If we are not able to step forward at this time, take care of this \nsituation, and provide hope for the livestock industry in our country, \nparticularly those that are experiencing severe drought, as in the case \nof Nebraska and the Midwestern States, many of those farmers and \nranchers are going to divest themselves of their herds. They are going \nto cut down the size of their herds. They are going to sell off their \nbreeding stock to survive under these terrible conditions. They are not \ngoing to be able to rebuild those herds overnight. It will take years \nto rebuild.\n  There is no coverage in the Crop Insurance Program for parched \npastures that today will not sustain the grazing of our cattle. There \nis no support in the farm bill for those farmers and ranchers who are \nexperiencing the losses on the livestock side. For those in this body \nwho are looking for offsets, which is important in the Senate, they are \nlooking for money. To go after the farm bill and the funding for \nbuilding agriculture and take that money now to support the \nlivestock industry is not the way to go. What we need to do is \nrecognize that this is an emergency situation like other emergencies \nand it is a disaster that must, in fact, be addressed right now.\n\n  Many of the people who voted for the last four or five disaster \nprograms without requiring any kind of an offset are today saying: If \nwe do it today, we have to find an offset. It is because today we have \na farm bill, and they found the source of dollars. That is the only \nreason I think they are looking at that program.\n  Robbing Peter to pay Paul at the present time will mean that both \nPeter and Paul will not make it. What we need to do is face this as a \nreality so that the farmers in Nebraska and the farmers all across our \ncountry, those who are selling their livestock, will know there is help \non the way; that they can be sustained; that they are not going to have \nto sell off their herds.\n  As we look at this downward spiral, the spinoff problems are \nconsequential. In addition to having smaller herds, there will be less \ncattle to eat corn. In a bumper crop year, there will be more corn, and \ntherefore that will depress the price of corn.\n  This is not a situation without consequences to those outside \ninterests. It will harm the smaller communities that depend on \nagricultural income for their very existence. We must, in fact, act now \nand not make this a partisan or political football to kick back and \nforth. We must, in fact, step forward now and recognize the urgency of \nthis situation and not hold the farmers and ranchers of the livestock \nindustry hostage while others are playing partisan politics.\n  I thank the Senators from Minnesota and other colleagues who are \nlooking forward to having an emergency aid package, recognizing this \ndisaster at the soonest possible time.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we are playing revolving chairs today. \nIt is a pleasure to be in the Chamber with you. I indicate to my \ncolleagues--the Senator from Nebraska and my colleagues from \nMinnesota--that I completely understand and support what they are \nfighting for and join them in that fight.\n  We also have had in northern and western Michigan disasters that \nhappened as late as this spring where we have seen our cherry crop \nwiped out because of extremely hot weather, in the nineties, and then \nimmediately going into freezing temperatures. We have seen our orchards \nliterally wiped out in terms of the ability to produce cherries and \nother crops.\n  When this happens to our farmers, it is critical we step forward in a \nbipartisan way and do everything we can to support them to get through \nthis year, to get through these disasters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7244-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7244-S7246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have now for many\n\n[[Page S7245]]\n\nweeks, and in particular in the last 2 weeks, focusing on prescription \ndrugs, which is another disaster, quite frankly, that has been facing \nour seniors, our families, our farmers who are trying to find health \ninsurance for their families, our small businesses that are seeing \ntheir health care premiums double in some cases, trying to afford \nhealth care for themselves and their employees.\n  I rise on behalf of those workers who have had their employer say: \nYou are going to have to take a pay freeze this year because we have to \nhave money to pay for health care benefits.\n  I rise for those manufacturers that are seeing an explosion as well, \nand basically for everyone who is paying the price for the explosion in \nprescription prices, and the system that is basically out of control.\n  We have been working hard in the last week and a half. I think we are \nmaking some progress, but we are not there yet.\n  Yesterday, we had an opportunity to vote on two different plans \nbefore the Senate. One was a plan to strengthen Medicare, to put a \nsystem in place that was promised in 1965 with the advent of Medicare: \nThat once you are 65 or you are disabled, you will know that health \ncare is available for you. We all pay into the system. The promise was \nmade, and we have been trying to update and modernize that system to \nreflect the way health care is provided today, which is primarily on an \noutpatient basis with prescription drugs. Yesterday, we had that plan \nthat would pay the majority of the bill and would do it within \nMedicare, which we know works.\n  Then we had another plan much more focused on private insurance, \nHMOs, and I believe a step in privatizing the system. Quite frankly, \nthat is supported by the drug industry, the pharmaceutical industry \nthat has a situation right now for them that is too good to give up \nvoluntarily. They fight everything. They fight any effort to modernize \nMedicare, to put 40 million people, seniors and disabled persons, in \none insurance system because they know that if 40 million seniors and \ndisabled persons are in a system together, they will be able to get a \ngroup discount, like all the other insurance companies. They are \nfighting that. They know when the Federal Government goes to buy for \nveterans in the VA hospitals, we do not pay retail, we get a discount \non behalf of the veterans.\n  The outrageous part of the system today is that the only people who \npay retail, the only people who walk into the pharmacy and have nobody \nnegotiating on their behalf, are the seniors of this country and those \nwho are disabled and need help with health care.\n  Everybody else gets a discount. So we are trying to change that. The \ncompanies are fighting us every step of the way.\n  I think we did something historic yesterday. We did not get all the \nway to where we need to be, but for the first time in the Senate--52 \npeople, a majority of our colleagues--voted for a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. Unfortunately, in this process we need to get to 60 \nvotes, but I believe we sent a very strong message with 52 people--and \nthe other plan, in fact, had fewer; I believe it was 48 people that \nvoted for that plan. So fewer than the majority voted to move in the \ndirection of privatizing, to set up a system that is much more \nfavorable to the drug companies.\n  A majority of us, in fact, said we want to do this under Medicare; we \nwant to pay the majority of the bill for our seniors. I am very hopeful \nthat now we will be able to bring enough of our colleagues together, on \nboth sides of the aisle, to be able to get those eight extra votes for \nsomething that moves us in the right direction. We know it is not going \nto be all that we had originally hoped, but I desperately hope the drug \ncompanies are not successful again in stopping anything real from \nhappening.\n  I believe this is a point in history that people will look to just as \nthey will look to 1965, and it is up to us to show that we will do the \nright thing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be honored to yield to my friend from North \nDakota, who has been such a leader in this effort.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to ask a question of the Senator from \nMichigan. It is true that yesterday we had 52 votes for a prescription \ndrug plan in the Medicare Program. It is also true that we desperately \nneed it. Medicare is now roughly 40 years old. Had we had these \nlifesaving and miracle drugs available when Medicare was created, there \nis no question that we would have had a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare Program. Our task now is to put a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare Program and do it in a way that does not break \nthe bank. Both goals are important.\n  Yesterday, we had 52 votes for a prescription drug plan in the \nMedicare Program, but we need 60. It is also true that although a \nmajority of the Senate have now expressed themselves that they want \nthis prescription drug plan in the Medicare Program, a minority of the \nSenate can block it.\n  My hope is we will find a way now to reach 60 votes put a \nprescription drug plan in the Medicare Program in a thoughtful, \nresponsible manner, that is helpful to senior citizens. At the same \ntime we must put downward pressure on prescription drug prices. Both \napproaches are necessary.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan if it is not the case that although \nwe had 52 votes and the Senate has already said, yes, let us do it, a \nminority can block it? The question is, over the next 48 hours, Will a \nminority in the Senate block the majority's efforts to pass this bill? \nIs that not where we stand at this point?\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is exactly where we stand. My friend from North \nDakota is correct. That is exactly where we stand. The question is, \nWill the minority be able to block what the majority of people want to \nhave happen?\n  Turning back and asking my friend a question as well, I want to say \nfor those who are watching today, there is a way to express yourself. \nWe certainly hope you will engage with your Senator. You can also go to \nfairdrugprices.org and be part of an online petition drive urging the \nSenate to act, and share your own individual story. We have never had a \nmore important time for people to be involved. We need people now to be \ninvolved. There are six drug company lobbyists for every one Member of \nthe Senate, but the majority of the people in this country, regardless \nof where they live, know that we need action for them now, and that is \nwhat this is about.\n\n  Since my colleague has been a leader in another important effort, \nlowering prices for everyone, which is the other piece of the puzzle, \nwe want to make sure Medicare is updated to cover prescriptions for \nthose on Medicare, and that is critical. But for everyone else who is \nnot on Medicare, they also pay too much, and there are a number of \nefforts we are equally engaged in to get more competition, to lower \nprices for everyone, and I wonder if I might ask my colleague to speak \nto that specifically, since we have joined in efforts to open the \nborder to Canada, and other efforts.\n  I know that the Senator has been very involved in those efforts to \ncreate more competition.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan knows that one \nissue with respect to this bill is adding a prescription drug benefit \nto the Medicare Program, but that is not the only issue concerning \nprescription drugs in this country. The other issue is that all \nAmericans who get sick, who have a disease or an illness and who need \nprescription drugs need to be able to afford and have access to these \nmedicines. Miracle drugs provide no miracles, lifesaving drugs save no \nlives for those who cannot afford them. So we are trying to find a way \nto put some downward pressure on prescription drug prices.\n  The fact is that American people are charged the highest prices in \nthe world for prescription drugs. Virtually everyone else in the world \nbuys the same pill, put in the same bottle, made by the same company, \nand pays a much lower price. There is no Republican or Democratic way \nto get sick. There is no Republican version of Celebrex, Zocor, or \ntamoxifen, and there is no Democratic version of Celebrex, Zocor, or \ntamoxifen. There is just sickness, medicine, and need.\n  I want the drug companies to do well. I want them to invest in \nresearch, experimentation, and finding drugs. We are doing that in the \npublic sector,\n\n[[Page S7246]]\n\ndoubling the amount we are spending on the National Institutes of \nHealth searching for cures for these diseases. By the same token, I \nwant what we reap from all this research to be affordable by the \nAmerican people who need them when they get sick.\n  Regrettably, what has happened is every year the cost of prescription \ndrugs is going up--18 percent last year, 16 percent the year before, 17 \npercent the year before that. There is this relentless increase in the \ncost of prescription drugs, and the fact is a lot of vulnerable people \nin this country desperately need those drugs and cannot possibly afford \nthem.\n  Yes, it is important we do a prescription drug benefit in the \nMedicare Program. Fifty-two Senators have already said yes. The \nquestion is, Will a minority block us in the next day or two from \ngetting this done?\n  We also need to find a way to put downward pressure on prices. One \nway we have worked on--and the Senator from Michigan has been a \nleader--is the reimportation of prescription drugs from Canada. The \nsame drug, put in the same bottle, made by the same company, is sold in \nCanada at a fraction of the cost that the American consumer is charged.\n  To use one example, someone suffering from breast cancer who needs to \ntake the drug tamoxifen is going to pay $100 for that which they could \nbuy for $10 in Canada, the same medicine made by the same company, FDA \napproved, similar bottle, different price. The U.S. consumer is charged \n10 times more than the Canadian consumer. It is wrong, it is unfair, \nand it ought to stop. These are the things on which we are working.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We do not have perfect solutions, but we must in the next \nday or two make progress to get this bill completed so that we can go \nto conference with the House and make prescription drugs available to \nsenior citizens, especially in the Medicare Program, and also begin to \nfind a way to bring prescription drug prices down for all of us.\n  I appreciate the work the Senator from Michigan has done. She has \ndone in her leadership position a lot of work on this issue, and I \ndeeply appreciate it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  To support the comments of the Senator from North Dakota, it is so \nfrustrating to look at what is happening, and I think so unfair for \nconsumers in the United States, taxpayers, and ratepayers. People say: \nHow can this happen?\n  The reality is that today, while the companies say, oh, no, they \ncannot possibly lower prices at all because they would have to cut \nresearch, we know today that they spend two and a half times more on \nadvertising, marketing, and administration than they do on research. \nWhen we look at the numbers for last year, the top companies' profits \nwere three times more than they spent on research. This is not about \nresearch. We all are for research and, as my friend from North Dakota \nindicated, we as taxpayers fund research. This year we will contribute \nover $23 billion to basic research. I support that. I support doing \nmore than that. It is an important investment.\n\n  After we do that, the companies take the basic information and see if \nthey can develop new lifesaving medicine. That is great. However, we \ngive tax deductions for research, as well as advertising and other \ncosts of doing business. When they get to the point where they actually \nhave a new drug, we give them a patent of up to 20 years to protect \ntheir competitive edge, their brand name, so they can recover their \nresearch costs.\n  We know it costs a lot of money to develop a lifesaving drug. We want \nto make sure it is a good investment and they can recover their costs. \nThe problem is, we get done with all of this and what do we have? The \nhighest prices in the world--higher than anyone else. If you are \nuninsured and using medications--which is primarily the seniors of this \ncountry--and you walk into your pharmacy, you get the great pleasure \nand honor of paying the absolutely highest prices in the world. That is \noutrageous. That is what we are trying to fix, both by making sure the \nhealth care system works with medications through Medicare, and also \nmaking sure that we have greater competition, that we address the \noutrageous spiraling prices and we can bring those down for everyone. \nThat is the point of the debate.\n  We made some progress through amendments last week on cost \ncontainment. Yesterday we had an important debate on Medicare coverage. \nThe question now is whether or not we will be able to get this done on \nbehalf of the American people. I am hopeful we will be able to do that.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Some say, when you talk of prescription drug prices, let \nthe market decide. There is, after all, an open, free market; let the \nmarket decide.\n  Is it not the case that there is no free market for prescription \ndrugs in this country? There are price controls in the United States \nbut the prices are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, and they \nlike that. I understand that. Most other countries have price controls \nin which the governing authority sets the price, including profit, and \nthe drug manufactures market those drugs in those countries under those \nconditions.\n  In this country, there are no such limitations. So in this country, \nyou can charge whatever you like. The problem is, what if you charge \ntoo much for tamoxifen? What if you charge 10 times more than you \nshould for tamoxifen, and they can actually buy it for one-tenth the \nprice in Winnipeg, Canada? What prevents the consumer from voting with \ntheir feet and going to Canada? What prevents it is a perversion of the \nfree market, and that is a law that says the pharmacist at the Main \nStreet drugstore, the distributor cannot access drugs and bring them \nback.\n  There is a law that creates an artificial barrier against the free \nmarket working. When we try to change that, people say they are worried \nabout bioterrorism, poppy seeds in Afghanistan, or they are worried the \nMoon is made of blue cheese--the most Byzantine arguments I have heard \nsince I have been in the Senate.\n  Is it not the case that to say let the market decide, the free market \nis not a free market with respect to drug pricing in the United States?\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator is absolutely correct. There is not a free \nmarket. There are barriers placed in the way from real competition, \nreal trade across the border, and there are ways now that the companies \nstop competition--buying up generic companies and blocking other \ncompetition.\n  I say in conclusion, unfortunately, we cannot just say, let the free \nmarket prevail. We are not talking about optional products. We are not \ntalking about a family saying, we cannot afford a new car this year, we \nwill wait; we cannot afford a pair of new tennis shoes or lawn \nequipment. We are talking about lifesaving medicine. Sometimes when \npeople have to wait, they do not survive. This is different. We have to \nbe serious about the difference.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together and get something done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7246-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7246-S7248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill on which we will be voting \nat about 1:30 this afternoon. It is high time we pass this bill. The \nPresident asked for emergency appropriations to fund the Department of \nDefense and the war on terrorism about 4 months ago. It is critical. It \ncontains $14 billion to fund the war on terrorism. With the cost of \nantiterrorist operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere exceeding $2 \nbillion per month, these funds are certainly needed.\n  Because Congress has taken so long to produce this bill, the Pentagon \nhas already reached into $3 billion worth of funds budgeted for ongoing \nactivities in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.\n  Last week, the Pentagon's comptroller warned of dire consequences if \nCongress did not provide the funds soon. He said the Department would \nhave to suspend ship deployments and aircraft training operations for \nunits that are not forward deployed, with the result that many units \nwould no longer\n\n[[Page S7247]]\n\nbe able to respond to any crisis that might emerge.\n  Many spare parts and supplies no longer could be ordered, and both \nship maintenance and maintenance on critical aircraft, such as the EA-\n6B jammers and the F/A-18 fighter/attack aircraft, would come to a \nhalt. Scheduled moves for military personnel would be disrupted, \njeopardizing school years for children and job opportunities for \nspouses. As many as 35,000 civilians could be furloughed from the \nDepartment of defense.\n  Passage of this bill will guarantee our military does not run out of \nfunds before the fiscal year 2003 Defense appropriations bill is sent \nto the President's desk, hopefully by October 1 of this year.\n\n  This bill also helps Texans who have been devastated by two disasters \nat the same time--a severe lack of water in the Rio Grande River Valley \nin south Texas and heavy flooding in central Texas.\n  This emergency legislation will help south Texas farmers by providing \n$10 million to make up for some of the losses they incurred during the \nlast crop year due to lack of water. Families are suffering because \ntheir livelihood depends on water and Mexico has failed to deliver, \nunder the United States-Mexico water treaty of 1994, the water that is \nowed. This treaty obligates Mexico to allow 350,000 acre feet of water \nto flow to the Rio Grande river annually while obliging the United \nStates to allow 1.5 million acre feet of water to flow to Mexico from \nthe Colorado River.\n  Since 1992, Mexico has incurred a debt of 1.5 million acre feet of \nthis water to the United States, while the United States has \ncontinually complied with our water obligations under the treaty. \nBecause Mexico has failed to deliver its treaty obligated water, south \nTexas has lost over 5,000 jobs each year and suffered $230 million per \nyear in lost business activity. The economic loss to the region since \n1992 is estimated to be $1 billion. This situation has become critical \ndue to the continuing drought conditions in both south Texas and \nMexico.\n  The bill also provides $100 million in assistance for emergency use--\n$50 million for fires, $50 million for floods--to hundreds of thousands \nof Americans who courageously fought to survive the wrath of scorching \nwildfires and unyielding flash floods that swept across New Mexico, \nColorado, Arizona, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Texas, and many other areas \nof our Nation. These natural disasters rip through our towns, threaten \nour families, wreck our homes and businesses, destroy our heirlooms, \nand leave us stripped of resources to begin putting the pieces back \ntogether.\n  On the Fourth of July, when most of the Nation was celebrating \nAmerica's birthday, central Texans were evacuated from their homes by \nthe thousands. Texas rivers were on the rise and were cresting at \nrecord levels, more than 20 feet above flood stage in most locations. \nBy the time most of America's firework had burned out, the Medina River \ncrested at a ferocious 44 feet above flood stage south of San Antonio. \nThe storm left Texas with four people injured, four missing, and \nmourning the tragic deaths of nine.\n  I thank the Texas Department of Emergency Management and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, for their rapid response and rescue \nefforts for thousands of people who evacuated their homes, some of whom \nhad only a few precious minutes to muster their families and secure \ntheir most valuable possessions.\n  Imagine having to choose between saving your family photo album, your \ngreat-grandfather's journal, or your family Bible.\n  I particularly want to thank Joe Albaugh, the Director of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, who toured with some of us in the \ncongressional delegation to see the floods firsthand so he could come \nback and make sure he had made all of the efforts that could be made, \nall that were possible to give help to the people of south central \nTexas.\n  The flood waters have dropped in Texas and people are now diligently \nworking to clean and repair their homes and businesses. The total \ndamages are still being assessed, and it is estimated they will reach \nanother billion dollars. So I urge my colleagues to agree to this \nsupplemental appropriations conference report to help them begin to put \ntheir lives back together in south central Texas.\n  In addition, I want to mention Amtrak because this bill does restore \na commitment to Amtrak, and $4.4 billion in vital highway funding to \nthe States that would have been lost due to a decrease in gasoline tax \nrevenue. Amtrak, in particular, deserves our continued attention. Our \nnational passenger rail system is teetering on the edge of the abyss. \nThe bill merely pulls it back a few inches. We must find a way for \nAmtrak to achieve long-term financial security through a dedicated \nfunding source similar to the way we fund highways and aviation \ntransportation. Otherwise, we will face these emergencies every year, \nand service will continue to deteriorate.\n  At the same time, Amtrak's new leadership must eliminate this \nregional bias which has infected the railroad since its inception. \nAmtrak must stop sending all of its resources to the Northeast \ncorridor, which is probably the only place in America with reliable \nrail service. Even so, the Northeast corridor is losing money every bit \nas fast as the rest of the system.\n  I have inserted language into the Amtrak authorization, of which I am \na cosponsor, that would force the railroad to spend its money \nproportionately throughout the system. That way, passengers in Texas, \nWashington State, and Mississippi can enjoy the kind of service that \nNortheast commuters have had for decades.\n  I think we can have a national rail system for our country. I think \nit is important that we do so. We have the outline of such a railroad \nsystem today in Amtrak, but we have not funded it at a level where we \ncould have and expect stable service.\n  So I hope we will not only give Amtrak its lifeline today--which I \nbelieve that we will--but let's look at ways we can stabilize Amtrak so \nall the places that now get service can get reliable service, ontime \nservice. Every time Amtrak threatens to pull the long-haul lines--which \nthey did earlier this year--we lose thousands of reservations from \npeople not knowing if they are going to be able to use their tickets, \nif they are going to go somewhere and not be able to get back, so it \nhurts the system even more. That is why we need to have stability so \npeople can count on the service for which they are paying. We owe them \nthat.\n  We cannot possibly judge Amtrak unless we give them reliable service \nthat would give us fair criteria. But to think we are going to do it on \nan operationally self-sufficient basis is ludicrous. We are not. No \ncountry in the world does. We are going to have to give it a stable \nrevenue base and then hold the officers and board accountable for \nknowing how to run a railroad. I think it is time we do all these \nthings and keep the commitment to having rail service in our country.\n  Rail service is every bit as important an alternative as highways, as \nbuses on the highways, as airports and aviation. We need all kinds of \ntransportation in our country. In some places, freight is most easily \nand efficiently transferred from State to State across our country via \nrail. In some places, people cannot get to an airport. They do not live \nin a place that even has bus service. So they need another alternative \nthat will allow them to travel across our country. This is part of \nnational security. It is part of a stable economy. I think we need to \njust make a commitment and do it right. We have not been doing it \nright. We have been putting Band-Aids on Amtrak ever since we revived \nit years ago. Now is the time to do it right.\n  I think this supplemental appropriations bill is a good one. It meets \nthe needs of our military and our homeland defense, which certainly \nhave been in a crisis situation for the last few months as we have \ndebated this bill. It also addresses the emergencies in our country, \nfrom fires raging across the western part of the United States to \nfloods in my home State of Texas. And it does help us revive Amtrak, \nhopefully to give the leadership of Amtrak--new leadership, I might \nadd--the ability to get this job on track and hopefully to do it right.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the state of the proceedings at \nthis point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate accomplished two significant \nfeats last week. First, this body took strong action to ensure that \ncandor and accountability will be watchwords in the world of corporate \naccounting. We have given the Securities and Exchange Commission the \ntools it needs to better do its job of ensuring that financial \nstatements tell investors, in plain English, how our nation's \ncorporations are really doing. And we crafted 21st-century criminal \nstatutes and tougher penalties for those corporate wrongdoers who \nwillfully mislead investors about corporate finances, and we are still \nworking on that language.\n  Second, and more important, we resisted to a great extent the \ntemptation to turn this bill, on which Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nGramm worked so hard, into a tool for demagoguery. With the continuing \nreports of shoddy bookkeeping at some of our biggest companies, with \nterrible news coming from Wall Street these past few weeks, and with \ncontinuing layoffs at major corporations, it is no wonder that many \npundits across the country, and even a few of our colleagues, were \ntempted to cast about, looking for a bill to support--any bill at all--\nthat could make them look tough on white-collar crime.\n  But the battle is not over yet. We know that here in Congress, as \nwell as in the regulatory agencies and in State governments, there are \nstill moves afoot to impose more rules, more regulations, and more \npunishments on American businesses. There are those who are predicting \nthat this wave of corporate scandals could give rise to a new era of \nbig government, much like the Progressive Era or even the Great \nDepression.\n  I rise today, to say that this Nation must not return down that \nfailed path. A new era of ``re-regulation'' would, without a doubt, \ndamage or destroy the twin engines of innovation and capital formation \nthat have made the American people the richest people the world has \never known. A new era of re-regulation, however well-intentioned, would \nput us on the path that Europe and Japan have recently trod. We would \nbe playing a constant game of catch-up with whatever country was in the \neconomic lead. People in the leading countries would have access to new \ninventions today, and then, years later, citizens of the sluggish \nUnited States would finally be able to afford them. That is the kind of \ntrickle-down we need to avoid, and that is the kind of trickle-down \nthat the good people of Europe and Japan live with every day.\n  I have faith that the American people will not be led down that path. \nInstead, I believe that they will remember that in the late 1990s, the \nforces of competition gave birth to modern wonders in the fields of \nmedicine and telecommunications while Congress cut capital gains taxes \nand balanced the budget. We saw the promise of venture capital \nunleashed, as many new start-ups tried out their new ideas in the \nmarketplace even though we knew in advance that only a few would \nsucceed.\n  And as investment and innovation increased, our workers became more \nproductive, and higher productivity led, as always, to higher wages and \nbetter living standards. Census figures show that since 1980, the share \nof families earning over $100,000 per year doubled, even after \nadjusting for inflation. The number of people living in poverty has \ndeclined, and the only reason it has not declined faster is because \nthis land of opportunity draws in poor immigrants from throughout the \nworld. In many cases, however, within a generation these immigrants \nwill rise into the middle and upper ranks of income-earners.\n  And, most saliently, this prosperity reached into almost every part \nof American life. Overall unemployment rates reached the lowest levels \nin 30 years, and every race and every age group saw its fortunes \nimprove. Just as the 1980s debunked the pessimists who thought that \nstagflation and malaise were the waves of the future, so the 1990s, \nwith unemployment rates getting down to 4 percent, debunked those who \nthought that unemployment rates below 6 percent inevitably spark \ninflation.\n  Despite the fact that the American people have endured a year of high \nenergy prices, a painful recession, waves of corporate \naccounting scandals, and the horrific attacks of September Eleventh, \nour economy's foundations remain strong. Innovation and capital \nformation have continued even during the depths of the recession, to \nthe amazement of the pessimists. Despite the many buffetings our nation \nhas endured, America's workers are more productive today than they were \njust a year ago. That continued the trend of the last few years, where \nwe saw productivity grow at an annual rate of 3.1 percent.\n\n  We have seen the unemployment rate shoot up from its 30-year low of \n3.9 percent up to 5.9 percent in June. Mere numbers, of course, can \nnever convey the real cost of losing a job. And tragically, recessions \ncontinue to hurt workers months and months after sales pick up. But \nclearly, this recession is like no other that we have seen: \nmanufacturing has been hit hard, very hard, by this recession. Workers \nin those industries, and people who live in towns that rely on those \nindustries, have paid a heavy price.\n  But our economy's resilience and flexibility is amazing, and this \nresilience shows in our labor markets, where our nationwide average \nunemployment rate of 5.9 percent, while still too high, would have been \nhailed during most of the 1980's and 1990's. And if Congress acts to \nrestore the economy to its potential, enacting policies that encourage \ninnovation and capital formation, we can continue to improve our \nstandard of living, get the unemployment rate back down, and make our \neconomy more resistant to the inevitable economic shocks of our modern \nworld.\n  As Chairman Greenspan noted last Tuesday, Congress can strengthen our \neconomy's long-run potential through strong fiscal discipline, so that \nmore of our economy's resources are in the hands of our innovating \nprivate sector. And since capital formation and technical innovation \nare keys to productivity growth, we should move aggressively toward \nexpensing capital equipment and finally making the research and \ndevelopment tax credit permanent.\n  The accounting reform bill we passed last week is a good bill, and \nonce it comes out of conference, I hope it is even better. The Senate \nbill reduces the potential for conflicts of interest between auditing \nand consulting services. It ensures that the government will vigorously \nscrutinize audits to ensure that the balance sheet is telling the real \nstory. And it modernizes the criminal codes to deal with the corrupt \nfew who knowingly break the rules outright.\n  But once the final version of this bill becomes law, that is by no \nmeans the end of the story. Once the regulators get ahold of the final \nbill, it will, once again, become a target for anti-corporate \nactivists, those who distrust bigness, who distrust success, and who \ndistrust the competitive spirit of the American people. They will seek \nto pressure the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board to \nenact rules that express their hostility toward corporate America. And \nhowever well-intentioned the goals of these activists, they could have \ndisastrous consequences.\n\n  Let us consider an example that sounds reasonable enough. I started \noff by noting that the Sarbanes bill would ensure that financial \nstatements tell investors, in plain English, how our nation's \ncorporations are really doing. There are good reasons for reporting \nfinancial statements in language that ordinary investors can \nunderstand, and the SEC has done a good job encouraging corporations \nand financial services companies to avoid unneeded jargon in their \nofficial statements. But at the same time, we need to remember that \nwhile corporate finance is not rocket science, it is not that far from \nit.\n  Some issues will be hard to understand, and they should stay that \nway. If we insist that every financial dealing be completely \nunderstandable to the average investor, then you know what we will end \nup with. Corporations that\n\n[[Page S7249]]\n\nthe average investor would not want to invest in. Investors want their \ncompanies to be run by people who know more about finance than they do, \njust as they want our homes built by people who know more about \nconstruction than they do. Sure, it is good to know the broad outlines \nabout how a house is built. But we expect construction workers to use \ntheir specialized knowledge, knowledge that is difficult to convey to a \nlayperson.\n  The same holds true in the world of corporate management. Even after \nthese accounting reforms are up and running, accounting is still going \nto sound like a foreign language to most people, and plenty of run-of-\nthe-mill business decisions are going to sound complex to outsiders. \nCritics will accuse anything with a footnote of being a loophole, just \nanother example of ``crony capitalism.'' They will put pressure on \nAmerica's businesses to simplify their businesses so that it can be \n``transparent'' to outsiders. But we cannot give in to the urge to \ninsist that corporate finance be intelligible to high-school students, \nand we cannot allow pressure groups to dictate how to organize a \nbusiness.\n\n  We have seen unjustified awards destroy the careers of many good \ndoctors who can no longer get malpractice insurance just because juries \nend up being swayed by emotion and genuine human suffering rather than \nby the difficult medical issues at hand. We cannot let the same thing \nhappen to corporate America.\n  Finally, I want to address an overarching question: Do we really live \nin a world where a couple of crafty and unscrupulous executives can \ndestroy an entire Fortune 500 company? Is our market economy really a \nhouse of cards that needs the ever-present support of the Federal \nGovernment to keep from falling down? I do not believe the evidence \nsupports these pessimistic conclusions. The companies that have been in \nthe news made bad business decisions generated by what Chairman \nGreenspan called ``infectious greed,'' which they covered up with \naccounting chicanery. It was the bad business decisions that were the \nroot cause here, made far worse by the fact that the mistakes were \nsuccessfully covered up for so long.\n  By tightening the auditor's scrutiny of business decisions, we expect \nthat in the future, bad decisions will be uncovered sooner, before too \nmuch damage is done to the company and to its stock price. But business \ndecisions will continue to be made, both good and bad, and companies \nwill continue to rise and fall as customers and shareholders vote with \ntheir dollars. That, as Secretary O'Neill noted, is the ``genius of the \nmarket.''\n  And that brings me to my final point. If auditors uncover a serious \nproblem with a company's books, who will fix it? Surely, in most cases, \nthe board of directors will act aggressively to sack the problem \nexecutives and install a new team that will work hard to put things \nright. Especially with the incentive of stock options and stock \nownership, the new management team, facing auditor scrutiny, will have \nstrong reasons to do the best they can to boost shareholder value. The \npunishments dealt by the stock market are already giving corporations a \nstrong incentive to reform, as stockholders press for clarity and \nboards of directors interrogate their CEOs and demand answers.\n  But what about those occasional situations where the directors are \neither incompetent or out of touch? In practice, it is very difficult \nfor shareholders to replace directors on their own. There are sometimes \nmillions of individual shareholders, each of whom has little incentive \nto put in the time and effort of replacing their directors. It is \nalmost always easier to sell the badly-performing stock than it is to \nreplace incompetent directors. At this point, our last best hope is \nthat much-maligned character from the 1980s, the hostile takeover \nartist.\n  The Sarbanes bill uses the phrase ``protection of investors'' over 20 \ntimes. But who protects investors better than someone who invests a \nlarge sum of cash into a failing company, kicks out the old, \nineffective, perhaps even corrupt management, and installs new leaders \ndedicated to maximizing long-run shareholder value? But while we have \nseen numerous large mergers over the last decade, why have we not seen \nas many genuinely hostile takeovers? The answer, of course, is \nlegislation. In this case, it was not federal law but state laws that \nstemmed the tide of hostile takeovers, as laws made it easier for \nsloppy management to fend off takeover advances. So even if improved \naudits uncover corporate incompetence or worse, shareholders could \nstill be left with bad managers and worthless investments.\n  The accounting reform legislation on which we have worked will break \nnew ground in the realm of investor protection. It will increase \ntransparency and punish wrongdoers. But that is only half the battle \nagainst corporate mismanagement. The second half of the battle comes \nwhen directors and shareholders take action to purge the ineffective \nexecutives and restore the profitability of their investments. In time, \nI hope Congress takes action to assist them. The combined calls by the \nPresident and the Senate for directors with greater independence is a \nstrong step in that direction.\n  In closing, I want to draw attention again to the true foundation of \nour nation's prosperity--our nation's workers, the most productive in \nthe world. Whether they work in a factory, behind a desk, or on a farm, \nthe American worker can produce more in an hour than any other worker \nin the world. That is because they have access to better tools, better \nknowledge, better education, and in particular, better organizations. \nFrom old-economy stalwarts such as Ford to new-economy innovators like \nIntel to our ever-modernizing agribusiness sector, our economy's large \norganizations help to coordinate the activities and innovations of \ncountless numbers of people so that we can accomplish more with our \nscarce time. The quality of American automobiles, the speed of \nAmerican-designed microprocessors, and the produce of America's farms \nkeep increasing each and every year. I am confident that our accounting \nreforms, if enforced prudently, will help to strengthen the American \ncorporation's ability to innovate. And by doing so, all Americans will \nreap the rewards.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7249-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am a strong supporter of the proposal \nthat was offered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, and Senator \nMiller from Georgia. That amendment achieved 52 votes in the Senate. A \nmajority of the Members voted in favor of a program based upon the \nMedicare system, a program that closes the great loophole that is part \nof our Medicare system, which so many of our seniors are faced with \nevery single day.\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\n  We had a good debate on that measure. And we had a good debate on the \nRepublican alternative, which I believe, as I expressed during the \ncourse of the debate, falls well short of meeting the needs of our \nseniors. The alternative plan is inadequate, full of loopholes, and \nfails to address the overarching issue of prescription drugs for our \nseniors. But, nonetheless, we had a good debate.\n  There are those who supported that program. Obviously, their \ninterpretation differed with my interpretation of the program, and they \nbelieved--and continue to believe strongly--that their program was the \nbest way to achieve the objective of universal coverage of seniors in \nthis country. We did not have a difference in terms of the underlying \nconcept, we had a difference in terms of approach. I believed--and \nstill believe--we would be unable to guarantee protections for our \nelderly under the Republican proposal. But that was the matter of the \ndebate. The Senate spoke. And it spoke more favorably of the proposal \noffered by Senator Graham than the Republican proposal.\n\n  Now we have an entirely different proposal before the Senate. I, \nquite frankly, believe--even though I was highly skeptical of what they \ncall the tripartisan proposal--that this does not even measure up to \nthe tripartisan proposal.\n  What we are attempting to do in the Senate is to pass a program that \nwill reach all of our seniors, and do it in a way that is going to be \naffordable for our seniors. That is one of the great features of the \nunderlying proposal, which we all support on this side of the aisle. \nAnd it does include measures that have been accepted both in our HELP \nCommittee, as well as on the floor of the Senate that deal with the \nissue of the cost of prescription drugs.\n  We want to make prescription drugs affordable, we want to make them \naccessible, and we want to build on a system in which the seniors have \nconfidence. That is why, quite frankly, we find that virtually all the \nseniors groups have supported the proposal of Senator Graham and \nSenator Miller. They all support that proposal. Virtually none of them \nsupport the tripartisan program. And virtually none of them support \nthis particular proposal.\n  It seems to me, as we stated yesterday, our seniors--who have fought \nin the wars, brought us out of the Depression, and built this Nation up \nto be the great country that it is--are entitled to more than crumbs in \nterms of the prescription drug program.\n  They are living longer, thankfully, and families are blessed by the \npresence of their parents and grandparents. These days, a number of \ngenerations--three or four generations--can be alive at the same time. \nThat is all very good.\n  I cannot understand, for the life of me, why the Senate would be \nwilling to accept the amendment which is being offered now, which is so \ninadequate that it does not even deserve to be called prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare. It is a step backwards, not forwards, in \nmending the broken promise of Medicare and providing senior citizens \nthe health security they deserve.\n  It provides no real cost containment for the explosive growth of \nprescription drugs. That is a major problem. We have had good debate on \nthose measures, but this proposal has no cost containment. Its funding \nis so inadequate that it would pay about a dime on the dollar toward \nprescription drug costs of the elderly--a dime on the dollar. One of \nthe things we want to avoid in the Senate is telling our seniors that \nwe are doing something meaningful for them in terms of prescription \ndrugs and then failing to meet that test. When you are down to a dime \non the dollar for prescription drugs, I believe this amendment fails to \nlive up to a prescription drug coverage for the elderly.\n  It is a catastrophic-cost-only plan. We tried that once, and the \nelderly, themselves, rejected it. I was here in the Senate when we \ntried the catastrophic program for the elderly, and they, themselves, \nrejected it. We can come back to that discussion later on if we want \nto.\n  Under this amendment, a poor senior citizen with an income of less \nthan $9,000 a year would have to pay $1,500--17 percent of their \nincome--before they got any help.\n  A low-income senior with an income of only $18,000 a year would have \nto pay $3,500--20 percent of their meager income--before they got any \nhelp.\n  A moderate-income senior citizen with an income of $35,000 would have \nto pay $5,500--16 percent of their income--before they got any help.\n\n  This isn't insurance, and this isn't Medicare. If it were to become \nlaw, senior citizens would still be choosing between whether they are \ngoing to put food on the table or take the medicines they need to \nsurvive. If it were to become law, senior citizens would still face the \nprospect of having their lifetime savings swept away by the high cost \nof prescription drugs. If it were to become law, the broken promise of \nMedicare would remain broken.\n  Beyond the simple fact that this benefit is inadequate, it violates a \nbasic principle of Medicare, by effectively imposing a means test. \nMedicare is one of the most beloved and successful programs ever \ncreated. The reason it has such broad public support is that it is \nuniversal social insurance. Everyone contributes, and everyone \nbenefits.\n  Republicans have wanted to turn Medicare into a welfare program ever \nsince it was created. This plan is, I believe, just another step in \nthat direction. The American people rejected that approach in 1965, and \nI think they still reject it today.\n  This bill is more inadequate than the House Republican bill. It is \nmore inadequate than either of the two bills just voted on by the \nSenate. It is not supported by a single organization of the elderly or \nthe disabled. And it does not deserve the support of the Senate.\n  If we are going to take steps to try to respond to the needs of the \nelderly, it seems to me we ought to be able to gain the support of \nthose groups. We have to ask ourselves, each time we consider \nlegislation, who benefits? Obviously, we also have to ask, who pays? \nThe taxpayer. Who benefits from this program, and how do they react to \nthis program? The elderly, and they are not in support of the program.\n  The fight for a real Medicare prescription drug benefit did not end \nyesterday. We will continue to fight until senior citizens have the \nprotections they deserve.\n  A vote for this bill is a vote to substitute a political fig leaf, a \nvery small fig leaf, for the real protection the elderly need.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise in support of the Hagel-Ensign \nbill because it really strikes right at the heart of what seniors \nexpect from our Government as they look at their health care and as \nthey look to their future.\n  When I talk to seniors as I travel around the great State of \nTennessee and the country, they tell me a very simple and \nstraightforward message regarding prescription drugs: Please, when you \ngo back to Washington, enact a prescription drug benefit and do it now. \nDo not do it 3 or 4 years from now--implementing the program in 7 or 8 \nyears. What I want is something now; do it now.\n  The beautiful thing about the Hagel-Ensign bill--and I congratulate \nthe authors and sponsors and cosponsors--is that it is the only bill \nthat has come to the floor of the Senate that enacts a prescription \ndrug benefit now. Our seniors deserve an affordable, immediate \nprescription drug coverage. That is No. 1: Do it now. This is the only \nbill we have considered that accomplishes that.\n  No. 2: do it responsibly. That is where the debate has changed a lot \ncompared to 2 years ago or 4 years ago or even prior to the last \nelection a year and a half ago. Our seniors today, individuals with \ndisabilities and the future generation of seniors say: Do it now, but \ndo it responsibly. Responsibly means to have a bill on the table that \ncan be sustained over time, which does not sunset or have a narrow \nwindow of applicability. Do it now; do it responsibly.\n  Yesterday, we talked about bills on the floor that cost $800 billion \nor, over a full 10-year period, $1 trillion, and that did not pass. \nAdditionally, we debated a bill that cost about $370 billion. That bill \ndid not have sufficient votes for the point of order. Today, we are\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\ntalking about a bill that costs less than $200 billion--well within \nwhat we have budgeted.\n  Even more importantly than cost, is that this particular bill \ncaptures the power of what is called competition or the marketplace. \nWhat that means is what we pass today in terms of benefits, in terms of \nthe prescription drug card, and in terms of the catastrophic coverage \nwill be able to be sustained over time. When you capture the element of \ncompetition in the delivery, what you say is that there will be prudent \ntradeoffs, and decisions made regarding--whether it is inpatient \nhospital care, acute care, chronic care, preventive care, or \nprescription drugs.\n  When I say ``tradeoffs,'' I don't mean lessening of the benefits. I \nmean bringing people to the table so rational decisionmaking can take \nplace, given that the benefits that are promised need to be matched \nwith the resources that are available.\n  The Hagel-Ensign bill is immediate, affordable, and permanent. It is \nnot promised just for a period of time. Finally, it is market based--\ncapturing the power of competition so that it can continue to deliver \nthe benefits over time.\n  For that reason, I am excited about this bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill. We will have the opportunity to debate and \ndiscuss the details over the next 2 hours. In short, it is a \nprescription drug card where every senior who participates can get a \ndiscount instead of paying retail for drugs. Additionally, there is a \ncap as to how much they will have to pay out of pocket. This cap \nprovides seniors with security and peace of mind that in the event they \nare struck by a lymphoma, heart or lung disease and have to buy \nprescription drugs that they will only have to pay a certain amount. \nFor those reasons, I urge support for this immediate, affordable, \npermanent, and market-based plan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes. Who seeks \nrecognition? Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I yield my colleague from Nevada 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I want to talk about a couple of \nphilosophies that deal with this bill. We currently have a health care \nsystem that has evolved over time where we have low deductible policies \nand we have usually a small copay involved. That low deductible \ncoverage over time has taken the patient out of the accountability \nloop.\n  Somebody goes into the office. They have an annual deductible. They \ndon't pay attention. They go in and they start getting their health \ncare coverage. The doctor tells them whatever they should do. The \ndoctor is trying to rush people through. They don't think the patient \nis paying for the care. So they don't take the time to explain why \ncertain tests cost money. They know somebody else is paying for it. \nThey don't think about the patient's cost because it isn't the patient. \nIt is an insurance company that is paying the cost.\n  By taking that patient out of the accountability loop, costs have \nskyrocketed in the United States. That is the fundamental flaw to the \ninsurance system we have in our health care delivery system today. It \nwould be akin to having homeowners insurance that paid for doing the \nlandscaping around your house or painting the trim. We don't expect \nthat. We expect those normal maintenance costs to be paid out of \npocket.\n  But if something like a fire happens to your house or some kind of \nother horrible thing happens--for example, I recently had a hose break \nin our washing machine. We ended up with probably about $30,000 worth \nof damage. Unfortunately, we had gone on vacation when the hose in the \nwashing machine broke. We came home. There was all kinds of damage. We \nhad to have floors replaced, walls; it was about $30,000 worth of \ndamage. Our insurance kicked in. But I didn't expect my homeowners \ninsurance to pay for repainting the trim on my house or landscaping or \nthings like that.\n  That is normal expenses in everyday life. That is why homeowners \ninsurance has remained relatively inexpensive over the years. Health \ncare insurance has not, because the patient doesn't think about the \ncost.\n  Our plan says: Let's keep the patient accountable. Let's keep the \nsenior citizen accountable. Senior citizens don't want to put a huge \nburden onto young people. Yes, they would like prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned that seniors don't want to \nlose what they have saved for all the years. They want to make sure \nthey have some security in their assets.\n  We have said: Let's keep the patient in the accountability loop. Low-\nincome seniors in our bill will pay the first $1,500 or about $120 a \nmonth out of pocket. They are going to pay that. Seniors can afford to \npay that. They are willing to do that. After that, the Government is \ngoing to pay--other than a small copay--is going to pay so that the \nsenior who has diabetes, a heart condition, cancer, that senior is \ngoing to be covered under our plan and is going to keep from losing all \nof their valuable assets.\n  So because the first dollar coverage is paid by the senior instead of \nthe Government, our plan is much more fiscally responsible to the next \ngeneration. That is why, when Senator Frist talked about it being a \nsustainable plan, our plan, in the future, will be sustainable because \nthe patients--the senior citizens themselves--will shop for medicine; \nthey will not just take whatever the doctor says. They will ask: what \nabout generics? Is there a generic for that? They will do that because \nthey are paying the first dollars out of their pockets. They will also \nask: Do I need that medication? I am taking four medications. Do I need \nall four? Maybe the doctor would say: I forgot about the other \nmedication you were taking.\n  So this brings the patient back into being accountable for their own \nhealth care. That is critically important to our health care system and \nespecially to this new prescription drug coverage that we want to add \nto Medicare.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to look at this very reasonable \nproposal. It is something that can be done, and can be done now, and it \ncan be made permanent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I think we ought to have at least some \nunderstanding about what the challenge is. We make decisions in the \nSenate, and this is basically a question of priorities. The issue that \nis before us, in the broader context, is whether we believe it's a \npriority to do something to keep the costs down in terms of \nprescription drugs for our senior citizens, our fellow citizens.\n  Now, our good friends on the other side say: Look, we want to do \nsomething, but we are not going to do very much. It is better than \ndoing nothing at all.\n  I would like to believe we are capable of doing something more for \nthose Americans who have been called the greatest generation. Rather \nthan giving them crumbs, it seems to me we ought to give them a decent \nbenefit package that is built upon the Medicare system. That is what is \nsupported by all of the elderly groups.\n  The question is, do we have the will? Or are we going to just trim \nsomething off the edges and give them a little something? If you are \nmaking $8,000 or $9,000, you are going to have to spend $1,500 before \nyou ever get anything at all.\n  It seems to me this is a question of priorities here in the Senate \nfor the greatest generation, for our senior citizens: Are we prepared \nto make a commitment that will ensure them a benefit package that is \nequal to the request by this President for tax cuts this year--$600 \nbillion? I don't hear any proposals from the other side saying, let's \ndefer that $600 billion tax cut and put it in here for prescription \ndrugs. Let us not try to shortchange our senior citizens.\n  There are two issues which are underlying all of this. One is the \nissue of cost, which is clearly demonstrated by this chart. The yellow \nrepresents the consumer price index, the gradual increase in inflation, \nand the blue represents the drug costs that are going up every year. \nThere is nothing in the Hagel proposal that does anything to get a \nhandle on these costs. Those costs are going to continue to go up. \nThere is no proposal in there that does anything about cost. But there \nis another very important proposal that we\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\nhave before the Senate--and we welcome the support of our Republican \ncolleagues--that can make a difference in terms of cost.\n\n  Our Democratic program deals with the issues of cost and also with \nthe issues of coverage. Cost is going up. Our seniors need help. Let's \njust look at what we are facing globally in the United States in terms \nof prescription drugs and our seniors and where they are.\n  We have 13 million who have virtually no coverage at all; 10 million \nhave coverage in employer-sponsored programs--we will come back to \nthat--13 million have none, and 10 million are in employer sponsored \nprograms; 5 million are in the Medicare HMO; 2 million are in Medigap; \n3 million are in Medicaid, and another million have other kinds of \npublic coverage. The only seniors who are protected in this whole group \nare the ones with Medicaid. They are the ones who are guaranteed. The \nrest of them are not, and we will see very quickly why they are not \nprotected.\n  Remember now, 13 million have none and 10 million are employer \nsponsored, 5 million in HMOs, and 2 million in Medigap. Let's take the \nemployer-sponsored group. Look at what happened in the employer-\nsponsored programs. This chart shows what has been happening in the \nemployer-sponsored programs. Firms offering retiree health coverage \ndropped 40 percent between 1994 and 2001. That line is going down \nthrough the cellar of the Senate. Those 10 million who were covered by \nemployer-sponsored plans are going right on down. They are being \ndropped every single day. Make no mistake about it.\n  Under the Republican proposal that was before the Senate yesterday, \nthis decrease would have been accelerated for 3 million seniors in that \nprogram because the employers would not receive any of the assistance \nthey need to retain them.\n  So the 10 million who have the employer sponsored are going down. We \nhave the 13 million who have none and 10 million who are employer \nsponsored. They are increasingly at risk every single day.\n  Well, you say, we still have 4 million who have HMO coverage. Look at \nthe bottom line here. Look at the Medicare HMOs, reducing the level of \ndrug coverage. This is going down every single year--70 percent of the \nHMOs limit their drug coverage to $750. So even if you have some \ncoverage up to $750, you are paying higher and higher costs. That \nwasn't the case 5 or 7 years ago, but it is the case now. Fifty percent \nof the Medicare HMOs with drug coverage only pay for generic drugs. So \nthis is what is happening now. The HMOs the 4 million people who have \nsome kind of coverage are being restricted, they are being limited, \nthey are being conditioned every single day.\n  Increasing numbers of our seniors are not being taken care of. This \nis what we are facing in our country. The answer we had before the \nSenate yesterday was a comprehensive program built upon Medicare, which \nis affordable, which is dependable, which is reliable, which is \ndefensible, and which the overwhelming majority of the elderly support. \nWe have 52 votes for it. We would like to build on that. We are \nattempting to do so. Now, with the Republican program--as I pointed \nout, I didn't agree with it, I didn't support it. But at least those \nwho did support it made the case that it was going to be able to \nprovide universal coverage. They said, look, we can do it through the \nprivate sector, and if the private sector won't provide the coverage in \nremote areas, we are going to continue to fund them until at last they \ndo.\n  I suppose at the end of the day you can find someone who will sell a \nprescription drug program in a remote area of Alaska if you pay them \nenough to do so. Our concern is that with the amount of money we are \nspending to pay the private sector, we ought to be using it in the \nbenefit package, ought to be enhancing the benefit package, providing \nadditional kinds of relief for our senior citizens.\n  Now along comes a proposal that is opposed by the AARP. Here is a \nletter that was circulated yesterday. It says:\n  Given these concerns, the AARP opposes your amendment.\n  The reason the seniors oppose it is they don't really believe that \nthis will be any substantial or significant help, or even a little \nhelp, to the seniors in this country. They believe what we ought to do \nis build upon the Medicare system, a system that has been tried and \ntested, and has performed over the test of time. As the leading \norganization of the elderly finds, this proposal is completely \ninadequate. At least we ought to live up to our hopes and our dreams \nfor our seniors, and that is to cover all of them.\n  We ought to cover all of them. What happens to those seniors who are \nmaking $7,000 or $8,000, $9,000? They have to pay out $1,500. Think of \nthis: An elderly person who has worked all of his or her life and has \n$9,000 in income. Now they have to pay out all of this money. They have \nto pay out $1,500 before they get any assistance at all. On what are \nthey going to live? Think of the difficult choices and decisions they \nhave to make to come up with that $1,500. Then they will have to pay a \ncopay after that.\n  A low-income person with only $18,000 in income will have to pay \n$3,500, 20 percent of their meager income before they get any help. \nThis is well above what any average senior citizen is paying at this \ntime. The average citizen is paying somewhere around $2,000. A person \nwith an income of $18,000 will have to pay $3,500. They are making \n$18,000 a year and we are calling that moderate income.\n  How do people get along with $18,000 a year to pay for a mortgage, \npay for the heating of their home, pay for their food, pay perhaps for \na summer camp for their children or grandchildren? How do people get \nalong on that $18,000? The fact is, people are hard-pressed, and I \nthink for us in this body to accept the concept that we have done \nsomething for our seniors with this is a complete misstatement. I just \ndo not see how we can support this proposal.\n  Nothing in this proposal deals with the cost of prescription drugs--\nthis limited program is unworthy of what we in this body ought to be \nabout. 52 Members of the Senate on our side, and 48 Members on the \nRepublican side voted for a universal plan. Now, we are back in less \nthan 24 hours talking about a catastrophic program that will only reach \na small number of people and will put people through the wringer to do \nso. I think this institution, this body, can do better.\n  I strongly believe that seniors, who are faced with this national \nchallenge and who are suffering and experiencing these extraordinary \nchoices every single day deserves a great deal better. That is why I \nhope eventually that this amendment will not be accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I am the designee of the Senator from \nNebraska. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to address some of the concerns \nof the Senator from Massachusetts. First, there are many States, at the \nincome levels he is talking about--$9,000, $10,000, $11,000, and even \nin my State of Nevada up to the $22,500 a year level--that are already \nproviding some help for senior citizens.\n  The Republican Governor of my State was very visionary and put \ntogether something called the Senior Rx Program using part of the money \nfrom the tobacco settlement. For people with an income of $21,500 or \nless--they are non-Medicaid-eligible people--as long as they have been \na resident of Nevada for at least 12 months, they can have a maximum \nbenefit of $5,000 a year. They have no premium. They pay $10 for \ngeneric drugs and a $25 copay for preferred drugs.\n  In the State of Nevada, that person Senator Kennedy was talking about \nwho makes $9,000 a year is taken care of. In fact, that person does \nvery well. That person does better than under the Democrat proposal--\nmuch better.\n  Also, if you go out and talk to seniors--I have been in a couple of \nvery time-consuming and all-encompassing campaigns 2 out of the last 4 \nyears--I talked to seniors all over our State, and if you say to them \nthey are going to be limited to about $100, $120 a month of out-of-\npocket expenses for those low-to moderate-income people, they are \necstatic; they will jump at that. They will say: Sign me up, as long as \nthey are limited from losing everything or from being bankrupted\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\nbased on prescription drugs or not being able to pay their rent.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts that maybe he ought to \nencourage the people in his State to take a look at what the people in \nthe State of Nevada have done for their seniors, because the seniors in \nNevada who truly need help, under this plan, are taken care of.\n\n  Those who are higher income seniors--by the way, most seniors have \ntheir mortgages paid for. Most of them have their cars paid for, \ncompared to young people. That is what a lot of this argument is about. \nTell someone who is making $30,000 a year and has a couple of kids that \nin the future they are going to have to pay a lot higher taxes; they \nare already paying high taxes now, but in the future they are going to \npay higher taxes because of what we are setting up today, especially if \nthe plan the Senator from Massachusetts supports became law. If the \nplan the Senator from Massachusetts supports became law, taxes in the \nfuture are guaranteed to go up, otherwise our Medicare system will be \nbankrupt.\n  Part of that is because of what I already talked about. When you take \nthe patient out of any kind of accountability for what they are \nreceiving, costs are going to skyrocket. We have seen that in our \nhealth care system today. A lot of the issues about which the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was talking and the charts he was showing with drugs \ngoing out of sight is because people are not accountable for what they \nare getting. Insurance is taking care of it.\n  Let us look at what we have before us today. Let us do something for \nthose seniors, and I want to give a couple of examples. I want to show \nyou real-life examples of senior citizens with real-life diseases who \nare paying real dollars out of their pockets for prescription drugs.\n  The first example I want to use is a guy named James. He is about 68 \nyears old with an income of about $16,000 a year. He is taking these \nfollowing medications: Glucophage, Glyburide, Neurontin, Protonix, \nLescol, and Zoloft, for a total cost of close to $500 a month, $5,700 a \nyear.\n  Under the three major competing proposals, that person with $16,000 \nin income, under the plan the Senator from Massachusetts supports, \nwould pay $2,900 a year out of pocket. Under the tripartisan plan, \n$2,340, and under the Hagel-Ensign plan, $1,923 a year. That is what \nthis person would pay. So this person who is really sick who needs the \nhelp the most is actually going to get the benefit they need, but yet \nwill still have some accountability, and that is the balance in the \nplan that we have done.\n  We feel this kind of an example is the reason that people should \nsupport our plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, to correct my colleague and friend, he \nmentioned $8,000 or $9,000. That falls within 135 percent of poverty. \nSo under our program, they would not be paying any out-of-pocket \nexpenditures.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Beyond this, he mentioned his own program in his own \nState as support. We are representing all the people of all the States. \nQuite frankly, I do not intend to get into a debate about his program \nin Nevada, although there are people who have talked about that \nprogram. Some of our colleagues who are former insurance commissioners \nhave talked about the history of that particular program.\n  I do not happen to get into that program. Let me point out my program \nin the State of Massachusetts. The annual out-of-pocket spending limits \nfor deductibles and copays are $2,000, or 10 percent of income, \nwhichever is less, and everyone over 65 is eligible for it.\n  This program is better than the Hagel-Ensign program. No one would \nbenefit from that program in Massachusetts. I do not know which States \nor individuals would benefit and which would not benefit.\n  We are concerned about all of our seniors. That is what we are trying \nto address. Even if one State does a little better and one State does \nworse, we are looking at the challenge which all of our seniors face. I \nmust say that I think I could go to places in Nevada or places in \nMassachusetts or any State, to find hard working, decent people, who \nplay by the rules and were guaranteed, through Medicare, that their \nhealth care would be secure. That is what we said in 1965. No ifs, \nands, or buts; it will be guaranteed. But it is not guaranteed, and the \nprincipal reason it is not guaranteed is because we do not have \nprescription drug coverage. That is the reason. We want to try to deal \nwith that.\n  Thinking you are giving health security to people who have incomes of \n$9,000 who are going to still have to pay out the $1,500--and people \nwith incomes of $18,000 who will have to pay $3,500--does not measure \nup. I know the Senator and I differ on that, but it just does not seem \nto measure up.\n  We are not talking about a comparison of particular States. We should \nbe trying to look at this generation and what happens to people who \nmove from State to State.\n  Speaking about the overutilization of health care, the people who \noverutilize it are the wealthy individuals. Most people who are working \n40 hours a week and taking care of their children do not have time to \nsit in a doctor's office or the resources to pay a copay. I can give \nstudy after study that reflects that.\n  The greatest overutilization of health care and prescription drugs is \nby wealthy individuals who can take all the time in a day to go to the \ndoctor's office and who have unlimited resources to pay for the \nprescription drugs.\n  Five dollars still makes a big difference to people in my State down \nin New Bedford, Fall River, and Holyoke. They have seen their water \nbills go up because of the pollution that has been done over a period \nof years, and this administration has backed out of making the \npolluters pay and is now shifting that onto the backs of those water \nusers and water rate payers.\n  They are seeing their fixed incomes dwindling gradually as they pay \nout and try to deal with those issues. They see the prescription drug \ncosts going up and the Senator is not doing anything. The Senator is \nnot talking about it. The Senator has not even talked about the \nescalation of costs. What is he going to do about that?\n  When are we going to see from the other side an amendment that is \ngoing to bring prices down? Where is it? We are waiting for it. We have \nbeen on this bill for 5 days. We have not had a single amendment from \nthat side to do something about the costs of prescription drugs--not \none. We have not had any. We have had complaints and criticisms of \nefforts that have been made on this side of the aisle to do something \nabout those prescription drugs. Now we are being asked to sign onto a \nprogram that will be presented to the people in my State, or the people \nthat could not afford it, to show that we have done something for them. \nBut this program is not as good as the one in my own State. We ought to \nbe dealing with this program for all Americans. That is what a majority \nof the Senate voted on yesterday, and almost a majority voted for the \nRepublican program. Not trying to take the small numbers of individuals \nwho are paying every single year was universal across the board.\n  I would ask the Senator, this is not a lifetime expenditure, is it? \nThey are going to have to pay $1,500 this year, $1,500 next year, \n$1,500 the year after--$1,500, $1,500, $1,500 every single year, or \n$3,500, $3,500, $3,500. Does anybody believe people on fixed incomes at \nthose levels can afford that kind of expenditure? They cannot.\n  So I hope we keep our sights higher in terms of trying to meet the \nchallenges and needs of our people.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I ask that I be notified when I have \nspoken for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I want to cover some areas of concern and \nquestions that have been addressed, appropriately so, regarding the \namendment, but let me generally make a comment in response to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  One of the results the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts is not factoring in in our amendment is the discount that \nall Medicare beneficiaries would derive. The estimates of\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\nthose discounts, which are real, which, in fact, are in existence now, \nthose discount card programs, are anywhere from 25 to 40 percent. That \nis one piece of this that has not been addressed, and it is important \nto factor that back in. That is but one part of our complete \nprescription drug program. Obviously, another part is the catastrophic \ncap.\n  I have been asked about pharmacies and how this legislation might \naffect pharmacies, because, as the Senator knows, we do not invent a \nnew bureaucracy. I am sorry to have to say that again to some people \nwho like big government, who think big is better, and the more money we \nthrow at anything always makes everything better. That is aside from \nthe debate about deficits in this country, which I hear an awful lot \nabout in this body, about irresponsible spending.\n  We do have to ask a question about the affordability. That may be \npainful for some of my colleagues but, in fact, that is reality. This \nprogram is not just about addressing what we must address--and the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts is exactly right; we need to address \nthis. For too long we have deferred it. It is not just about addressing \nthe problem.\n  The other end of that is, who pays for the program? Who eventually is \ngoing to wind up paying the bill for the program? We have tried to \ndevelop a program that focuses on those who need it most.\n  I know most people would like to have a program where they pay \nnothing; let somebody pay for it all. Well, that is not a bad life, I \nsuppose, but the reality is someone is going to pay for this. When we \nlook at the huge numbers that we are dealing with in this country today \non entitlement programs, everybody better stop for a moment and think \nthrough the consequences of what we are doing. There is a consequence \nto whatever action we take, and the consequence is going to be on the \nnext generation and the next generation, as we add a new entitlement \nprogram to Medicare.\n  We need to do this, but it must be done in some way that is \nresponsible and accountable for those who now have no say in it but we \nare saddling them with this burden. We cannot just merrily skip along \nand say, well, we have given you everything free, aren't we great, \nlet's send out a press release out and hold a press conference: oh, \nSenator Hagel, you are so good to us.\n  I have a 9-year-old and an 11-year-old. Many of my colleagues have \nchildren and grandchildren. They are the ones who will pay. When we \nlook at the numbers--Senator Gramm was on the floor yesterday, talking \nabout those numbers--they are significant. With a $2 trillion Federal \nbudget today in this country, about two-thirds is consumed by \nentitlement programs. We cannot do anything about that. The growth path \nwe are on, even if we do not add any new programs, is immense. I don't \nknow how we are going to ask this next generation and the generation \nafter that to carry that burden. Something will happen. The choices are \neither that you cut benefits at some point or you continue to raise \ntaxes on the workers, the young people, to pay for my drugs.\n\n  We have tried to accomplish some center of gravity, some responsible \nbalance in addressing the problem. It is real. We need to address it \nbut at the same time address the consequences. Who pays? That is the \npainful part of this process. Who pays? We don't like to talk about \nthat.\n  When I talk about using a market system in place, not developing or \nbuilding a new Government program, what do I mean? I mean using the \nmarket system in place. It is imperfect. Absolutely. But it is the \nmarket system in place today that has given America this remarkable \nlifestyle, quality of life, longevity. Imperfect and flawed? \nAbsolutely. Are there people who do not benefit from some of this \nbecause they are at the bottom? Absolutely; that is what we are trying \nto deal with. But do not destroy the system that has produced this \nremarkable quality of life. Why would we throw out a market system that \nworks pretty well?\n  We use the existing structure in place: Pharmacies, pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, insurance policies, systems, programs, administrators to \nadminister the program at the direction of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. Pharmacies are a big part of this. They must be a big \npart of it. In this system, we have worked with the pharmacist. We \npreserve that beneficiary/pharmacy relationship. Seniors and other \nMedicare beneficiaries will continue to get most of their drugs at the \npharmacy.\n  Any proposal that seriously disrupts that relationship would not work \nfor Medicare beneficiaries. I point this out because beneficiaries' \nrelationships with pharmacies will be strengthened. A system such as \nthis could not work without bringing in the pharmacies. There will be a \ngreater emphasis on discounts provided by pharmaceuticals and \nmanufacturers than the pharmacy discounts. It is the pharmaceutical \ncompanies that provide the discounts. Those are negotiated by the \nprivate plans at the direction of the Secretary.\n  Pharmacies would be free to choose whether or not to participate. It \nwould be voluntary. Right now, pharmacies are involved in many of these \ndiscount drug plans. They do well. It brings in traffic. They have \nconsulting fees. They are a big part of the process. Our bill would \nmake them more a part of a process.\n  Our legislation prohibits mail-order-only programs; therefore, it \ndoes not eliminate pharmacists. That is an option. Pharmacies could \ndirectly compete as administering entities. Pharmacies, as some \npharmacies do today, could administer these programs. I make this point \nbecause there have been questions raised about the role of pharmacies. \nI understand that. We have spent a lot of time listening to pharmacists \nfrom all over the country. I understand their concern. The way we have \ncrafted this, it would enhance the pharmacists.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Nevada for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I will address a couple of matters the \nSenator from Massachusetts talked about. First of all, the Senator said \nthe plan in Massachusetts was more generous than this plan. It is a \ndifferent plan in that it is a first-dollar coverage plan. I don't know \nif the numbers have been updated, but according to the report from the \nGAO, in Massachusetts, if you are 150 percent of poverty or below, you \nare covered up to a maximum out of pocket of $1,250. That is according \nto this report.\n  The bottom line is the difference is Massachusetts covers the first \ndollars, but it caps the amount that Massachusetts will pay. Our plan \ncaps the amount the seniors will pay. That is the difference. If they \nwant to do first-dollar coverage in Massachusetts--and that is what we \ndo in the State of Nevada--that is up to the State. What we want to do \nis say to the seniors, you will have the amount capped that you can \nactually pay out of your pocket so you don't end up going into poverty.\n  Why didn't the State of Massachusetts make a more generous benefit? \nThey only did it up to 150 percent of poverty. Why? Are people making \nmore than $12,000 a year rich? Can they afford some of the outrageous \ndrug costs? Of course they cannot. The reason they did that is because \nthat is all the State of Massachusetts believed they could afford at \nthe time.\n  Do what you can with the money you have. The Federal Government is \nnot unlimited in its resources. We have to be fiscally responsible to \nthe next generation.\n  Yesterday the amendment that the Senator from Massachusetts supported \nwas outlandish. It would bankrupt this country and bankrupt Medicare. I \nbelieve it was irresponsible in the long run to the next generation. \nThis bill we present today is responsible, but it provides the coverage \nseniors really need. When you combine it with the help the States are \ngiving, those low-income seniors, those sad stories we have heard, \nthose people are truly going to be helped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first of all, I ask my good friend from \nNevada to get current with regard to the Massachusetts plan. I will try \nand get current with regard to his if he gets current with regard to \nours.\n  Massachusetts residences not on Medicaid, 65 or older, are eligible.\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nEvery one is eligible. The annual out-of-pocket spending for deductible \nand copay is limited to $2,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less for \nindividuals.\n  It is a good deal different from what the Senator described.\n  I am not here to offer this as an amendment. Some States do a little \nbetter than other States. Massachusetts is clearly a good deal better \nthan what we are being offered with the amendment of Senator Hagel and \nSenator Ensign. Senator Hagel has pointed out the real problem is the \nissue of cost. Now we have cut to the bone. There are a lot of costly \nprograms. Medicare is costly. Yet this country made the decision that \nfor our elderly, who was going to try to offset the cost for frail \nelderly men and women who worked hard all during their lives? Would it \nbe the individuals who will have an average income of $13,000, and two-\nthirds below $25,000, or are we going to recognize that as a nation we \nare going to provide help and assistance?\n  We made the judgment and decision that we would do that as a country. \nWe did the same on Social Security. Many believe we ought to do it on \nprescription drugs. My good friends do not believe so.\n  What are we asking? There was a comment that some of the elderly are \nasking for something for nothing. Who are these people? They are \nparents, people who took care of everyone in this room. Asking for \nnothing? These are the people who fought in the wars. They are the \nfrail elderly, asking for nothing, who have sacrificed for this \ncountry, sacrificed for their children, sacrifice, sacrifice, \nsacrifice. And they are accused in the Senate of trying to get away \nwith something for nothing.\n  Are you asking them to give up going to the movies once in a while? \nOr taking their grandchildren out to dinner once in a while? How much \ncan you squeeze from someone with a $9,000 income? How much can you \nsqueeze them?\n  Defend the market system. Defend the market system. Defend the market \nsystem. Prescription drug companies are violating the market system by \njiggling the patent system so that there cannot be competition.\n  Why aren't we hearing something about the market system over there on \nthe underlying amendment? No, we don't hear anything about that. We \njust hear something about the frail elderly trying to get something for \nnothing.\n  What about States being able to use the power of all their people to \ntry to get a better drug price? That is the market system. We don't \nhear anything about that. No, no, we don't hear about that. We just \nhear about these frail elderly, all these greedy elderly senior \ncitizens who are trying to rip off the system. Come on. That is the \nheart of the Republican program. You just heard it out here.\n  That is what this decision is about. It is priorities, whether you \nwant to have a massive tax cut that is going to go to the wealthy, or \ndo we as a country and society put the value of our senior citizens \nahead of that. It is a value issue. And I believe it is a moral issue \nas well, as long as we can do something about it and help these senior \ncitizens. That is what the issue is about. We just heard it. We just \nheard it.\n  Somehow, we are against the market system when we are trying to stop \nthe kind of violations of patents to let competition get in? We are in \nviolation of the market system when we are trying to let States get \nbetter deals for their fellow citizens? We are against the market \nsystem?\n  Senator, that is just wrong. I do not know how much more we can do in \nterms of our senior citizens; how much more we can squeeze them; how \nmuch more, when they are paying out that 15 percent, 18 percent, 20 \npercent of their income every single year, watching their total life \nsavings go right on down. How much more can we squeeze them so we can \ngive tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals, who have had the \ngreatest profitability over the period of recent years? How much more \ncan we squeeze these men and women who have built the country, \nsuffered, and done such an extraordinary job?\n  This country has been built by our parents and our grandparents. If \nit is a great country, and it is, it is because of them. They are the \nones who are frail. They are the ones who need the help and assistance. \nAnd I reject the fact that we are trying to speak of them as \nindividuals who are trying to rip off the system and get something for \nnothing. That is not what this debate is about, and it should not be.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I came after the Senator from North Dakota so, if it is \nOK, I will take my 10 minutes after him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I joined my colleague earlier on the third \nfloor of the Capitol at a press conference to talk about the generic \nbill. That bill is very important and one about which I have held a \nhearing.\n  In terms of prescription drugs, we need to do two things that are \nimportant. We need to have a prescription drug benefit, and we need to \ndo something that puts some downward pressure on prescription drug \nprices. We must find a way to put a prescription drug plan in the \nMedicare Program, one that works, works for all beneficiaries, and \nprovides them with the ability to access the medicine they need when \nthey need it.\n  I said earlier that there is nothing lifesaving about drugs if you \ncannot afford them. There are no miracles in miracle drugs if you can't \nafford them.\n  I just heard my colleague talk about those people who helped build \nthis country. Tom Brokaw's book described some of them who went to war \nin the Second World War as ``the greatest generation.''\n  I had a fellow come to a meeting a while back, who is a member of the \ngreatest generation. He served in the Air Corps in the Second World \nWar. He was in his late seventies and he needed new teeth and didn't \nhave any money for them.\n  I arranged for a dentist and I also helped him get some teeth. Here \nis a fellow who fought in the Second World War, who ends up with \nnothing, who needs a new set of teeth and has to come nearly begging \npeople to help him get his new teeth.\n  Senator Kennedy is right. We have a lot of people in this country who \nhave needs. They reach their declining income years, their retirement \nyears, and they discover the things they need such as new teeth or \nprescription drugs, cost a fortune.\n  Senior citizens are 12 percent of America's population and they \nconsume one-third of all prescription drugs. Is it because they want to \nbe sick? Is it because they like to take prescription drugs? I think \nnot.\n  You meet them at town meetings and various locations around the \nState, and they come up to you and say: You know, Mr. Senator, I am 80 \nyears old and I have diabetes. I have heart trouble. I have to take \nseven different prescription medicines. Mr. Senator, I can't afford it. \nI don't have the money. I wish I didn't have to take the drugs, but I \nneed them and can't afford them.\n  A doctor in Dickensin, ND, told me one day about a cancer patient who \nhad breast cancer, a senior citizen. After the surgical removal of her \nbreast he told her about the drugs she was going to have to take to try \nto minimize the chance of recurrence of her cancer.\n  He said she looked at me and said: Doctor, what will these \nprescription drugs cost? And when he told her what they would cost, she \nsaid: Doctor, I couldn't possibly afford those prescription drugs. I \ndon't have the money. I'll just have to take my chances. I'll just have \nto take my chances.\n  We can do better than that. We need to put a prescription drug plan \nin the Medicare Program, one that works--one that really works. At the \nsame time as we do that, it has to be complemented by a couple of other \nprovisions we--the generic bill offered by my colleague, Senator \nSchumer and the Canadian reimportation bill, both of which will put \ndownward pressure on prices. If we do not do that, we just break the \nbank. I am not interested in breaking the bank, hooking a hose up to \nthe tank and just sucking all the money out. We can't do that. I am \ninterested in making sure we have a prescription drug benefit plan that \nworks. No, not some sliver of a plan, that says to a poor person: By \nthe way, spend a lot of your money first, and then we'll give you a \nlittle help.\n\n  No. 1, let's have a plan that works; No. 2, a plan that includes in \nit downward pressure on prices, not just for\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\nsenior citizens but for all Americans. That is why this is so \nimportant.\n  I imagine some members of this body could come up with a dozen \nreasons not to do this. In fact, the negative side of the debate is \nalways the easiest. I think it was Mark Twain who was asked if he would \nengage in a debate of some sort. He said: Of course, as long as I can \ntake the negative side.\n  When it was pointed out to him that he hadn't been told the subject \nof the debate, he said: It doesn't matter. The negative side takes no \npreparation.\n  It is easy to take the negative side. It is much more difficult to \ncome up with a positive approach. That is what we are trying to do \nhere. Yesterday, 52 Senators in a very important vote, for the first \ntime in over 40 years, said we would like to put a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare Program. Fifty-two Senators said that. It takes \n60 votes.\n  The question now is, Will the minority of the Senate block it in the \nnext couple of days? The answer is, I hope not. I hope all Members of \nthe Senate understand this is not just some run-of-the-mill issue. This \nis not just some issue of convenience. This is life or death issue for \nthose who have reached their declining income years. Those who in many \ncases are living in or near poverty and who are told by their doctor \nthey must take five or seven different kinds of prescription drugs. And \nthey do not have the ability to pay for those drugs. That is why this \nissue is important.\n  Let's do this and let's do it right. Let's not take slivers of policy \nhere or there and pretend that we have constructed something \nmeaningful. Let's put a real plan together, one that adds up, one that \nmakes sense, and one that provides real benefits.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. He spoke so poignantly of the \ndoctor in Dickinsin and the senior citizen who had breast cancer and \ncould not afford the drugs.\n  Again, I appreciate the approach that my colleagues from Nebraska and \nNevada have taken. It is an honest approach, but it is a minimalist \napproach. It is based on the theory that we do not have enough money to \ndo more, even though 52 people in the Senate voted to do significantly \nmore.\n  I would just ask my colleague this: Isn't this part of the same \nbudget where they take $600 billion over 10 years to reduce the estate \ntax? Isn't it true that estate tax reduction does not go to people \nwhose income is $17,000 or $35,000 or $350,000, but to people whose \nestates will eventually rise, I believe it is, to $2 million or $4 \nmillion? That is a minimum amount. This is not an abstract discussion.\n\n  I ask my colleague if I am right. Do you want to give somebody who is \na millionaire, who has an estate worth over $2 million, a total \nexemption from any tax and deprive patients in North Dakota their \ndesperately needed medicine? It isn't either/or. In my judgment, it is \nnot that we can't afford it. If tomorrow the President and his budget \nfriends on the other side in their budget say we are not going to make \nthe estate tax reduction permanent, there would be more than enough \nmoney to afford the plan that we voted for on the floor yesterday.\n  Am I wrong? Is this a question of choices? This is not simply an \nabstract discussion about how much we should spend. My colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have said they would like to do more, but \nwe can't afford it. But, all of a sudden, when it comes to estates of \n$10 million, $20 million, $100 million, or $1 billion, that should come \nahead of the senior citizen about whom the doctor in Dickensin talked. \nAnd we have thousands--tens of thousands--of the same people in New \nYork--poor senior citizens who are struggling and don't have the money \nfor their desperately needed medicine.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is certainly \ncorrect.\n  One-hundred years from now we will all be gone. Everyone in this room \nwill be dead. And historians will look at the choices we made in terms \nof our values and systems and evaluate what we thought was important.\n  My colleague Senator Feingold offered an amendment on the estate tax \nwhich said, let us have an estate tax and we will exempt everybody \nunder $100 million. The only estates that will bear a tax will be those \nabove $100 million.\n  That lost, because some here believe that the estate tax must be \nabolished for everybody--even those at the top who are billionaires. \nGood for them and their success. But I happen to think that when they \ndie part of their wealth should be used to help deal with some of our \nother needs.\n  The point is, as the Senator from New York pointed out, we are forced \nto make choices. What is important? What are the right choices for our \ncountry? People are living longer and living better. It is not unusual \nto find 80-year-olds. My uncle is 81 years old. He runs 400s and 800s \nin the Senior Olympics. He has 43 gold medals. It is not unusual to see \npeople living longer in our country but not all of them are as healthy \nas my uncle. Most of the elderly need prescription drugs to deal with \nmedical conditions. And many of them don't have enough income or assets \nto pay for them. They simply don't have the means to purchase them.\n  If we were writing a Medicare bill today, there is no question that \nwe would have a prescription drug benefit in that bill. It would be a \nbenefit that works--one that is thoughtful, reasonable, and helps all \nsenior citizens. That is what we ought to pass. It is not acceptable, \nin my judgment, just to grab slivers here and slivers there, and say, \noh, by the way, we can't afford much because we decided we wanted to \nhave other things such as an estate tax repeal for the largest estates \nin the country.\n  These are choices that we have to make. I believe we must make the \nright choices today and tomorrow as we go about our business on behalf \nof senior citizens and all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to my friend and colleague from New \nMexico 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, first, I thank the \nSenator from Nebraska for yielding time. Second, I compliment him and \nthe senior Senator from Nevada for offering this proposal which gives \nus a chance to do something very significant for our senior citizens.\n  Let me go back and trace a little bit of modern history so everybody \nwill know what caused the predicament we are in and why we can't do \nmuch more than this for our seniors at this point in time.\n  First, the last budget resolution that passed was a budget resolution \nwhen we were in control by one or two votes. That budget resolution \nprovided for a reform of Medicare and a prescription drug benefit that \ndid not cost more than $300 billion over 10 years. We didn't use that \nbecause the history has it that the last President got in a very big \nargument with a bipartisan committee and told them to vote with him and \nout the window went a bipartisan reform bill. It went, because the last \nPresident--President Clinton--wanted Medicare reform, but only his, \neven though he had appointed a commission.\n  There is one. Chalk that one up. Who is responsible for that one? \nPresident Clinton, without a doubt.\n  Now comes the time when we are supposed to pass a budget resolution. \nThe last time I heard it was the responsibility of the majority party \nto report one out and to take one up on the floor. They didn't have to \nreport it out but to take it up and do the business of the Senate by \npassing a budget resolution.\n  What happened in the middle of all this was that a Senator left our \nside of the aisle and joined their side of the aisle for votes and they \nbecame responsible for passing a budget resolution.\n  For the first time, since we had a Budget Act 27 years, we are \noperating without a budget. We are operating without a new budget that \nsuggests how much money the Senate wants to spend in the next 10 years \non prescription drugs. There is no current budget that says that. If \nthey would have put one in place, guess what. It would only require 51 \nvotes. That is not our fault. That is their fault. They did not do it. \nConsequently, 60 votes are required to get the seniors of America a \nMedicare bill.\n  I am not sure that some people think that is good and others think \nthat is\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\nbad. I am just stating the facts. That is the reason 60 votes are \nrequired. The seniors ought to know that.\n  That is not the Republicans. That is not our President. That is the \nDemocratic leadership here which said, That budget is getting too \ntough, let us just not do one.\n  I did 27 in my life; 12 of them as the chairman when we had to \nproduce them. We always produced them. Believe you me, they were tough. \nSome took 2 weeks. Some took 80 votes. One time we did 37 votes in a \nrow with Howard Baker sitting right at that table, all of which we had \nto win and all of which we had to fight for, because under the old \nrules you could offer almost anything.\n  Here we come at the end of the year and the leadership on that side \nof the aisle promises a Medicare bill for the seniors of America, but \nthey cannot pass one because they did not do a budget. Therefore, 60 \nvotes are required--not 51.\n  I repeat: That is not the Republicans' fault. It is not the \nPresident's fault.\n  I can vividly recall some leading Democrats when they were asked, Why \naren't we doing a budget resolution? Oh, well, one of them said, It is \ntoo hard this year. Maybe we don't need one. Now here is where we are \nas a result of that.\n  I compliment the two Senators. They have a third Senator. I am very \nlucky. I joined them yesterday. I am a cosponsor of theirs.\n  Frankly, I went with the tripartisan bill yesterday. If that had \npassed, we would be finished. But it didn't pass because it only got 48 \nvotes, or 47. It needs 60. That is a pretty good chunk of votes, \nhowever, to get you started.\n  What do I say? I look at all of this and I ask, Is there anybody who \nhas an amendment that does not require 60 votes and still will do \nsomething good for the seniors? This amendment will not exceed $300 \nbillion. I do not know the number exactly, but I am going to guess with \nyou that it is between $285 billion, $290 billion, or $295 billion. So \nthis amendment clearly only needs 51 votes. If you want to give the \nseniors something, 51 votes is all that is necessary.\n  From what I can tell, it is a very good approach to get the seniors \nsomething this year. It will take care of the seniors who are in the \nbiggest trouble with expensive drug bills. For those who have expensive \ndrug bills now, it will take care of them and all of the people who are \npoor under anyone's definition of poverty. It will take care of them.\n  What is wrong with that? About $295 billion, or $280 billion--just \nwhat the budget resolution said you ought to spend on the whole program \njust 18 months ago.\n  I thank the Senators for what I think is a rather ingenious bill. I \ndon't think it carries with it any acrimony. If the Democrats don't \nwant any bill at all, they can look right there to the seniors and say \nthis is what they are going to get.\n  The Hagel amendment does not have a 60-vote requirement in terms of \ncost because it comes in under the cost. However, it was not produced \nby the Finance Committee because they were not permitted to produce any \nbill. So it probably needs 60 votes.\n  Clearly, if we have the sufficient votes to adopt this, there would \nbe some way of getting it back to committee, and getting it out of \nthere.\n  I urge a vote for it because there is a real chance we will send the \nright signal, and set before us a way to get a bill this year.\n  I thank the Senator, again, for yielding. And I thank the Senate for \nlistening. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to address further this proposal \nbefore us. I was glad my colleague from New Mexico finally mentioned \nthat it would take 60 votes. So we are dealing with 60 votes, and 60 \nvotes, and 60 votes, because of the variety of the very technical, \ndetailed, and sometimes tortuous reasons for the Senate rules, which \nhave a wisdom to them way beyond my ken. But I would like to make a \ncouple points.\n  First, I would add to the Record, if it has not been added already, \nthe CBO estimate of the Hagel-Ensign amendment. I think last night we \nwere talking about $160 billion. Now CBO--and the Senator from New \nMexico has stated it correctly--estimates this bill costs $294.7 \nbillion. However, if the Schumer-McCain bill were added to it, it would \nreduce the cost by $13 billion to $284 billion. That is within the \nbudget resolution. My friend from New Mexico is exactly correct.\n  It is also $130 billion more than we were talking about last night. \nWith that money, the close to $300 billion, I just want to remind my \ncolleagues of who it covers and who it does not cover.\n  Again, a senior citizen, poor, with an income of $9,000, would have \nto first pay $1,500 before they would get a nickel from this bill. I \nwill tell you, $9,000 does not buy much. It buys even less in New York \nthan it would buy in Nebraska or in Nevada, but it does not buy much \nanywhere--and to ask that person to have to pay $1,500 first?\n  This amendment does nothing to take away the conundrum that poor \nsenior citizens have: prescription medicines, wonderful drugs that they \ndesperately need, or an adequate meal on the table, a plane ticket to \nsee the grandchildren maybe at Christmastime, whom they have not seen \nin 3 or 4 years. This amendment does nothing to relieve that burden.\n  A senior citizen making $18,000 now--that is not a poor senior \ncitizen, but it sure as heck isn't a rich one--would have to pay $3,500 \nbefore they got a nickel from this action. That is enormous. That is a \nhuge burden to them. Yet we are spending $300 billion for that.\n  I remember when we dealt with prescription drugs a couple years ago, \nand there was a general conclusion that if you are going to do this, do \nit right, really help people, do not bite around the edges. And this \nproposal does just that.\n  And then let's go to a senior citizen who is doing OK. They have a \n$35,000 income. They are almost never going to get benefits. They have \nan income of $35,000, and they would have to first spend $5,500 on \ntheir prescription drugs before they would get a nickel from the \namendment.\n  I think I know what is going on here. There is a demand that we do \nsomething. Everyone wants to say: I am for a bill. I would bet my \nbottom dollar, if you could get 280 million Americans in an auditorium, \nif you could get the--how many senior citizens do we have in America? \nAbout 40 million, 45 million. If you could get every senior citizen in \nan auditorium and ask, for $300 billion, should we adopt an amendment \nthat helps so few, they would say: No. Go back. Do it better.\n  And then again my colleagues will say--I will make the point again \nbecause it just gnaws at me--we don't have the money to do more.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, my good friend, knows the budget, \nstudies it. He is almost a priest of the budget, God bless him. He \nsays: We don't have a budget.\n\n  I will tell you why we don't have a budget. It is because of the \ninsistence of the other side and the White House that we continue the \ntax cuts for the very wealthy, that we can't afford in the President's \nbudget proposal--I repeat, $670 billion to eliminate the estate tax. \nMany of my same colleagues who are supporting this proposal were on the \nfloor talking about how that is important.\n  Go ask those 40 million senior citizens. Go ask the 280 million \nAmericans do they want a better benefit than the very measly benefits \nin this amendment or do they want the estate tax repealed. When? Right \nnow, if your estate is in the millions of dollars, it is taxed, but if \nit is below that, you are not taxed.\n  Ask them if they want us to say, let's say anyone with $20 million \nshould pay an estate tax, and we would get a lot more benefits in the \nbill.\n  So whom are we kidding? We know there is enough money to do this, if \nwe want to. But if we are going to play trickle down, if we are going \nto say, first, let's reduce the estate tax, and then work in the \nconfines of that, and provide some dribbles to the senior citizens, to \nthe lady in Dickinson who has breast cancer and cannot afford the \ndrugs. Whom are we kidding?\n  Where would 90 percent of the American people be? If the cupboard \nwere\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\nbare, if we had no dollars for anything else, if we needed it all for \nour war effort or for Social Security, maybe we would have to come up \nwith this amendment.\n  But when we hear the priorities of the other side are tax cuts, \nparticularly the estate tax cut, first, and then whatever is left over \nwe will sort of craft into a plan that makes someone whose income is \n$9,000 pay $1,500 first before they get a nickel from the benefit, whom \nare we fooling?\n  So the whole argument that I have heard from my good friends from \nNebraska, Nevada, and others is: We don't have enough money to do more. \nThis is fiscally responsible. Is it fiscally responsible, then, to call \nfor $600 billion in cutting the estate tax? And that, of course, is \neliminated--I need to get the right number. I know we go up to $2 \nmillion or $4 million per estate, but I think right now it is somewhere \nbetween $1 million and $2 million where estates are eliminated.\n  Whom are we kidding? We all have priorities. We have a Senate because \nnot everyone has the same priorities. We have a House of \nRepresentatives for the same reason. And our priorities are different. \nBut admit the truth. It is not that we do not have the money to do \nbetter, it is that people have other priorities.\n  I will tell you where the priorities of the senior Senator from New \nYork are. They are for a plan that got 52 votes on the floor of the \nSenate yesterday above cutting the estate tax for the very wealthy. How \nmany of you will join us in saying that? I doubt very many. And if not, \nthen the underpinning of the argument that we can't do better is false.\n  We can do better. We can pass a better bill, by rearranging our \npriorities, and telling that senior citizen who makes $9,000, you don't \nhave to wait until you spend $1,500 before you get a benefit; telling \nthe senior citizen who makes $18,000, you don't have to wait until you \nspend $3,500 before you get a benefit.\n  If this were an honest debate about priorities, then there would not \nbe a need for the minimalist plan that my colleagues have offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield my colleague from Nevada 1 minute.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to clear up a couple points the \nSenator from New York talked about. He said no benefit for somebody \nuntil they pay out-of-pocket expenses. He forgets the drug discount \ncard which will save seniors somewhere from 20 up to 40 percent because \nof volume buying. So they immediately benefit, anybody who signs up for \nthe plan.\n  Our plan fits really well--I talked about this before--with those \nState plans that are already out there. The State of Nevada has a great \nplan using tobacco money. Other plans in States work very well with our \nplan. Those seniors who need help the most will get the help under this \nplan.\n  Let's be honest about this plan. It is fiscally responsible to the \nnext generation but also truly does get the help to the seniors who \nneed it today.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Nebraska and \nNevada for bringing to the floor what is a valuable piece of \nlegislation to address the issue of prescription drugs.\n  As chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, I had not engaged in \nthis debate on the floor from the time it began several days ago \nlargely because, while it is a phenomenally important debate, it was a \nplay, a drama to be acted out and ultimately to close with no result. \nThat does not mean that those who come to the floor, such as my \ncolleagues from Nebraska and Nevada, to put forth a substantive piece \nof legislation aren't well meaning. It does not mean that at all. It \nmeans that the majority leader of the Senate set up this play with the \npurpose of never accomplishing anything in the end but to allow those \nwho wish to make a political statement and to shape themselves for the \nNovember election to have that opportunity.\n  That in itself is a tragedy in the formation of public policy. It \nallows those to come to the floor and talk about all kinds of other \nthings except that which is very meaningful; that is, a good \nprescription drug program for the seniors of America.\n  If this bill had been formed by the Finance Committee in a bipartisan \nmanner, it would be on the floor. It would receive a majority vote, it \nwould be in conference with the House to work out our differences, and \nthe seniors of America would have a drug prescription policy. That is \nnot a statement of myth; that is a statement of fact. It would not be a \ndrama; it would not be a play with all the characters hustling down to \nthe curtain call; it would in fact be an action of positive legislative \neffort to produce a bill.\n  The Senator from New York has talked about tax cuts. My goodness, \nwhat he has suggested is die and take everybody's money and put it into \na social welfare program. No, sir, not on my watch. You bet the Senator \nfrom New York and the Senator from Idaho are different people, coming \nfrom different States. I don't believe in that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not yield at this time. I do believe that people \nwho work hard all their life and build an estate ought to have a right \nto take a little of it, because it is after tax money that builds an \nestate, and they want to pass it on to their children. That is right. \nThat is reasonable. We call it the American dream. I don't think we \nought to step back in and swoop it up for the Government to spend, all \nin the name of a social welfare state. That is wrong. It is \nfundamentally un-American.\n  Debate it, if you wish. The reality is, use that as an excuse. That \nis law today. It is only an excuse not to have to face the reality of \nwhy we are here and not getting anything done.\n  The reality of why we are not getting anything done is that the \nmajority leader would not allow the chairman of the Finance Committee \nto do what he should have done at a very important time in American \nhistory, at a time when pharmaceutical drugs have become a part of the \nAmerican health care culture. The seniors of America who are living \nlonger and healthier today are finding that a very important part of \ntheir lifestyle. Medicare doesn't address that issue.\n  The Senator from New York and the Senator from North Dakota said it \nright: If we were writing a Medicare Program today, prescription drugs \nwould be in it. It would be in it, and I would vote for it, and they \nwould.\n  At the same time, we are not going to cram in a proposal that costs \nhundreds of billions of dollars, to the tune of $700 or $800 billion, \ndoesn't take effect until 2004, terminates in 2008 or 2009, and call \nthat something we want to take home and say: Look what we have done for \nyou.\n  Why not something that our country can afford, that our seniors will \nfind a reliable approach toward acquiring the necessary pharmaceutical \ndrugs to deal with their health care in a way that will not break them? \nThat is not going to be allowed to happen in the Senate in the 107th \nCongress.\n  There are 40 million-plus seniors. Put them all in one room and ask \nthem this question: Do you want a pharmaceutical drug program now? The \nanswer is: Yes, we do. We want it now, not 2004. No, we don't want it \nto terminate in 2008. Most importantly, we don't want it to bankrupt \nour country. Yes, we would pay a small deductible and, yes, we would \neven pay a small premium because a small deductible of maybe $100 a \nmonth to pay for a $400 drug bill is a right and reasonable thing to \nask.\n  The Senator from Nevada put it well when he said there are State \nprograms--that wasn't counted--that can offset the truly needy. And \nthere are many. Those who have little to no money--and there are many \nseniors in this position--could have full access. It wouldn't have to \ncome through the Medicare Program or, I should say, the Medicaid \nProgram that oftentimes is administered by the State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for 1 more minute.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senators from Nebraska and Nevada for bringing \na realistic amendment to the floor, one that could take effect now, one \nwith\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nwhich we could go home to New York or Idaho and say to our seniors: We \nhave cut your drug bills well over a half or two-thirds. You have it \nnow, not wishes 4 years from now, not wishes 3 years from now, a \nprogram that won't bankrupt the country and won't demand that those who \nhave saved and earned all their life have to give up their estates so \nthat you can live well.\n\n  That is not what this country ought to be about. More importantly, \nthat is not what this debate ought to be about. It ought to be about a \nsubstantive, affordable program that truly allows America to say to its \nseniors: We have changed the dynamics of health care from a 30-year-old \nmodel to a modern model that allows pharmaceutical drugs to be \naffordable, to be fitted into the program.\n  I strongly support the effort of my colleagues from Nebraska and \nNevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will speak for a minute. I want to make \nsome comments to my friend from Idaho. He keeps talking about, we are \ngoing to take everybody's money. No, we are not going to take \neverybody's money in the estate tax. We are not even taking most \npeople's money. We are not even taking 5 percent, the wealthiest 5 \npercent of people's money. We are taking only from people who have \nestates certainly over $1 million and probably somewhat more than that.\n  That is how this debate often gets off track. We are not saying to \nthe plumber who built up a little business: We are taking your money. \nWe are not saying to the steelworker who has a pension: We are taking \nyour money.\n  Yes, we are saying to the very wealthiest: God bless America, you \nhave made a great living, you have lived well. Are you willing, in this \nsocial compact we call America, to tell the senior citizen who can't \nafford to pay for these drugs, and it is life or death, that you have \nto keep it all--and not even keep it all, pass it all on to your heirs?\n  That is the issue. It is not everybody. It is not half of the people. \nIt is not a quarter of the people. It is not 5 percent of the people. \nWhat is driving the estate tax is the very wealthiest people in America \nwho somehow have won over the other side. But they never talk about \nthem. They say ``everybody's'' money. Not so. Then the other side of \nwhat my good friend said--he said take everybody's money and put it in \na social welfare program. The definition of what my friend said, the \nHagel-Ensign amendment, is a social welfare program. Social Security is \na social welfare program. Medicare is a social welfare program.\n  Yes, in America, we believe in those things. Back in the 1870s, we \ndid not. The life expectancy was 40 years; one out of every four \nchildren died in childbirth; people lived in slums, tenements; farmers \nwent bankrupt every year. Yes, America has changed, and it is not a \ncountry that should be run exclusively for the wealthiest people and \nyou give the crumbs to the others. We learned that in the 1890s, in \n1912, and in the 1930s. We learned it in the 1960s, and we have learned \nit since then.\n  So I reiterate my point. It is a choice of priorities. In this \ncontext, yes, you are right, as long as there is a budget deadlock--\nprimarily because we would not go along with reducing taxes even \nfurther on the very wealthiest Americans while doing nothing for the \nmiddle class--we don't have enough to do a prescription drug bill in \nthe right way. We are left debating whether we should do one that the \nvast majority of Americans would agree doesn't solve their problems.\n  So, yes, I regret that the debate has come to this. I don't think it \nis where the American people are. I think they are much more on the \nside of the bill that got 52 votes yesterday. But because of the rules \nof the Senate and, more importantly, because we don't have enough \nSenators who have the priorities I am enunciating, we will not get \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank Senators Hagel, Ensign, and \nGramm. They have put forth a plan that focuses in on exactly the \nproblem most Americans understand, which is that we have people who \nhave a high cost of drugs but simply don't have the ability to afford \nthem. They have to make difficult decisions about how to provide for \nthemselves as well as provide the medicine they need.\n  Secondly, they provide a focused attempt to help the lower income \npeople, who may not have that high of a drug cost, but even with a \nsmall amount of the prescription drugs they need, they don't have the \nresources to pay for them. This is a commonsense approach. This is a \nfocused approach. This is a good first step. It gets us very far down \nthe playing field.\n  To me, it is a little bit frustrating to see a proposal that makes so \nmuch common sense, is within the budget framework that has been worked \nout, and we find opposition to going way down the field in a proper \ndirection. Some will say no because it doesn't give us everything we \nwant, it doesn't get us the whole loaf, and somehow that is not good \nenough.\n  This is a very solid proposal. I think it is something that should \nhave very strong bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from Nebraska \nfor his leadership on this issue. I think the best proposal that has \nbeen presented to the Senate is the Hagel-Ensign proposal. It is the \nonly proposal that is rational. It is the only proposal that is \norganized in such a way as to give most of the help to the people who \nneed it the most. It is the only proposal that is affordable.\n  My strong suggestion and my recommendation to my colleagues is that \nwe adopt this proposal. This proposal basically says if you have a \nmoderate income and you have high drug bills, you are going to receive \nassistance from Medicare. A simple guideline is that if you have a \nfamily income, in retirement, of less than $23,000 a year, if this bill \ngoes into effect, you will spend only slightly more than $100 a month \non pharmaceuticals before you receive assistance. The amount that \npeople would have to spend before they hit the critical level where \nthey would receive assistance rises with people's incomes, so that at \n$46,000, you would have to spend $3,500, or about $300 a month; at \n$69,000 of income, that amount would be $5,500.\n  So what does this do? It does two things. Immediately, it provides \nassistance by setting up a program whereby we can use the ability to \nnegotiate prices. Medicare does not buy competitively. It is estimated \nthat by allowing people to choose among selections that will be \navailable through Medicare and by utilizing a purchasing cooperative, \nwhereby they will enter into an agreement with private companies to \npurchase their pharmaceuticals and find the cheapest price for them, \nevery senior will save between 25 percent and 40 percent on their drug \nbills. That benefit will start immediately--not in 2004 as the Democrat \nalternative does, not in 2005 as the tripartisan alternative does, but \nupon adoption. The other parts of this bill will go into effect as of \nJanuary 1, 2004.\n  So this bill helps everybody now, brings efficiency in purchasing \nhealth care for every senior, and provides assistance to people who \nneed it the most. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I have heard about the generosity of this plan. Well, \nI think we all can admit it is the least generous plan on the floor. \nAny plan that tells someone making $9,000 that they have to spend \n$1,500 first, I don't think most people would call generous. I would \nsay any plan that says to someone making $18,000 that you have to spend \n$3,500 before you get a nickel is not a generous plan. Again, if that \nwere the best we could do, fine. But it is not. We here on this floor \nare not in sync with the American people's priorities.\n  Go back to the issue I have been bringing up this last hour, the \nestate\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\ntax--$670 billion to repeal the estate tax only for estates of over $1 \nmillion or even more. Most of that money comes from estates of $50 \nmillion. Are you going to tell that person, you get your tax cut, or \nare you going to tell our senior citizens, you don't have to spend \n$1,500 of your $9,000 income before you get a bit of benefit?\n  My colleagues, again, this is a question of choices. We can say that \nwe will keep the status quo, that we will continue the tax cuts on the \nwealthiest of Americans. All things being equal, I would like to get \nrid of the estate tax. But if telling the senior citizens of New York \nState that they don't get a benefit before we take the taxes of people \nmaking $50 million down a few more notches, you know what side I am on. \nI ask my colleagues which side they are on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we are coming to the close of this debate. \nA couple of things need to be cleared up. There has been talk about the \nestate tax versus prescription drugs. Medicare is a program that is \npaid for out of the payroll tax. It has always been that way. \nHopefully, it will always be that way. Payroll taxes pay for Medicare.\n\n  Our amendment, we believe, is responsible. The difference between our \nbill is that the seniors pay their first dollar out of pocket for \ncoverage. The other bills, the seniors pay a portion of the first \ndollar out of pocket. The reason for that is we thought it was \nimportant to keep the senior in the accountability loop. I mentioned \nthat earlier in the debate, but it needs to be reemphasized.\n  When seniors or any other patients in health care do not have to \nthink about the financial aspects of their care, whether it is in \npurchasing drugs or in getting their health care, if they are only \npaying a small portion, they do not even think about that. But if they \nare paying the first dollars--and in our plan, if they have up to \n$17,700 in income, they will pay out of pocket $1,500--they are going \nto think about prescription drugs. This is about $120 a month.\n  Seniors with whom I have talked literally would jump at knowing they \nwould be limited to about $120 a month for prescription drugs. They \njust do not want to be bankrupt. They do not want to think they are \ngoing to lose their house. Many are concerned about long-term care, and \nthat is their biggest fear--that they have to lose everything to get \nlong-term care.\n  It is the same with prescription drugs. They do not want to lose \neverything before they are so poor that they have to go on Medicaid to \nget prescription drugs from the Government. Our amendment is basically \nlimiting out-of-pocket expenses.\n  The other misconception of our amendment is that you do not get any \nhelp if you have, say, $9,000 in income. You absolutely do. That is \nwhat our prescription drug discount card is all about. Every senior on \na voluntary basis--if they want to sign up--because of group buying, \nthis cooperative-type buying, similar to what HMOs do today, can save \nabout 40 percent. Most HMOs say you save 40 percent versus retail on \ntheir prescription drugs. Every senior who signs up for our plan would \nbe able to save up to 40 percent on their prescription drugs, \nregardless of income. Regardless of where in any of these ranges they \nfit, they save up to 40 percent.\n  When we combine that prescription drug discount card with limiting \nout-of-pocket expenses, along with what many States have done--if \nStates want to be more generous, they can be. My State of Nevada is \nmore generous. The State of Massachusetts, as we have learned today, is \nmore generous. The State of West Virginia has a drug discount card that \nis working very well. Other States have put these programs into effect. \nOur plan fits with most of the plans that are already working across \nthe country. So for those seniors who truly need the help, they will \nget it.\n  I wish to close my time today with a couple real-life examples. Doris \nis a patient. She is 75 years old. We changed her name, obviously, for \nprivacy reasons. She has an income of about $17,000 a year. This is a \nreal-life case. She is being treated for diabetes, hypertension, and \nhigh cholesterol. She is on Lipitor, Gloucophage, insulin, Coumadin, \nand Monopril. These are common medications. These are $300 in monthly \nexpenses, about $3,600 per year.\n  To compare the various plans on a real-life case, under the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy plan, the leading Democrat proposal, she would have out-\nof-pocket expenses of $2,200. Under the tripartisan plan, it is about \n$2,100. Under our plan, it is $1,700. Ours is more generous to the \nperson who is really sick, who has a low to moderate income.\n  Example No. 2: Betty is 68 years old with $15,500 per year in income. \nShe has breast cancer, not uncommon for a lot of senior women. She \ntakes morphine, Paxil, dexamethazone, Acifex, trimethobenzamide, and \nNolvadex. These cost almost $670--almost $8,000 per year.\n  Let's compare what happens under the various plans. Under the leading \nDemocrat proposal, she would pay $3,180 out of pocket. Under the \ntripartisan plan, she would pay about $2,600, and under the Hagel-\nEnsign plan, she would pay $2,150.\n  Once again, in a real-life example, the person who is sick who needs \nthe most would do better under our plan, and that is why we are asking \npeople to support this plan.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last night and earlier today the Senate \ndebated the Hagel-Ensign prescription drug amendment. During the course \nof that debate, some Members on the other side made a comparison of the \ncost of the Graham-Kennedy prescription drug amendment and the revenue \nloss of a proposal to repeal the ``sunset'' of death tax relief \nprovisions in last year's bipartisan tax relief bill.\n  The essence of the argument was that the budget effects of these \nproposals are roughly equal. As we heard many times, the Senate was \nsupposedly making a choice between these two proposals. Senator Schumer \nclaimed, during the argument, two different figures for repeal of the \nsunset. At one point, the Senator from New York claimed the revenue \nloss was $670 billion. At another point, a few moments later, the \nSenator from New York claimed the revenue loss was $600 billion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored the Graham amendment as a \nspending increase of $594 billion. This figure covers the 8-year \nproposal's 10-year budget effect. Now, if you accepted Senator \nSchumer's figures as is, then there might be some basis for his \nargument. That is, if, in fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation scored \nthe proposed permanent death tax relief proposal at $600 billion or \n$670 billion, then Senator Schumer's argument might be worth debate.\n  The facts are different. I don't know where Senator Schumer got his \nfigure. Maybe it was a liberal think tank, such as the Center on Budget \nPolicy and Priorities. Maybe it was a partisan liberal communications \nshop, like the Senate Democratic Policy Committee. I don't know where \nhe got the number.\n  I do know this: The number doesn't apply. For purposes of the \nCongressional Budget Act, tax provisions are to be scored by the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  According to Joint tax, the permanent death tax relief proposal \nscores at $43.6 billion if you use the fiscal year 2002 budget \nresolution. That is the one the Senate is currently operating under. If \nyou use the fiscal year 2003 budget resolution, the one under which the \nHouse is operating, permanent death tax relief scores at $99.4 billion.\n  So the real number is, at most, $99.4 billion, for permanent death \ntax relief. That is one-sixth the cost of the Graham amendment.\n  It is interesting to note that during last month's debate on the \ndeath tax that the Senator from New York supported Senator Dorgan's \namendment. That amendment was scored by Joint Tax as losing $111 \nbillion over 10 years. Basically, Senator Schumer voted for death tax \nrelief of $11 billion more than the proposal he criticized last night \nand today.\n  So if we are talking about choices between resources for prescription \ndrugs and death tax relief, let's review the record. Let the record \nreflect that Senator Schumer and 39 other members of the Democratic \nCaucus voted for $11 billion more in death tax relief than\n\n[[Page S7261]]\n\ntheir colleagues. For reference, that's rollcall vote No. 149. It is \nset out in page S5412 of the Congressional Record of June 12, 2002.\n  The Senator from New York's use of erroneous data on the bipartisan \ntax relief package is unfortunately part of a coordinated strategy on \nthe part of the Democratic leadership. It is also data unchallenged by \nmany in the media. In fact, many in the media parrot another of the \nDemocratic Leadership's equally erroneous statistics. We keep hearing \nand reading that the bipartisan tax relief package yielded 40 percent \nof its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. This statistic, like \nSenator Schumer's other tax relief statistics, is dramatically at odds \nwith Joint Tax, the official scorekeeper for Congressional tax relief.\n  According to Joint Tax, the bipartisan tax relief package makes the \nTax Code more progressive.\n  I make this statement for one basic reason. The issues of \nprescription drugs and death tax relief are important matters. \nCertainly every one of us hears about both of these issues when we are \nback home. They are issues that our constituents expect us to resolve. \nFolks back home expect us to be intellectually honest in debating these \nimportant matters. When we debate these issues, we ought to use \nintellectually honest figures.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Joint Committee on Taxation's \nrevenue estimate of the proposed estate tax relief and the distribution \nanalysis in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                               ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF H.R. 2143, ``PERMANENT DEATH TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2001'', FISCAL YEARS 2002-2012\n                                                                                                          [Billions of Dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Provision                                    Effective                     2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012     2002-07    2002-12\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMake Permanent the Repeal of the Estate Tax     dda & gma 12/31/10.......................  .........       -1.2       -1.5       -1.8       -2.3       -2.5       -2.7       -2.8       -4.0      -24.9      -55.8       -9.2      -99.4\n and the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

This distribution has been updated to reflect \n     changes enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation \n     Relief Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-16).\n       The first table shows the distribution of the Federal \n     individual income tax and the second table shows the \n     distribution of the Federal individual income tax, Federal \n     excise taxes, and Federal employment taxes.\n       For purposes of these tables, the income concept used for \n     classifying taxpayers is adjusted gross income (``AGI'') \n     plus: (1) tax-exempt interest, (2) employer contributions for \n     health plans and life insurance, (3) employer share of FICA \n     tax, (4) worker's compensation, (5) nontaxable Social \n     Security benefits, (6) insurance value of Medicare benefits, \n     (7) alternative minimum tax preference items, and (8) \n     excluded income of U.S. citizens living abroad.\n       The first table shows the distribution of the Federal \n     individual income tax, including the outlay portion of the \n     earned income credit (``EIC'') and the child credit. The \n     table shows, by income category, (1) the number of returns \n     and the percent of all returns represented by the category, \n     (2) the aggregate income and the percent of all income \n     represented by the category, (3) the aggregate individual \n     income taxes paid and the percent of all individual income \n     taxes paid by the category, and (4) the number of returns \n     with zero or negative tax liability and the percent of all \n     returns with zero or negative tax liability represented by \n     the category.\n       The second table show the distribution of the combined \n     Federal individual income tax (including the outlay portion \n     of the EIC and the child credit), Federal excise taxes, and \n     Federal employment taxes (those taxes required under the \n     Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Federal Unemployment \n     Tax Act). The table shows (1) the number of returns and the \n     percent of all returns represented by the category, (2) the \n     aggregate income and the percent of all income represented by \n     the category, and (3) the aggregate Federal taxes paid and \n     the percent of all Federal taxes paid by the category.\n\n                                     DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY \\1\\--CALENDAR YEAR 2001\n                                                                [Updated August 2, 2001]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     No. of returns \\3\\              Income             Individual income tax   No. of returns with zero\n                                                 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   or negative liability\n               Income category \\2\\                                                                                             -------------------------\n                                                    Millions     Percent      Billions     Percent      Billions     Percent      Millions     Percent\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLess than $10,000...............................         19.9         14.0          $83          1.0           -6         -0.7         18.9         37.4\n10,000 to 20,000................................         23.3         16.4          347          4.2          -13         -1.3         16.4         32.4\n20,000 to 30,000................................         18.5         13.0          460          5.6            3          0.4          8.5         16.9\n30,000 to 40,000................................         15.8         11.1          549          6.7           22          2.4          3.8          7.5\n40,000 to 50,000................................         13.1          9.2          589          7.2           33          3.5          1.8          3.7\n50,000 to 75,000................................         21.9         15.4        1,337         16.4          100         10.6          1.0          2.0\n75,000 to 100,000...............................         12.9          9.1        1,121         13.7          110         11.6          0.1          0.2\n100,000 to 200,000..............................         12.8          9.0        1,683         20.6          226         23.9        (\\4\\)          0.1\n200,000 and over................................          3.8          2.7        1,999         24.5          471         49.7        (\\4\\)        (\\5\\)\n                                                 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total, All Taxpayers......................        142.0        100.0        8,168        100.0          948        100.0         50.6        100.0\n                                                 =======================================================================================================\n            Highest 10%.........................         14.2         10.0        3,431         42.0          670         70.7        (\\4\\)          0.1\n            Highest 5%..........................          7.1          5.0        2,556         31.3          559         59.0        (\\4\\)        (\\5\\)\n            Highest 1%..........................          1.4          1.0        1,402         17.2          357         37.6        (\\4\\)        (\\5\\)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes the outlay portion of the EIC and child credit.\n\\2\\ The income concept used to place tax returns into income categories is adjusted gross income (AGI) plus: [1] tax-exempt interest, \\2\\ employer\n  contributions for health plans and life insurance, [3] employer share of FICA tax, [4] worker's compensation, [5] nontaxable Social Security benefits,\n  [6] insurance value of Medicare benefits, [7] alternative minimum tax preference items, and [8] excluded income of U.S. citizens living abroad.\n  Categories are measured at 2001 levels.

Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  Mr. President, this debate in which our body has engaged over the \nlast 5 days I believe has been helpful for our country because it has \nfocused on a critical need, a need to come forward with a Medicare \nprescription drug plan, a plan that is focused on those who need it \nmost and that is responsible.\n  None of the programs we have debated over the last few days have been \nperfect. The proposal that Senator Ensign and I and others have brought \nto the floor is not perfect. We were not given much of an opportunity \nto work through these issues where we normally have opportunities to \nwork through issues, and that is in committee. So we debated something \nso critical to our seniors, to the future of our country on the floor \nof the Senate. When we do it that way, we have to rush. We slam things \ntogether. There are imperfections in that process, but nonetheless, \nagain, I believe this has been an important, enlightened, educational, \nand helpful process.\n  We now have one option before us. We voted down two options \nyesterday. We have the Hagel-Ensign plan that we will vote on within \nthe hour. What this plan does is give our seniors a very significant \nbenefit. I ask: Would we really deny our seniors not only the benefit--\nthe real, practical, relevant, tangible benefit--of this program, but \nalso something maybe more important, and that is the peace of mind that \nthey will not be ruined by catastrophic drug costs? Let's again review \nquickly what this amendment does.\n  This is immediate. It can be up and running on January 1, 2004. It is \npermanent, unlike the Democratic plan that we voted down yesterday.\n  It offers discount drug card programs with 20- to 40-percent \ndiscounts for all who enroll.\n  It is affordable. Seniors pay only a $25 annual fee and then a small \ncopayment after they have reached their out-of-pocket expense level.\n  It provides catastrophic coverage. We use the market system. We do \nnot invent more government, bigger government, impersonal government. \nWe propose a real-world solution to a real-world problem with this \nproposal.\n  This bill gives our seniors the protection they need and for those \nwho need it most. I encourage my colleagues to look seriously and \nclosely at what we are proposing today.\n  It is accountable, it is responsible, it fits within the $300 billion \nbudget resolution that we passed last year for a prescription drug plan \nover the next 10 years. We are giving the seniors an opportunity for \npeace of mind and real benefits that will enhance their quality of life \nand enhance the ability for not just this senior generation but future \ngenerations to pay for their health care costs, at the same time taking \ninto consideration the generations ahead who will have to pay for this \nprogram.\n  Someone will pay for this program. We need a program, but let us use \nsome common sense. Let us find a center of gravity, an equilibrium, and \ndo it right. We believe our amendment accomplishes that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n4775.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of July \n19, 2002, at page 4935.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time is allotted for debate on \nthe conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes equally divided between the \nchairman and the ranking member.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Madam President, Senator Stevens is on \nhis way. He is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and \nhe will share the time with me. I have been informed he has indicated I \nshould proceed immediately with my statement, and he will shortly reach \nthe floor and speak on the conference report himself.\n  The Senate will then vote on the conference report for the fiscal \nyear 2002 supplemental appropriations bill. This conference agreement \nprovides critical investments in national defense, both at home and \nabroad. Let me say that again. This conference report provides critical \ninvestments in national defense, both at home and abroad. So let the \nworld know that the Appropriations Committee has acted expeditiously, \nworking with the House Appropriations Committee in conference, and that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have worked hard with their staffs \nto provide for these investments in the Nation's defense, both at home \nand abroad.\n  This agreement is the result of true bipartisan, bicameral \ncooperation, and I urge its adoption.\n  Last fall, America was in shock. The World Trade Center and the \nPentagon had been attacked. Thousands of Americans had lost their lives \nto the brutal terrorist attacks. Our eyes were opened to the new \nreality of war in the 21st century, a different kind of war. No\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\nlonger were we immune from attack on the homeland that we all love. No \nlonger did the great oceans shield our country from the violence that \nhad scarred so many nations elsewhere in the world. The danger was \nreal. The enemy was among us, not just in some foreign land on another \ncontinent. We could not ignore the massive gaps in our security any \nlonger.\n  In response, within days of the attacks, Congress adopted a $40 \nbillion emergency supplemental bill to fund our military efforts \noverseas and to protect Americans from further attacks at home. I say \nthat again. Within 3 days, Congress adopted a $40 billion--not million \nbut $40 billion--emergency supplemental bill to fund our military \nefforts overseas and to protect Americans from further attacks at home.\n  That funding helped our U.S. troops to bring the downfall of the \nTaliban, the shakeup of the terrorist al-Quida network, and the start \nof worldwide commitment to end terrorism--wherever it could end, if we \ncould end it at home, that initial funding paid for more than 2,200 \nagents and inspectors to guard our long, porous borders with Canada and \nMexico. The foreign student visa program, which has been identified as \none of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's chief loopholes, is \nundergoing a tighter tracking system because of funding that Congress \nthis body and the House included in that initial funding package.\n  Across the country, local police officers, firefighters, and \nemergency medical teams are receiving new training and equipment to \nhandle threats that, before last fall, they hardly considered possible. \nWho would have imagined that their community fire department and \nparamedics would need training on how to respond to a chemical or \nbiological or radiological attack? Bake sales and bingo nights could \nnot possibly fund terrorist response efforts. Congress had a \nresponsibility to respond, and Congress did respond. We responded \nwithin 3 days. We knew what our duty was. We knew where our duty lay--\nand we acted.\n  Federal law enforcement also benefited from the work of this \nCongress, from the work of this committee, this Appropriations \nCommittee. Because of the funding contained in the initial supplemental \nbill, the FBI started to hire hundreds of new agents. Because the \nAppropriations Committees in both Houses appropriated the moneys, more \nthan 300 additional protective personnel were hired to protect the \nNation's nuclear weapons complex. Air marshals are coming on board to \nprotect our planes. Madam President, 750 food inspectors were hired to \nensure the safety of the meals served at America's kitchen table \nbecause--and they were able to do this--because this Appropriations \nCommittees, which I chair, and which Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska has \nchaired before me, and on which he now sits as the ranking member, \nbecause this committee acted in a bipartisan way. No split; no aisle \nbetween the two parties on the Appropriations Committee. We joined \ntogether. We did not have to be told. We did not have to be ordered. We \nknew where our duty lay. So 750 food inspectors were hired.\n  These are just a few, just a few of the examples of the good work \nthat came about because of the investments, the infusion of funds by \nCongress, starting with the Appropriations Committees, because of the \ncommitment of the men and the women of this body to identify the gaps \nin homeland security and invest funds--your money, the taxpayers' \nmoney--to close those gaps.\n  In the months that followed that first supplemental, many \ncongressional committees held hearings on homeland security. In the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, Senators Stevens of Alaska and I \nconvened 5 days of hearings. They were long. They were arduous. They \nwere time consuming. They were tiring. Members heard from mayors. \nMembers heard from Governors. Members heard from county officials. We \nreceived testimony from police officers, from firefighters, from local \nhealth officials, from terrorism experts, from experts on port \nsecurity, from experts on water security and nuclear security. Seven \nCabinet Secretaries and the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, appeared before this Appropriations Committee. \nThe House Appropriations Committee did not hold a hearing. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee held a hearing. And Senator Stevens and I \njoined in selecting everyone. Everything was done in a bipartisan way. \nSo seven Cabinet Secretaries and the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency appeared before the Committee, as well as two former \ncolleagues--Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Senator Warren Rudman of \nNew Hampshire.\n\n  What we learned was eye opening. What we learned was that despite all \nof the efforts of Congress and of the men and women at the local level, \nthe task before us was massive. As a result of the incredible backlog \nof homeland security needs, one truth was clearly evident; namely, this \ncountry was not prepared. We are vulnerable today.\n  Earlier this summer, it seemed the administration issued another \nterrorist warning to the American people almost daily. Those warnings \nonly underscored the fact that the new enemy lives in our midst--here \namong us. So, as Christopher Wren would say, if you seek my monument, \nlook about you. If you seek the enemy, look about you. He is somewhere. \nHe is invisible. But he is sure in our midst.\n  So the enemy, the new enemy, lives among us, moving through our \nsociety with ease, crafting life-threatening weapons with everyday \naspects of life: Tanker trucks, postal mail, airplanes, waste \nradiological material from hospitals and energy plants. Any of these, \nand more, we are told can be fashioned into weapons to cause death, \ndestruction, fear, panic.\n  The Appropriations Committee of the Senate heard testimony that \nindicated America's adversaries could cripple the U.S. economy without \ngreat difficulty. That was one of the main objectives of the enemy. \nThey could cripple the economy, but at a far greater cost than any \ncorporate scandal even. The enemy can disrupt the economy without great \ndifficulty and at far greater cost than even any corporate scandal, and \nthe roots of a corporate scandal are running deep, as we know.\n  Yet what we do not know is the most vexing: Where will the terrorists \nattempt to strike next? And when? We may not know the answer to those \nquestions until it is too late and the attacks are upon us.\n  What this Congress has a responsibility to do is to invest in \nprotections that work to prevent attacks before they can occur, and we \nmust help to train our emergency responders to be prepared should \nanother attack strike within our border. We need to do more. We need to \ndo more now. That is why the conference report before the Senate is so \ncritical.\n  This afternoon, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is writing \nlegislation to create a new Department of Homeland Security. But that \nDepartment, no matter how well crafted, will take time before it can be \nan effective tool against terrorism. I am thankful for the fact that \nthe ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator \nStevens, sits on that committee.\n  We all know where the holes are in our protections--borders, ports, \nat our nuclear facilities, and throughout our transportation system. If \nwe know where those holes are, then surely the terrorists know, don't \nyou think?\n  We should not wait--we must not wait--for the next fiscal year or the \nnext calendar year to plug the holes in our homeland security. Congress \nand the President should make the critical investments that will \nprotect Americans now--today!--without delay.\n  This conference report makes those investments. It directs $6.7 \nbillion for homeland security initiatives, including $3.85 billion for \nthe Transportation Security Administration. Another $14.4 billion will \nallow the men and women in the Armed Services to continue to track down \nthose responsible for the terrorist attacks almost 11 months ago. The \nconference report also fulfills Congress's promise to the people of New \nYork to provide $20 billion to help them recover from the attacks on \nthe World Trade Center with a final installment in this bill of $5.5 \nbillion. The remainder of the funding will go toward other national \nemergencies including fire suppression in the West, flood recovery \nefforts in the Midwest and South, and veterans' health care. The \nshortfall in the Pell Grant program is resolved, and Amtrak, the \nnation's passenger rail service, will be\n\n[[Page S7265]]\n\nable to stave off bankruptcy, because there are $2.5 billion included \nin this conference report for Amtrak.\n  This is a balanced bill, a responsible bill, and one that I hope the \nPresident will sign. I hope he will sign all of this emergency funding \ninto law quickly.\n  Why do I say ``all of this emergency funding''? I say that because \nCongress gives the President a choice. We have stated that it is the \nCongress's position that these investments are an emergency and they \nshould be made. If the President signs this bill, he will have 30 days \nto decide whether to agree with Congress and designate more than $5.1 \nbillion in this legislation as an emergency. If he does not make the \nemergency designation, the funds cannot be spent.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor an additional time not to exceed 7 minutes and that my partner, my \nfellow Senator, my colleague, may be also allowed that time, and that \nthe time for the vote be changed accordingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Within the $5.1 billion there is nearly $2.5 billion for \nhomeland security. That includes funding for firefighters, police \nofficers, port and border security, and airport security, search and \nrescue teams, food safety, drinking water safety.\n  Let me back up just a moment. The self-imposed interruption might \ncause listeners to lose sight of just where we were.\n  So we say the President has 30 days in which to decide whether to \nagree with Congress and designate more than $5.1 billion in this \nlegislation as an emergency. If he doesn't make the emergency \ndesignation, the funds cannot be spent--I am talking about the \nPresident. If he doesn't make the designation, the funds can't be \nspent. Within the $5.1 billion--that is what we are talking about--\nincluded as emergencies, within that $5.1 billion which the President \nmust agree to if it is to be spent, there is nearly $2.5 billion for \nhomeland security. That includes funding for firefighters, police \nofficers, port and border security and airport security, search and \nrescue teams, food safety, drinking water safety.\n  If the President does not make the emergency designation, he will \nblock nearly $2.5 billion in homeland security investments. I hope that \nthe President will join with Congress in this bipartisan approach to \nhomeland security, declare these items to be an emergency, and make \nthese important investments immediately to protect the American people \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  In addition, if the President decides not to make the emergency \ndesignation, he also will block funding for the National Guard and \nReserves; election reform; combating AIDS, tuberculosis; and malaria \noverseas; flood prevention and mitigation; embassy security; aid to \nIsrael and disaster assistance to Palestinians; wildfire suppression; \nemergency highway repairs; and veterans health care.\n  These critical appropriations for the American people have been \ndelayed for too long, sometimes as a result of Administration \nintervention, and the time has come for its speedy passage and the \nPresident's signature.\n  Once again I want to thank my Ranking Member, Senator Stevens, the \nformer chairman of this committee, for his dedication, his assistance, \nand, indeed for his leadership on this bill. If it were not for Senator \nStevens, his work, this bill would not be here today. Without his hard \nwork and constant efforts, we would not be here to present this \nconference report to the Senate today. I also thank our House \ncolleagues, Chairman Bill Young of Florida and Ranking Member David \nObey of Wisconsin, for their cooperation and commitment to the well-\nbeing of the American people.\n  Between the supplemental bill last fall and this conference report, \nCongress has approved $15 billion for homeland security initiatives, \n$5.3 billion above the President's request. This legislation is a real \nvictory for the American people. It speeds protections that are so \ndesperately needed at our borders and our ports. It provides vital \ntraining for police, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel. \nThrough this legislation, Congress is making investments today that \nwill help to protect Americans from terrorist attack for many years to \ncome.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this conference agreement, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of \nour Committee, Senator Byrd, in recommending this conference report to \nthe Senate. The consideration of this conference report today in the \nSenate, following its overwhelming adoption in the other body \nyesterday, reflects the true consensus that surrounds this agreement.\n  While not an easy process, the compromises reached on this bill meet \nthe most vital Defense and Homeland Security needs facing our Nation.\n  In addition, this agreement fulfills the commitment of the Congress \nand the President to meet the needs of the victims of the attacks of \nSeptember 11 of last year.\n  While passed in very different forms by both Houses of Congress, this \nconference report adheres to the priorities submitted to Congress by \nthe President. With the funds added by Congress in the form of \ncontingent emergency appropriations, the President will have even \ngreater flexibility to address challenges not fully foreseen when his \nrequest was transmitted on March 21, if he approves the emergency \ndesignation.\n  Additional funds for the Department of Defense will address the \nmobilization of National Guard and Reserve personnel from around the \nNation.\n  Funds for port security grants and the Coast Guard will protect our \nNation's maritime commerce and trade.\n  Funds added in this bill for aids response in Africa will jump start \nthe international effort to address that scourge.\n  The House and Senate Both included additional funds to assist Israel, \nand those prepared to join Israel in seeking a permanent and lasting \npeace.\n  The conference report makes an initial down payment to respond to \ndramatic flood and fire emergencies in several states, particularly in \nthe West.\n  While many activities were reduced during the conference to meet the \nfunding limit sought by the President, and the OMB, one component not \ntouched was support for New York.\n  Governor Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg deserve our continued support for \ntheir leadership and determination to recover from the attacks last \nyear. This bill keeps our word to New York and to those officials.\n  Despite suggestions from OMB, the conferees rejected any cut to the \nfunding for reconstruction and renovation of the Pentagon.\n  Restoration of the sector of the Pentagon damaged on September 11 is \non track for re-opening on the one year anniversary of the attack--\nreally our Nation's center of military strategy. We will keep faith \nwith those who died defending our Nation at the Pentagon as well as \nthose in New York.\n  I want to commend our Chairman, Senator Byrd, and the House Chairman, \nBill Young, for their exceptional work to bring this conference report \nbefore the Congress.\n  Along with House Ranking Member Obey, I have worked to ensure \ncompletion of this bill prior to the August recess and in time to make \na difference during the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  If the President makes the certification that he has the authority to \ndo within 30 days after passage of this bill, the moneys will be \navailable to use for the contingent emergencies we have specified. The \nsooner that happens, the better it will be for our Nation.\n  But above all, I urge all Members of the Senate to approve this \nconference report and send it to the President as quickly as possible \nso it will be possible to get this money to our people--particularly to \nthe Department of Defense and all our people in uniform--by the \nbeginning of August.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise today in support of an improved \nsupplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002. I am glad to see \nthat the Senate conferees have reassessed their position and agreed to \nreduce the amount they had originally sought by more than $2.5 billion. \nThe conference report now totals $28.9 billion, which is\n\n[[Page S7266]]\n\nonly $1.8 billion over the President's request, and an amount he said \nhe would support.\n  Additionally, the vast majority of the funds will now be appropriated \nas a contingent emergency, giving the President discretion on whether \nthey should be spent, instead of forcing him to designate ``all or \nnone'' of the non-defense funding items as emergency items.\n  The bill has been improved in other areas as well, signifying a \nmarked realignment of priorities by the conferees. For example, I am \npleased that this report increases defense funding by $330.9 million. \nAlthough this is an increase over the President's request, the \nconferees used updated Department of Defense execution data to make \nmany of their adjustments. They also made rescissions to un-executable \nprograms and took back unobligated funds resulting from revised \neconomic assumptions in order to offset much-needed increases to the \ndefense budget. I note that the increase is primarily focused on \noperations and maintenance, $723.6 million, an area most critical to \nthe Department.\n  Specifically, I support increases to the Navy flying hour account by \n$140 million, the ship operations account by $225 million, the Air \nForce airlift account by $626 million, and the Army's logistical \nsupport account by $1.03 billion. These increases will go a long way in \nhelping our troops around the globe. In the procurement line, much of \nthe funding is related to purchasing advanced C3I equipment. And in the \nResearch and Development line, the conferees provided additional funds \nto upgrade existing C3I programs, increases that will be crucial to the \nsuccessful execution of our war on terror.\n  Additionally, this bill includes the American Service Members' \nProtection Act language that was proposed by both Chambers, and it \nmaintains the Senate's provision giving our military the flexibility to \nconduct operations in coordination with international efforts to pursue \nforeign nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \ngenocide.\n  On the domestic front, I would also note that the conference report \nincludes $100 million in disaster assistance for fires and floods, \nfunds that are critically important to the State of Arizona. I strongly \nbelieve that this amount of funding is still woefully inadequate to \naddress the dire circumstances surrounding the fires in the Western \nStates; however, I am confident that there will be other legislative \nopportunities in which to adequately fund these firefighting efforts.\n  While this bill has improved in many ways, I still believe it spends \ntoo much money on low-priority programs that are not truly emergencies, \nfor example, provisions dealing with another Amtrak bailout and \nnumerous non-emergency pork projects such as coral reef mapping. That \nsaid, especially given the need to support our war on terrorism, the \nmerits of this legislation now outweigh its deficiencies. Although not \nperfect, the bill deserves the support of my colleagues. President Bush \nhas asked that we get this bill to his desk before August recess. I am \nglad that we will be able to do so.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I support this important supplemental \nappropriations bill, which primarily contains crucial spending that is \nimmediately needed for homeland security purposes. I commend the \nmanagers for their efforts on it. I know that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the ranking member worked hard and \ndiligently, as did others, to complete this bill. And I know that they \nare not responsible for its delay. I am glad the bill will now go to \nthe President, and this funding can go quickly to meet urgent national \nsecurity needs.\n  I would like briefly to highlight three topics touched upon by the \nbill, items which are not the largest matters dealt with here, but \nwhich I consider to be very important. The issues are workforce \ndevelopment, disaster assistance and veterans' health care.\n  First, as chair of the Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee, \nwith jurisdiction over workforce development issues, I want to address \nthe elimination of emergency funding for job retraining services \nthrough the Workforce Investment Act, WIA, which occurred late during \nthe conference on this bill.\n  What has happened in connection with WIA programs is, I fear, just \nthe tip of the budgetary iceberg. Although confronted with severe \neconomic distress and uncertainty and record unemployment, we are being \ntold by the administration that we lack the resources for key job-\ntraining services. Having spent our surplus on tax cuts for the well to \ndo, we do not have the resources to fund services that are essential in \nhelping displaced workers train for and find new employment and in \nhelping businesses find the skilled workers they need to stay \ncompetitive in our global economy.\n  Yet investments in a skilled workforce are precisely what we need \nright now. As former Treasury Secretary Rubin recently said, to rebuild \nconfidence in our financial markets and economic system, ``[b]udgeting \npriorities should heavily emphasize preparing our future workforce to \nbe competitively productive in the global economy . . . ''\n  The irony is that additional support for WIA was in the President's \ninitial fiscal year 2002 supplemental request. He proposed $750 million \nfor WIA, including the restoration of last year's $110 million \nrescission of dislocated worker formula funds. The Senate and the House \nfollowed, both including WIA funding at lower levels.\n  But then, in the quest to reach the overall target the President and \nOMB Director Mitch Daniels set for the emergency supplemental, all of \nthe WIA funding was cut.\n  Frankly, this seems to contradict what the President is saying \nelsewhere. Just yesterday the President was quoted as saying that his \nbiggest concern about Sunday's record bankruptcy filing by WorldCom was \nthe effect on employees who lose their jobs. Well, the best thing we \ncan do for people who have lost their jobs through Enron, WorldCom, and \nthe other bankruptcies is to help them retrain and retool to find new \njobs.\n  And earlier this year when he submitted his supplemental request, we \nwere told: ``The President's supplemental budget request provides the \nurgent assistance that is needed now to ensure that affected workers \nget the assistance and jobs they need.''\n  This decision is a harsh one for the tens of thousands of workers who \nwill not get the training they need to retool their careers. Already \nthey are finding that the courses they want to take are closed or they \nare put on endless waiting lists. Workers dislocated because of the \nimpact of trade and certified to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance \nfind they are unable to get training because States have run out of \nresources and the National Emergency Grant funds that typically see the \nStates through such shortages are themselves depleted\n  It is harsh as well for businesses that cannot find the skilled \nworkers to stay competitive and take advantage of market opportunities \nto help fuel our economic recovery.\n  And it also threatens to undercut WIA's key reforms. States and \nlocalities, along with their private sector partners are now at a \ncritical stage in the process of building the new systems called for in \nWIA. Without adequate funding and without stable funding this essential \nsystems building will be undermined.\n  Moreover, all of this is happening while the new WIA infrastructure \nis being stretched to its limits with demands for services triggered by \nthe catastrophic after effects of September 11, the highest \nunemployment in years, and the continuing dislocations from the largest \nbankruptcies ever seen in this Nation's history.\n  This is why I am concerned. This is why I felt I had to speak out. I \nunderstand that we are not going to change the fiscal year 2002 \nemergency supplemental to address this problem. But I do want my \ncolleagues to understand the full impact of the decisions that have \nbeen made in this bill concerning some very important priorities. I \nurge my colleagues to reflect on these implications so that when we \ntake up the fiscal year 2003 Labor/HHS Appropriations bill, we will be \nespecially careful not to further undermine the WIA programs that are \nso critical to American workers, businesses, and our economic recovery.\n  The second topic I would like to address is disaster assistance. As a \nresult of severe flooding in Northwestern Minnesota 17 counties are \nunder a federally declared disaster: Becker,\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nBeltrami, Clay, Clearwater, Itasca, Kittson, Koochiching, Lake of the \nWoods, Mahnomen, Marshall, McLeod, Norman, Pennington, Polk, Red Lake, \nRoseau, and Wright.\n  In the 17 counties that are currently included in the federally \ndeclared disaster, 1,785 homes were damaged. In Roseau alone over 1,180 \nhomes were damaged.\n  I am pleased that the supplemental includes some much needed funding \nfor FEMA. The disaster assistance included here represents a down \npayment in terms of the assistance that the families, businesses and \ncommunities in my State will need as they move forward and begin the \nprocess of rebuilding their homes, offices and cities.\n  The Minnesota Recovers Task Force estimates that there will be over \n$85 million in disaster funding needs as a result of this spring/summer \nflooding. Of this amount, nearly $50 million will be eligible for FEMA \nfunding. That will leave approximately $35 million in recovery needs \nthat will not be covered by existing FEMA and SBA assistance programs.\n  I am working closely with my colleagues, Senator Dayton and \nRepresentative Peterson, to secure additional flood recovery funding in \nthe fiscal year 2003 HUD Appropriations bill. This funding will be used \nfor the distinct purpose of meeting unmet needs for buyouts, \nrelocation, rehabilitation, long-term recovery, and mitigation to aid \nthe business community of Roseau, MN and the surrounding counties that \nhave received a Federal disaster declaration. The funding will be used \nin coordination with other Federal, State, and local assistance.\n  While these FEMA programs are very important, unfortunately they are \nnot geared to handle agricultural losses. In Northwest Minnesota an \nextraordinary rich agriculture region now lies devastated. According to \nthe Farm Service Agency, this season's crop losses are estimated at \nmore than $267 million across 14 counties. Overall, total agricultural \nflood losses, including damage to agricultural small businesses, are \nestimated at more than $370 million.\n  That is why Senator Dayton and I introduced legislation to provide \ndisaster assistance to agricultural producers last week. This \nlegislation is a starting point to providing the needed assistance to \nfarmers, many of whom, without this emergency assistance will be driven \noff their farms.\n  I believe the supplemental appropriations bill would have been the \nappropriate place to add emergency agricultural disaster assistance to \ncover weather-related losses. However, the Bush administration \ncontinues to oppose any emergency appropriation to provide disaster \nassistance to farmers. The administration's position is that in order \nto provide any relief to family farmers who lost their crop due to a \nflood or drought, money must be taken away from commodity program \nsupports that assist other farmers. In other words, they are saying \nthat when the President signed the farm bill, that was going to be all \nfarmers could expect until 2008, no matter what.\n  That doesn't work for Northwestern Minnesota. The farm bill was not a \ndisaster-assistance bill. It is a 6-year policy to help stabilize farm \nincome and rural economies. Its funding is absolutely needed for that \npurpose.\n  We tried to include separate, emergency weather-disaster assistance \nin the farm bill, but the administration opposed that, too. They also \nopposed it when we tried to include it in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. When Congress decides to help areas affected by \nhurricanes or fires, we don't tell people to pull their emergency \nassistance out of somebody else's highway fund. Sometimes the Federal \nGovernment just needs to be there for people. The President needs to \nchange his position and help us get some assistance to Northwestern \nMinnesota.\n  Finally, the supplemental appropriation bill includes $417 million \nfor veterans health care that I requested which was included in the \nSenate's bill. These funds are critically important to the veterans in \nMinnesota. The need for services has simply overwhelmed the VA and in \nsome ways there is more of a crisis now in VA health care now than \nthere was even during the era of flat-lined budgets.\n  The $417 million for Veterans health care in this bill will mean that \nMinnesota's Network, VISN 23, will get an additional $19 million to \nreduce waiting times, keep clinics open, open new clinics, and improve \nthe quality of healthcare. This is very badly needed.\n  I want to thank Senators Mikulski and Bond on the VA-HUD Subcommittee \nespecially, because I know they fought to keep this money in \nconference, as well as Senators Byrd and Stevens. We did right by \nveterans in this supplemental.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to comment briefly about Title II, \nthe American Service Members Protection Act of H.R. 4775 in order to \nclarify the Senate''s intent in insisting on the retention of Sec. 2015 \nof that Title which was added during Senate consideration of the \nsupplemental.\n  I read with interest the remarks of Chairman Henry Hyde during House \nconsideration of the conference report on July 23. I am certainly not \nin any position to dispute his comments concerning the first 14 \nsections of Title II relating to the American Service Members \nProtection Act, ASPA, as I was not a party to those discussions. I \nleave it to the administration and to others involved in those \ndiscussions to make that judgment.\n  I do, however, know something about the intent behind Sec. 2015 as I \nwas the author of the amendment that was ultimately included in the \nSenate passed version of ASPA. A review of the Senate debate makes \nclear that I was offering the second degree amendment because of my \nconcern with respect to the complexity of the House passed language \nwhich was offered as a first degree amendment by Senator Warner. As \nwritten, I was concerned that it unduly restricted the ability of the \nPresident to cooperate with international efforts to bring to foreign \nnationals accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity to \njustice if he chose to do so.\n  Sec. 2015 makes clear that regardless of the other sections contained \nin Title II, the President is not prohibited from rendering assistance \nto any such international efforts, including to the International \nCriminal Court. An amendment to exclude cooperation with the ICC was \nproposed during the conference on H.R. 4775, but was rejected by the \nconferees. Therefore, as the language now stands the President has the \ndiscretion to cooperate with any and all international efforts to bring \nsuch criminals to justice.\n  I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to clarify an important \naddition to the House version of ASPA.\n\n\n       FUNDING OF HUMANITARIAN GOODS THROUGH COMMERCIAL SHIPPING\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the supplemental provides language \nsupporting the shipment of humanitarian supplies to poor nations. My \nfriend from Alabama was the initiator of this language and I was hoping \nhe could provide the Senate with more information on this topic.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would be glad to discuss the \nnational Forum Foundation's TRANSFORM Program. With the help of my good \nfriend from Alaska, I offered an amendment to the supplemental that was \naccepted by the Senate. I understand that it was modified during \nconference--but will now permit organizations, such as the National \nForum Foundation's TRANSFORM program, to receive the much needed \nauthority to receive funds to pay for administrative expenses.\n  TRANSFORM began 3 years ago as a natural extrapolation of the Denton \nProgram. The Denton Program allows U.S. Air Force Transport aircraft \nunder the control of CINCTRANS to deliver overseas on a space available \nbasis, humanitarian aid donated by 501(c)(3) charity organizations.\n  In analyzing the transportation of humanitarian aid, the National \nForum Foundation has learned that commercial ships have 2000 times the \nspace than our Air Force aircraft and with the export-import imbalance, \nare usually relatively empty departing our ports.\n  The TRANSFORM program brings the 501(c)(3) charitable organizations, \nwhich collect and wish to distribute these goods, to the commercial \nshipping lines willing to carry them space-available. The charity has \nto be indoctrinated to conform to the loading dates and times, port \nlocations and the\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\nspecific loading manner required by the ship-line. TRANSFORM exercises \nspecial means to ensure no delays in ports or customs issues.\n  Finally, TRANSFORM's system has a leverage of 250-1 meaning that for \nevery dollar of its budgetary expenses, TRANSFORM gets $250 to needy \nrecipients.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, may I make an inquiry to my friend from \nAlabama? Is it correct that the TRANSFORM program recently gained \nglobal recognition of its activities at a transportation conference \nhosted by USAID? I understand that in speaking of its activities, the \nWorld Food Programme's representative praised the program and offered \nit the use of spare space on their ships. This spurred others to offer \ntheir vessels--such as American President Line, Maersk and CSX.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My friend from Alaska is correct. And I must commend \nhim for the work that he did with the help of the House foreign \nOperations Subcommittee on this issue. The conferees were able to \nensure that organizations that are working for the benefit of \ndeveloping communities on behalf of the United States government and \ncharitable organizations receive the assistance they need to execute \ntheir much laudable goals. I am very grateful to him for this support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am optimistic that the larger this program becomes, \nthe more humanitarian aid will be delivered to those in need around the \nworld. Gain, I thank my friend for bringing this amendment and look \nforward to its future success.\n  (At the request of Mr. Stevens, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I commend Senators Byrd and \nStevens and the entire Appropriations Committee, as well as the \nleadership of Senators Warner and Miller for ensuring that American \nsoldiers, sailors, aviators and marines will not be subject to the \njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). (I, \nunfortunately, could not be here to offer an amendment on June 6 as I \nwas recovering from surgery to replace a valve in my heart.) With \ninclusion of the American Servicemembers Protection Act, ASPA, in the \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill we can all be proud that the \nCongress put these brave men and women at the top of our priority list.\n  During Senate action on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill, Senator Warner offered a unanimous consent request to include \nsection 2015 in ASPA as generous gesture in the face of concerns raised \nabout the spirit of the legislation. I have been assured by Senator \nWarner that he did not intend to limit in any way the applicability of \nthe bill or the binding nature of its substance. The hortatory nature \nof section 2015 was plain at the time it was adopted, and confirmed by \nthe fact that, during debate shortly before ASPA was overwhelmingly \napproved, no Senator uttered a word--not a single word--to suggest that \nsection 2015 made any substantive change to ASPA whatsoever.\n  Section 2015 was not part of ASPA language negotiated with the \nAdministration. It merely reiterates that ASPA applies only to the \nInternational Criminal Court. It does not apply to other international \nefforts to bring to justice foreign nationals accused of genocide, war \ncrimes, or crimes against humanity.\n  Section 2015 must be read in line with ordinary canons of statutory \nconstruction. Our courts have long affirmed that in interpreting laws \nthe specific controls the general unless otherwise provided. There are \nmany very specific provisions in ASPA about what is permitted and what \nis forbidden regarding the International Criminal Court. Had the Senate \nwished to weaken ASPA's restrictions through section 2015--thereby \nweakening its protections for American servicemembers--it would have \nhad to amend them, strike them, or not withstand them directly. \nHowever, this would have been completely inconsistent with the plain \nlanguage of the legislation, and the intent of its supporters.\n  The full text of sections 2004, 2006, and 2011, along with other \nprovisions of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, was adopted \nby the Senate by a vote of 78-21 when I offered an amendment to the \nDefense Appropriations for fiscal year 2002 bill on December 7, 2001. \nWhen Senator Warner offered these same provisions as an amendment to \nthis supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate had essentially the \nsame debate it had on December 7th of last year. No Senator suggested \nthat section 2015, which was included by voice vote during the final \nminutes of debate, was intended to alter the legislation that passed \nthe Senate previously. The final vote in favor of the ASPA amendment, \n75-19, reflected complete uniformity with the December 7, 2001 \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the conference agreement includes \nbill language recommending that $1 million should be provided by the \nAdministration for programs and activities which support the \ndevelopment of independent media in Pakistan. This action was taken by \nthe conferees in recognition of the important role independent media \nwill play in improving democracy in Pakistan. I am aware of the \nexcellent work that has been done by Internews in this area and urge \nthat their experience be used in the development of this project.\n  I also want to note that the agreement includes report language \nencouraging the United States Agency for International Development and \nthe Department of State to provide $1 million for programs and \nactivities that provide professional training for journalists from the \nMiddle East. My colleagues and the Administration should know that \nInternews and Western Kentucky University have jointly conducted \nsimilar training for journalists from Indonesia and Southeast Asia. \nThis has been a very successful partnership, and I expect that funding \nprovided in the supplemental bill will be used to expand these efforts \nto the Middle East, particularly Egypt.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today deeply \ndisappointed by the outcome of the final agreement on the supplemental \nappropriations bill, which deleted the Senate recommendation of \n$400,000,000 for dislocated worker assistance under the Workforce \nInvestment Act.\n  I know that to break the impasse with OMB to get this supplemental \nenacted, with vitally important items for national defense and homeland \nsecurity, the leadership of the House and Senate had to agree to reduce \nthe overall size of this supplemental. Our leadership was hard-pressed \nby the administration to accept unpopular cuts. Sadly, the final \nagreement eliminated all supplemental funding for dislocated worker \nassistance.\n  Most disturbing was the elimination of the $110,000,000 component \nwhich had been requested by the administration, and included in both \nHouse and Senate versions of the supplemental, to restore last year's \nrescission of dislocated worker funding. This rescission was enacted \nwhen it appeared there was sufficient unspent carryover funding in a \nbrandnew workforce system, and Congress needed to offset an emergency \nsupplemental for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance. Since that time, \nspending by local workforce agencies has accelerated, while the \neconomic downturn has resulted in a continuing, nagging rise in \nunemployment. In the last year, more than 2 million workers have lost \ntheir jobs.\n  Fortunately, July marks the beginning of a new program year under the \nWorkforce Investment Act, and $1,549,000,000 in new dislocated worker \nfunding will be available for the next 12 months. Of this amount, the \nlaw provides that the States receive $1,239,200,000, or 80 percent, \nwith the remaining $309,800,000 available for the Secretary of Labor to \ntarget areas particularly hard hit by mass layoffs. Nevertheless, I am \nfearful that the deletion of supplemental funding will send the wrong \nmessage to local sponsors of job training projects that will cause them \nto slow down spending of funds that are so desperately needed by the \ngrowing numbers of dislocated workers. As chairman of the Labor-HHS-\nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, I intend to do my best to send a \nstrong message that Workforce Investment Act funding will be maintained \ndespite the attempt of the President to slash more than $500 million \nout of the fiscal year 2003 budget. At my recommendation, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has fully restored these proposed cuts in the \nfiscal year 2003 budget, recommending a total of $5,633,364,000 for job\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\ntraining for the program year beginning in July of 2003. We rejected \nthe President's proposal to cut dislocated worker assistance by \n$177,500,000, maintaining the appropriation at $1,549,000,000. We also \nfully restored the President's proposed cuts of $362,000,000 in youth \njob training programs, recognizing that young adults, ages 16 to 24, \nhave been disproportionately affected by the decline in total \nemployment over the past year. I wish we could have done more, but our \nsubcommittee's allocation was extremely tight.\n  In conclusion, let me say I am not at all satisfied with the level of \nresources devoted to employment and training services, and I intend to \nwork with my colleagues to explore every means to further augment \nassistance for the more than 8 million Americans who are now \nunemployed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nconference report for the Supplemental Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2002. When we debated the Senate version of this bill in June, I \nstated my strong opposition to any item included that was not for the \nstated purpose of the bill: the ``further recovery from and response to \nterrorist attacks on the United States.'' As I said before, using the \nguise of responding to the terrorist attacks of September 11th to spend \nfederal funds on items that obviously have nothing to do with fighting \nterrorism is war profiteering.\n  The conference report before us today contains $28.9 billion in \nfederal spending. That is about $1.8 billion over the President's \nbudget request of $27.1 billion--a request, I might add, he made over \nthree months ago--but at least it is lower than the $31.4 billion in \nthe Senate-passed bill.\n  Even so, I have reviewed the conference report to determine whether \nthe bill contains items that are low-priority, unnecessary, wasteful, \nor have not been appropriately reviewed in the normal, merit-based \nprioritization process. I understand that some of these provisions may \nbe meritorious, or included in unfunded priority lists for certain \nagencies. However, I have listed them because they were not requested \nby the President or should not be considered an ``emergency'' for \nfunding purposes on this bill or are unrelated to our war on terrorism \nand should be considered for funding in the regular appropriations \nprocess. All told, I have identified approximately $5 billion in such \nspending in the conference report.\n  Before I proceed, I want to especially commend the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, Mitch Daniels, for his valiant charge \nto reign-in the free-spending ways of Congressional appropriators. In \nthis town, the louder the opposition gets, the more sense you are \nmaking, so keep up the good work Mr. Daniels--and let them howl.\n  In the absence of a Senate-passed budget resolution, we need fiscal \ndiscipline now more than ever. Where we once saw surpluses as far as \nthe eye could see, now we have mounting deficits, a national debt clock \nthat is again ticking, and both houses of Congress voting to raise the \ngovernment's debt limit by $450 billion. You don't have to be a five-\ntime Jeopardy winner to grasp the bottom line: With the tremendous \ndemands on the federal budget today and with the coming retirement of \nthe Baby Boom generation, we must be even more prudent about where we \ndevote limited taxpayers' dollars.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government is \nrunning a deficit of $122 billion for the first nine months of this \nfiscal year, a sharp reversal from the $169 billion surplus recorded \nfor the same period a year ago. And the Office of Management and Budget \nrecently unveiled their mid-year review of the budget showing that \nthere will be a $165 billion deficit for the entire fiscal year. It \ndoesn't take an Nobel Prize-winning economist to conclude that at the \nrate we are increasing spending, this sizable deficit will increase \nproportionately in the years to follow.\n  It is unfortunate that in a time of war, my colleagues cannot curb \ntheir appetite for non-emergency, wasteful spending. At this moment, \nthe national interest must prevail over politicians' parochial \nconcerns. Unfortunately, as this conference report and the recent Farm \nBill attests, this message has still not gotten through to Congress.\n  For example, the recent Farm Bill contained an astounding $83 billion \nabove the baseline in new spending for farm programs. This increase \nbrought the total level of spending in the legislation to a mammoth \n$183 billion for the 10-year life of that bill. It ranks amongst the \nmost expensive in recent history for farm legislation. As has been the \ntrend of previous farm bills, this legislation lacked any payment \nrestrictions to prevent most of the subsidy funding from continuing to \nbenefit large farms and agribusinesses. Widely available information \nhas also shown the overwhelming disparity of farm payment \ndistributions. The General Accounting Office has shown that over 80 \npercent of farm payments primarily benefited large and medium-sized \nfarms. Other studies have similarly found that the top 10 percent of \nbig farmers and agribusiness consumed about 80 percent of farm \nbenefits, leaving small farmers out in the cold. And yet, despite the \nevidence of the great inequity in distribution of the farm payments and \ntheir whopping price tag, the Senate passed it by a vote of 64-35.\n  Now the bulk of the supplemental conference report does contain \nprovisions that have been designated as emergencies in response to the \nterrorist attacks of September 11th, but the story doesn't end there, \nMr. President. Can anyone say with a straight face that everything in \nthis conference report, which is officially titled the ``2002 \nSupplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery From and Response \nTo Terrorist Attacks on the United States,'' is directly related to the \nbill's stated purpose?\n  There is a long list of items under the Commerce Committee's \njurisdiction that were not requested by the President or have been \nearmarked.\n  I am particularly concerned about the funding allocation and \ndirectives made by the appropriators with respect to the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, TSA. The funding level provided falls short of \nthe President's request for $4.4 billion. Further, the conference \nagreement would take away the TSA's flexibility to allocate the funds \nto areas its considers to be transportation security priorities and \ninstead earmarks nearly $1 billion for expenditures considered \nimportant to the appropriators.\n  While these directives may not sound unreasonable, much of the \nfunding is being directed toward unauthorized programs. How do the \nappropriators know if these are the most important transportation \nsecurity priorities and that the level of funding they provided is \ncorrect?\n  The conference report goes so far as to prohibit TSA from using \nfederal funds to recruit or hire the personnel the Administration says \nit needs to meet the statutory directives in the Aviation Security Act, \nincluding the directive to, by year end, inspect all baggage. If we do \nnot give them the resources, how can we possibly expect the TSA to meet \nits statutory directives?\n\n  Yesterday, Secretary Mineta testified before the House Aviation \nSubcommittee expressing grave concerns over the fact that TSA is not \nbeing provided its full request and that the earmarks will have a \nserious impact on TSA's ability to meet its statutory obligations with \nregard to baggage screening and other directives. Specifically, \nSecretary Mineta said in his prepared statement:\n\n       The Administration's Emergency Supplemental request was the \n     amount we needed to do the job. No more, no less. Last \n     Friday, the appropriations Conference Committee voted to cut \n     $1 billion from the $4.4 billion requested by President Bush \n     and to impose new restrictions on our ability to get the job \n     done. Here are five facts about the Conference report:\n       First, it eliminates $550 million off the top; second, it \n     sets aside $480 million in a so-called contingency fund that \n     may not be available to TSA; third, it imposes $445 million \n     in numerous earmarks not requested or supported by the \n     Administration; fourth, it limits the total number of full-\n     time TSA employees to 45,000--at least 20,000 employees short \n     of what TSA needs to meet its statutory mission; and finally, \n     report language severely restricts my discretionary authority \n     to manage TSA.\n       In short: TSA's budget was cut by at least $1 billion, \n     possibly up to $1.5 billion. That is a whopping 34 percent \n     cut from the President's request.\n       Here is the dilemma Congress has created. You have not yet \n     changed TSA's mission,\n\n[[Page S7270]]\n\n     yet the budget to do the job is apparently on the way to \n     being radically diminished while new restrictions and \n     mandates are being imposed. What can be done? The amount of \n     money Congress is about to approve simply will not support \n     the mandates and timetables for aviation security that \n     Congress set last Fall for TSA.\n       Less money with no flexibility means fewer TSA employees, \n     less equipment, longer lines, delay in reducing the hassle \n     factor at airports, and/or diminished security at our \n     nation's airports. Frankly, these conflicting signals sent by \n     Congress have forced us to regroup and revise the TSA \n     business plan. That will likely take several more weeks. It \n     will involve complex negotiations, and a review of literally \n     thousands of TSA commitments and plans.\n\n  These are not my words. These are the words of the Secretary of \nTransportation. I hope my colleagues pay close attention to the \nSecretary's concerns. When the TSA is unable to meet its statutory \ndeadlines and fully address critical security issues, we should all \nknow it will largely come back to this funding measure.\n  Other questionable provisions regarding the TSA should also be \nmentioned. For example, in the Statement of Managers, the appropriators \nhave earmarked money for the field testing of a particular security \ntechnology referred to as Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (PFNA). There is \nonly one company that has developed this technology: Ancore Corporation \nof Santa Clara, California. Unfortunately, earlier this month, the \nNational Research Council (NRC), concluded that PFNA is not ready for \nairport deployment or testing. Even though the main role for PFNA is \nthe detection of explosives in full cargo containers, the appropriators \nare directing money for field testing on checked bags. This earmark \ncould be a total waste of critical research money that should be \ncontributing to our effort to increase aviation security.\n  Further, the Statement of Managers directs that the TSA ``be \nattentive to the needs'' of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, \nAnchorage International Airport, and Kansas City International Airport \nwhen allocating resources provided above the Administration's request \nfor the costs of physical modifications of airports for installing \nexplosive detection systems. This directive is just another thinly \nveiled attempt at earmarking. I am sure there are many airports that \nhave significant needs in terms of physical alterations that must be \nmade to permit the effective use of bomb detection machines. We should \nnot elevate three airports for special attention. The TSA should be \nattentive to the needs of all airports and should have the flexibility \nto establish priorities on how best to meet those needs.\n  I note that the conference report would take $150 million out of the \nAirport and Airway Trust Fund to reimburse airports for costs \nassociated with new security requirements imposed on or after September \n11. Let me point out there is no statutory authorization to use the \nTrust Fund for such purposes, nor was this funding requested by the \nPresident. While I'm not opposed to reimbursing airports, if it is for \nemergency purposes it should come out of the General Fund, as was \nauthorized in last year's aviation security bill. Once again, the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee is being circumvented.\n  It comes as no surprise that there is funding in the bill for Amtrak \n$205 million to keep Amtrak operating through September. We all know \nAmtrak is again in financial crisis, nearly $4.6 billion in debt. \nAmtrak's independent accountant concluded this year--after 31 years of \nlosses--that a company that loses over a billion dollars annually is \nnot a going concern. Imagine. The upshot is that Amtrak hasn't been \nable to access a line of credit from its banker, so once again, \nCongress must make up the shortfall.\n  I accept, although reluctantly, that Congress must provide \nassistance. It would not be in the best interest of the country for \nAmtrak to shut down its entire system in the next few weeks, \nparticularly since Amtrak has not prepared any type of contingency plan \nto keep its corridor trains, which are paid for by the states, and \ncommuter operations, which are also paid by the states, in operation \neven if it were to shut down its intercity service. But I regret that \nthe conferees opted to give more money directly to Amtrak in the form \nof a straight appropriation.\n\n  After providing a $100 million loan earlier this month, the \nAdministration requested that it be allowed to provide Amtrak another \nloan in the amount of $170 million. By providing a loan rather than a \ngrant, the Administration could better control how the funds are used \nand at least try to protect the interests of the American taxpayers. \nInstead, Amtrak is being given another infusion of cash without any \nreal restrictions on how it is spent.\n  Not only are we not holding Amtrak and its Board of Directors \nresponsible for the current crisis, we're not even making an attempt to \nensure these funds are spent wisely. I question the need to expend \nemergency funds for planning a new route to Las Vegas or investing in \nhigh-speed rail projects when the Northeast Corridor has a capital \nbacklog of over $5 billion and the tunnels under New York's Penn \nStation need $1 billion in safety and reliability improvements. But \nAmtrak is spending its emergency funds on the Las Vegas route and other \nprojects that sure don't sound like emergency expenditures to me.\n  While I support the intent of the conferees to ensure that Amtrak \nprovides Congress the same information it is now required to supply DOT \nas a condition of its $100 million loan, I believe this information \nshould also be coming to the authorization committees, not just the \nappropriators. The Senate Commerce Committee and the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee are responsible for setting \npolicy with respect to Amtrak not the Appropriations Committees.\n  Perhaps one of the more egregious provisions in the conference report \ndeals with earmarked highway projects. My colleagues may recall the \nenormous controversy raised late last year when the appropriators took \nthe unprecedented action in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Bill in \nwhich every state lost a portion of their highway funding that was to \nbe allocated by formula under the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century, TEA-21. The appropriators redirected the states' formula \nfunding to projects primarily in the appropriators' home states. Well, \nthey are at it once again.\n  The conference report includes language making eligible 49 projects \nearmarked in the FY 2002 DOT Appropriations Bill that, under TEA-21, \nare not eligible to receive the earmarked funds. It is very troubling \nthat the authorizing Committee of jurisdiction is not more concerned \nabout maintaining the integrity of the multi-year highway funding \nformula law. Even more than I, the members whose states lost the \npredominant share of their formula and RABA funds to projects in the \nappropriators' states, should be vehemently objecting to this latest \noverreach.\n  Does anyone even know how their state fared as a result of the \nappropriators' handiwork last year? Of course, it should come as no \nsurprise that the big winner was the state of West Virginia, which \nreceived $96.7 million in highway funding earmarks through the funding \nre-directives. This is followed by Kentucky which received $70 million; \nWashington which received $61 million; Mississippi which received $60.7 \nmillion; and Alabama which received $60.6 million.\n  Compare this to other states, such as Delaware, which received \n$100,000 but suffered a reduction of its formula funds of $2.496 \nmillion. Many other states also took substantial hits because of the \nappropriators' funding redirection efforts, including:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          Cut in Formula/\n                  State                    New Earmarks     RABA funds\n                                            (millions)      (millions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWyoming.................................             +$1         -$4.387\nGeorgia.................................            +8.2           -22.4\nMichigan................................           +17.3         -21.397\nNew Jersey..............................           +16.1         -18.153\nNorth Carolina..........................           +15.9         -17.598\nNorth Dakota............................            +2.9          -3.684\nOhio....................................           +20.5         -24.624\nOregon..................................          +7.750          -9.815\nPennsylvania............................          +13.97         -40.325\nTennessee...............................           +10.6         -16.656\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  I will ask at the end of my remarks that two charts showing the \nwinners and losers based on information provided by the Federal Highway \nAdministration be printed in the Record. I will also include the list \nof the projects being deemed TEA-21 eligible projects in the conference \nreport.\n  The conference report would also ensure funding distributed under the \nhighway trust fund for the upcoming fiscal year will not be reduced by \nthe\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\nstatutory requirements under TEA-21 to adjust the program based on \nadjustments to the revenue aligned budget authority provisions of the \nAct. Instead of following the law, the conference report provides for \nan additional $4.4 billion over the President's budget request for \nfiscal year 2003. I think all of us have known this funding would be \nprovided even though the President's budget request actually fulfilled \nthe requirements that so many members voted for when TEA-21 was passed \nin 1998. But why does this provision need to be included in this \nemergency supplemental legislation?\n  With respect to funding provided for the Coast Guard, the conference \nreport directs $12.1 million, above the President's request of $26 \nmillion, to acquire, repair, renovate or improve vessels, small boats \nand related equipment. The Statement of Managers further indicates the \nfunding shall be used for the procurement of additional 87-foot \nBarracuda class coastal patrol boats. The conference report further \ndirects $200 million, not requested by the President, to acquire new \naircraft and increase aviation capability; and $50.171 million above \nthe President's request of $12 million, for shore facilities and aids \nto navigation facilities. Unfortunately, we are provided little other \ninformation to explain the purpose of these funds. $200 million is a \nsignificant funding level and we have no clear understanding of this \nprovision.\n  The conference report provides $33.1 million over the President's \nrequest for ``Scientific and Technical Research and Services'' for \nemergency expenses resulting from new homeland security activities and \nincreased security requirements of which $20 million is for a cyber-\nsecurity initiative.\n  It is also worth noting that a provision pertaining to the Advanced \nTechnology Program at the Department of Commerce was also included. The \nsupplemental bill would change the program which currently imposes a \nceiling of $60.7 million on the amount of new grants that can be \nawarded by the end of the fiscal year, to establishing a floor of $60.7 \nmillion that can be awarded in new grants by the end fiscal year 2002. \nThe President did not request this change and why it is necessary, I do \nnot know.\n  The conference report also includes $400 million for election \nadministration reform, contingent upon completion of the ongoing \nconference on election reform legislation. Since it is highly unlikely \na conference agreement can be reached before the August recess, I \nquestion why we need to include this funding in this emergency \nsupplemental measure. Instead, we should appropriate the funding upon \ncompletion of the conference report and as part of the Fiscal Year 2003 \nAppropriations process.\n  The conference report would provide so-called technical corrections \nfor the Fisheries Finance Program Account. Specifically, it would \nauthorize up to $5 million for Individual Fishing Quota Loans and up to \n$19 million for traditional loans under the direct loan program \nauthorized by the Merchant Marine Act of 1926. As I mentioned when the \nSenate considered the supplemental in June, these are authorizations \nwhich have not been considered by the Senate Commerce Committee. \nFurther, with some limited exceptions, Individual Fishing Quota \nPrograms are not allowed under current law. Therefore, this funding \nwill only help fisheries where a Quota Program already exists, such as \nthe halibut fishery in Alaska.\n  The conference report also amends the Oceans Act of 2000 to extend \nthe deadline for the Ocean Commission's report by an additional 11 \nmonths. The Oceans Act of 2000 was drafted in the Commerce Committee \nand any amendments should start there, yet we were not even consulted \non this provision.\n  The conference report directs $2.5 million of funding provided in the \nCommerce, Justice State Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2002 to now \nbe dedicated to conducting coral mapping in the waters of the Hawaiian \nIslands. We debated this issue on the floor in June. While my amendment \nto strike the earmark failed, that doesn't mean the funding proposal is \nmeritorious. This directive was not requested by the President and the \nfunding would be earmarked for the National Defense Center of \nExcellence for Research in Ocean Sciences.\n  The conference report also includes $2 million to address what the \nappropriators call ``critical mapping and charting backlog \nrequirements'' and $2.8 million for backup capability of the National \nOcean and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, satellite products and \nservices. None of this funding was requested by the President and even \nthough it falls within the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, again we were not consulted. Moreover, this funding has no \nrelation that I can see to address emergency homeland security needs \nwhich is the purported purpose of this bill.\n  The conference report also includes a total of $11 million for \neconomic assistance to New England fishermen and fishing communities. \nThis funding was not requested by the President, although I understand \nit is in response to unforeseen circumstances resulting from a federal \ncourt order which restricts the number of days that fisherman can fish. \nThe Statement of Managers then earmarks that funding based on the \nSenate report, as follows:\n  Maine, $2 million; New Hampshire, $2 million; Massachusetts, $5.5 \nmillion; and Rhode Island, $1.5 million.\n  The conference report places a limitation on apparel articles that \nare eligible for preferential treatment under the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, CBI, and the Andean Trade Preferences Act, ATPA. Under this \nprovision, all dyeing, printing, and finishing of knit and woven \nfabrics must take place in the United States in order for nations under \nCBI and ATPA to benefit from reduced-rate treatment.\n  This measure is one in a series of protectionist actions recently \nundertaken by the United States. The U.S. textile industry has carved \nout a protective shell around itself to avoid competition at all costs. \nIn this case, the Caribbean Basin and the Andean region nations are the \nvictims along with American consumers.\n  Due to recent political and special interest pressures, House \nappropriators inserted this protectionist provision into the \nsupplemental limiting the dyeing, printing and finishing of certain \napparel articles to United States manufacturers, with no objection from \nthe Senate appropriators. Caribbean nations received greater access to \nthe United States' apparel market through the Caribbean Basin Economic \nRecovery Act. This law granted the Caribbean Basin nations similar \nprivileges as those afforded Mexico under the North American Free Trade \nAgreement, NAFTA.\n  This provision will scale back the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \npreventing their growing industry access to the U.S. apparel market. In \naddition, it would preclude the Andean Trade Preferences Act, ATPA, \nbeneficiary nations from entering the apparel market to begin with.\n  Moreover, this is yet another example of the appropriators \nlegislating on an appropriations bill. While a trade bill that would, \namong other things, extend and expand the expired ATPA, sits mired in \nconference, the appropriators have reached their own conclusions \nregarding provisions of that bill which would hopefully allow Andean \nbeneficiary nations greater access to U.S. apparel markets. Despite a \nletter objecting to the actions of the appropriators from the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, the Committee that \nholds jurisdiction over ATPA, this provision remained.\n\n  This is an unfortunate turn of events that is becoming all too \ncommon: Leaders of the U.S. rhetorically expounding their commitment to \nfree trade while actively pursuing protectionist policies.\n  The reorganization of our armed services was, of course, an extremely \nimportant subject before September 11th, and it is all the more so now.\n  In the months ahead, no task before the Administration and the \nCongress will be more important or require greater care and \ndeliberation than making the changes necessary to strengthen our \nnational defense in this new, uncertain era. Needless to say, this \ntransformation process will require enlightened, thoughtful leadership, \nand not the pork barreling of military funds, if we are to best serve \nAmerica in this time of rapid change in the global security \nenvironment.\n  Again, I question the requirement for certain items in the defense \nportion of\n\n[[Page S7272]]\n\nthis supplemental appropriations bill. We are waging war against a new \nenemy. The dangers in Afghanistan to our service members are real. \nHowever, I do not believe that our ``special forces'' units are \nthreatened by any perceived torpedo attack that would cause the \nappropriators to include in the conference Report a provision to \ninclude $1 million for the Tripwire Torpedo Defense Program or $1 \nmillion for the Undersea Warfare Support Equipment AN/SLQ 25A.\n  The conference report improves on the Senate-passed language \nregarding U.S. policy in Colombia by providing the Departments of State \nand Defense with the authority to support the Colombian government's \nunified campaign against narcotics trafficking and terrorism. However, \nI regret that the final language imposes a burdensome requirement on \nthe President of Colombia to commit in writing to a series of \nbenchmarks regarding his policy and reform plans. I also regret that \nthe conferees have seen fit to cut the President's peacekeeping \nrequests by nearly $28 million--at a time when America's global \npresence, and the importance of standing shoulder to shoulder with our \nallies in defense of our common interests, matters.\n  I do applaud this legislation's requirement for reports setting forth \na strategy for meeting the security needs of Afghanistan to ensure \neffective delivery of humanitarian aid, build the rule of law and civil \norder, and support the Afghan government's efforts to bring stability \nand security to its people. History shows that America cannot walk away \nfrom Afghanistan if we are to protect our interests there. Our first \nrequirement in this post-war phase must be to help the Afghan \ngovernment bring basic security and order to all parts of the country. \nAmerica must do more, not less, to consolidate our victory in \nAfghanistan by helping to build an environment in which our values can \nflourish.\n  Let there be no doubt that this war will be long. Therefore, we \nshould not frivolously spend today like there is no tomorrow. For when \ntomorrow comes, we must have the fiscal resources to not only fight \nthis war to victory, but to provide for our nation's other priorities \nincluding tax relief for the lower- and middle-income Americans, \nadequate funding for Social Security and Medicare, and significant debt \nreduction.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the information I \nearlier referenced.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24JY02.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24JY02.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S7275]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24JY02.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24JY02.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, I rise to object to the Dyeing \nand Finishing Provision found in the 2002 supplemental appropriations \nbill, H.R. 4775, that is now going through the conference process \nwithin the Senate and will soon be voted on by this body.\n  This provision is of serious concern to me because it falls within \nthe jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and it was not voted on nor \nreviewed by the committee.\n  Senator Baucus and I sent a joint letter in June expressing our deep \nconcern about the inclusion of this provision in the bill and asked the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee to oppose this provision due \nto our jurisdiction concerns.\n  Section 1405 of the House bill pertains language that will amend two \nU.S. trade preference programs: the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery \nAct and the Andean Trade Preference Act.\n  The amendment requires certain fabric to be dyed and finished in the \nUnited States in order for apparel sewn from such fabric in the \nCarribean or Andean region to enter the United States duty-free.\n  Regardless of how my colleagues feel about the requirement for fabric \nto be dyed and finished in the United States to qualify for duty-free \ntreatment they should respect the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee \nunder the trade laws of this Congress.\n  Our committee has oversight over carefully balanced programs that \nwere developed after years of close study and deliberations in the \nFinance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n  During the debate of the Bipartisan Trade Act of 2002 when Senator \nByrd asked for Senator Baucus and I to respect the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Committee by striking all authorization language in the \ntrade bill while we were debating the legislation on the floor.\n  Senator Baucus and I addressed the Senator's concerns by stopping the \ndebate and revising the legislation so as to not encroach upon the \njurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I am deeply dismayed about the Finance Committees' concerns not \nseriously being considered about the dyeing and finishing provision \nwhich is clearly in our jurisdiction.\n  I would hope my colleagues would be more considerate of the problem \nwe have with the House being able to slip provisions in the \nsupplemental hoping to sneak it through the legislative process \notherwise the legislative process will become a free-for-all.\n  If the provision is a good piece of legislation then my colleagues in \nthe House should be willing to have an open dialogue with the Finance \nCommittee members and address our concerns.\n  Alarms should go off when people try to slip legislation by hoping \nthat no one will catch it.\n  I am disappointed because this is not the way we are suppose to do \nbusiness around here.\n  There are several good reasons why committees were established and \ngiven jurisdiction over specific issues.\n  The Finance Committee members are the experts on trade, therefore all \nissues involving trade should come through our committee.\n  I am just asking my colleagues to respect the rules established by \nthe Senate. I am disappointed that the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee did not respect our jurisdiction.\n  This is bad policy and I oppose it.\n  I also want to strongly emphasize how important it is that we do not \nset a precedent allowing Members to thwart the committee process and \nsmuggle legislation through the Senate under the radar screen.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, a provision I have worked on with my \nAlaska colleagues, Congressman Don Young and Senator Frank Murkowski, \nis included in this bill as section 3002. In conversations with air \ncarriers in Alaska and the Postal Service, we have found that there are \nserious problems with mail delivery to rural Alaska under the current \nbypass mail system. This provision, titled the Rural Service \nImprovement Act of 2002, is derived from S. 1713 in the Senate and H.R. \n3444 in the House. It contains several technical changes that will \nresolve these problems.\n  The bypass mail system is unique to my State: It was created by \nsection 5402 of title 39 of the U.S. Code, and attempts to ensure \nreliable and affordable passenger service and the delivery of food, \ngoods, and basic consumer necessities to rural Alaska communities.\n  I have stated on numerous occasions during Postal Service hearings \nbefore the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that the establishment \nand maintenance of post offices and post roads applies to my State as \nit does the rest of the Union. As a member of the committee with \noversight over Postal operations, I take the responsibilities of the \nPostal Service very seriously. As an Alaskan, I am even more concerned. \nAlmost every item found on the shelf of a rural Alaska general store \narrives via the bypass mail system. This system was created through \nlegislation originated by the Senate in 1970 and today it is the \nlifeline of rural Alaska.\n  In addition to ensuring delivery of food and goods, the bypass mail \nsystem assured that passenger seats would be available to rural \nAlaskans. The revenues paid to air carriers to transport the bypass \nmail helps underwrite the cost of this passenger service. The Federal \nGovernment's vast ownership of lands in Alaska and the limited access \nto those lands means that air transportation is the only way to reach \nmost rural communities in Alaska. We are prohibited by the Federal \nGovernment from building roads to connect most of our communities and \nthis system assures access by air.\n  In recent years there has been an explosion in the number of carriers \neligible to carry bypass mail in Alaska because the threshold \nrequirements for eligibility have been very low. However, few of these \nnew carriers operate in ways that reflect the intent behind the bypass \nmail program. Instead of providing air transportation to passengers, \nthese carriers use the system to underwrite a portion of their total \nbusiness plan. Other mail-only carriers use it as the basis of their \nentire operation. They provide little to no passenger service to \nAlaska's rural communities.\n  The bypass mail system is divided into two categories: mainline \nroutes and bush routes. Mainline routes are flown by carriers operating \nlarger aircraft capable of carrying many pallets of food and goods. \nThese pallets usually weigh a minimum of 1,000 pounds. To be qualified \nas a mainline carrier under the current regulations, carriers must \noperate aircraft certified to carry at least 7,500 pounds of payload \ncapacity. These mainline carriers take bypass mail from one of two \nacceptance points, Anchorage or Fairbanks, and carry it to ``hubs'' \nsuch as Bethel, Barrow, and Nome. From these hubs the mail is \ndistributed to bush communities by smaller bush aircraft. To operate \nproperly and efficiently the system needs healthy mainline and bush \ncarriers.\n  The Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 resolves many of the \nproblems with mainline operations. It clarifies who is eligible to be a \nmainline carrier, stabilizes mainline markets, and supports increased \npassenger service. It limits the entry of new all-cargo carriers to \nmainline markets where current cargo service is deficient. This bill \nalso gives existing carriers 30 days to correct problems with mail \ndelivery, schedule adherence, or repeated mail damage that the Postal \nService deems unacceptable. If no improvements are made new mainline \ncarriers would be eligible to offer service on these routes.\n\n  In addition, the bill allows new carriers to enter otherwise closed \nmainline routes if they provide substantial passenger service. This \ndetermination will be made on a route-by-route basis. To qualify, a new \ncarrier must regularly make available to the public at least 75 percent \nof the number of passenger seats on the largest carrier on a give route \nfor 6 consecutive months. After a new carrier is certified as a \nmainline carrier it must carry 20 percent of the actual passengers on \nthe route to remain qualified. Carriers will design their business \nplans around passenger service, not just bypass mail. This will enable \nthe bypass mail system to fulfill our original intent: to provide mail \nand air transportation to Alaskans.\n  The bill also addresses a current problem on routes that receive \nsubsidies from the Department of Transportation's Essential Air \nService, EAS, program. Currently DOT establishes a\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nsubsidy rate based on a combination of factors, including the size of \nthe community, the desired level of service an show much revenue the \nEAS carrier can expect to earn from other sources. However, DOT has no \nrole in determining how much mail is carried by EAS carriers. This act \naddresses this flaw by requiring all nonpriority mail and nonpriority \nbypass mail be tendered to the contracted EAS carrier on each route, as \nlong as the needs of the Postal Service are being met. This will reduce \nthe cost of the EAS program in Alaska and ensure mail is delivered in a \ntimely fashion. First class and priority mail will still be carried by \nthe Postal Service's preferred provides based on premium delivery \nstandards on these routes.\n  This bill also ensures adequate passenger service for under served \ncommunities. Under this act, a new passenger carrier may immediately be \ntendered bypass mail on a mainline route if all passenger carriers \noperating under Federal Aviation Rules part 121 leave the market or no \npart 121 passenger service is available. These provisions mean that \nunder such conditions a new 121 carrier will not have to wait 6 months \nto provide services. It will get bypass mail immediately in mainline \nmarkets with no passenger service. This change will provide mainline \ncommunities with quality passenger service as mail revenues underwrite \npassenger transportation.\n  In addition, this bill addresses a serious problem for rural Alaska. \nCurrently, some rural markets are classified as mainline by the Postal \nservice but have no mainline passenger or bypass mail service. This \nbill allows bush carriers currently serving those routes to continue \ncarrying bypass mail even if a mainline carrier begins service there. \nThe bush carriers will be paid the lower mainline rate which will \nreduce costs for the Postal Service while preserving existing passenger \nservice on the those routes. To preserves bush passenger and non-mail \nfreight service on rural routes, if a mainline carrier beings providing \nservice on a traditional bush route, existing bush passenger and on-\nmail freight carriers may continue to receive bypass mail if they agree \nto be paid the lower mainline rate.\n  This act allows for equalization on those mainline routes with no \ncurrent mainline service and on traditional bush routes where a \nmainline carrier enters. It specifically prohibits bush carriers from \nentering or operating on mainline routes with existing mainline \nservice, except under specialized circumstances, to ensure that larger \naircraft capable of carrying many pallets fly full to the hubs. The act \nallows the Postal Service to tender bypass mail to bush carriers on \nmainline routes with existing mainline service if three conditions are \nmet. First, the bush carrier must meet the minimum \ntechnical requirements of the operating statute. Second, no similar \nservice is available on the route by the existing mainline carriers. \nThird, the Postal Service determines that the tender of mail to a bush \ncarrier on the mainline route will not decrease the efficiency of the \nhub or increase costs for the Postal Service. This test will be applied \nby the Postal Service on a case-by-case basis.\n\n  Another feature of the bill is the explicit authorization of \n``composite equalization,'' to protect and enhance passenger service. \nCurrently almost all bypass mail flows from an acceptance point to a \nhub and then on to a bush point. This act allows bush carriers to \nreceive mail at the acceptance point for a direct flight to bush \nvillages without first stopping in the hub. Bush carriers are paid \nbased on what they would have flown to the hub point at the lower \nmainline rate and then based on what they would have flown from the hub \npoint to the bush village at the lowest bush rate. The provision also \nrecognizes routes where composite equalization or direct flights \nbypassing the hub exist today. The intent is to promote additional \nsavings for the Postal Service and to preserve existing direct flights \nfor rural Alaskan residents.\n  The act also allows for the creation of future routes at composite \nrates if carriers meet a four-part test. First, a carriers seeking \ntender at composite rates must meet the minimum passenger service \nrequirements of the bill. Second, the carriers must qualify to be \ntendered mail in the hub point being bypassed by the proposed direct \nroute. Third, the carrier must prove that carrying bypass mail on \ndirect routes will not reduce the efficiency of the entire hub \noperations. Lastly, the Postal Service must determine that allowing the \ndirect flight will save money for that portion of the system. The \nPostal Service will take into account the cost of flying the mail \ndirectly to the bush village from the acceptance point along with the \ncost of not flying the mail through the hub in terms of payments to \nother carriers, especially the mainline carriers.\n  The act restricts entry of new cargo-only capacity in mainline \nmarkets. All new mainline carriers must also meet the passenger \nrequirements of the bill to be tendered mainline bypass mail. A carrier \notherwise qualified to be tendered non-priority bypass mail on January \n1, 2001, but not engaged in the regular carriage of mainline bypass \nmail on that date, is not qualified as an existing carrier. A carrier \nnot qualified as a mainline carrier on January 1, 2001, which has since \nbecome qualified does not fulfill the definition of an existing carrier \nfor the purposes of carrying mainline bypass mail. Likewise, a carrier \nthat was tendered mainline bypass mail on January 1, 2001 in improperly \nsized aircraft does not qualify as an existing carrier.\n  The Rural Service Improvement Act of 2002 also resolves problems with \nbush community operations. Currently any carrier meeting very minimum \nqualifications may be tendered bush bypass mail. In a community with 10 \nqualified carriers each carrier receives approximately 10 percent of \nthe bypass mail on that route. Not all of those carriers also provide \npassenger or non-mail freight service. This act intends to change this \nsituation by establishing rural mail pools on a route-by-route basis.\n  First, 70 percent of the mail will be tendered to those carriers \nwhich provided at least 20 percent of the passenger service on a given \nroute. Twenty percent of the mail will go to non-mail freight carriers \nwhich provide at least 25 percent of the non-mail freight service on a \ngiven market. The remaining 10 percent of the bypass mail will go to \nthe remaining carriers on the route. After 3 years this 10 percent mail \npool will terminate and its mail will be divided among the remaining \ntwo pools. The amount of mail in the passenger pool should increase to \n75 percent; the remaining 25 percent of bypass mail will go to non-mail \nfreight carriers. The creation of these pool for passenger and non-mail \nfreight carriers should ensure competition in each market without \nhaving the mail revenue split between an infinite number of carriers.\n\n  Based on advice from the department of Transportation, this act \nincludes provisions to increase safety standards. It permits markets to \nconvert from operations under part 135 of the Federal Aviation Rules to \npart 121 if a part 121 carrier becomes qualified to receive bypass mail \nin a given market. If this happens, all 135 carriers in the market have \n5 years to convert to operations under part 121 in order to continue \nreceiving bypass mail. The bill defines part 121 operations as aircraft \ncarrying passengers and non-priority bush bypass mail on aircraft type \ncertificated to carry at least 19 passengers, which according to the \nDepartment of Transportation, are the most efficient aircraft on an \nair-ton-mile basis that are still reasonably sized for use in rural \nAlaska. For the purposes of part 121 operators, the bill focuses on the \naircraft which actually carry the mail.\n  All carriers in Alaska are put on notice of the requirements of \nconversion from part 135 to part 121. After a 6-year period if a 121 \ncarrier becomes eligible for bypass mail on any route, 135 carriers on \nthat route have one year to convert to part 121 to continue receiving \nmail.\n  Saving the Postal Service money by requiring the use of more \nefficient and larger aircraft, because of conversion to part 121 is an \nimportant goal of this bill. This also improves passenger service and \nsafety. In a market which can physically support 121 operations, all \npassenger carriers in that market should be encouraged to provided \nincreased safety and efficiency.\n  Some markets in Alaska may not receive 121 passenger service due to a \nlack of ground infrastructure or the population base to support 19-seat \npassenger aircraft. In these communities\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nsmaller airplanes operated under part 135 are an integral part of the \nAlaska transportation system. Also, if a 121 carrier begins service in \na market and withdraws, 135 carriers in that market need not convert \n121 in order to carry bypass mail in the market.\n  The bill encourages passenger competition in bush markets. Where \nthere is only one qualified passenger carrier under the bill, meaning \nit carries at least 80.01 percent of the passengers on a given route, \nthen no other carrier could qualify as a passenger carrier in that \nmarket. As an incentive for other passenger carriers to enter the \nmarket to become the second largest carrier, thus increasing \ncompetition, the act requires the Postal Service to tender 20 percent \nof the 70 percent mail pool to the next largest passenger carrier \nduring the first three years of the act, 14 percent of the overall \nbypass mail volume for the market. After the first 3 years the Postal \nService may provide 20 percent of the 75 percent pool to the next \nlargest passenger carrier, or 15 percent of the bypass mail for the \nmarket.\n  As previously stated, carriers operating under part 121 must use \naircraft type-certificated to carry at least 19 passengers. Carriers \noperating under part 135 must use aircraft type-certificated to carry \nat least five passengers. Finally, recognizing the special needs of \nmarkets with water-only airports the bill requires water-landing \naircraft to be type-certificated to carry at least three passengers. \nThese requirements do not require these seats to be installed at all \ntimes. Rather, carriers must use minimum sized aircraft to increase \nefficiencies for the Postal Service and, passenger seats must be \ninstalled and insured when needed on such aircraft. A carrier may fly \nan extra section with only cargo or mail as long as the plane meets the \nminimum size requirements and the carrier otherwise qualifies to carry \nmail as a qualified passenger or non-mail freight carrier under the \nAct.\n  Under provisions in the bill, to avoid over-concentration in the \nmarkets, no carrier which qualifies both as a passenger carrier and a \nnon-mail freight carrier may get mail under both the 70 percent--75 \npercent pool in 3 years--and the 20 percent pool--25 percent in 3 \nyears--at the same time unless no other carrier qualifies in the \nmarket.\n\n  A substantial amount of the savings for the Postal Service comes from \nthe creation of new bush rates for the carriage of mail. After \ncollecting all of the carriers' cost data the Department of \nTransportation should first calculate the costs for all bush part 121 \npassenger carriers, then for 135 carriers, and finally for 135 carriers \nwhere only water landings are available to create a new rate for each \nclass of carrier. In markets with qualified 121 carriers, all passenger \ncarriers will be paid the 121 rate, including all 135 passenger \ncarriers operating in those markets. For markets with only 135 carriers \nand water landing markets the new 135 rate will be applied evenly.\n  The act provides significant penalties for carriers which \nsubstantially misstate data just to qualify for bypass mail. However, \nit also gives DOT and the Postal Service the flexibility they need. \nUnder this bill, both DOT and the Postal Service may grant waivers for \notherwise unqualified passenger carriers if the carriers are operating \nin good faith, meaning they are making great efforts to provide \npassenger or non-mail freight service and are not using the bypass mail \nrevenues as the primary means of their business. In addition, if the \nPostal Service or DOT determines a carrier meets all of the technical \nqualifications to operate in the system, but is not providing another \nsubstantial service, i.e. passenger or non-mail freight service, then \nit may be removed from the system. When making this determination DOT \nand the Postal Service should look at the quantity and quality of \nexisting service in the community, including passenger carriage, and \nthe proposed quality and quantity of service for the carrier seeking a \nwaiver, to allow a 121 passenger carrier to become qualified if it \nreduces costs for the Postal Service and improves passenger service in \na market, even if it has not provided a full 12 months of service in \nthe market at the required levels under the Act.\n  To allow the Postal Service and DOT to collect 12 months of T-100 \ndata from the carriers before establishing the new tender policy and \nsetting new rates, most of the bush provisions will not take effect for \n15 months from the date of enactment. Also, the bill requires the DOT \nto review the need for a bush rate case at least every 2 years. To \nmaximize the savings for the Postal Service initial rate reviews by DOT \nshould be performed expeditiously. All carriers in the State are \nallowed at least 1 year to begin providing additional services to the \ncommunities before reductions in mail tender go into effect.\n  Stating 6 months after the enactment date, the act permits the Postal \nService and DOT to remove a carrier from the bypass mail program if the \ncarrier was not attempting to qualify as a passenger or non-mail \nfreight carrier.\n  The bill intends to promote safety by empowering the Secretary of \nTransportation to shut down any operation where substantial evidence \nexists that the carrier is flying in an unsafe manner to qualify for \nthe tender of bypass mail. Such evidence includes flying in unsafe \nconditions or without proper training and equipment, especially with \npassengers on board.\n  The bill allows for the merger or acquisition of airlines. If two or \nmore airlines merge, the two carriers' data for the previous period of \ntime may be counted together for the purpose of qualifying for bypass \nmail. The merged carrier must show it is otherwise qualified to carry \nbypass mail under the provisions of the act. Also, where two or more \nair carrier certificates merge into one certificate, the carriers \ncannot later be split up and operated separately.\n  To allow the Postal Service to deliver the mail in the most efficient \nmanner possible, under the provisions of this act, and under its \ninternal statutory and regulatory provisions, the Postal Service may \nremove a carrier from the bypass mail system if it does not meet the \nrequirements of this act. The act states previous carriage of bypass \nmail does not create a contract for guaranteeing future tender of \nbypass mail. Rather, the tender of bypass mail is only a contract for \nthe carriage of each particularly batch of mail.\n  In summary, this bill intends to reduce the Postal Service's losses \non the bypass mail program while improving safety and stabilizing \npassenger service. The full Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nagreed, unanimously voting to pass the bill out of Committee on May 22, \n2002. While some may argue this is re-regulation of the airline \nindustry in Alaska, it is not. This bill requires carriers seeking \neligibility to carry the bypass mail in Alaska to meet basic tests and \nminimum requirements. This is the time to correct the problems with the \nAlaska system before it collapses completely. To do otherwise would be \nto turn our backs on the rural communities of Alaska and the \ncommitments the Federal Government has made to them as a result of \nbroad Federal land ownership in Alaska.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring of the conference report to H.R. \n4775, the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery and \nResponse to Terrorist Attacks on the United States.\n  The conference report provides $29.356 billion in net, new \ndiscretionary budget authority, of which $14.492 billion if for defense \nactivities and $14.864 billion is for nondefense activities. That \nadditional budget authority will increase outlays by a total of $7.8 \nbillion in 2002. Of the total spending authority provided, H.R. 4775 \ndesignates $29,886 billion as emergency spending, which will increase \noutlays by $7.783 billion in 2002. Per section 314 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I have adjusted the Appropriations Committee's allocation \nfor 2002 by the amount of that emergency funding. The conference report \nis within the committee's revised section 302(a) and 302(b) allocations \nfor budget authority and outlays.\n  The conference report to H.R. 4775 is subject to several budget \npoints of order. First, by including language increasing the 2003 cap \non highway spending, the conference report violates section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, which requires that such language be reported \nby the Budget Committee. Second, by amending the Caribbean Basin \nEconomic Recovery\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\nAct, H.R. 4775 decreases revenues by $60 million in 2003 and $785 \nmillion over the 2003-2012 period. Because the Congress has already \nbreached the revenue aggregates under the 2002 budget resolution, the \nconference report violates section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act. \nFinally, H.R. 4775 violates section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budge for Fiscal Year 2001, by including a \nnumber of emergency designations for spending on nondefense activities.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that two tables displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of H.R. 4775 be inserted in the record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TABLE 1.--CONFERENCE REPORT TO H.R. 4775, 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FURTHER RECOVERY FROM AND\n  RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES (Spending comparison--302(a) Allocations to Appropriations\n                                                   Committee)\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    Current Level\n                                                                         Plus            Senate       Difference\n                                                                     Supplemental     Allocations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral purpose:\n  BA.............................................................          733,597          734,126         -529\n  OT.............................................................          694,579          700,500       -5,921\nHighways:\n  BA.............................................................                0                0            0\n  OT.............................................................           28,489           28,489            0\nMass Transit:\n  BA.............................................................                0                0            0\n  OT.............................................................            5,275            5,275            0\nConservation:\n  BA.............................................................            1,758            1,760           -2\n  OT.............................................................            1,392            1,473          -81\nMandatory:\n  BA.............................................................          358,567          358,567            0\n  OT.............................................................          350,837          350,837            0\n                                                                  ----------------------------------------------\n    Total\n      BA.........................................................        1,093,922        1,094,453         -531\n      OT.........................................................        1,080,572        1,086,574       -6,002\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Madam President, I am pleased that the supplemental bill \ncontains $75 million additional funding for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's operational account. It was facing some severe \ncutbacks in service without this funding.\n  In particular, the FAA had reduced funding for proficiency and \ndevelopmental training of air traffic controllers. This funding was \nreduced by about $10 million without reprogramming approval from the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. It is my hope and desire \nthat the FAA add back at least $2 Million to the Air Traffic \nInstructional Services program. This is a vital program that should \nnever have been cut back. It provides ongoing in-service developmental \ntraining all across the country. It has proven to lower error rates by \nair traffic controllers, thus making the skies safer for the flying \npublic. I believe they should restore the funding immediately.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I have come to the floor today to \ndiscuss an item that is not in the conference report that we will soon \nvote on, but is critical for our national defense, our future economic \nvitality, and the ability of our workers to turn this national disaster \ninto new opportunities.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate supplemental bill contained $400 \nmillion for job training and employment assistance for our Nation's \nworkers.\n  These are funds that were requested by the administration and \nsupported by a bipartisan group of Senators, and are critically needed \nthroughout our Nation.\n  Unemployment nationwide has hovered around 6 percent throughout most \nof this year, and in my State, it is been considerably higher than the \nnational average. With the loss of nearly 20,000 commercial aviation \njobs in Washington State and severe slowdowns in other major \nindustries, we are likely to suffer secondary layoffs that extend \nthroughout the next 2 years.\n  But throughout the Nation, we are seeing more and more workers who \nare unable to find employment for extended periods of time.\n  A report released last week by the National Employment Law Project \nfound that long-term employment is higher now than in any of the last \nfour recessions.\n  The number of workers unemployed for more than 26 weeks has grown \nover 140 percent from March of 2001,\n  Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin wrote on Sunday in the \nWashington Post that, to get our economy on a sound footing and restore \nthe prosperity of the '90s, we need to do three things: one, look \nseriously at our nation's long term fiscal position; two, expand trade \nby granting trade promotion authority; and three, invest in the \ntraining of our workers . . .\n  Mr. Rubin went on to say that ``Budgeting priorities should heavily \nemphasize preparing our future workforce to be competitively productive \nin the global economy.''\n  I have supported this bill and I still believe that we need to get \nthese funds out there to replenish vital defense accounts and to \nimplement immediate improvements in homeland security.\n  But in trimming the bill down to reach the level of spending the \nPresident feels necessary, I believe that this bill does a disservice \nto the workers in this nation trying to upgrade or learn new skills and \nidentify new opportunities, and continues to short-change the systems \nthat we have established to support those efforts.\n  While we are experiencing massive layoffs throughout the nation, \nbusinesses continue to find a serious skills shortage in our workforce, \nwhich slows our economic recovery.\n  Reducing WIA funding at this time by allowing last year's rescission \nto be enacted, will seriously impede our ability to get workers the \ntraining they need to secure high-paying jobs and strengthen U.S. \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. Such cuts would be short-sighted \nat a time when long-term unemployment is at a record high.\n  So I am disappointed that these funds have fallen through at the \neleventh hour.\n  We are facing a tidal wave of demand for job training services. One-\nstop centers throughout this nation are experiencing record visits by \ndisplaced workers and those seeking to upgrade their skills.\n  In my State, the Renton ``Worksource Center'' is serving over 4,500 \nworkers per month; and the Benton-Franklin County center recently \nserved 991 job seekers in a single day last month;\n  And our one-stop systems are already producing results. In \nWashington, we have estimated that, for every dollar invested in \nprograms for dislocated workers and youth training, we get $8 in \nparticipant earnings growth and taxes collected.\n  As these programs get further institutionalized, and as workers get \nto know the one-stop sites created throughout our States, we will see \neven greater usage by workers seeking to upgrade their skills or find a \nmore ideal job.\n  But it won't happen if we don't commit to getting the system up and \nrunning. If we continue to short-change workforce development systems, \nthe effects will be felt on our economy for years to come.\n  That is why I and over 50 of my colleagues joined together in \nrequesting an increase in funding in the regular Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill currently under consideration by the committee. \nDespite my concerns about the immediate needs, I am pleased that the \ncommittee has decided to restore last year's rescission and provide \nincreases in job these training accounts.\n  I urge my colleagues on the committee to work with us in ensuring \nthat those funds are protected and maintained as we proceed to moving \nthat bill through both Houses, and that we expeditiously reach \nconsensus on that bill in the interest of our Nation's future.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Washington Post article by \nRobert Rubin in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the washingtonpost.com, July 21, 2002; Page B07]\n\n                          To Regain Confidence\n\n                          (By Robert E. Rubin)\n\n       There has been much confusion and uncertainty among \n     investors and in Washington about the economy and the stock \n     market, and about what to do in response to a seemingly \n     significant loss of confidence in our system. Much of the \n     focus has been on accounting and corporate governance. These \n     issues are important, but I think the restoration of \n     confidence and the establishment of sound fundamentals going \n     forward require a much broader focus.\n       To address accounting and corporate governance first: \n     Clearly reforms are needed to deal with the systemic issues \n     revealed by the recent spate of corporate problems, as are \n     specific enforcement actions where appropriate. The \n     accounting and corporate governance bill passed recently by \n     the Senate seems to me on the whole sensible and responsive \n     to these needs. Similarly, the New York Stock Exchange has \n     issued thoughtful proposals on corporate governance. \n     Expensing of stock options is, in my view, worth serious \n     consideration, though practical problems such as valuation \n     need to be resolved. And the conflicts between research and \n     investment banking need a dispositive, industry-wide \n     solution.\n       These accounting and corporate governance problems \n     developed over time--as\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\n     seems to happen after extended good times--but only really \n     came to the fore during the past year. From the time the \n     magnitude of the problems became clear, the need was for a \n     response that was energetic, effective and as rapid as \n     possible. But that response--both in regulatory and \n     legislative changes and in enforcement--should be balanced \n     and appropriate. Our accounting and corporate governance \n     systems have great strengths--in allowing for decisive \n     management decisions, rapid change and agility, \n     experimentation and risk taking--and those strengths should \n     not be unwisely eroded.\n       Having said that, these accounting and corporate governance \n     issues--though very important--are only part of a much \n     broader question of how to best promote confidence and strong \n     fundamentals, for the short and the long term.\n       That was exactly the question the new administration faced \n     in the beginning of 1993, and the strategy then put in place \n     contributed centrally to the remarkably strong economic \n     conditions and sound economic fundamentals for the balance of \n     the 1990s. Unemployment fell from over 7 percent to 4 percent \n     and was under 5 percent for 40 consecutive months; private \n     investment in productive equipment grew at double-digit rates \n     for eight years; annual productivity growth more than doubled \n     by the end of the period; inflation was low; GDP growth \n     averaged roughly 4 percent per annum, and 20 million new \n     private-sector jobs were created. Moreover, instead of the \n     huge 10-year deficits projected by the Office of Management \n     and Budget at the end of 1992, deficits were reduced and in \n     time surpluses began.\n       Certain imbalances did develop--for example, the levels of \n     consumer and corporate debt, the level of the stock market, \n     and excess capacity--as they always do after extended good \n     times, and an adjustment period was inevitable. How difficult \n     that period was going to be would be affected by many \n     factors, very much including the actions of government. Also, \n     the legacy of the 1990s provided strong fundamentals to \n     ameliorate this adjustment, e.g., a large fiscal surplus, \n     strong productivity growth, low unemployment, more open \n     markets around the world and a healthy banking system.\n       In my view, we need to restore the sound, broad-based \n     strategy that was so central to the prosperity of the '90s. \n     More specifically, I would focus especially on the following:\n       (1) Virtually the entire $5.6 trillion surplus projected by \n     the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in January 2001, \n     including $2.5 trillion of Social Security surplus, has now \n     been dissipated. I wrote when last May's 10-year tax cuts \n     were being debated that their direct cost--later estimated by \n     the CBO as $1.7 trillion including debt service--and even \n     more important, their indirect cost in undermining political \n     cohesion around fiscal discipline, threatened the federal \n     government's long-term fiscal position. And that is precisely \n     what has happened.\n       Long-term fiscal discipline and a sound long-term fiscal \n     position contribute substantially, over time but also in the \n     short term, to lower interest rates, increased consumer and \n     business confidence, and to attracting much-needed capital \n     from abroad to our savings-deficient country. In addition, a \n     sound long-term fiscal position would far better enable us to \n     meet our long-term Social Security and Medicare commitments.\n       The portion of the 10-year tax cut that occurred in the \n     short-term may well serve a useful expansionary purpose at a \n     time of economic weakness. But the great preponderance of \n     this tax cut occurs in outer years. Moreover, nobody is \n     talking about a tax increase; the question is whether the \n     cuts enacted for later years should be canceled. In my view, \n     all matters pertaining to taxes and spending should be on the \n     table, with a commitment to reestablishing a sound long-term \n     fiscal position for the federal government.\n       (2) Trade liberalization and our own open markets \n     contributed greatly to our economic well-being during the \n     1990s, and are critically important looking forward. The \n     president should be given trade promotion authority, and the \n     recently adopted steel tariffs and agricultural subsidies--\n     which present such a threat to global trade liberalization \n     and to business confidence in the outcome of the struggle \n     over continued globalization--should be corrected. Also--a \n     related matter--we should be prepared to engage in and lead \n     en effective and sensible response to financial crisis abroad \n     when our interests can be affected.\n       (3) Budgeting priorities should heavily emphasize preparing \n     our future workforce to be competitively productive in the \n     global economy, including improving our public school system \n     and equipping the poor to join the economic mainstream.\n       Finally, we must deal effectively--building on the strong \n     response to the terrible attack of Sept. 11--with the \n     immensely complex challenges of terrorism and geopolitical \n     instability that are of enormous importance to our economy as \n     well as to our national security.\n       Much of this is difficult, substantively and politically, \n     but the willingness to deal with exceedingly difficult public \n     issues was central to our economic well-being in the '90s and \n     is centrally important today and for the years and decades \n     ahead.\n       The writer was head of the National Economic Council from \n     1993 to 1994 and secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999. \n     He is now director and chairman of the executive committee of \n     Citigroup Inc.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the Hagel amendment No. 4315 \nprior to the vote on or in relation to the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand it, we are on the Hagel \namendment and we have 5 minutes evenly divided. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I imagine the Senator from Nevada would want recognition \nto make a statement in favor of his amendment.\n  Madam President, I will yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes and ask to be \nnotified of the last 15 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, yesterday we voted in the Senate on \nwhether we were going to deal with a comprehensive prescription drug \nprogram for our senior citizens--the 13 million who have none, the 10 \nmillion who have employer-based systems and are losing it, and the 4 \nmillion who have HMO coverage but have caps of $500 and $750. We \ndebated that.\n  I strongly supported the Graham-Miller proposal because it is built \nupon the Medicare model, a tried and tested program. It was \ncomprehensive, affordable, and it would have met the needs of our \nsenior citizens. I differed with our Republican friends on this \nparticular proposal, but they believe they would achieve the same goal.\n  That isn't what the Hagel proposal is all about. It will only amount \nto 10 or 12 cents out of every health care dollar.\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nI think our seniors are entitled to better. They are the men and women \nwho fought in the world wars, brought this country out of depression, \nand now are frail and elderly.\n  The question is, Are we prepared to do for them what we did for them \nin hospital care and physician services? They need the prescription \ndrugs. I believe we can still find common ground. I would like to find \ncommon ground. It is the position of our Democratic leader to try to \nfind common ground in terms of a comprehensive program.\n  This is a drop in the bucket. This is smaller than a fig leaf to \ncover the needs of our senior citizens. Let us in the Senate of the \nUnited States perform nobly and protect our senior citizens: let's pass \na comprehensive program. The Hagel proposal does not do that. We need \nto do that or we fail our senior citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I yield to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Nevada 1\\1/2\\ minutes of our 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, our plan is affordable to seniors as \nwell as to taxpayers in future generations. Our plan keeps senior \ncitizens involved in the choices they are making because they will pay \nthe first dollar out of pocket. They have the prescription drug \ndiscount card so they will save 25 to 40 percent on the drugs they \npurchase; but they will pay the first dollar out of pocket so it keeps \nthem involved in the choices they are making and helps the market work \nand keeps downward pressure on prices.\n  It also works well with State plans. My State of Nevada used some of \nits tobacco money to cover senior citizens below $21,500 in income. Our \nplan fits in well with any of the State plans that have already been \nput into effect.\n  The other advantage that this plan has is that it goes into effect at \nleast a year earlier than any of the other plans.\n  Lastly, our plan gives the help to those seniors who truly need it. \nRegarding the really sad stories we have heard on the floor of the \nSenate, this plan helps those seniors more than the Democrat plan, and \nit helps them even more than the tripartisan plan. If you are a \nmoderate-income senior, with $17,000 of income or so and have $5,000 a \nyear in drug costs, our plan helps those seniors more than any of the \nother two plans.\n  I urge the other Senators in this Chamber to support the Hagel-Ensign \nplan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, my friend and distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts, talks about a common ground. \nThis proposal is the common ground. As my colleague, Senator Ensign, \nhas just stated, this addresses those who need the help the most. We do \nprioritize. We do focus on those seniors who need the help. Yet we do \nit in a responsible way. We stay within the $300 billion budget cap \nthat this body voted on for a prescription drug plan over the next 10 \nyears. It is immediate, it is permanent, and it uses the present market \nsystem.\n  We don't build a new government bureaucracy. It is not impersonal. It \nis direct. It caps the catastrophic dark cloud that hangs over all \nsenior citizens. We are doing something for this generation of seniors \nas well as the next generation of seniors.\n  I hope our colleagues give this consideration and will vote for our \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the AARP opposes this amendment. Every \nsenior citizen group opposes this amendment for the reasons in this \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                              Retired Persons,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2002.\n       Dear Senator Hagel: Enacting a comprehensive prescription \n     drug benefit in Medicare this year remains the top priority \n     for AARP. Our members are counting on the Senate to pass a \n     meaningful drug benefit that is available and affordable to \n     all beneficiaries. Our members were promised in the last \n     election that a comprehensive drug benefit would be a \n     priority, and we are counting on you to make good on that \n     promise this year.\n       We appreciate the intent of your bill, S. 2736, the \n     ``Medicare Rx Drug Discount and Security Act of 2002,'' to \n     provide a prescription drug discount card and stop-loss \n     protection to Medicare beneficiaries. However, in addition to \n     our substantive objections, we are concerned that by offering \n     this scaled-back proposal today, you would effectively derail \n     bipartisan discussion and compromise on more meaningful \n     comprehensive approaches. We believe Congress should focus \n     its efforts on enactment of a more comprehensive drug benefit \n     this year.\n       In addition to the timing of your proposal, AARP has \n     concerns about the approach taken in your bill, including:\n       Catastrophic coverage--While AARP has not opposed income-\n     relating premiums, income-relating the Medicare benefit \n     changes the nature of the program. This would set an \n     extremely dangerous precedent in Medicare. Further, the stop-\n     loss levels set in the bill do not provide enough protection \n     for lower income beneficiaries. A low-income couple could \n     spend 25 percent of their income just for drugs before this \n     plan offered assistance. Thirdly, there are a number of \n     issues involved in using tax returns to determine program \n     eligibility levels, and we believe other options should be \n     explored.\n       Discount card--While AARP supports the use of a discount \n     card program as a building block for a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit, your proposal lacks the necessary \n     specifications to guaranty the level of discount, what level \n     of discount would be passed to beneficiaries, and the degree \n     of consumer protections required of plans.\n       Given these concerns, AARP opposes your amendment. We \n     remain fully committed to developing a comprehensive drug \n     benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries and we look forward to \n     working with you on legislation that our members can support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli,\n                                       Executive Director and CEO.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I \nbelieve all time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I move to waive the respective sections of \nthe Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on \nbehalf of many Senators. It is a very long list.\n  Most of my colleagues know we should have included State fiscal \nrelief and, in fact, did include it in our original stimulus package, \nwhich we debated both before Christmas and afterward but did nothing \nabout. This is a stimulus package that we need now and need to complete \nbecause we have very dangerous cuts going on in Medicaid and in the \nhealth care programs in our States that affect our most vulnerable \nAmericans.\n  The amendment which I and about 30 other Senators offer is to provide \nStates with the assistance they need right now. State budgets, as the \nPresiding Officer is more than aware, having been a Governor himself, \nare in really bad shape financially, and 49 States, of course, cannot \nspend any deficit money at all. More than 40 States in this fiscal year \nfaced a combined budget shortfall of between $40 and $50 billion, \naccording to the National Governors Association and the National \nAssociation of State Budget Offices. It is a crisis. I hear from my \nGovernor from West Virginia as often as the Presiding Officer from the \nState of Delaware hears from his Governor.\n  These deficits were caused by a combination of lower-than-expected \nrevenues, higher-than-expected expenditures, including increased \nMedicaid costs, and Medicaid is our key, partly a result of the rise in \nunemployment. When that happens, what is a State going to do but to \noffer Medicaid?\n  There are some signs of an economic recovery at the national level. I \nsay that without any particular reason to know that or even to be \nhopeful, but I will say that rather than just be pessimistic. However, \nit will certainly take 12 to 18 months, if I am right in my optimism, \nfor the State to recover.\n  We offer this amendment to help address the States' fiscal crises. \nYes, we are the Federal Government. Yes, they are States. However, they \nare deeply responsive to us and reactive to us with respect to Medicaid \nand virtually all of our health care programs.\n  This amendment will provide about $9 billion to States over the next \nyear and a half by increasing the Federal Medicaid match, also by \nholding States harmless for reductions in their Medicaid match that \nwould occur under current law and providing about $3 billion in new \nmoney that States can use for other social service needs such as child \ncare.\n  I will explain that simply by saying when I conceived of this \namendment originally, it was all about the Federal matching percentage. \nAnd then I got together with Senator Collins from Maine and Senator \nNelson from Nebraska and we worked out a compromise, which I think is a \nfar stronger amendment, which is to say that we want to do the Medicaid \nmatch problem but we also want to work on social services block grants.\n  There is a block grant component here of $3 billion, which means less \nfor Medicaid but more for block grants, which means States can use it \nfor child care, for education, for child abuse and negligence, and a \nvariety of other services. It is a creative and good approach.\n  It is important that my colleagues support this amendment. I will say \na word or two about some of its provisions.\n  Some Senators might say we should help the States. That is what we \ndo. We often impose requirements and they get into trouble; we wander \noff, forgetting what we have done.\n  Some might say, look, they got themselves into this mess; why should \nwe get them out of this mess? But the problem with that approach is, \nNo. 1, they didn't get themselves into that mess. It was a result of \nwhat was going on nationally, economically, the way the whole formula \nis figured, and I can get into that if my colleagues want to talk about \nit.\n  Regardless of that, the problem is the people are affected, the \npeople of our States are the ones affected. Governor Patton of Kentucky \nhas noted:\n\n       Without fiscal relief the cuts necessary to close the \n     budget gaps will have profound effects on our Nation's \n     children and the programs which serve our most needy \n     populations.\n\n  Several States have already cut back coverage under their Medicaid \nprograms. If States cut back on Medicaid benefits, their residents will \nbe out in the cold. So we need to stop pointing fingers at the States \nand ensure that the safety net is strong for this Nation's people who \nare our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Despite the downturn in the economy that is affecting most areas of \nthe country, the proportion of Medicaid costs that the Federal \nGovernment bears--in my State, it is 77, 78 percent, but the proportion \nthat the Federal Government is now paying is declining in 29 States. It \nis declining in 29 States including the State of West Virginia.\n  So the States with reduced matched rates will lose well over half a \nbillion dollars. This is as a consequence of what is now going on under \ncurrent law. Our amendment would hold States harmless for these \ndecreases.\n  Our amendment will also provide a temporary increase in the Federal \nMedicaid matching rates. I say temporary; it is not permanent. There \nwill be people here who will try to argue we are creating an \nentitlement. It is a temporary program which we write into law.\n  I would say to the Presiding Officer, when we did the tax decreases, \nwe wrote that into law. We could write this into law. It will last a \ncertain period of time, the Medicaid match will be up until a certain \nyear, the social services block grant up until a certain year. We write \nit into law. That is what we did with tax cuts. That is what we could \ndo in this amendment.\n  The pressure on States to cut back health insurance for low-income \nfamilies and individuals is enormous. The Governor of my State, this \nSenator's State, Gov. Bob Wise, calls me constantly about this. The \nState is in deficit for many reasons. It is not a wealthy State--it is \na wonderful State, but it is not a wealthy State--and he agonizes over \nthis because he knows at the end of the day he will have to make cuts \nin Medicaid. He already has had to. He doesn't want to do that because \nit affects so many of the people I represent--that we all represent.\n  Finally, I say to the Presiding Officer, the amendment will provide \nStates with money they can use for other social services. It is very \ncreative. It can be education. It can't be health care, but it can be \neducation; it can be child care, which plays very strongly into the \nwhole welfare reform debate issue. It can be for child abuse and \nneglect.\n  All of us will offer meaningful assistance to States with ailing \nbudgets, lessening the need for States to cut programs or raise taxes \nin the middle of something called a very bad recession. I cannot think \nof a more important time to pass this than now.\n  My State will receive about $58.5 million under this amendment, which \nit desperately needs in order to ensure coverage for our people.\n  I want to stress that this proposal is temporary. It will be \neffective for 18 months from April 2002. Our amendment includes an \nemergency designation. Why do we do that? Because that is the way it \noriginally was. That is the way it always was. It was part of the \nstimulus package. It was part of getting America going again. Now more \nthan ever we need to get America moving again economically.\n  The total estimated cost of the proposal, for both the block grant \npart and the FMAP part, the Medicaid match part, is $9 billion over 10 \nyears. I believe it is appropriate that we provide the States with this \nrelief under the traditional emergency designation.\n  I will be glad to speak further, but I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Ben Nelson, and Senator Gordon Smith, as well as \nwith several other of our colleagues, to offer an amendment that begins \nto address the fiscal plight of our States. I congratulate Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Nelson for their hard work on this issue.\n  Originally, we had slightly different approaches but, in an attempt \nto get something done that will help our States that are struggling \nwith fiscal\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\ncrises, and more important, the low-income families who are dependent \non Medicaid for their health care needs, we joined together and came up \nwith a compromise that I hope will win widespread bipartisan support.\n  Here in Washington, consumed with our own budget issues, we too often \nforget that we have 50 partners in our efforts to provide needed health \ncare, education, and other essential services to our citizens. Our \npartners are our States, and they need our help and they need it now.\n  The recession may officially have come to an end, but its effects \nstill linger and they are being felt acutely by States from Maine to \nNebraska, from West Virginia to Oregon. The resulting rise in \nunemployment, as well as the decline in tax revenues, coupled with the \naftermath of September 11, have placed enormous and unanticipated \nstrains on our State governments' budgets. States are facing a dramatic \nand unexpected decrease in government revenues at precisely the time \nwhen more revenues are needed to respond to the needs of more and more \nAmericans who are having difficulties making ends meet.\n  The combination of increasing demand for services and resources that \nhave declined is causing a fiscal crisis for States across the Nation. \nAccording to the National Governors Association and the National \nAssociation of State Budget Officers, more than 40 States are facing an \naggregate budget shortfall of between $40 billion and $50 billion. Most \nStates have seen their estimates of tax collections decrease, often \nprecipitously and unexpectedly. State governments are scrambling to \nrespond.\n  Forty-nine States are required by law or their constitution to \nbalance their budgets, so running a temporary deficit for these States \nis not a possibility.\n  Moreover, the problem is getting worse. It is not likely to improve \nanytime soon. A survey by the National Governors Association shows that \nindividual tax revenues for the first 4 months of this year are running \nnearly 15 percent behind last year's level.\n  The problem also is not an isolated one. It is not limited to just \none area of the country. Mr. President, 39 States have been forced to \nreduce their already-enacted budgets for fiscal 2002 by cutting \nprograms, tapping rainy day funds, laying off employees, and reducing \nimportant services.\n  According to the Conference of State Legislators, States have been \nforced to cut a number of critical programs. Twenty-nine States have \nattempted to balance their budgets by cutting spending on higher \neducation--something no one likes to see; 25 States have cut \ncorrections programs. Others have cut K-12 education and the Medicaid \nProgram; 10 States have reduced aid to local governments. In addition, \na number of States have resorted to increasing taxes and fees by a \ntotal of $2.4 billion.\n  The situation in my home State of Maine is typical of the problems \nfaced by many States. Our fiscal year just ended on June 30. Just this \npast March, State revenues appeared to be on target at approximately \n$2.4 billion. In April, after the State legislature had adjourned for \nthe year, State forecasters projected a shortfall of $90 million, \nlargely due to sluggish capital gain receipts.\n\n  By mid-June, the expected shortfall had risen by another $20 million, \ndue to lower than expected sales taxes, income taxes, and corporate \nincome tax receipts. All were off projections.\n  So you can see how quickly the financial system turned from \nrelatively positive to negative in my State and many others.\n  The shortfall in the fiscal year that just began in May looks even \nworse. We may experience a shortfall of $180 million. That is \nenormously difficult for a State such as Maine to deal with in a way \nthat does not hurt the people we serve.\n  To close the books on last year, the Governor of Maine had nearly \nemptied our State's rainy day fund. This year, the choices are going to \nbe far tougher. Already, cuts in education funding, furloughs for \ngovernment workers, and cuts in the Medicaid Program are on the \nhorizon.\n  I believe States need to tighten their belts in times of fiscal \ndifficulty just as the Federal Government should do in austere fiscal \ntimes.\n  We are not talking about taking the States off the hook. They are \nstill going to have to make a number of very difficult choices in order \nto balance their budgets. But the unexpected nature and the severity of \nthe crisis that States now face has convinced me we need to give them \nsome temporary help. We should do so by targeting resources where they \nare most needed for health care and social services programs.\n  Our amendment would provide a temporary increase in the Federal \nMedicaid matching rate. It would also provide block grant funds to \nevery State. Specifically, it would provide $6 billion to States by \nholding each State's Medicaid matching rate harmless for the next 18 \nmonths. It would also provide a temporary increase in the Medicaid \nmatching rate.\n  I note that over 30 States are scheduled to see a decrease in their \nFederal matching under the Medicaid Program.\n  So we would hold these States harmless. They would no longer see \ntheir Medicaid rate drop at the worst possible time for them from a \nfiscal standpoint.\n  The legislation would also provide $3 billion through a temporary \nblock grant to help States pay for the rising demand in social services \nresulting from the economic downturn. As Senator Rockefeller indicated, \nthat could be used, for example, for child care programs that are so \nimportant to our States.\n  In order to be eligible for the increased Medicaid funds, States are \nasked to maintain their Medicaid Programs. There are some States that \nhave acted to contract their Medicaid Programs in order to cut their \ncosts. But these States could reverse those actions and, thus, become \neligible for the increased Medicaid match that is provided by this \nbill.\n  Regardless, every State is going to benefit from the package we put \ntogether. Every State will receive a share of the block grant funding \nand will be protected by the provisions that maintain the Medicaid \nmatching rates at no less than the current level. Those are the so-\ncalled hold harmless provisions.\n  Our amendment is strongly supported by the National Governors \nAssociation, as you might well expect. They need our help. But it is \nalso strongly endorsed by a number of health care providers that are \nvery concerned about their ability to continue to provide much-needed \nquality health care to citizens who rely on the Medicaid Program. It \nhas been endorsed by the American Hospital Association, the American \nHealth Care Association, which represents our nursing homes, the \nVisiting Nurse Associations of America, and a host of other health care \nprovider groups.\n  The support that our legislation has received underscores the \nimportance of providing assistance to States at a time when many are \nbeing forced to look toward cuts in vital health care programs in order \nto balance their budgets.\n  Our amendment targets most of our assistance on Medicaid. The reason \nis that the Medicaid Program is the fastest growing component of State \nbudgets. While State revenues were stagnant or declined in many States \nlast year, Medicaid costs increased by 11 percent. This year, Medicaid \ncosts are increasing at an even greater rate--13.4 percent. My home \nState of Maine is one of only a number of States that have been forced \nto consider resorting to cuts in Medicaid in order to make up for their \nbudget shortfall.\n  The amendment we are offering today--I want to stress this point--\nwould not free States from the burden of making painful, difficult \nchoices in crafting their budgets for the current year. But it would \nhelp to lessen the impact of the cuts. It would help to soften the blow \nfrom a situation in which the States are really not to blame. It is a \ncombination of events--of declining tax revenues, lingering impact of a \nrecession, and the events of September 11--that has created the fiscal \ncrisis for our States.\n  Our legislation would help protect vital programs for those who can \nleast bear the cuts in services. To the State of Maine, our amendment \nwould mean $54 million for health care and social services that would \nhelp our most needy citizens and assist our Governor\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nand the legislature in producing a balanced budget without resorting to \ndraconian cuts that would have a terrible impact on our State citizens.\n  Congress is most effective when it stands arm in arm--not toe to \ntoe--with our partners, the States. Our States face a crisis of vast \nand still expanding dimensions. I think we need to help, and we need to \nhelp now. The longer we wait, the more difficult it is going to be for \nour partners, the States.\n  This amendment is a modest amendment. Other versions of this \namendment were far more expensive. But in recognition of the fiscal \nrealities we face, we have limited its scope. But it is an amendment \nthat would make a difference to the States and to needy citizens across \nour Nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in providing much needed \nbut temporary fiscal relief to the States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleagues and good friends, Senator Collins and Senator Rockefeller, \nin discussing this issue, and to urge the support of our colleagues as \nwe strengthen the partnership that exists between the States and the \nFederal Government as it relates to the Medicaid Program and social \nservices.\n  With the Presiding Officer having led the National Governors \nAssociation, and having served as a Governor with the Presiding Officer \nin the National Governors Association, I feel perhaps a little bit like \nI am preaching to the choir. On the other hand, I think it is important \nthat we continue to point out the challenges facing the States today \nwhich will put in doubt the continuing relationship of providing the \nkinds of benefits necessary for Medicaid and for social services.\n  There is, in fact, a partnership. It has been a partnership--a \npartnership where all the parties have responsibility and all the \nparties have an opportunity to help the most vulnerable among our \nsociety and our population. But as my colleagues have pointed out, \nStates today are experiencing the necessity of making cuts in spending \nfor important social services as well as for education and for a number \nof other programs.\n  The current economic indicators suggest it could be years before \nrevenue levels return to what they were in the late 1990s. It will \ncontinue, therefore, to be a herculean challenge for the States to \nmaintain a semblance of the services they were able to provide only a \nfew years ago. As is the case in any economic downturn, now is the time \nwhen people need the services most.\n  Senator Collins and Senator Rockefeller have indicated the importance \nof this particular legislation to their home States. I ask for the \nopportunity and the courtesy to be able to do the same.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, unemployment levels are at their \nhighest mark in 15 years. For only the second time in history, Nebraska \nwill collect less revenue this year than it did last year. When those \ntwo figures are put together, it should be abundantly clear that the \nbudget is being pressed on both sides, and eventually something will \nbreak.\n  In Nebraska, cuts have already been made to child care programs, \nrural development, and other essential services. A tax increase has \nbeen passed by the legislature. These measures might relieve the strain \nfor today and tomorrow. But next year there will be more tough choices \nand even fewer options.\n  Many of those options will likely involve cuts to Medicaid unless we \nact to provide fiscal relief. According to the National Governors \nAssociation, Medicaid spending has been a particular struggle for \nStates since expenditures have risen an average of 12 percent over the \npast 2 years while State revenues rose to a total of 5 percent--where \nthey even increased, let alone where they decreased.\n  Medicaid spending has been driven by increases in health care costs \ngenerally. For example, Medicaid costs for prescription drugs have \nincreased by 18 percent annually over the past 3 years. It has also \nbeen increased by the recession-related increases in the number of \npeople who have become eligible for Medicaid due to the downturn in the \neconomy. This continues to grow worse.\n  As we look for a solution for Medicare and the prescription drug \nbenefit that we want to see provided to our seniors and to those who \nhave the need as part of the Medicare Program, we know what the \nincrease in cost has done to the average citizen. This program has felt \nthe same impact.\n  To date, most States have been able to reduce Medicaid spending \nwithout cutting back eligibility significantly. Mr. President, 28 \nStates have failed to budget enough funds for Medicaid this year, and \nnearly all States have implemented Medicaid cost-containment measures, \nsuch as reducing some benefits, increasing beneficiary cost-sharing, or \ncutting or delaying payment to providers.\n  But as fiscal pressures continue to mount, many States are likely to \nconsider substantial reductions in Medicaid eligibility that would \nleave hundreds of thousands more children, families, and seniors \nuninsured. Medicaid, as you know, is often the second largest share of \nState budgets after education, and States have already exhausted the \ntraditional budget balancing tools, such as tapping reserve funds and \nusing one-time measures, such as using tobacco settlement funds or \nforward-funding spending programs, as well as Medicaid spending cuts \nunrelated to eligibility. But the States need help.\n  It is important that we help the States today because part of the \npartnership we have established with the States is welfare reform. To \nthe extent they are now faced with making cuts that will reverse the \nsuccess we have had in welfare reform, it would be a tremendous shame \nto sit by and not do what we can to help avoid that sort of result.\n  As you know, Medicaid, as well as the eligibility requirements and \ntransitional benefits in social services, have helped transition people \nfrom welfare to work. I think it would be a tremendous disservice if we \nsaw the absence and the withdrawal of those programs reverse the trend, \nwhere people go from work back to welfare because they lose their child \nsupport care and other valuable programs that have helped in the \ntransition.\n  For the past several months, we have been working together, Senator \nCollins and I--and we have been so pleased to have been joined by \nSenator Rockefeller in bringing about this coalition--to craft a \nmeasure to help States through this period of fiscal crisis.\n  During the journey to bring our measure to the floor, it has gone \nthrough some changes, but, more importantly, it has become even more of \na consensus measure along the way. As Senator Collins indicated, it has \nthe support of the National Governors Association, with the letter \ntoday supporting it. And these are members of all political parties, a \ntripartite group, where they are now supporting it and truly recognize \nhow important it is we work as quickly as we can to provide this \nsupport to the States.\n  The Rockefeller-Collins-Nelson amendment will provide $9 billion, as \nhas been mentioned. It is a temporary measure that will provide enough \nhelp, over the next 18 months, to ensure that low-income families, \nchildren, seniors, and persons with disabilities most affected by the \neconomic downturn will get the health care as well as the other \nservices they need. It will also help to provide financial resources \nfor various hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, doctors, and other \nproviders that offer such services.\n  It is clear this amendment is, by no means, perfect. But it is a \nconsensus amendment, and it is a step in the right direction, on a \ntemporary basis, to help the States through these difficult times and, \nmoreover, to help the residents and the citizens of the States get \nthrough this.\n  So I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and take this step to \navert, at least in part, potentially damaging cuts to Medicaid, as well \nas to other social service programs.\n  I hope, as the list of supporters is included in the Record, numerous \nsenior groups and other groups interested in the outcome of the \nMedicaid Program and social services--that that list will show there is \nstrong support, not only among the States but by those who are equally \ninterested in the outcome for seniors and for others, and that that \nsupport will encourage and bring about the support of others of our \ncolleagues, so this amendment can be adopted.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n  It appears we are going to need the requisite 60 votes for this to be \nadopted. We hope people will support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to express my concerns with Senator \nRockefeller's amendment. As you know, it would provide every state with \na 1.35 percent point increase in their Federal Medical Assistance \nPercentage, FMAP,--the amount that the Federal Government supplements \nStates for their Medicaid costs.\n  Under FMAP, Medicaid funds are distributed to States based upon a \nformula designed to provide a higher Federal matching percentage to \nthose States with lower relative per capita income, and a lower Federal \nmatching percentage to those States with higher per capita income. This \nformula, although not perfect, is justified because States cannot \nmanipulate it for their own gain; the data is periodically published \nand can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, the use of \nper capita income is a proxy for State tax capacity which, in turn, \nrelates to a State's ability to pay for medical services for needy \npeople. To put it simply: poorer states get more help than wealthier \nStates.\n  The Rockefeller amendment ignores the Medicaid formula and gives each \nState a 1.35 percent point increase. Under the amendment, states that \nhave been determined by the Medicaid formula to receive the lowest FMAP \nof 50 percent receive the greatest percentage increase in FMAP. States \nwith the highest FMAP receive the lowest percentage increase. This is \nthe exact opposite of how the funds should be allocated. The Medicaid \nformula, whatever its faults, does indicate a relative sense of need. \nIt would be wrong to the give the least needy States the largest \npercentage increase.\n  For example, Illinois' FMAP for fiscal year 2003 is 50 percent. \nIncreasing this to 51.35 percent, as the chairman's mark does, \nincreases Illinois' FMAP by 2.7 percent. Arizona's FMAP for fiscal year \n2003 is 67.25 percent. Increasing this to 68.60 percent, as the \namendment does, increases Arizona's FMAP by only 2 percent and, \nobviously, a much lower dollar figure. Illinois is receiving a 35 \npercent greater increase in its FMAP than Arizona, yet by the formula's \nstandards, Arizona has shown that it needs a far greater FMAP than \nIllinois.\n  While the amendment is supposed to be a temporary increase in the \nFMAP for just 18 months--I also worry that this temporarily increase \nwould become permanent, in which case it could cost upwards of $30 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Additionally, the Chairman of the Finance Committee had scheduled a \nmark up on a proposal similar to this amendment. Unfortunately, the \nmark up was canceled. I do not think that having an amendment on the \nSenate floor without the legislation going through the committee \nprocess is the best way to make changes in the Medicaid formula that \ncould become permanent.\n  Given these facts, I will not be able to support the Rockefeller \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there are a variety of things that \nhave been said about this amendment, and there are a few more things \nthat could be said, but, basically, the nature of the amendment has \nbeen laid out.\n  We are talking about an emergency designation. We did that in the \npre-last Christmas stimulus conference, of which I was a member, but it \ndid not get anywhere. We have talked about maintenance of effort. We \ntalked about the fact that this started out as just for Medicaid, and \nnow it is bifurcated in two parts, both of which are good. And it is a \nstronger amendment.\n  I notice the presence of my distinguished colleague, Senator Smith, \non the floor, and hope that he will have some comments he will want to \nmake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his leadership in bringing together this coalition.\n  The amendment, that I hope we soon adopt by an over 60-vote margin, \nis, in part, like what we adopted last December when, as part of the \nsupplemental bill or the stimulus package, Senator Baucus and I \nauthored an amendment that would have helped a great deal with respect \nto Medicaid in the States' use of these funds. This bill is broader. It \nallows States more discretion.\n  Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Collins, Senator Tim Hutchinson, I, and \nothers have come together to provide an amendment that our States \ndesperately need us to adopt.\n  Medicaid is an essential part of our health care safety net. Last \nyear, the Medicaid Program provided health coverage for 44 million of \nthe most vulnerable Americans 22.6 million children, 9.2 million adults \nin low-income families, and 12 million elderly and disabled.\n  One in four American children are covered by this important program. \nYet, despite the program's importance, states around the country are \nstruggling to fund their share of their Medicaid programs.\n  The National Governors' Association reported several weeks ago that \nStates are in the worst financial situation in 20 years, and that they \nexpect next year's situation to be even worse.\n  During this current fiscal year, more than 40 States are experiencing \nbudget shortfalls totaling $45 billion. To close the gaps in funding, \nmany States are cutting public education, services to the elderly, and \nhealth care to the poor--Medicaid--even as families are struggling to \nget by in the weakened economy.\n  Twenty-two States have already acted to cut costs by eliminating \nplanned expansions of Medicaid or slashing current Medicaid \neligibility.\n  To keep State budgets in balance this year, Governors have cut \nspending in many departments, tapped ``rainy day'' funds, and depleted \ntobacco settlement funds. What this means is that, as we enter 2003, \nthe one-time fixes have been used up. In the words of Idaho's Governor \nKempthorne, ``The cupboard is bare.''\n  Going into legislative session this year, my home State of Oregon \nfaced a budget shortfall of more than $800 million, and the majority of \nStates are facing similar conditions.\n  The cruel irony of this situation is that just as State revenues have \ndropped due to poor economic conditions, many more families are turning \nto Medicaid as their only source of health care.\n  I know that in Oregon, the number of people on Medicaid has risen by \nmore than 10 percent since June of last year, and I suspect that many \nof your States have experienced similar increases in demand.\n  Last year, more than 40 million Americans lived and worked without \nhealth insurance, and it is estimated that the economic downturn will \nadd another 4 million to the ranks of the uninsured.\n  The amendment before the Senate today addresses a very real \nemergency. It will allow States to continue providing health care to \nour society's most vulnerable members in this economic downturn by \nproviding a temporary increase in the federal medical assistance \nprogram, FMAP, funds States receive to pay their portion of the \nMedicaid bill.\n  It will prevent the erosion of health insurance coverage and help \nmaintain a strong health care safety net for vulnerable Americans \nduring the economic downturn.\n  By temporarily increasing the Federal portion of the Medicaid bill, \nthe scope and depth of possible State budget cuts or tax increases will \nbe lessened, minimizing the potential negative impact on the economy \nand our most vulnerable citizens across the country.\n  Including funds for States to use for a variety of social services \nwill also help provide services to the needy at a time when demand for \nsuch services is demonstrably on the rise.\n  It is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment so we can clear the 60-\nvote threshold.\n  Again, I thank our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller,\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\nfor his leadership and look forward to joining him in support of this \ncritical and timely amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Rockefeller for his \nleadership on this amendment and on health care policy. I have said to \nthe Senator from West Virginia, it is a little bit like the E.F. Hutton \nad: When E.F. Hutton speaks, people listen. Senator Rockefeller has \nthat credibility.\n  This is critically important. I know in Minnesota it is about $123 \nmillion in additional Medicaid funding. There is also the additional \nsocial services block grant money that would also come to Minnesota. \nOur State, just like many States in the country, is under siege \nfinancially.\n  The other important feature is that one of the conditions upon \nreceiving this is to not cut back on Medicaid or medical assistance \neligibility which is extremely important. People need to be able to \nkeep their health insurance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Rockefeller for stepping forward and \ntaking the lead. I indicate to my colleagues my very strong support as \na Senator from Minnesota for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from West Virginia, the \nsponsor of this amendment, the Senator from West Virginia would agree \nto a reasonable time on this amendment; would he not?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. There is not a manager on the floor, and there are other \nthings going on, such as the memorial service for the fallen police \nofficers in a few minutes. I would hope that we would be in a position \nin the near future to arrive at some reasonable time to vote on this \namendment. It appears to have wide support. I would hope on this \namendment the majority leader would not have to file a cloture motion. \nIt is my understanding that the last time there were at least eight or \nnine Republican cosponsors of this legislation; is that not true?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is correct. If the Senator will yield \nfor an additional comment.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. It is a very interesting situation because we have a \ncompromise. It has very broad support. Nobody has come to speak against \nit. There is a temptation to call for the yeas and nays; we are ready \nto vote. We could have voted on this already. We voted in the Finance \nCommittee. If we voted on the floor, this is something I think would \npass well and easily. It is incredibly important to the States. I will \nsay something about that after I yield back to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the work that has been done by the Senator. I \nhope this isn't happening. This is very typical, when someone knows \nthere is a good piece of legislation on the floor, to just ignore it \nand go away. People don't want to speak against this because States are \nhelped as a result of the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. \nIt is shaping up that maybe this will be our Friday vote. The leader \nhas indicated he will not go off this legislation at the drop of a hat. \nHe is working very hard to get a bipartisan prescription drug amendment \nadded to this underlying legislation.\n  We should move on this legislation the Senator has offered and not \nwaste time. The Senator from West Virginia or the Senator from Nevada \ncan't make that decision.\n  But we can suggest to the majority leader that it appears a big stall \nwent on here and maybe there should be a cloture motion filed on the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia. Nothing is happening here \nand this amendment has been on the floor. I have been watching all the \nfloor proceedings. Has anybody spoken against this amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator, not a single voice has been \nraised against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I say to the majority whip that \nthere is one individual--Senator Gramm of Texas--who came by as I was \nabout to speak and asked to speak before there is a vote or any final \nagreement. He intends to speak in opposition to my position. He made \nthat clear. I will not speak for him, but as a courtesy to him I note \nhis interest in making a statement in opposition.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is very perplexing, really, \nbecause I was noting when the Senator from Nebraska was here, the floor \nwas crowded with Senators on our last votes. Obviously, all of a \nsudden, the Senate floor was empty when we came to what is the single \nmost important part of the relationship with the Federal Government \nthat States are worried about and that is their Medicaid match.\n  This Senator was a Governor for 8 years. I remember what happened in \nthe early 1980s when we had the recession. I remember what happened in \nMedicaid and I remember what happened in the public employees \ninsurance. Everything sort of collapsed. And then there is this body up \nthere in Washington that thinks it is so high and mighty that it \ndoesn't need to pay attention to the problems of States. We only pay \nattention to the problems of the world and the country. This is an \nexample where this was part of the stimulus package and we were dealing \nwith the absolutely most critically important part of whether a child \neats, whether a child has medical services, whether a family has \nmedical services, and everybody is silent.\n  I have a very strong feeling that if this were taken to a vote, it \nwould get well over 60 votes. I know the Senator from Illinois is here \nand so is the Senator from Minnesota. But there is this strange \nsilence, which sounds like a rolling filibuster without voice. I think \nit is wrong. We are ready to go to a vote. I am going to keep saying \nthat because it is important.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question and comment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I urge the Senator--and I know he will do so--it is \nhard to figure out the opposition, but I hope all of us think about our \nStates. This is an enormous contribution the Senator is making.\n  I ask the Senator from West Virginia whether he intends to persevere \nand to keep it on the floor and do whatever he needs to do to bring it \nto a vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This amendment is going to be voted on.\n  I notice the presence of the distinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to speak on behalf of the Senator's \namendment. I will seek recognition on my own time if that would be \nappropriate.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I was trying to be courteous and friendly and \nencourage the Senator to speak, and he will proceed as he does so well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from West Virginia is always courteous.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us, offered by the Senator from \nWest Virginia, is one of critical importance across the Nation. In \nIllinois, we have cities large and small, hospitals large and small; \nbut we have health care needs that are universal. Whether you live in \nsmall town America or in the middle of Chicago, there is genuine \nconcern about health care and its cost.\n  Now, one of the groups of Americans that we have made a special \neffort to try to help are those who are in low-income situations. The \nMedicaid Program is an effort by our country to say that no matter how \npoor you might be, whatever your economic circumstances, we will not \nlet you go without basic medical care. That has been a commitment in \nplace for almost 50 years, and it is one that I think we honor as \nMembers of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans.\n  What the Senator from West Virginia challenges us to face is the fact \nthat the amount of money we are sending to the States to meet that \nobligation is not enough. It is not enough for several reasons. The \nstate of the economy is so poor, with unemployment, with businesses in \ntrouble, with people not receiving health insurance at their place of \nemployment. They turn in desperation to this Medicaid Program. I think \nyou will find that a substantial portion of those who turn to it are \nchildren--the children of a working mother, the\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\nchildren who otherwise might not receive the most basic medical care. \nSo the demand for services is increasing because of the sad state of \nour economy.\n  The Senator from West Virginia knows that. He comes before the Senate \nand says: If you are going to talk about health care in America, for \ngoodness' sake, be sensitive to the fact that there are more and more \npeople in desperate need. If the commitment of our Federal Government \nto Medicaid is to be honored, certainly we must pay close attention to \nthe amendment.\n  Second, he raises a serious element, which is the fact that the cost \nof this medical care is increasing. Ironically, one of the elements \nthat drives up cost is the cost of prescription drugs under the \nMedicaid Program--under virtually every health care program. So in the \nState of Illinois, in West Virginia, in North Carolina, and in \nCalifornia, when you try to keep some young person, for example, \nhealthy so they don't have to be hospitalized, under Medicaid the cost \nof prescription drugs to do it keeps increasing.\n  On a national average, the cost of prescription drugs went up 17 to \n18 percent last year. So is it little wonder that, as we look at this \nprogram, it is suffering because not only are there more demands but \nthe costs have gone up? Senator Rockefeller appropriately says to us, \nfor goodness' sake, you cannot ignore these realities. If you don't \nprovide additional resources for Medicaid, fewer people will be served \nand we will literally threaten the quality of health care to millions \nof Americans.\n\n  This bill sounds so simple--and it is--because it asks the Senate to \nkeep its word. If you are committed to the families of America, rich \nand poor, that they will not be left without quality health care, are \nyou willing to vote for it?\n  It amazes me. As the Senator comes to the floor, you would expect \nopponents of this legislation to be gathered and make the arguments \nthey are going to make. Yet you could shoot a cannon across this floor \nand not hit an opponent. No one is here. I don't know if this is an \neffort or a conspiracy of silence to not come and say anything and then \npray that the amendment doesn't come to a vote. Some colleagues live \nand dread that they may have to vote for this one way or the other.\n  I am reminded of one of my favorite colleagues from the House of \nRepresentatives, the late Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who used to say to \nme, when a tough vote would come up on the House floor: I know you \ndon't want to cast that tough vote, but if you don't want to fight \nfires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to vote on tough \nissues, don't run for Congress.\n  Well, this is a tough call. We are saying to Democrats and \nRepublicans alike: Come to the floor and vote on whether we are going \nto adequately fund Medicaid and reimburse the States that are \nstruggling with this economy. If you don't believe we should, then vote \nno. But if you believe we should, as I do, join Senator Rockefeller in \nthis effort.\n  We all know what the States are going through. There is not a State \nin the Nation that hasn't faced serious shortfalls in terms of State \nrevenue. My State of Illinois, and virtually every other State, has had \nto make cuts and changes when, in fact, each and every one of them is \npaying for them. At the same time, since September 11, all of the \nStates and localities are putting more money into security as we expect \nthem to do. They are providing law enforcement so we have a safe and \nsecure Nation. They are trying to maintain and protect our basic \ninfrastructure of America.\n  So as the economy is weakening, the demands on State revenue increase \nand the costs of the Medicaid Program go up, and Senator Rockefeller \nsays it is time for the Federal Government to meet its obligation. What \nhe has proposed that we do is to increase the Medicaid reimbursement in \nall States by 1.35 percent.\n  As I stand here and say that, many people listening to this debate \nwill say: How big a difference could that make? The fact is it could \nmake a substantial difference. It could provide our States up to $6 \nbillion over the next 18 months; $6 billion right into the Medicaid \nsystem, making certain that people receive basic health care.\n  It also says States with a lower FMAP this year than last year will \nbe held harmless. States do not lose money under this proposal. It says \nStates will also receive, if I understand correctly, $3 billion in \nfiscal relief grants for a variety of social service programs which are \nnow suffering.\n  The Urban Institute estimates that Medicaid enrollment can be \nexpected to increase because of our weak economy by approximately \n800,000 adults, 2 million children, and 260,000 people with \ndisabilities, if the unemployment rate rises from 4.5 percent to 6.5 \npercent. With that, of course, are the demands for more Federal money \nand more State money.\n  I applaud my colleague from West Virginia. We have worked on this \nbefore. We tried to bring this to the floor several different times. \nThis is the moment. If we are talking about health care costs, whether \nit is the cost of prescription drugs, the availability of generic \ndrugs, as we address each of these issues, let's not overlook the \nbasics.\n  There are many people in this country struggling to get by today, \nworking part-time, unemployed, trying to keep their children healthy. \nStates are struggling to provide the services these folks need. In my \nState, I can find them in rural areas, I am sure in Arkansas and North \nCarolina. There are many small town hospitals which are threatened with \ngoing out of existence. They are going to leave.\n  In one part of my State, as I traveled around, I said in Calhoun \nCounty: What does it mean if that local hospital closes? They said \ninstead of a woman traveling 40 miles to deliver a baby, it is 75 \nmiles. I have been through that three times with my wife, and the \nprospect of getting in a car and driving 75 miles when she thinks the \nbaby is on the way is something no father, no member of any family can \nlook forward to. That is the real world affect of this amendment.\n  If we do not provide the assistance through Medicaid for those \nhospitals and those doctors, we are going to say to some parts of \nAmerica, whether it is inner-city or rural America: You are going to \nfind a dramatic decline in the services and quality of service \navailable to you.\n  The block grant which Senator Rockefeller proposes to the States is \nalso going to help us in providing a variety of social services. This \nincrease in Federal support is essential if we are going to honor our \ncommitment to act as partners with our States to help our Nation's most \nvulnerable people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Rockefeller's amendment and \nto increase Federal assistance to States that are struggling to make \nends meet. This increase in Federal support is long overdue. We first \nstarted talking about it last November. Senator Rockefeller and I tried \nto include this in the energy package, if I am not mistaken. That was \none of our efforts. We cannot delay it further.\n  Anyone who opposes it--I hope no one does--if anyone opposes it, come \nforward, make your argument, suggest your own amendment, but for \ngoodness' sake, let's not let this important issue slide by. There are \nliterally people in communities across America who are dependent on our \ngood work, and if we do not respond to this national emergency, there \nare families and people who will suffer.\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller for his leadership on this issue. I ask \nunanimous consent to be shown as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to say a special thanks to \nSenator Rockefeller who has been tireless in this effort on behalf of \nhis constituents in West Virginia. The similarities in our States have \ncertainly given me a wonderful partner in fighting on behalf of this \nissue. We have been fighting to increase Arkansas' share of Medicaid \ndollars since last fall.\n  I remind the Senator from West Virginia that back in November, when \nwe were taking up the stimulus bill in the Finance Committee, we tried \neven there to offer this type of an amendment, to recognize the \nshortfall in our rural States and the problems they were suffering at \nthat point. We know\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nthat in terms of stimulating the economy, it is pretty hard to go to \nwork if you are sick and cannot get health care. It is pretty hard for \nchildren to learn and become a great part of the future leadership and \nthe future workforce of this country if they are sick and cannot go to \nschool.\n  Back in February, we argued to get it into a slimmed down stimulus \npackage, but we did not pass it there either.\n  I worked with Senator Rockefeller to try to amend the energy bill, \nbut we did not get a vote on that back in March. Again, in April, I \ncosponsored stand-alone legislation with Senator Rockefeller and \nSenator Smith, and in May I cosponsored stand-alone legislation with \nSenator Collins and Senator Nelson.\n  We have been working on this issue for quite some time. We recognized \nlast fall when many of our State Governors were having to take cuts \nthat those who were most vulnerable in our society were going to be \nhurt the most, and we needed to do something and we needed to act.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the amendment before us in which the two \nprevious proposals I mentioned have been merged. I thank my colleagues, \ncertainly Senator Rockefeller, Senator Smith, Senator Collins, and \nSenator Nelson for their leadership and their perseverance.\n  In times of tight budgets and economic downturns in our States, \nStates are cutting their Medicaid budgets, and we are seeing it right \nand left across this country. Who suffers because of this? Our most \nvulnerable citizens: Our low-income families, our children, and our \nsenior citizens.\n  Medicaid funding plays a critical role in senior care, with two-\nthirds of the residents of America's nursing homes depending on \nMedicaid payments for their care. But many States, including Arkansas, \nare facing real budget crunches with their Medicaid budgets. We are \nseeing, because of a multitude of other medical underpayments, whether \nit be UPL, whether it be physician payment reimbursement cuts, whether \nwe are talking about ambulance provider fee schedules, we are looking \nat a crisis in rural America in the delivery of health care.\n  It is a serious problem that we are facing now, but if we do not do \nsomething pretty quickly, we are going to see some devastation. I have \nheard from hospitals in my State that are going to, in the next couple \nof months, stop providing OB care. I have constituents at that point \nwho will have to travel 90 miles to get obstetric care. We are going \nbackward, not forward, in providing the health care across the board in \nrural areas, as well as urban areas, that is so necessary to the \nquality of life that each American deserves.\n  In Arkansas, our population of seniors is a snapshot of where the \nNation is going to be in the next few years. So we are already facing \nthe challenges with which other States will have to contend, the \nchallenges that other States will have to face in the next 10 to 15 \nyears.\n\n  It is also true that we have a disproportionately high number of \nseniors living in poverty, and many of them rely on Medicaid funding \nfor health care and long-term care. Especially in rural States such as \nArkansas where health care services are harder to come by, Medicaid \nmakes a huge difference in helping families afford care for their \nseniors.\n  We need greater investment in Medicaid funding to States, especially \nat a time when our States are in such a devastating budget situation.\n  The bills I have helped introduce in the Senate will adjust the FMAP \nlevel so that States can benefit from greater Medicaid funding, which \nwill go a long way toward helping our most vulnerable citizens, \nparticularly our seniors.\n  I appreciate the support I have received from our colleagues today, \nthose who have worked tirelessly on this issue. And I can tell you that \nwe will all keep fighting to get this done. No matter what barriers \npeople may put before us, we are going to continue to make this fight. \nI think the fact we have been doing it since last November should \nindicate to our colleagues that this is essential, we know it is \nimportant, our constituents know it is important, and the rest of the \nSenate must learn that it is important enough for us to act now.\n  Under this amendment, Arkansas stands to gain $80 million over 18 \nmonths. This is a much needed injection into our economy and into the \nquality of life of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  To my colleague from West Virginia, I thank him so much for his \nleadership on this issue. I have enjoyed working with him since last \nfall, and we are going to continue on this effort because we know how \nimportant it is to the lives of the people we represent in this body. \nIt is so important we move forward as quickly as we possibly can.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nobserve a moment of silence to honor the memory of Officer Chestnut and \nDetective Gibson.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I and other members of \nthe leadership of the Senate have joined the House of Representatives \nat the memorial entrance to have a moment of silence in memory of \nOfficer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. I know that moment of silence \nwas honored in the Senate. We do not want this moment to go by without \nmaking some specific remarks.\n  We remember today with fondness and in prayer and everlasting \ngratitude the sacrifice of two great men of peace who lost their lives \nin the line of duty in our Capitol 4 years ago at precisely 3:40 p.m.\n  Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson were part of our \ncongressional family, a family whose security was their life and for \nwhose safety they died.\n  On July 24, 1998, our gift of freedom was challenged every bit as \ndeterminedly as it was on September 11. And just as the Nation \nwitnessed on September 11, we saw on July 24, selfless protectors and \nguardians rise to the defense of the liberty of all Americans. No one \nwho was in the Capitol that day 4 years ago or who revels in the \ntriumph of democracy that this great dome symbolizes could help but be \naffected by the profound heroism of these fallen comrades, Officer \nChestnut and Detective Gibson, and also of the courage and the \ndedication and the loving of their families.\n  We cherish their memory and gratefully accept responsibility every \nday of proving ourselves worthy of their example and the cherished gift \nof freedom they left us. Our thoughts and prayers and gratitude are \nwith the Chestnut and Gibson families today and every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This is a sad day for the Capitol Hill family. Four \nyears ago today, two very good men--two members of our Capitol Hill \nfamily, Officer J.J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson--were killed \ndefending this Capitol Building.\n  As Senator Lott has noted, a few moments ago we paused for a moment \nof silence to pay tribute to these fallen heroes for their selfless \nservice and their enormous sacrifice.\n  Just before that moment of silence, there was a ceremony at the \nmemorial door entrance to this building. Under the bronze plaque that \nbears the names and likenesses of Officer Chestnut and Detective \nGibson, we laid roses in their honor.\n  Yesterday at that same spot someone left another tribute: a small \nbasket of red, white, and blue flowers. Attached to the basket was a \ncard. Inside the card was a handwritten note that read: We will never \nforget. You were my friends. God bless. It was signed by a member of \nthe Capitol Police Force.\n  Also yesterday John Gibson's beloved Boston Red Sox trounced the \nTampa Bay Devil Rays 22 to 4--in the first game of a double hitter, no \nless. So I know John Gibson is smiling up in heaven today.\n  And even though the gardening he loved is struggling in this heat and \ndrought, I am sure J.J. Chestnut is right there with him--smiling, too.\n  For those of us down here who knew them, it is a little harder to \nsmile today. The great poet Emily Dickinson wrote, after someone you \nloved dies, you feel ``the presence of their absence everywhere.''\n  The absence of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson is felt today by many \npeople, by their friends, their fellow officers, most of all by their \nfamilies, their wives and children, and in Officer Chestnut's case, his \ngrandchildren. The Gibson and Chestnut families have felt the presence \nof the absence of John and J.J. for three Thanksgivings and three \nChristmases, at too many birthday parties, weddings, and graduations.\n  Those of us who work in the Capitol want the Gibson and Chestnut \nfamilies to know that in all those moments our hearts have been with \nthem. We also want them to know that we, too, feel the presence of the \nabsence of their loved ones. We feel it when we pass the memorial door \nentrance. We feel it when we see Capitol Police officers working double \nshifts to protect us. We felt it on September 11 when our Nation was \nattacked and on October 15 when the anthrax letter was opened.\n  During this past year, we have all been reminded with terrible \ncertainty that there are people in the world who would like to destroy \nthis building, the people's House, and the government and the ideals \nfor which it stands. We also know with absolute certainty that as long \nas there are patriots such as John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut who are \nwilling to sacrifice their lives to defend our freedom and safety, this \npeople's House and this great Nation will endure.\n  As the note on the basket said: We will never forget. They were our \nfriends and our protectors. God bless them today and always.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, understanding the gravity of the \nmoment, I do not want to leave a very important piece of legislation. \nBefore I say a word, I would like to add Senator Zell Miller as a \ncosponsor to the amendment and I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as I look at the situation, we have a \nwhole lot of meetings going on around this Capitol--conference \ncommittees on trade, conference committees on prescription drugs. We \nhave a generic drug bill. That is the underlying bill here with a \nprescription drug amendment attached to it. We have a Federal matching \nMedicaid amendment which I am offering. There is so much going on on \nhealth but there is so little that is going on on health, and it \nperturbs me.\n  Senator Durbin, when he was talking, pointed out the importance of \nMedicaid to hospitals, nursing homes, and others. It makes it extremely \nimportant for me to note that in the State I represent, 80 percent of \nour hospitals are losing money. They are mostly rural hospitals, and \nmost of them depend upon Medicaid and Medicare in combination, usually \nat 85, 80, sometimes 75 percent of their total reimbursement of \neverything that they do. That is the nature of the State I represent. \nSo many others are like that. It is the nature of part of the State \nthat the Presiding Officer represents.\n  So the question of are we doing Medicaid and reimbursing States so \nthey can keep their health facilities open and Medicaid available to \ntheir people is a profoundly important matter. But we treat it as if it \nwere not.\n  We are trying our best to come to an agreement on prescription drugs. \nThere is no particular compromise in sight at the moment. We had two \nvotes yesterday. Both failed. The American people ask us: What are you \ndoing about health care for our people? My people ask, What are you \ndoing about health care for our people? What am I to answer? What am I \nto tell them?\n  I can refer, if I want, to the catastrophic health bill experience of \na number of us, where we had a terrific bill that the House turned down \nthree times, the Senate refused to turn down three times. But the point \nwas that we finally had to yield, and there was no catastrophic health \ncare bill.\n  Then we had something called the Pepper Commission where we came up \nwith a very good solution for both long term and acute care, and it \nwent nowhere. It was declared dead on arrival, and those who so \ndeclared it were correct. Nothing happened.\n  Then we had the very large health care experience of the early 1990s \nwhen everything got very politicized. The result was twofold: One, that \nwe passed nothing on that health care bill; and, two, everybody \nretreated inside their shells. Nobody seemed to want to take up health \ncare, and health care became something that somehow, either politically \nor for whatever reason--because it was complex--people did not want to \nundertake.\n  Senator Jack Danforth and I, and now Senator Frist and I, started \nsomething called the alliance for health reform. The whole idea was to \nget those who did not serve on the Finance Committee more acquainted \nwith the intricacies and difficulties of what is a very difficult \nproblem; that is, all the acronyms and complexities associated with \nhealth care. Now there are a lot more people who know a lot more about \nhealth care, and we are still not getting anything done.\n  Now we are talking about the Federal matching adjustment for Medicaid \nto our most vulnerable people, to people to whom, we go to our \nJefferson and Jackson Day Dinners, when we appeal and bring out emotion \nand speak emotionally, and then when we come up here, we do nothing to \nhelp them.\n  I put this amendment on the floor with endless cosponsors. I am \nlooking at Susan Collins, a good Republican from Maine, and there she \nstands, perhaps ready to speak, and she and seven other Republicans are \ncosponsors of this amendment. Senator Zell Miller just became a \ncosponsor. So we have, I don't know, 35, 40 sponsors.\n\n  I come to two conclusions. No 1, I think this amendment is going to \npass and that there may be those who are not coming to this floor to \nspeak against it because they do not want to because they know their \nGovernors feel so passionately about it. Whether they be Republican, \nDemocratic, or Independent, Governors are absolutely passionate about \npassing this amendment. But they cannot do it. We have to do it for \nthem.\n  We are not doing universal health care. We haven't done anything on \nprescription drugs yet. We have not done a generic drug bill yet. We \nhave not done anything about importation. We passed a bill--the White \nHouse said they do\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nnot want to implement it--about bringing drugs in from Canada, produced \nhere, at a lower cost.\n  So we are talking, debating, having compromises, having caucuses, and \nwe are not accomplishing anything. Here is an amendment in which we can \ndo something real for the people in our States who need it. They are \nnot just children, but that is a very basic part of it. It is also \nreimbursement for hospital facilities. It is reimbursement for skilled \nnursing facilities, for nursing homes. And they need it more than ever \nbecause Medicaid is the one program in government, other than the \nVeterans Administration, which does have prescription drugs. It does \nhave prescription drugs.\n  As the Presiding Officer has said so many times so eloquently as the \nleader of this fight, the cost of prescription drugs has been going up \nin a terrifying manner in these last several years. Who bears the brunt \nof that? Medicaid. Medicaid bears the brunt of it. And here we are \ntrying to do something which the States cannot do for themselves, which \nwe can do for them, which they are unanimously--Republicans, Democrats \nand Independent--on record unanimously wanting.\n  I stand here on the floor accompanied only by a distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine and the distinguished Presiding Officer. I find this \nperplexing and troubling. Are we risk averse? Have we become risk \naverse? That is a health care term. Maybe it ought to be a Senate term. \nHave we become afraid of doing things which require tough votes?\n  As the Senator from Illinois said, this is a very easy process. \nPeople put legislation forward, it goes through committees or doesn't \ngo through committees, it comes to the floor, doesn't come to the \nfloor, but if it comes to the floor, then you have a chance to vote on \nit. If people want to filibuster it, then you can file a cloture \nmotion, you wait 2 days, and you get a vote on it. People have to \neventually vote up or down, or else, as the Senator from Illinois said, \nthey should not be in this profession.\n  I conclude with a sense of awe and tremendous anger, I would say to \nthe Presiding Officer. I started out my career in public life--which I \nnever intended to enter and which my parents were not fond of as a \ncareer. They were not pleased as I entered it as a career.\n  I went to a little coal mining community in the State of West \nVirginia which was nothing but people who had no health insurance, who \nwanted to work but had no job, who wanted to go to school but had no \nbus. They had one 1-room school through the sixth grade, 1 through 6, \nlined up row by row, just in a row.\n  They fed me; they took care of me; we worked together; we developed \ncommunity programs. They had something called the dollar-an-hour \nprogram in West Virginia. You went out and you worked and you cleaned \nup the roads--men for the most part, at that point--and you got $1 an \nhour. Glory be, you got 8 hours a day. Any health insurance? Of course \nnot. Nobody had health insurance. No one had health insurance.\n  That seared my soul then, and it sears me today, and it sears me as I \ntalk now, as we sit here and avoid a chance to vote on something with \nwhich we can immediately help our States and our people. Are we only to \nlegislate on Afghanistan or broad national concepts or are we here to \nhelp people? Is there something wrong, in fact, about actually doing \nsomething which would help people?\n  Some people say it would because it would cost money. Then why was it \nthey put this in the emergency supplemental? They put the Medicaid \nmatch formula in the emergency supplemental because it was considered \nthat important to the country. And now here we are, 9 months later, 10 \nmonths later--whatever it is--and we have done absolutely nothing. This \nSenator is tired of it. This Senator is very pleased to note that, with \neight Republican cosponsors and a whole lot of people waiting to vote \nfor this, there is a cloture motion being filled out, and we are going \nto vote on this, and we are going to show the people of our States that \nwe care about our children and our families, our prescription drug \nprograms, and that we are not risk averse. We are quite capable, yes, \nof helping people when it comes to health care. We have not shown that \nvery much in recent years. We are going to show it this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I share the concern of the Senator from \nWest Virginia that we should not delay action on this important matter.\n  Support for our proposal is growing with each hour. I am excited \nabout that. This proposal offers real relief to our State governments \nthat are struggling with budget shortfalls. But, most importantly, it \noffers the promise that low-income families who depend on Medicaid will \nnot face a cutoff of some of their important benefits.\n  The Senator from West Virginia raises a very good point. There are \nhealth care providers in my State, as well as his, rural hospitals in \nparticular, that are struggling to make ends meet. The threat of \nMedicaid cuts imposed by States trying to balance their budgets during \nthis very difficult fiscal time poses a threat to their ability to \ncontinue to provide quality care.\n  That is why we have the support of so many health care provider \ngroups.\n  I am going to read from some of letters that we have received that \nendorse our proposal. In some cases, the letters speak to earlier \nlegislation that I introduced along with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Ben Nelson of Nebraska. But, as I said earlier, we have pooled \nour efforts because we want to get relief to the States as fast as \npossible.\n  Let me tell you what our visiting nurses say about the importance of \nproviding this relief.\n  This is a letter that I will read from the Visiting Nurse \nAssociations of America. It is signed by the president, Carolyn Markey.\n  She writes:\n\n       On behalf of the Visiting Nurse Associations of America \n     (VNAA), I would like to express our strong support for you \n     and Senator Ben Nelson's proposed legislation that would \n     provide temporary fiscal relief to states for Medicaid-\n     covered health care services. VNAA is the national membership \n     association for non-profit, community-based Visiting Nurse \n     Agencies (VNAs), which collectively care for approximately \n     50% of all Medicaid home health patients each year.\n       VNAA is concerned that approximately one-half of the states \n     across the nation have had to cut their FY 2002 Medicaid \n     budgets in order to avoid a budget crisis. We fear that the \n     majority of states will implement additional cost-containment \n     measures, including reducing benefits, increasing beneficiary \n     cost-sharing and further reducing Medicaid reimbursement to \n     health care providers.\n       On average, Medicaid already reimburses providers \n     significantly less than the cost of care.\n\n  That is an important point. There are already reimbursement levels \nthat aren't covering the cost of providing this essential care.\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       VNAA's 2001 data shows that, collectively, VNAs are \n     incurring an average $565 loss per Medicaid patient, with an \n     annual loss of $148,500. VNAs' mission is to provide care to \n     all eligible persons regardless of their condition or ability \n     to pay. Because of this mission, VNAs will attempt to \n     continue to admit all eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, but \n     subsidizing Medicaid will force VNAs to cut other social \n     service programs that are funded through charity \n     contributions, such as Meals on Wheels and preventive health \n     clinics.\n       Your legislation is sorely needed at this time. It would \n     help states maintain eligibility and program levels in order \n     for low-income families, children, seniors and persons with \n     disabilities to continue to receive the health care they \n     need. It will also prevent the exodus of some providers from \n     Medicaid participation, and prevent other providers from \n     having to cut vital community-based social services.\n\n  Those are the stakes. The stakes are high.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the letter from \nCarolyn Markey, the president of the Visiting Nurse Associations of \nAmerica, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Visiting Nurse Associations\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2002.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Visiting Nurse \n     Associations of America (VNAA), I would like to express our \n     strong support for your and Senator Ben Nelson's proposed \n     legislation that would provide temporary fiscal relief to \n     states for Medicaid-covered health care services. VNAA is the \n     national membership association for non-profit, community-\n     based Visiting Nurse\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\n     Agencies (VNAs), which collectively care for approximately \n     50% of all Medicaid home health patients each year.\n       VNAA is concerned that approximately one-half of the states \n     across the nation have had to cut their FY 2002 Medicaid \n     budgets in order to avoid a budget crisis. We fear that the \n     majority of states will implement additional cost-containment \n     measures, including reducing benefits, increasing beneficiary \n     cost-sharing and further reducing Medicaid reimbursement to \n     health care providers.\n       On average, Medicaid already reimburses providers \n     significantly less than the cost of care. VNAA's 2001 data \n     shows that, collectively, VNAs are incurring an average $565 \n     loss per Medicaid patient, with an annual loss of $148,500. \n     VNAs' mission is to provide care to all eligible persons \n     regardless of their condition or ability to pay. Because of \n     this mission, VNAs will attempt to continue to admit all \n     eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, but subsidizing Medicaid \n     will force VNAs to cut other social service programs that are \n     funded through charity contributions, such as Meals on Wheels \n     and preventive health clinics.\n       Your legislation is sorely needed at this time. It would \n     help states maintain eligibility and program levels in order \n     for low-income families, children, seniors and persons with \n     disabilities to continue to receive the health care they \n     need. It will also prevent the exodus of some providers from \n     Medicaid participation, and prevent other providers from \n     having to cut vital community-based social services.\n       Thank you for all you do for the nation's most vulnerable \n     populations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carolyn Markey,\n                                                President and CEO.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I see the Senator from New York is in \nthe Chamber. If he would like to speak on this issue at this point, I \nwould be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Maine, and I \nthank her for her leadership on this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his sponsorship of this \nimportant legislation. He has done a great job on every aspect of this \nproposal. I want to once again clarify for the record the help he has \nbeen not only on this issue, not only on adding prescription drugs to \nMedicare, but on generic drugs as well. We all owe the Senator from \nWest Virginia a debt of gratitude for the great work he has done on the \ngeneric drug issue.\n  This is an extremely important amendment that I am proud to support. \nMy State, as so many of the States, is in fiscal trouble. We have found \ngreat difficulty in doing what we have to do. Our State tends to be a \ngenerous State in terms of health care benefits. Programs enacted \nthroughout the years make our Medicaid benefit generous. We have gone \nbeyond Medicaid. We tried to help a little bit on prescription drugs \nwith the Epic Program, as I know 17 other States have done a little bit \nhere and there. We tried to help in a whole variety of ways.\n  During times of prosperity, we do quite well. But, obviously, the \nattacks of September 11, which cost us dearly in terms of life, and \nthen secondarily in terms of dollars, as well as the downturn in the \nfinancial markets, which probably hit our State harder than any other, \nhave caused real problems. If there was ever a time that this amendment \nwas appropriate for New York, it is now.\n  I think the amendment is appropriate to all of our States. Not only \nare they all under fiscal strains--my State may be under greater strain \nthan others--but we all know that Medicaid spending is probably the \nfastest growing part of most State budgets. It is certainly mine.\n  I would add one other point about New York. Our localities will get \nhelp, if this aid passes, because we are one of the few States where we \nask the localities to pay half of the non-Federal share of Medicaid. In \nother words, we are 50-25-25. A city such as New York that is \nstraining--our budget deficit is about $4 billion in the next fiscal \nyear, it is estimated, and some estimates go as high as $5 billion--\nwould also get a real shot in the arm. Our communities upstate are \nhurting because of the poor economy--Buffalo, Albany, Rochester, \nBinghamton, and Utica are all hurting and need the help as well.\n  Certainly, the amendment is needed from a fiscal point of view. \nCertainly, it helps the Medicaid Program meet the promise that was made \nearly on in terms of its help. It is appropriate that it be added to \nthis bill.\n  If you ask the States the No. 1 cause of their fiscal problems, most \nof them would say it is Medicaid. Then, if you ask the head of Medicaid \nin each State what the No. 1 reason is for costs going up, that person \nwould say prescription drugs. In fact, Medicaid drug costs nationally \nhave increased 18 percent every year for the past 3 years. That is \nsomething that cannot keep going on.\n  Our States are now faced with terrible choices--either go more deeply \ninto debt or cut benefits to the most vulnerable. That is something we \nreally do not want to do.\n  I support the amendment. It would be a tremendous shot in the arm for \nNew York. It would be a tremendous shot in the arm to all State \ngovernments. And it is the right thing to do.\n  The cost is large. I believe it is something like $8 billion. But the \nbenefits are larger still.\n  Every time any part of America has a child who doesn't get the \nappropriate coverage, it sets him back or her back--it sometimes sets \nthe family back in ways from which they never recover. The fact that \nour country has decided to say health care for everyone is important--\nand not say because you have no money you should get no health care--is \none aspect that makes us a great country. The fact that today we are \nsaying that during this time of crisis, the Federal Government will \nstep up to the plate and fulfill its role is really important.\n  Let me go over the numbers for New York.\n  In fiscal year 2002, if the Rockefeller-Collins-Nelson amendment were \nadopted, we would receive, in terms of our Medicaid help, $244 million. \nThis is the temporary FMAP increase. In 2003, we would receive $553.8 \nmillion. That means, for the total of the 18 months--the second half of \n2002 and all of 2003--it would be $797.8 million.\n  In terms of temporary grants, we would get an additional--these are \navailable through 2004--an additional $461 million.\n  That is $1.2 billion. That is real help. That is not just a nice \nlittle bauble around the edges. And it could not come at a more \nappropriate, needed time in my State.\n  So I say to my colleagues, you all have your problems in your States. \nWe have our problems in New York. Let's unite. This amendment is a \nbipartisan amendment. Let's unite and adopt it.\n  Let's make sure that our poor people get the medical help they need. \nAnd let us say to the States that during these extremely difficult \ntimes--as I say, made doubly difficult in New York because we were the \nepicenter of the 9/11 attacks--we are not going to punish you because \nof your generosity in helping the poor attain some modicum of health \ncare.\n  So I am proud to support the amendment. Again, I compliment my \ncolleague from West Virginia, who has been such a leader on this issue, \nas on so many others. I thank my colleague from Maine as well.\n  I look forward to quickly adopting this amendment as part of our base \nbill which, as you know, I am proud is the bill that Senator McCain and \nI introduced in terms of generic drugs.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the National Partnership for Women and \nFamilies has issued a statement today endorsing the amendment I have \noffered with Senators Rockefeller, Ben Nelson, and Gordon Smith. It \nincludes some very important information that helps us better \nunderstand why this debate is so important.\n  The National Partnership cites the National Governors Association's \nMay report that over 40 States are facing budget shortfalls totaling \n$40 to $50 billion overall.\n  Since Medicaid makes up, on average, 20 percent of State spending, it \nis often the first place that States look to make cuts. So our \namendment would provide $9 billion in total fiscal relief that would \nhelp sustain critical State Medicaid Programs and bolster the States' \nability to keep providing vital social services to those most in need.\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\n  Let's look at whom this benefits.\n  Medicaid provides health insurance to approximately 40 million low-\nincome Americans, including 21 million children and young adults, 11 \nmillion elderly and disabled individuals, and 8.6 million adults in \nfamilies, most of whom are single mothers. That is the population that \nis hurt when Medicaid budgets are slashed. That is the most vulnerable \nof populations. They need our help.\n  The States need our help in order to maintain vital health care \nservices for those 40 million low-income Americans. Without this \ncritical safety net, millions of women and their families would be left \nwith no health insurance at all.\n  So that is why we must act. And we must act before more time elapses \nand more States are forced to cut their Medicaid budgets. Time is of \nthe essence.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in supporting this absolutely \ncritical bipartisan proposal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, the proposal that is before \nthe body today, to enhance the partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States with regard to Medicaid and with regard to \nwelfare reform and social services that are so critical to the most \nvulnerable in our society, is a very important piece of legislation.\n  It merits our total support, not because it is just about money but \nbecause it is about doing the right thing to continue the gains and not \nsee a spiral downwards back to welfare for those who have been able to \nmake it to the workforce. It is for those who are teetering on the \nbrink who would, if their eligibility for Medicaid were taken away, be \nunable to support themselves and/or their families. It is for the \nseniors who need, so much today, the kind of support the Medicaid \nProgram provides when they are in nursing homes.\n  So it is about people. That is what it is truly about. It is about \ndoing the right thing. It is continuing the relationship and the \npartnership that has been developed between our Governors, our State \nlegislatures, and our Federal Government. It is an important \npartnership that must be maintained.\n  It is also important that we recognize it is a temporary fix. It is \nnot a permanent solution. No one is expecting that kind of a permanent \nsolution today, given the temporary, and hopefully only temporary, \nnature of the downturn in the economy. But it is essential we do \nsomething soon because of the plight of the States and the experience \nthey have in terms of not being able to meet all of their obligations \nas they move forward on these programs.\n  The truth of the matter is, we can work together with the States as \nwe have in the past. Many of our colleagues here, as you know, are \nformer Governors. You may be able to take us out of the Governor's \noffice, but you cannot take the experiences we have gained in that \nposition away from us simply because we have changed our titles or we \nhave new responsibilities.\n  It is important, also, that we recognize that the States, in making \nthese tough decisions, will have to make them on the basis of how they \nbalance their budgets because all but a handful have to balance their \nbudgets and can't have deficit spending. So they either balance their \nbudgets with major cuts or with tax hikes or with a combination.\n  In any event, most of the States have made the cuts they believe they \ncan make, up until this point, without affecting Medicaid. But as their \nbudgets continue to flow with red ink, now they are looking at these \nsocial programs for the necessary cuts. They have cut education. They \nhave cut many of the other essential programs. Now they are faced with \ncutting this program.\n  So if we wait until they have made the cuts, there will be the \ncasualties of those who are not able to have the benefits--the elderly, \nthe young people, those who in our society today are reliant on the \navailability of these programs.\n  We have asked people to work their way out of welfare, to join the \nworkforce. We have created at the State level, with welfare reform at \nthe Federal level, the opportunity for people to transition out of the \nlevels of poverty and welfare, with the opportunity to join the \nworkforce. We have done it with transitional benefits that are \ncomprised of child care, some Medicaid continuing coverage, so these \nindividuals and their families have the capacity to leave the welfare \nrolls to join the workforce.\n  If we pull back on these and other programs like it, they will \nteeter, and it is very likely that they will fall back into the welfare \nsituation. While already experiencing higher unemployment levels than \nwe have experienced over the last 10 years, we see that the growing \npopulation of Medicaid is putting more pressure on Medicaid \nexpenditures at the State level.\n  I remember looking at the growth of Medicaid and the opportunities \nthat were there to try to reform it and to make it so it worked not to \ncreate incentives for unemployment but opportunities for employment and \nincentives for joining the workforce. But when you see it today and you \nsee the growth in this program, you recognize that something must be \ndone in order to stem that growing tide.\n  The truth is, we can and we should do this. There will be some who \nwill say we don't have an obligation, a further obligation to the \nStates. But it is not about just from one government to another; it is \nabout to the people of the United States who have the need for these \nvery important benefits. Those are the people we need to be supporting. \nIn supporting them, we work through the States in our partnership.\n  That is the opportunity we have. I hope if there are some who have a \ndifferent, opposing point of view, they will come down to the floor and \nexplain why they don't think we ought to support this Federal Medicaid \nassistance program on a temporary basis to permit the States to \ncontinue to support the kinds of programs that are important to the \nmost vulnerable of our population. I hope they will come to the Chamber \nso we have the opportunity for a full debate and so, if there are \nopposing views, we will be able to respond to them rather than speak to \nan empty Chamber. That is not what this should be about. If there is to \nbe spirited debate, I hope we will have that begin in the near future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would like to direct a question through \nthe Chair to my friend from West Virginia, the author of the amendment. \nI was here about an hour and a half ago. I ask the Senator from West \nVirginia if anyone has spoken against the merits of his amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator from Nevada, I am not sure, but \nI believe Senators have been here discussing it favorably for 2 to 2\\1/\n2\\ hours. Not a single Senator has come to the floor opposing this \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friends, whoever opposes this amendment, I \ndon't know where they are. We were told by one of the sponsors of the \namendment, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, that he \ndidn't oppose it, but he, on information and belief, understood that \nthe senior Senator from Texas opposed the amendment. I would hope that \nmy friend from Texas, if that, in fact, is the case, would come here \nand defend his position. I will say that if that isn't the case, that I \nwill ask for the yeas and nays and move forward on the amendment. It is \njust simply not fair.\n  We have an order in effect that as soon as this amendment is \ncompleted, we would move to something that Senator Gregg or someone he \ndesignates would offer. And then following that we have a Democratic \namendment in order. We should move through those. I hope that if there \nare people other than the distinguished Senator from Texas who oppose \nthis amendment or the Senator from Texas, that they would come to the \nfloor and explain themselves.\n  I will say that I am getting the feeling that this is one of those \nkinds of\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nstealth oppositions we get around here a lot of times. People know this \nis a good amendment, supported by the Governors of the States, \nsupported by people in the States who are desperate for dollars. States \nare suffering. I think there are people who would like to come and \noppose this, but they really don't quite know why. So they just stay \naway hoping it will go away.\n  It is not going to go away. If I come back here again and there is no \none within a reasonable period of time who has voiced any opposition to \nthe amendment or there is no one on the floor speaking against it, I \nwill ask for the yeas and nays and move on to something else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, the National Governors \nAssociation has written a letter, dated July 24--very current--to the \nminority and majority leaders of the Senate strongly urging support for \nthe Rockefeller-Collins-Nelson-Smith compromise.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print it in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                National Governors\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: The nation's \n     Governors strongly support the Rockefeller-Collins-Nelson-\n     Smith compromise state fiscal relief legislation. We urge its \n     consideration as an amendment to S. 812 on the Senate floor \n     and its swift passage into law.\n       The legislation to temporarily increase the federal share \n     of the Medicaid program as well as provide a temporary block \n     grant to states will assist during the current fiscal crisis \n     so that states will not be forced to make deep cuts in \n     health, social services, and even education programs. It will \n     thus ensure that low-income vulnerable families are protected \n     from drastic cuts in these key programs.\n       One of the major contributors to the rising state Medicaid \n     costs is prescription drug expenses. Immediate Federal \n     assistance with these costs would provide real fiscal relief \n     to the states. We urge timely Senate action on the \n     Rockefeller-Collins-Nelson-Smith amendment.\n       We would very much appreciate your support and we look \n     forward to working with you to ensure that meaningful state \n     fiscal relief legislation is enacted.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul E. Patton,\n       Governor.\n     Dirk Kempthorne,\n       Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia, in my \nview, has outlined a very important position with respect to a critical \nhealth issue for the States. I commend him for his outstanding work. It \nis going to make a difference in Oregon and across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. WYDEN are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am a strong supporter of the \nRockefeller amendment which will make a huge difference for our States \nat a time when the situation is truly dire with respect to health care. \nSo I thank my colleague. When we get to a vote on the Rockefeller \namendment--I know Senator Nelson of Nebraska has done excellent work on \nthis as well--I hope the amendment will pass with a resounding \nmajority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wanted to speak on a couple of issues. \nFirst is the underlying effort here to pass major legislation in the \narea of assisting senior citizens, specifically, with the cost of their \nprescription drugs.\n  I think we all understand very well that there has been a fundamental \nshift in the way medicine is practiced in our country, and it has been \na positive shift. That shift is that we have gone from a society which \nhad basically as its first line of defense for significant health \nconcerns an invasive medical procedure using a scalpel, to a society \nwhich has as its first line of defense for major medical concerns the \nuse of pharmaceuticals. This has been a revolution, a biotech \nrevolution.\n  As a result, it is not so much that pharmaceuticals have become more \nexpensive--but not outrageously so, with respect to inflation and other \ncosts--but they have become so much more aggressively utilized. As a \nresult, senior citizens and all citizenry that have medical concerns \nare finding that they are more often than not going down to the \npharmacy and purchasing a pill in order to address a physical ailment \nversus going into the hospital and receiving some sort of remedial \nmedical care that might involve an operation or some sort of therapy \nwithin the physical confines of a hospital. So utilization has gone up \ndramatically in the area of pharmaceuticals. This is a change in the \nway we practice medicine as a country.\n  The practical effect of that is that all Americans, but seniors \nespecially because as a practical fact, as people begin to get older, \nthey have more health needs in most instances.\n  Seniors are finding themselves more and more put into the situation \nof having to purchase pharmaceutical goods, which are adding up, and \nbecause there is more significant utilization, they are expensive and \nsometimes unaffordable, especially to low-and middle-income seniors. So \nwe as a Congress and the President are attempting to address this \nthrough passing some sort of a package that will give senior citizens \nthe opportunity to take some of the pressure off of the cost of this \nnew need to use prescription drugs.\n  The goal, in my opinion, should be basically twofold: One, to assure \nthat low- and moderate-income seniors--especially low-income seniors--\nwho find it virtually impossible to fit into their budgets, which are \nusually very constricted, the cost of pharmaceuticals, to allow those \nindividuals to receive assistance as they have to purchase these \nmedications; second, to address the situation where a senior who has \nreasonable income and reasonable wealth confronts a catastrophic \nsituation where simply the cost of medication exceeds even their \ncapacity to pay for it. Those should be our two primary goals as we put \ntogether this package of relief for senior citizens, in my opinion.\n\n  Also, there are a lot of secondary goals. Secondary goals should be--\nand it is fairly significant--that we do not undermine the ability of \nour society to bring new drugs to the market.\n  As a society, we have basically become the creators of most of the \nmajor new pharmaceuticals that are created in this world, and that is \nbecause we have a vibrant research capability going on in this country \nand a vibrant commercialization of goods and products which are created \nwithin that research market. It is important that we not kill the goose \nthat is laying the lifesaving drug, as I said earlier, and that we \nallow the entrepreneurs in our society, who are research scientists for \nthe most part, to evolve a capability of continuing to bring to market \ndrugs which save people's lives and benefit people and make their lives \nbetter, and that we not in the process of developing a package of drug \nbenefits end up creating an atmosphere which works against the bringing \nto market of new pharmaceutical drugs. That should be a subsidiary \neffort as we move forward to address the question of a drug benefit for \nsenior citizens.\n  In that context, we are now working aggressively to try to pull \ntogether a\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\npackage. We have had three major votes on different drug packages. We \nhad the Democratic proposal which, regrettably, was, in my opinion, \nfundamentally flawed because it did not meet the conditions I have laid \nout.\n  First, it was extraordinarily expensive, and I should have mentioned \nthat as a fourth line of consideration, which is that as we put this \nbenefit package in place for seniors, we should not have it created in \nsuch a way that it transfers a huge new cost on to working Americans, \nespecially young Americans with young families, who are trying to make \nends meet, who have other issues, such as education, housing, the day-\nto-day costs of raising a family.\n  We should not make the cost of this major new drug benefit so high \nthat the tax burden to pay for it--which will fall on working Americans \nfor the most part will significantly disadvantage working Americans in \ntheir ability to live a good life.\n  This new drug benefit is not like the Medicare proposals under which \nwe presently work. There is no premium in most instances. Some have \npremiums, most do not. There is also no earned benefit--in other words, \nover the years people paying into the Part A insurance fund and \nbuilding up a fund. In this instance, seniors are going to simply \nreceive this benefit without it having been paid for through building \nit up over the years, paying through Part A. It is essentially going to \nbe a tax. To pay for this drug benefit, there is going to be a tax \nlevied on working Americans, especially young Americans, to assist \nsenior citizens with the issue of how they pay for drugs.\n  We have to be very careful in putting this package together that we \ndo not end up putting such a huge burden on young working Americans \nthat it makes it very difficult for them to raise their families.\n  As I mentioned, there have been three votes on this issue in the \nSenate in the last few days. The first was on the Democratic plan. The \nDemocratic plan failed in a number of areas.\n\n  One, it was extraordinarily expensive. It would have passed $600 \nbillion--and that was the estimate. We all know estimates end up being \nlow. For example, when Medicare was originally passed in the 1960s, it \nwas estimated in 1990 to cost $9 billion. Medicare in 1990 cost about \n$70 billion. It was off by almost 1,000 percent. We know the $600 \nbillion pricetag attached to the Democratic package is a pricetag which \nis probably low. Even if it were accurate, it is a huge pricetag to \npass on to working Americans, younger Americans, and far more than we \nshould put on the backs of the working American who is trying to raise \nthat young family. It is far too high a burden on those individuals.\n  It is disproportionate in the way it deals with the intergenerational \nissues in benefiting dramatically, in terms of dollars spent, senior \ncitizens at the expense of young Americans who are trying to raise a \nfamily. It exceeded the budget allocation by $300 billion, by 100 \npercent. There was $300 billion budgeted. This was a $600 billion \npackage, which is far too expensive.\n  Also, it undermined the marketplace. It was a public program, which \nin and of itself is an undermining of the marketplace, but it was a \npublic program which had an incredibly regressive element to it. It \nessentially said that you could only, for a certain ailment--let's take \narthritis--purchase one type of drug for that ailment, one. There are \nprobably 20 different drugs on the market to address arthritis. Why \nwould you limit the ability of a senior to only purchase one and have \nit covered by insurance? It is a foolish idea from the standpoint that \ndoctors may not want to prescribe that one drug, and it may not be \nmedically a good idea, plus it is just not conducive to creating a \nmarketplace which is going to bring more pharmaceuticals on to the \nmarket so seniors have more choices and that we drive down the prices \nof pharmaceuticals generally because we have competition.\n  It is truly a regressive idea from the standpoint of health care and \nfrom the standpoint of how you develop a strong and vibrant market for \nproducing pharmaceuticals. That bill, in my opinion, was fundamentally \nflawed. Plus, of course, it had the little gimmick in it--rather large \nactually--that it was not a permanent benefit. It lapsed after 5 years. \nIt would not exist anymore. I do not know what was going to happen \nthen. It would be gone and who knew what was going to happen.\n  It was a black hole or a cliff proposal where everybody gets a \nbenefit for 5 years and suddenly they look down and there is no more \nbenefit and they have to step off the cliff into the abyss, not knowing \nwhat is going to happen. It was a poorly constructed idea and it failed \nbecause it did not get 60 votes.\n  The second idea that came through was the tripartisan proposal. \nAgain, it is a fairly expensive proposal, $370 billion, but \nsignificantly less than the Democratic proposal, but much more \nreasonable in the way it approached the issue. It opened the \nmarketplace. It gave seniors options as to what pharmaceuticals they \ncould use.\n  Senator Snowe was talking about how many more pharmaceuticals it \ncovered than the Democratic proposal, dramatically more. I am not sure \nof the numbers. In any event, the specific numbers were that it covered \nfar more specific pharmaceutical products, and made those available \nto seniors, than the Democratic plan--dramatically more.\n\n  In addition, it had language which significantly protected the low-\nincome senior. It gave them basically a 90-percent subsidy and had \npositive catastrophic language.\n  That also failed to get 60 votes.\n  The third vote we had was on the Hagel-Ensign proposal, which is an \nidea I am attracted to, although I also voted for the tripartisan plan. \nIt says what I have been saying. You take low-income seniors and \nprotect them. You give them the ability to buy the pharmaceutical, you \ngive them support to do that and it does not wipe out their income. The \nplan was very progressive in this way.\n  You say to seniors, who are in the general population, who are not \nlow-income seniors: If you have a serious illness which throws you into \na high-cost pharmaceutical situation, and you are spending a dramatic \namount of your basic wealth, your income, your assets on \npharmaceuticals, the Government will come in and pick it up. There was \na catastrophic cap which the Government picked up.\n  Again, this was built in, as I understood it, in a progressive way so \nhigher income people had to spend more than middle- and moderate-income \npeople had to spend. It was very progressive in a thoughtful way. This \nidea made a lot of sense and got a very good vote. In fact, it got as \nhigh a vote as any other proposal that came to the floor. I hope from \nthis idea we can evolve a package that can work effectively.\n  That is basically where we stand today. We have now had three major \npackages. None have passed because the sequence of events that are set \nup is that the Democratic leadership refused to take these bills \nthrough committee and created a situation where we could not pass them \non the floor because they all required 60 votes.\n  Had Hagel-Ensign, for example, come out to the floor after having \ngone through the committee, with the vote it got on this floor it would \nhave passed the Senate, and we would now have in place a drug benefit. \nIt would not have been subject to a budget point of order because it \nwas under $300 billion--just barely, $294 billion. That was not allowed \nto happen because of the way this whole exercise was set up, which is \nunfortunate.\n  Where do we go from here? It is my hope we will reach some sort of \nconsensus on a catastrophic package, a package that takes care of low-\nincome seniors and makes sure they have adequate coverage, that takes \ncare of people who have a huge impact on their assets through a \ncatastrophic event, and allows seniors who have moderate income, if \nthey wish, to purchase the insurance if they want to cover the \ndifference through some sort of Medigap insurance. This, to me, is a \nlogical way of resolving this issue.\n  Independent of all that, however, we have had other amendments \ndealing with this bill. One of them is the amendment which we presently \nhave before us which is a $9 billion bailout for the States--some \nStates, not all States. States such as mine, which do not happen to \nmeet the formula because we have been very frugal in the way we have \nmanaged our Medicaid accounts and, as a result, have kept our \nreimbursement at 50 percent, do not benefit a whole lot from this \nproposal.\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\nFor States which have been less effective in their ability to deal with \nMedicaid, this bill basically is a $9 billion bailout. Is the $9 \nbillion offset? No, it will simply be a vote by the Senate which says \nwe are going to spend another $9 billion on Medicaid to assist the \nStates.\n  First off, this is the wrong place to bring forth this amendment. \nThis bill started out as a generic drug bill. It has moved on to an \nall-inclusive drug bill debate, but it has always been a bill that has \nbeen debated in the context of Medicare and drug initiatives, and this \nis a Medicaid bailout, which is totally separate from the underlying \nissue of what we discussed in these other bills. This amendment should \nhave gone through committee and should have been brought out here as a \ncommittee bill versus being brought out here separately.\n  Secondly, it sets a very dangerous precedent in that it waters down \nthe FMAP formula even on a temporary basis. The purpose and fairness of \nthe formula will be eroded over time. Around here, temporary changes \nrarely turn out to be temporary, although they claim it is temporary.\n  This amendment sets a precedent, and if it is passed, any State that \never faces an FMAP decrease in the future will lobby Congress to \noverride the formula. Instead of an automatic process based on a fair \nformula, future FMAP rates will become a political fight in Congress, \nwhich is exactly what this exercise is.\n  It is basically an attempt to use the fact that a number of States \nbelieve they need more money and to pull enough people together from \nthose States so there are enough to vote for this $9 billion bailout. \nIt is called logroll. It is working very effectively on this amendment, \nI am afraid, which is too bad.\n  This is totally fiscally irresponsible. Such a process as this \ndisrupts the whole process and will not likely produce a program that \nbenefits those who need it most but, rather, States that have been most \nineffective in managing their Medicaid accounts.\n  FMAP rates are not designed to change according to short-term \neconomic developments. Although FMAPs are based on State per capita \nincome levels and other economic indicators, they have not typically \nrisen at all and with short-term economic trends. If State logic \nsuggests raising FMAP now, then it would also apply to lowering them in \ntimes of economic boom.\n  If we had followed such a course after 9 years of economic recovery, \ncurrent FMAP rates would be much lower than they are today. Such \ncyclical movements are contrary to the intent of Medicaid statutes and \nin the long term would serve the interests neither of the States nor \nthe Federal Government to pursue this action.\n  States have other options to making Medicaid benefits more secure. \nStates can take steps to make their benefits more efficient, enabling \nmore persons to be covered with the same or lower costs using the \nhealth insurance flexibility and accountability initiatives unveiled in \nAugust 2001. The HIFAI demonstration is designed to help States reduce \nthe number of uninsured through innovative and cost-effective \napproaches using Medicaid and CHIP funds. The initiative emphasizes \nprivate insurance options rather than public program expansions. To \ndate, HHS has approved HIFAI demonstrations in Arizona and California, \nand it could approve more if more States are willing to be aggressive.\n  The simple fact is what we have is an effort by a large number of \nStates that have had problems with their Medicaid accounts for a \nvariety of reasons to basically raid the Federal Treasury to the tune \nof $9 billion. I guess they are probably going to have enough votes to \ndo that because they have structured this formula so that enough States \nare going to pick up money from it that is significant. But I have to \nask the question, Why are we not offsetting this $9 billion? Why are we \njust coming out and saying let's take another $9 billion hit on the \nFederal Treasury, in which we do not happen to have any money right \nnow, and add that to the deficit? It makes very little sense from the \nstandpoint of fiscal policy.\n  Fifty States have the power to energize this type of support for $9 \nbillion. I would think they would have the power to go find money to \noffset it somewhere, but unfortunately they are not doing that in this \namendment. It is an unfortunate, in my opinion, effort to raid the \nTreasury, as a result of which we will not only get bad policy but we \nwill get a significant increase in Federal debt.\n  I yield the floor and make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MILLER). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Am I correct in understanding that the distinguished \nSenator raised a point of order?\n  Mr. GREGG. No, I have not raised a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He did not.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire raised a number of very important questions regarding \nthis FMAP proposal to expand the support that the Federal Government is \nproviding to the States as part of the partnership that has existed for \nmany years.\n  I think it would be very difficult to go back and tell our partners \nthat we are unable to or we should not increase the amount of the \nFederal match because we did not follow the procedures that some people \nin the Senate believed we ought to follow. Inside baseball is not going \nto make those friends who are on the outside experiencing some major \nfinancial challenges very happy. They may not be very happy at all with \nthat kind of an explanation.\n  I think it is important to remember how the Medicaid Program \ndeveloped, as well as some of the social benefits programs that are \nalso included as part of this bill. If the Chair remembers--and I know \nhe does as a former Governor from Georgia--this was a big part of his \nbudget. He probably was surprised, as I was, on the day we took office \nand put our budgets together to find out what a big piece of the pie \nthis Medicaid Program amounted to as part of the budget. If the Chair \nremembers what happened, as I am sure he does, as do all former \nGovernors, and I believe all of our colleagues do, this came about \nbecause of a Federal mandate. The Federal Government said we are going \nto have a Federal Medicaid Program and the States are going to be \nparties to it and the Federal Government is going to decide how much \nthe Federal Government contributes to it, and the Federal Government is \nalways going to be able to raise or lower the amount of the Federal \nmatch on the basis of a formula that has been established. The States, \nas the junior partners, have to go along with whatever the Federal \nGovernment proposes.\n\n  It was a mandate--not an unfunded mandate but an underfunded Federal \nmandate.\n  The States generally made innovative challenges, but I know the \ndistinguished former Governor of Georgia will recall when States came \nto the Federal Government and said, we would like to make some changes \nto the program, you had to get a waiver and come back to Washington and \nask, will you please allow us to make these innovative changes that our \ndistinguished colleague from the Northeast was talking about that have \nbeen made in some areas. Many proposed innovative changes were denied.\n  It has been essentially a Federal program where the States have been \nthe junior partner. In this situation, all we are saying is, instead of \nreducing the amount of the Federal match over the next 19 months, as it \nhas been scheduled to be reduced in various States, we are going to \nhold that constant. In addition, we are going to add 1 percent to the \nState in the Federal match, so for 18 months we will help the States so \nthey do not have to take away benefits from the most needy and most \nvulnerable in our society today.\n  It is recognizing we have a partnership. This was part of the \nstimulus package worked on this last year. It just did not survive into \nthe ultimate stimulus package that was passed earlier this year. Last \nyear and this year, when the stimulus package was being discussed, \nthere was little talk about offsets. Now, when it is convenient to talk \nof offsets, in getting in a direction the way this is heading, we talk \nof assets. There is not anyone in this body not in favor of offsets, \nunless the whole discussion of offsets is designed to set this off the \ntracks so we can get it passed.\n  It seems to me what we have to do is recognize how the program began, \nhow\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nit works, and what assistance this plan we are proposing today--how it \nwill help the States and why it is necessary to help the States deal \nwith our citizens, citizens of the United States of America who happen \nto reside in the various States.\n  It seems to me we do have a responsibility, that we can meet that \nresponsibility, and, yes, I would love to have offsets, but I want to \nmake sure the search for offsets is not what gets this off the track.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I and other Members of the Senate from \ntime to time have taken the floor to address the tragedies which daily, \nweekly, monthly, and yearly come forth in the Middle East. Today, we \nwere greeted by a headline in the Washington Post: U.S. Decries Israeli \nMissile Strike, Ponders The Effect On The Peace Bid.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, again, I have taken the floor several \ntimes to give just one Senator's viewpoint. I am almost at a loss for \nwords to describe the tragic situation that has unfolded in the past 24 \nhours, or 36 hours--whatever the case may be--where a plane that was \nmanufactured here in the United States delivered a missile into a \nresidential area controlled by the Palestinians and brought about the \ndeaths of many innocent people.\n  It is characterized and described at length in the article which \nappeared in this paper and the papers across the world today.\n  The raid, as told by the reports, took the life of an individual who \nhas brought about great harm to the people of Israel over a long \nperiod, but along with that life went the lives of many children and \ninnocent people.\n  Preceding this use of force--again, use of force which is perceived \nby the Israeli leadership as necessary to protect the integrity of \ntheir sovereign nation and the safety of the people, and I will not \ndebate that at this point in time--preceding this event were the tragic \nbombings by humans going into the Israeli areas with the bombs strapped \nto them giving up their lives and taking the lives of innocent people \non the streets. And on and on it goes.\n  What do we do about it?\n  I reiterate that I have spoken about this on this floor several \ntimes, and I intend to this time formalize it in a letter which I will \nbe sending perhaps tonight or early tomorrow morning to the President \nof the United States. The thoughts in that letter are basically the \nsame thoughts that I have said on this floor two or three times, and \nalso at the time that the NATO Ambassadors came to visit the Congress \nof the United States. We had an informal meeting hosted by several of \nour colleagues. I was invited to speak. The very thoughts that I am \nreferring to tonight I shared in that meeting some 2 weeks ago.\n  Our Nation recently celebrated our traditional Fourth of July \nholiday. It is normally a time of joyful reflection of our history, of \npatriotism, and just plain, old-fashioned summer fun. Thankfully, it \nwas a peaceful day for America. But when we entered that holiday \nperiod, I remember so well that we were confronted with yet another \nwarning by responsible individuals in our Government of a possible \nterrorist attack. In varying degrees in varying places here in our \ngreat United States, it had a dampening effect. I remember that so \nwell.\n  A number of constituents--who I am proud to represent in Virginia, \nwhich adjoins the Nation's Capital--called to inquire whether it was \nsafe to go down and watch the fireworks on The Mall. We gave them \nencouragement, in our opinion, to do so.\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\n  I myself was in the area during part of that day. Indeed, there was \nan enormous outpouring of our citizens and visitors from all around the \nworld who enjoyed those fireworks that night. I say that thankfully it \nwas a peaceful day. But we ended that holiday period confronted with \nthat warning.\n  It is, indeed, prudent that our citizens be warned of such threats. \nThere is no criticism of what I believe is a very responsible and \nprudent program of persons in our Government entrusted to make the \ndecision to alert our people when they have reason to believe because \nof intelligence gathering that they should promulgate those warnings.\n  I, however, have to ask myself: Do these warnings continue \nindefinitely? Will people begin to ask of me and my colleagues, of our \nPresident and of all those in positions of authority, what is the root \ncause of this hatred towards the United States? Are we in leadership \npositions doing everything we can to learn of those causes, to lessen \nthat hatred, to tell the truth about America's cause for freedom, and \nhow our men and women of the Armed Forces--as the Presiding Officer \nknows so well having served in the military himself--have gone forth \nfrom our shores throughout these 200-plus years of this Republic only \nin the cause of freedom-- never have taken a square mile of property \nand kept it. Temporarily, we have administered certain geographic areas \nthroughout our history, but never used force to acquire land to augment \nthis Nation.\n\n  People will begin to say: Has our Government done everything it can \ndo? I think our President has exhibited--in the past, today, and will \nin the future--extraordinary leadership, together with his principal \nCabinet officers and his military men and women for whom he is \nCommander in Chief.\n  The scourge of terrorism in the 21st century is a complex and \nmultifaceted problem. None of us fully understand all the root causes \nand all the means with which we have to deal with it.\n  This Chamber, hopefully next week, will resonate with a strong debate \non the bill for homeland defense. We will soon be giving final approval \nto the division in the military of commander in chief, forces north. \nJust think, Mr. President, CINC, commander in chief, for homeland \ndefense, which means marshaling all the military assets and other \nassets of this Nation to try to protect our citizens against further \nterrorist attack.\n  There is not a single cause for this terrorism and hatred but many, \nincluding disparate economic development around the world, lack of \npolitical and economic opportunity in many regions, the alarming spread \nof radical fundamentalist religions, the dogmas, especially Islam, \namongst those feeling disenfranchised from the mainstream of the world, \nand the tyrannical rise of ethnic conflicts after decades of repression \nby communists and other tyrannical regimes.\n  In this environment of perceived hopelessness and despair for many \npeople, particularly the world's youth, seemingly unsolvable events \ncontinue to fan the flames of anger and hatred that lead to irrational \nacts, acts which are almost beyond comprehension.\n  This is manifested in the individual acts of terror we witness almost \ndaily on the streets of Israel against the freedom-loving people of the \nState of Israel and in the recruitment of angry young men and women \ninto radical terrorist organizations that encourage them to vent their \nanger in most destructive ways, most notably human suicide of \nthemselves and against the innocent citizens of Israel.\n  Israel really has no recourse but to strike back in a manner that \nclearly indicates not only to the Palestinians but to the rest of the \nworld that it is a sovereign nation and has the right to exercise every \npossible resource of that nation to protect its people.\n  Solving the conditions that have bred this hate and total disregard \nfor peaceful solutions will be complex, but it must be systematically \naddressed. Again, clearly, our President and his administration have \nshown leadership.\n  But is our Congress showing leadership to help? Can more be done by \nothers? These are the questions I ponder daily.\n  Clearly, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, prolonged over a period of \ntime that none of us ever envisioned, contributes, in some measure, to \nthe unrest and anger in the Arab world directed towards the people of \nthis great United States of America.\n  I cannot quantify it--I do not think anyone else can--but clearly \nthat conflict is part of the root cause of hatred against us, hatred \nwhich is causing us to create a brand new Department of Government, \nHomeland Defense, an entirely new military command, to take all types \nof precautions in our daily life--whether it is at the airports or \npeople just coming to visit here in the Congress of the United States--\nwith security measures.\n\n  This conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians often is \npresented and distorted in a very biased manner to the citizens \nthroughout that region by the media in the Arab nations. We must \nconfront that. We must take actions which are clear to show that we \nwant to bring about peace in that region.\n  We have to address the disaffection and dissatisfaction felt by the \npeople of that region. Each act of violence by either side in this \nunending conflict erodes hope for the peaceful future for Israel--it is \nin this article--and for the peaceful future of the people in \nPalestine.\n  In fact, each act of senseless violence in the Middle East further \nerodes hope that someday we can be more secure here at home.\n  All reasonable options to bring about an end to this violence and \nindiscriminate loss of life must be considered. We can never, ever \nabandon hope. We must act together to renew hope in this land of the \nMiddle East, the land of faith, the land from which so much history has \nemanated for the rest of the world.\n  One option I believe must be considered--and I said this many times \nhere on the floor--is the use of NATO peacekeepers. But that can only \nbe achieved if certain criteria are met.\n  First, I call upon the administration to explore, with the other \nmember nations of NATO: Are they willing to take on this task, a task \nwith unknown risks? Clearly there are risks, but the quantum of risk is \nunknown. Are they willing to take it on if these conditions are met--\nfirst, the people of Palestine and the people of Israel, ask them to \ntake on this obligation to maintain conditions of stability. That is \nthe first.\n  Second, if both the Palestinian people and the people of Israel, \nthrough their respected, elected leaders, will pledge to cooperate in \nevery way with those NATO forces.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is a perception in the world that the \nEuropeans are more sympathetic to the Palestinian causes, and that we \nhere in the United States are more sympathetic to the Israeli causes. \nBut NATO bonds us together, as we have been for these 50 years, in one \nconstituted force.\n  And we would then go, as a constituted military organization, for the \nstated purpose, only, of trying to bring about stability, so that the \ndiplomatic discussions, not only between the leaders of the Palestinian \npeople and the leaders of the Israeli people can commence, but other \nleaders in the world, who desire, can step up.\n  There are those who have looked at this problem, and I respect them, \nand they disagree. I ask unanimous consent an article by a noted \nauthor, Mr. Kagan, be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 24, 2002]\n\n    U.S. Decries Israeli Missile Strike, Ponders Effect on Peace Bid\n\n                           (By Karen DeYoung)\n\n       The White House yesterday denounced Israel's missile strike \n     in a densely populated area in the Gaza Strip as ``heavy-\n     handed'' and described it as ``a deliberate attack against a \n     building in which civilians were known to be located.''\n       Rejecting Israel's contention that it did not intend to \n     kill innocents with a strike that was directed against a \n     leader of the Hamas militant group, spokesman Ari Fleischer \n     said. ``These were apartment buildings that were targeted.'' \n     In addition to Salah Shehada, the intended target, the \n     missile fired from an Israeli F-16 warplane killed 14 other \n     people, most of them under the age of 11, and injured about \n     150.\n       Although President Bush continues ``to be a lead defender \n     of Israel around the world and will speak out about Israel's \n     right to self-defense,'' Fleischer said, ``this is an \n     instance in which the United States and Israel do not see eye \n     to eye.''\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n       The Monday night attack was widely condemned in Europe and \n     the Arab world. Many, particularly in Arab capitals, said it \n     demonstrated that the government of Israeli Prime Minister \n     Ariel Sharon was trying to undercut recent progress in the \n     Middle East peace process.\n       The attack appeared initially to have stunned U.S. \n     officials involved in peace efforts. They said they had no \n     warning of Israel's plans despite talks here Monday between \n     high-level representatives of the two governments. By \n     yesterday, shock had turned to depression and uncertainty \n     over where the process would go.\n       ``There is considerable agreement that this represents \n     something really problematic, something unique,'' one \n     administration official said.\n       U.S. reaction to the attack, which occurred around 7 p.m. \n     Washington time, was delayed until there was a clear picture \n     of what had happened, the official said. After a flurry of \n     telephone calls to the region, ``within an hour, we knew what \n     we were dealing with. Then discussions began on how to \n     respond.''\n       Talks Monday night among Secretary of State Colin L. \n     Powell; his deputy, Richard L. Armitage; and William Burns, \n     the assistant secretary for the region, were quickly joined \n     by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and her deputy, \n     Stephen Hadley. While acknowledging deep and longstanding \n     differences between the State Department and the White House \n     over Middle East policy, the official said, ``this particular \n     time, there was agreement across the board.''\n       Under the rhetorical code that has long surrounded \n     statements on the Middle East, the United States normally \n     ``condemns'' Palestinian terrorist attacks and uses the \n     somewhat softer verb, ``deplore,'' to criticize Israeli \n     actions.\n       Officials considered, then rejected, condemning the \n     Israelis or describing their actions as ``counterproductive'' \n     before settling on ``heavy-handed,'' as something they \n     believed ``captured the deploring,'' as one official put it.\n       It was decided that Daniel C. Kurtzer, the U.S. ambassador \n     to Israel, would deliver the message to Sharon. U.S. \n     officials here described that discussion yesterday as \n     unpleasant, and said Sharon said little in private that \n     differed from his description of the attack as ``one of our \n     major successes.''\n       White House public comment was left to Fleischer, and Bush \n     made no statement yesterday on the attack. ``The president \n     views this as a heavy-handed action that is not consistent \n     with dedication to peace in the Middle East,'' Fleischer \n     said.\n       Asked why Israel's action in Gaza was different from U.S. \n     attacks against al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan that \n     resulted in the loss of innocent civilian lives--a comparison \n     Israel has made--Fleischer replied: ``It isn't accurate to \n     compare the two. . . . There are going to be losses of \n     innocents in times of war, and I think that's recognized \n     around the world.\n       ``What's important is, in pursuit of the military \n     objectives, as the United States does in Afghanistan, to \n     always exercise every restraint to minimize those losses of \n     life,'' Fleischer said. ``But in this case, what happened in \n     Gaza was a knowing attack against a building in which \n     innocents were found.''\n       European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana called \n     the attack an ``extra-judicial killing operation'' that \n     ``comes at a time when both Israelis and Palestinians were \n     working very seriously to curb violence and restore \n     cooperative security arrangements.''\n       Solana represents the EU in the ``quartet'' group on the \n     Middle East that also includes Powell, U.N. Secretary General \n     Kofi Annan and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.\n       Annan issued a statement late Monday deploring the attack, \n     saying, ``Israel has the legal and moral responsibility to \n     take all measures to avoid the loss of innocent life; it \n     clearly failed to do so.''\n       There was no direct contact yesterday between Powell and \n     the other quartet members, and no one seemed to have a clear \n     idea how to proceed beyond waiting for the immediate \n     fallout--including widely expected Palestinian retaliation--\n     and its unpredictable impact on the wider peace process.\n       After months in which the process has been frozen, and \n     despite Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israeli \n     civilians as recently as last week, significant recent \n     progress had been reported.\n       Plans to restructure the Palestinian Authority's security \n     and financial infrastructure and prepare for elections in \n     January were near completion. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon \n     Peres met with senior Palestinian officials last weekend for \n     the first time in months, amid signs that Israeli troops \n     would begin to withdraw from occupied Palestinian cities.\n       Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, the Arab countries most \n     active in the peace process, all condemned the Israeli \n     action. Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher called it a \n     ``war crime,'' and his Saudi counterpart, Saud Faisal, said \n     it was ``a repulsive act that will be registered against \n     [Sharon] in history.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               exhibit 2\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 18, 2002]\n\n                       Can NATO Patrol Palestine?\n\n                           (By Robert Kagan)\n\n       When Pulitzer-Prize winning New York Times columnist Tom \n     Friedman talks, people listen. Now one of Friedman's most \n     radical ideas--to put a NATO peacekeeping force on the ground \n     between the Israelis and Palestinians as a key part of an \n     overall peace settlement--is actually starting to pick up \n     steam around the world. U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has \n     endorsed the idea of an international force as part of a \n     settlement that would be imposed on Israel and the \n     Palestinians. So has German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. \n     More important, Secretary of State Colin Powell is believed \n     to be mulling such a plan. He has publicly talked about \n     putting American observers on the ground. Even some Israelis \n     have warmed to the idea, provided of course that any force \n     includes American troops. After Europe's lynching of Israel \n     these past few weeks, that's the only army they trust.\n       Friedman's idea deserves to be taken seriously. And to \n     those of us who have supported American troop deployments for \n     peacekeeping in Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti and elsewhere over the \n     past decade, peacekeeping in the Middle East seems at least \n     as worthy, in principal. Our strategic interest in a stable \n     peace there is clear, and so is the moral case for doing \n     something to end the bloodshed, defend the Israeli democracy \n     and given the Palestinians a chance for a better life. After \n     Sept. 11, we have to engage in peacekeeping and nation-\n     building in messy places such as Afghanistan and, one hopes, \n     post-Saddam Iraq, whether we like it or not. So why not in \n     the Palestinian territories.\n       But if the idea of a U.S.-led force between Israel and a \n     Palestinian state is starting to get serious attention, it's \n     time for Friedman and others to spell out what exactly they \n     have in mind, and with a little more candor about the costs \n     and risks.\n       Take the size and role of the force, for instance. To carry \n     out its mission and avoid disaster, the American force would \n     have to be, as they say in the military, ``robust.'' For one \n     thing, the demarcation line between Israelis and Palestinians \n     that will have to be patrolled and controlled will be long, \n     twisty, and difficult. For another thing, Americans are going \n     to be the prime target for terrorist attacks. Friedman denies \n     this, arguing that the Palestinian people will view the \n     Americans as saviors--they will be ``the midwife of a \n     Palestinian state.'' But Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad \n     probably won't see it that way. Rallying to the cry of \n     ``Remember Beirut!'' they'll look for ways to take out \n     another 240 Marines. And they'll have help from Iran, Iraq, \n     al Qaeda and all other jihadists out there.\n       That means any American force will have to be big--10,000 \n     to 20,000 troops, with another 10,000 to 20,000 backing them \n     up. And they'll have to be heavily armed. Potential attackers \n     will need to be intimidated by American firepower every day \n     and every night for as many years as it takes. And that means \n     Tom Friedman and Kofi Annan and Joschka Fischer will need to \n     become full-time lobbyists for massive increases in the \n     American defense budget, because right now we have neither \n     the troops nor the money to carry out their plan.\n       Now for the hard part. Let's say we get a peace agreement \n     and we put the peacekeeping force on the ground between the \n     Israelis and Palestinians. What happens when, despite all our \n     best efforts, the occasional Hamas suicide bomber gets \n     through anyway and commits the occasional massacre in \n     Jerusalem or Tel Aviv? Count on it: This will happen. And \n     what about when Hezbollah tries to use the new Palestinian \n     state created by the peace settlement the way it now uses \n     southern Lebanon, as a convenient place from which to launch \n     Katyusha rockets at Israeli population centers? What do we \n     do then?\n       Friedman et al. can't wish this problem away. And the \n     options are less than enticing. One option is that the \n     American-led peacekeeping force does nothing. But then we \n     will have effectively created an American shield for \n     terrorist attacks against Israel. This, by the way, was \n     exactly the role a U.N. peacekeeping force played in Lebanon \n     for several years in the late 1970s and early '80s, right up \n     until the Israeli army invaded Lebanon and pushed the U.N. \n     force (known as UNIFIL) aside.\n       Option two is that the peacekeeping force could, like \n     UNIFIL, just get out of the way and let the Israeli military \n     retaliate for any terrorist attacks. Then at least American \n     forces wouldn't be helping the terrorist attack Israel. \n     They'd be helping Israel attack the state of Palestine. \n     That's how it would look to the Palestinians, anyway. So much \n     for the Americans as saviors.\n       Option three is that the American-led force goes to war. We \n     tell the Israelis to hold their fire and then send our own \n     forces in to stop the terrorists. In essence, we take on the \n     job the Israelis are currently doing in the territories. This \n     prevents the outbreak of a new Israeli-Palestinian conflict--\n     and begins the first round of the U.S.-Palestinian conflict. \n     Maybe that's kind of progress, but it's not very attractive.\n       Is there another option I'm missing? If not, the proposal \n     for an international peacekeeping force looks less like a \n     real plan than a desperate if noble attempt to solve the \n     insoluble in the Middle East--a deus ex America summoned to \n     provide a miracle when all roads to peace have reached a dead \n     end. Even Ehud Barak's idea of building a very, very big \n     fence between Israel and the Palestinians looks better. Help \n     us out, Tom.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield to our leaders. They have an \nimportant matter.\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a matter on which I and a number \nof others have worked for some time. I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Virginia, Congressman Virgil Goode, whom I asked to introduce this \nmeasure in the House. He did so with great skill. It was passed by the \nHouse. It had previously been adopted by the Senate, but now the House \nbill has been adopted by the Senate. Hopefully it will be forthcoming \nto the President for signature.\n  I rise in support of this resolution which has been an idea I have \nhad for many years.\n  It bestows honorary citizenship on the Marquis de Lafayette. I think \nit is an honor long overdue. This great Frenchman fought with \nWashington, as I shall enumerate, in a battle for our independence. He \nwas very influential in having the French Government intervene, as they \ndid decisively, at\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\nYorktown to enable that long, drawn-out conflict to be brought to an \nend. He later came back to Virginia and traveled throughout my State \nand other parts of this great Nation and is remembered with great \nfondness.\n  In his greatest time of need when the Austrians imprisoned him for \nhis supposed involvement in the fall of the French monarchy, the United \nStates did not acknowledge Lafayette as a U.S. citizen despite his \ncries for help all across our land.\n  This young man risked so much to help build the America we know \ntoday, and we are now correcting this long-delayed injustice to \nLafayette and celebrating him not only as a patriot of freedom and \nliberty but as a U.S. citizen.\n  At the young age of 19, Lafayette disobeyed the wishes of King Louis \nXVI of France, risking his own personal wealth and status to aid in our \nquest for freedom from Great Britain. He proved his dedication to our \nliberty when he was wounded in the battle of Brandywine, forever \nendearing himself to the American soldiers.\n  Throughout the American Revolution, Lafayette acted as a liaison \nbetween France and the American colonies. He urged influential \npolicymakers to have France make the decisive military, naval, and \nfinancial commitment to save the American colonists. His tireless \nefforts, both as a liaison and as a general, aided America in her \nultimate victory.\n  During the war, Lafayette proved himself over and over as a soldier \nand a good friend to George Washington. George Washington was impressed \nwith Lafayette's military tactics which lured British General \nCornwallis and his army to Yorktown, VA. The American Army, led by \nGeneral Washington, along with French forces led by General Rochambeau, \ncame south and trapped Cornwallis and his troops at Yorktown. As a \nresult, the British were forced to surrender. The famous French fleet \nappeared on the horizon and they prevented any resupply to the British \nforces from their ships offshore. It was a decisive part of that \nbattle. Here we are today enjoying freedom 200-plus years later because \nof Lafayette and the French contribution.\n  Lafayette's services to America extended beyond the battlefield. He \nworked diligently as an adviser, helping to win concessions from \nBritain during the treaty negotiations. At Versailles, when negotiating \nwith the French Government, our representatives, Franklin and \nJefferson, found him invaluable. Moreover, his impartial friendship was \nextended to the first seven U.S. Presidents.\n  One of Lafayette's major contributions was bridging these cultural \ngaps between America and France. His early influence on America still \nholds true today as we try to bridge the cultural gaps to many \ncountries across the globe to help cultivate freedom. With this in \nmind, now more than ever, it is important to remember who our friends \nare in the world as we try to create a coalition against terror.\n  The Marquis de Lafayette is celebrated by many as a symbol of freedom \nand liberty. I am happy and honored for the opportunity to offer this \nresolution for citizenship before the Senate.\n  Congress has before shown its respect and gratitude for Lafayette \nwhen both the Senate and the House of Representatives draped their \nChambers in black for his contribution to the independence of this \ngreat Nation.\n  Now, I would like to say to the Marquis de Lafayette as John J. \nPershing did in World War I when he stood before the patriot's grave \nand said: ``Lafayette, we are here.''\n  Our Nation has only bestowed this honor on a few persons. I shall \nplace into the Record the names of those, such as Winston Churchill and \nothers. So here now, at long last, we honor this great patriot.\n  First, I thank Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I \nalso thank, from my staff, John Frierson; former staff member, Don \nLefeve; and Congressman Virgil Goode from Virginia and his assistant, \nRawley Vaughn, for their help. The French Ambassador to the United \nStates has been of great help and encouragement, as has Mr. Jim \nJohnston of the Virginia Film Foundation, Wyatt Dickerson, and Dr. \nJames Scalon, a history professor at Randolph-Macon University.\n  It is interesting how many people have joined to make this possible. \nI now enumerate those who have received honorary citizenship by our \nGovernment: British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, on April 9, 1963; \nSwedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, October 5, 1981; William Penn and \nhis wife Hannah, October 4, 1984; Mother Teresa, November 16, 1996.\n  It is very interesting. I am deeply humbled to have been one of \nseveral to make this possible.\n  Again, I say that the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. Leahy, was of invaluable help to make this legislation \npossible. I spoke with him earlier today. He helped me facilitate the \nadoption of this matter this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7303-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, normally I try not to use written text \non the floor of the Senate, but I want to make sure that I say what I \nsay in the Senate in a careful and hopefully the right way.\n  Tuesday's missile strike against the home of Sheik Salah Shehaded was \nan unsettling departure from the more careful methods Israel has \ntypically used against its terrorist enemies. The sheik, who was killed \nin the operation, was the Gaza terrorism chief of Hamas, a group that \nhas slaughtered hundreds of innocent Israelis and who seeks the \ndestruction of Israel. Unfortunately, the attack killed not only the \nsheik but also 14 of his family members and neighbors, including nine \nchildren--terrible, terrible, toll.\n  It is true that these deaths were not the purpose of the operation. \nUnlike suicide bombers, the Israeli military does not target civilians. \nAnd perhaps, given the sheik's role in killing civilians, maybe you \ncould argue that more innocent lives were saved than would ultimately \nhave been lost if he had continued to live.\n  But military planners should have known that this operation, taking \nplace in a densely populated residential complex, might result in the \ndeath of many civilians. Surely other military options could have been \nconsidered.\n  The rising toll on innocent civilians in this conflict is \nheartbreaking. There must be a greater effort by all--the Government of \nIsrael, the Palestinians, the Arab States, and the United States--to \nbreak this cycle of revenge and spiraling violence.\n  Four weeks ago Monday, President Bush outlined his latest ideas for \nresolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He laid out a vision of the \nfuture for the Middle East, declaring that he wanted to see two \ndemocratic states living side by side with secure borders, and he \nbelieved this goal could be achieved within 3 years. He called for \nmovement on three tracks. First, aggressive action to end terrorist \nattacks on innocent Israeli citizens; second, reform of Palestinian \nlegal and security structures; and third, substantial assistance to \nrelieve the suffering of ordinary Palestinians who now are on the brink \nof humanitarian disaster.\n  The Bush speech, with its important elements, now needs to be recast \ninto a concrete work plan where there is movement on all three tracks. \nBehind the scenes, Secretary Powell and members of the Quartet have \nbeen seeking to flesh out plans for overhauling the Palestinian \nAuthority, yet movement there has been slow. The bottom line is that \nthe political roadmap that was missing from the President's speech\n\n[[Page S7304]]\n\nhas yet to appear. The United States must lead a diplomatic process to \nend the endless cycle of violence and get to the end game--an \nindependent Palestinian state and security for Israel. There must be \naction on all fronts, or what little hope is left will vanish.\n  I wish I had a clear answer, but thought as a Senator from Minnesota \nI should at least speak out in the Senate. I am absolutely convinced \nthat there is no hope in the present course, that we have to figure out \nhow to get from where we are back on a political track. As tiring and \ntiresome as it might sound to some, we have to continue to call for \npolitical negotiation. What is the alternative? There is no \nalternative. There is no alternative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7304-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO AND BOISE STATE RADIO\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, with great pride, I commend National Public \nRadio and its Idaho affiliate, Boise State Radio, for their creative \napplication of wind power technology.\n  With unprecedented innovation, in what is believed to be the first \npublic radio transmitter site to rely on the power of wind, Boise State \nRadio and National Public Radio have erected three state-of-the-art \nwind turbines in order to provide broadcast service to previously \nunreachable areas in southern Idaho and northeastern Nevada.\n  In an age when just 3 percent of electricity in today's national mix \ncomes from renewable sources, Boise State Radio and National Public \nRadio have committed to expanding their services while advancing the \nuse of clean, efficient power sources.\n  The American Wind Energy Association estimates that Idaho has the \npotential to generate over 8,000 megawatts of wind power, placing our \nState in a unique position to contribute significantly to domestic \nenergy production.\n  At the same time, it is clear that the overall economy is changing \nand that rural America is shouldering a great deal of this weight. The \nfact is, many of the jobs that have been lost over the last decade \nmight never return. While continuing to support our traditional \nindustries, we must also be creative in capitalizing on new \nopportunities for rural communities.\n  By expanding communications and providing a new facet to the rural \neconomic infrastructure, the generation of wind power serves not only \nto maintain our Nation's available resources, but also to advance \neconomic opportunity in rural America.\n  Recognizing Idaho's wind power potential and its benefits to our \neconomies, National Public Radio and Boise State Radio are emerging as \nleaders in the advancement of environmentally efficient energy \ntechnology. This further serves as evidence that opportunities exist \nright at home to increase energy production that would boost our \nelectricity supply and reduce dependence on foreign fuels, such as oil, \nwhich we import primarily from the Middle East.\n  We need to make the best use of our domestic renewable energy \nresources to ensure a secure, reliable, and clean energy supply while \nimproving the economies of rural Idaho and rural America.\n  National Public Radio and Boise State Radio: On behalf of Idahoans \nand millions of Americans, I salute you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7304-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7304-S7305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STOCK OPTIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to outline briefly an approach with \nrespect to the stock option issue that I am hopeful could bring \ntogether Senators of varying philosophies in both political parties.\n  It seems as if every morning Americans wake up to yet another \nheadline about the collapse of a major U.S. corporation. These failures \nhave devastated the savings of millions of hard-working Americans, \nsavings they were depending on for their retirement or to pay for their \nkids' college. When the smoke clears and the fallout settles, the issue \nof stock options invariably comes to the fore.\n  I serve as chair of the Science and Technology Subcommittee, and I \nhave spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the stock option \nissue. There is no question in my mind that some companies have abused \nstock options, using them as a vehicle for funneling large amounts of \nwealth to top executives. What is more, options have been granted in \nways that fail to serve their intended purpose of aligning the \ninterests of management with the long-term interests of the company.\n  Instead, a number of these massive option grants have created \nperverse incentives, enabling top executives to get extraordinarily \nrich by pumping up a company's short-term share price. The tactics they \nuse can jeopardize the company's long-term financial health, but by the \ntime the long-term impact is felt, the executives invariably have \ncashed out and left the firm. When an executive develops a big personal \nstake in options, it can lead to a big conflict of interest. Too often \nthe company's long-term interests take a backseat to that executive's \ndesire for personal reasons to boost the short-term share price.\n  When the betting is between massaging the numbers to ``manage'' \nquarterly profit projections and improving the quality of the business \nthrough such initiatives as long-term research and development \ninvestments, short-term profits and the value of executive stock \noptions can be the odds-on favorite.\n  The abuse of stock options in the executive suite should not be taken \nas an indictment of all stock options that are offered.\n  I remain convinced that stock option plans, as long as they are broad \nbased and have significant shareholder investment protection, can play \na very important role in our economy. They can enable corporations to \nattract and retain good workers and top talent. They can motivate and \nincrease productivity by giving employees a strong personal interest in \nthe long-term success of the corporation.\n  The program I would like to outline this afternoon is based on the \npremise that it is time for the Senate to act to stop abuses at the \ntop, while not gutting options that are so vital to rank and file \nworkers. This can best be done by restoring the link between the long-\nterm interests of the company and those of senior management and giving \nshareholders knowledge about control over the stock options of \ncorporate leaders.\n  So I hope we will be looking to discuss with Senators of both parties \nthe differing philosophies on the stock option issue, and that we can \ncome together as a Senate around reform based on three issues.\n  First, the rule should increase shareholder influence and oversight \nwith respect to grants of stock options to corporate officers and \ndirectors by requiring shareholder approval. This would help prevent \nthe all-too-common ``I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine'' \nculture of clubby directors and top executives voting each other huge \noption packages with little or no shareholder input.\n  Second, new rules should seek to ensure that stock options provide \nincentives for corporate officers and directors who act in the best \nlong-term interests of their corporation, not incentives to stimulate \nshort-term runups in stock prices. I believe the way to do this is to \nestablish substantial vesting periods for options and holding periods \nfor stock shares so that top executives do not have the ability to \nquickly cash out and jump ship.\n  Specifically, I believe there needs to be a multitiered holding \nperiod. Directors and officers should be allowed to sell a modest \nproportion of shares, for example, to permit a degree of \ndiversification; but for the large majority, they should have to wait a \nsubstantial period of time and they should be required to hold on to a \nportion of their stock until at least 6 months after leaving the \ncompany.\n  Finally, a third requirement in the proposal I outline today would be \nnew rules improving the transparency of stock option grants to \ndirectors and officers. It is critical that better and more frequent \ninformation be provided to shareholders and investors. They deserve \nmore information than what is buried in the typical footnote. Stock \noption information ought to be reported quarterly, not just annually, \nand broken out into an easy-to-find section in each company's public \nSEC filings.\n  In concluding, there have been two paths presented in the Senate in \nrecent months with respect to the issue of stock options. Some now \nthink the\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\nproblem is so severe that options should be pared back across the board \nand that Congress should take that action. Others say that business as \nusual should continue, that this is a problem that has affected just a \nhandful of companies.\n  The principles I have described today lay out a third path--a path \nthat will ensure that broad-based stock options can continue to be a \nuseful tool for deserving workers, shareholders, and the economy as a \nwhole, while at the same time curbing abuses by those in the executive \nsuites whose conduct is over the line.\n  On the Science and Technology Subcommittee, which I chair, we have \nheard again and again how important these stock options are. There is \nno question that is correct. But I think it is also correct to say that \nthe job of cleaning up corporate corruption is not going to be complete \nuntil Congress acts to curb the abuse of stock options.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to put in place tough, \nnew rules that will ensure that stock options remain broad based, but \nalso address this issue of abuse that, unfortunately, has drawn options \nand their value into question.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7305-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7305-S7306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AN UNWARRANTED BLOW TO GLOBAL FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my very deep \nregret that the Bush administration has decided not to release the $34 \nmillion allocated for the United Nations Fund for Population \nActivities, UNFPA. I would ask the White House to reconsider its \ndecision.\n  At stake here is vital assistance for needy individuals throughout \nthe developing world, living under the threat of HIV infection and \ndeteriorating health conditions.\n  Indeed, it is a shame that such assistance--assistance that can save \nlives--is being held hostage by domestic politics, and the \nmisconceptions of the anti-choice wing of the Republican Party.\n  I would remind the administration that the $34 million was \nappropriated by Congress in a spirit of bipartisan consensus, after 2 \nmonths of negotiations. During these talks there was never any question \nwhether or not to allocate the funds, but simply how much.\n  The White House's own budget proposal for fiscal year 2002 included \n$25 million for the fund, $3.5 million more than allocated by the \nClinton administration.\n  Within this context, the administration's decision is all the more \nperplexing. It stands as painful proof that the debate over U.S. \nsupport for international family planning has been distorted all out \nproportion.\n  In particular, there remains a belief, in some quarters, that the \nUnited Nations Fund for Population Activities either condones or even \nassists in abortion and coercive sterilization.\n  This is, at best, nothing but hearsay. And if such proof does exist, \nwhy haven't we seen or heard anything substantive about it?\n  With respect to China, in May the State Department sent a mission to \ninvestigate such allegations, and it found no evidence at all of that \nthe fund was involved, in any way, in abortion or coercive \nsterilization. A month before, a British delegation drew a similar \nconclusion.\n  For the record, I would like to quote directly from the State \nDepartment's conclusions. ``We find no evidence that UNFPA has \nknowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of \ncoercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in [China].''\n  In light of this finding, the report recommends, and I quote, ``that \nnot more than $34 million which has already been appropriated be \nreleased to UNFPA.''\n  I would also argue that it is precisely because of the questions \nraised about China's policies, that United Nations presence there \nbecomes that much more important. The United Nations Fund for \nPopulation Activities remains the best way to do this.\n\n  Only last year, Secretary of State Colin Powell praised the United \nNations Fund for Population Activities, saying that it was engaged in \n``critical population and assistance to developing countries.''\n  This explains why the Department of State provided $600,000 to the \nfund for sanity supplies, clean undergarments, and emergency infant \ndelivery kits for Afghan refugees in Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and \nTajikistan.\n  The facts speak for themselves. The United Nations Fund for \nPopulation Activities does not subsidize abortion services in any \ncountry. Its executive director, Madame Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, has said \nthat the fund would cease its family planning program in China, if any \nallegations of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization could be \nverified.\n  I would also argue that we would be wise to focus on the wider role \nthat the United Nations Fund for Population Activities plays, most \nnotably in the critical area of HIV prevention. And I would remind my \ncolleagues of just a few of the troubling facts revealed at the recent \nAIDS conference in Barcelona.\n  In Botswana, for example--a country where 38 percent of the adult \npopulation is infected with HIV--20 percent of high-school-age students \nbelieve that you can tell whether a person has HIV/AIDS simply by \nlooking at them.\n  In Malawi, where 15 percent of all adults are HIV positive, 64 \npercent of young men admit to not using a condom with their most recent \nsexual partner. The scourge of AIDS throughout sub-Saharan Africa is a \nhuman tragedy of terrifying proportions.\n  How can we turn our backs on those not yet infected, especially when \nthe reason for doing so is based on unfounded allegations and a \nmisunderstanding of the term ``family planning.''\n  There are no hidden meanings; there is no secret agenda. Family \nplanning does not condone or promote abortion. Simply put, family \nplanning means: women able to control their reproductive destinies; \ncouples given the information necessary to make their own choices about \nfamily size and the timing of births; health care officials reaching \nout to adolescents and young adults, as a means to educate them, and in \nturn prevent HIV infection and unwanted pregnancies.\n  Healthy families--the heart of any healthy society--depend upon women \nbeing able to make informed choices. The United Nations Fund for \nPopulation Activities helps women do just that--make a choice--which I \nhold to be a fundamental right of women everywhere, regardless of their \neconomic circumstances.\n  Women here in the United States take such information for granted, \nand we can not forget that this is all too often unavailable to poor \nwomen in the developing world.\n  How to protect themselves from HIV or other sexually transmitted \ndiseases, how to space pregnancies so that they can better manage the \nsize of their families, and how to lower the risks of childbirth and \nincrease their chances of delivering healthy babies--this is at the \nheart of the information the United Nations Fund for Population \nActivities provides. This strikes me as hardly immoral or illegal.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the \nworld's population today stands at more than six billion--a figure that \nshows no signs of stabilizing. In fact, the United Nations estimates \nthis number could double, to 12 billion, by the year 2050.\n  The brunt of this growth will impact precisely those areas least able \nto absorb it--namely, the developing world. Overpopulation has already \ncaused significant problems, like malnutrition, disease, environmental \ndegradation, and political instability.\n  If we in the United States bury our heads in the sand here, it will \nbecome increasing likely that overpopulation could overwhelm such \nfragile societies.\n  Given such alarming facts, the purpose of the United Nations Fund for \nPopulation Activities--to reduce poverty, improve health and raise \nliving standards around the world--will become only more important in \nthe years to come. The United States, in my mind, has two options: one, \neither we help support international family planning efforts, in a way \nthat is both responsible and accountable; or two, we relinquish our \nleadership role, and turn our backs on the developing world.\n  The Bush Administration seems to have taken the latter course, and I \ncan only hope that it reconsiders its decision and will do what is \nright.\n  It should release the $34 million allocated to the United Nations \nFund for\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\nPopulation Activities. Failure to do so would set an unfortunate \nprecedent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7306-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JOHN H.

Mr. President, a recent article from the New York Times \ndescribes the infestation of spruce bark beetles on the Kenai Peninsula \nin Alaska. This is another aspect of global climate change that has \ndeadly implications in my state. On the Kenai Peninsula, the spruce \nbark beetle has infested nearly 95 percent of the spruce trees, which \nrepresents about four million acres of dead or dying forest. Some \nscientists believe that a succession of warm years in Alaska has \nallowed spruce bark beetles to reproduce at twice their normal rate. \nThis warming trend in Alaska has coincided with a huge outbreak of \nthese beetles and the death of a forest nearly twice the size of \nYellowstone National Park. This terrible situation, in one of my \nstate's most beautiful tourist destinations, has created a dangerous \nenvironment for a large scale fire in this region.\n  Over half of the people of Alaska live in the path of this fire.\n  The Forest Service, under the previous Administration, in my State \nwould not permit the selective cutting of infested trees, which would \nhave mitigated, if not stopped, the outbreak of the deadly beetle. When \ntimber sales were offered in this area extreme environmental lawsuits \nstopped any removal of the ever growing fuel load. My state is now in a \nvery dangerous situation--eight years of beetle kill stands in the \nforests on the Kenai Peninsula and the insect continues to spread.\n  This article demonstrates that. I call it to the attention of the \nSenate because of the emphasis placed on fires already started in the \nWest and that are ongoing.\n  This is the most deadly situation I have ever encountered in terms of \npotential fire and the hazard in this enormous area--4 million acres of \ndead or dying trees caused by this beetle. I think it ought to be dealt \nwith by all concerned. I hope we have some money in the regular bill \nfor this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record. I \ncall it to the attention of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Science Times, June 25, 2002]\n\n                 On Hot Trail of Tiny Killer in Alaska\n\n                           (By Timothy Egan)\n\n       Soldotna, Alaska--Edward Berg has a pair of doctorates, one \n     in philosophy and another in botany, but for the last decade \n     he has been a forensic detective in the forest, trying to \n     solve a large murder mystery.\n       The evidence surrounds him on his home in the Kenai \n     Peninsula: nearly four million acres of white spruce trees, \n     dead or dying from an infestation of beetles--the largest \n     kill by insects of any forest in North America, federal \n     officials say.\n       Beetles have been gnawing at spruce trees for thousands of \n     years. Why, Dr. Berg wondered, has this infestation been so \n     great? After matching climate records to the rate of dying \n     trees, Dr. Berg, who works at the Kenai National Widlife \n     Refuge, believes he has come up with an answer.\n       He says a succession of warm years in Alaska has allowed \n     spruce bark beetles to reproduce at twice their normal rate. \n     Hungry for the sweet lining beneath the bark, the beetles \n     have swarmed over the stands of spruce, overwhelming the \n     trees' normal defense mechanisms.\n       If Dr. Berg is correct--and he has won many converts as \n     well as some skeptics--then the dead spruce forest of Alaska \n     may well be one of the world's most visible monuments to \n     climate change. On the Kenai, nearly 95 percent of spruce \n     trees have fallen to the beetle. Now, conditions are ripe for \n     a large fire and could lead to bigger changes in the \n     ecosystem, affecting moose, bear, salmon and other creatures \n     that have made the peninsula, just a few hours' drive from \n     Anchorage, a tourist mecca.\n       ``The chief reason why the beetle outbreak has been the \n     largest and the longest is that we have had a unprecedented \n     run of warm summers,'' said Dr. Berg, 62 a soft-spoken man in \n     suspenders and running shoes.\n       Temperatures in Alaska have risen sharply in the last 30 \n     years, causing sea ice to break up off the northern \n     coastlines, some glaciers to recede and permafrost, to melt. \n     But until Dr. Berg began matching raising temperatures to the \n     number of trees killed by beetles, no one of had tied the \n     death of a forest nearly twice the size of Yellowstone \n     National Park to warming temperatures.\n       Dr. Berg believes the larger culprit is global warming, \n     brought on by increased emissions of greenhouse gases, which \n     trap heat in the atmosphere. But that is a bigger debate, one \n     which Dr. Berg's findings for other forests vulnerable to \n     bugs is that as climate warms in the north, some species of \n     evergreen trees that cover vast acreage could be mowed down \n     by an ever-expanding population of bettles.\n       The dead spruce forest of Alaska is also a lesson, to some \n     ecologists, of how warmer temperatures present intractable \n     problems for living things anchored to a certain area. People \n     can adapt, or even more, but trees that have been growing in \n     one area for 8,000 years cannot--at least not quickly enough.\n       Other scientists who work on global warming issues are now \n     looking at Dr. Berg's findings.\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\n       ``His work is very convincing; I would even say \n     unimpeachable,'' said Dr. Glenn Juday, a forest ecologist at \n     the University of Alaska. ``For the first time, I now think \n     beetle infestation is related to climate change.''\n       While Dr. Juday did not collaborate on Dr. Berg's spruce \n     studies, he relayed some of the findings at a recent \n     conference on climate change in Oslo, as part of the Arctic \n     Climate Impact Assessment Project, a study by scientists from \n     several nations. It was also presented by Dr. Berg himself in \n     a speech at an American forestry conference this year.\n       ``There is enormous excitement over Ed Berg's studies,'' \n     Dr. Juday said.\n       But other scientists are still skeptical, saying it may be \n     only a coincidence that rising temperatures go hand in hand \n     with growing beetle infestations. Some say he has found a big \n     piece of the puzzle, but not all of it.\n       ``I think Ed Berg is only partially correct,'' said Dr. Ed \n     Holsten, who studies insects for the Forest Service in \n     Alaska. The trees on the Kenai are old, and ripe for beetle \n     outbreaks. If they had been logged, or burned in fire, it \n     might have kept the bugs down, Dr. Holsten said.\n       The spruce beetle, which is about a quarter-inch long with \n     six legs, is barely visible to most people who roam through \n     evergreen forests in the West and Alaska. Large swaths of \n     forest in Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming have been felled by the \n     bug. But nothing has approached the Alaska kill.\n       The beetles take to the air in spring, looking for trees to \n     attack. When they find a vulnerable stand, they will signal \n     to other beetles ``a chemical message,'' Dr. Holsten says. \n     They burrow under the bark, feeding on woody capillary tissue \n     that the tree uses to transport nutrients.\n       In Dr. Berg's office, he has a cross-section of a tree that \n     has been under attack by beetles. They build a web of canals \n     as they eat. Eventually, the tree loses its ability to feed \n     itself; it is essentially choked to death, a process that can \n     take several years, Dr. Berg said.\n       Spruce trees produce chemicals, called terpenes, that are \n     supposed to drive beetles off. But when so many beetles go \n     after a single tree, the beetles usually win. As it dies, the \n     normally green needles of spruce will turn red, and then, in \n     later years, silver or gray. Ghostly stands of dead, silver-\n     colored spruce--looking like black and white photographs of a \n     forest--can be seen throughout south-central Alaska, \n     particularly on the Kenai. Scientists estimate that 38 \n     million spruce trees have died in Alaska in the current \n     outbreak.\n       ``It's very hard to live among the dead spruce; it's been a \n     real kick in the teeth,'' said Dr. Berg. ``We all love this \n     beautiful forest.''\n       One reason Dr. Berg may have been able to see the large \n     implications of the beetle attack when others saw only dead \n     trees is that he is one of few government scientists for the \n     Fish and Wildlife Service who is paid to study the big \n     picture.\n       His title is ecologist for the Kenai refuge. ``When they \n     hired me they felt the need to look at things from a broader \n     scale rather than simply do moose counts,'' he said.\n       Working with a doctoral student, Chris Fastie, on a federal \n     grant, Dr. Berg has been matching the volume of dead trees to \n     climate. Since 1987, he said, the Kenai Peninsula has had a \n     string of above-normal temperature years, particularly in the \n     summer. Each of those years coincided with huge outbreaks of \n     beetle infestation and dead trees, matching warmer years and \n     a rise in spruce kills in the early 1970's. Dr. Berg found a \n     similar pattern in the Kluane area of the Canada's Yukon \n     Territory, where it is much colder.\n       Spruce beetle eggs normally hatch by August, then spend the \n     winter, dormant, in larvae beneath the bark. They can \n     withstand temperatures of up to 35 degrees below zero. The \n     normal life of a spruce beetle--if not picked off by \n     woodpeckers or other birds--is two years. But in the warmer \n     years, Dr. Berg and others found that the beetles were \n     completing a two-year cycle in a single year. This mass of \n     insects has consumed nearly every mature spruce tree on the \n     Kenai, until there is very little left to eat. Most of the \n     trees are more than 100 years old.\n       Other scientists say the warming climate may be responsible \n     for a big part of the huge bug outbreak, but not all of it.\n       ``These bugs are coldblooded,'' Dr. Holsten said. ``They \n     are an early warning indicator of climate change. If it warms \n     up enough they can complete that two-year life in a single \n     year.''\n\n\n           warmer weather allows voracious insects to thrive\n\n       Spruce has grown on the Kenai Peninsula for about 8,000 \n     years. Other infestations have killed up to 30 percent of a \n     forested area, before bug populations died from fire or \n     freeze or other natural causes. The current infestation never \n     slowed until the beetles ran out of food.\n       ``It slowed down only after they had literally eaten \n     themselves out of house and home,'' Dr. Berg said.\n       The Forest Service has been studying beetle-killed spruce \n     for some time, but has yet to come up with any way of \n     attacking the insects, other than suggestions of logging and \n     controlled-burn fires--each of which is hotly contested.\n       What may follow in the path of the dead forest will be \n     likely be a mix of grasses, and more hardwood trees like \n     birch, alder and aspens, said Dr. Berg.\n       Climate records have been kept for barely a hundred years \n     in most places in Alaska. By studying tree rings--which \n     expand in warmer years and barely grow in cold years--\n     scientists in Alaska say the current warming period is \n     unmatched for at least 400 years. By studying dead trees, \n     they say they can find no evidence of a spruce beetle \n     outbreak of this magnitude, ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7307-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PATRICIA OBRADOVICH\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the late Oregon Governor \nTom McCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a \nred sky. They are people who say, `This is my community and it's my \nresponsibility to make it better.' ''\n  I rise today to pay tribute to Patricia Obradovich, a remarkable \nOregonian who was a true hero, because she dedicated her entire career \nto making her community, her State, and her Nation a better place. \nPatricia passed away last month at the young age of 44, after a \ncourageous battle against cancer. Her legacy, however, will continue \nlong into the future.\n  Patricia dedicated her entire professional life to working for the \nFederal Government. I have long believed that government service is a \nhigh and important calling. The hours are often long, the pressures are \ngreat, and the monetary compensation is frequently lower than what is \navailable in the private sector. Patricia was one of those individuals \nwho was more concerned with making a difference than making a fortune.\n  Patricia joined the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers as an economist with \nthe Portland, OR District in May of 1981, and continued with the Corps \nfor 21 years. In that time, she served in many roles, including Chief \nof Economics, Acting Chief of Planning, and Outreach Coordinator.\n  During her two decades of service, Patricia earned a reputation in \nOregon and across the Nation as a public servant of great intelligence \nand integrity. She played a leadership role in formulating policy on \nmany projects of national significance, including salmon restoration \nand navigation projects along the Oregon coast and the Columbia River. \nAs an employee of the Federal Government, Patricia received a \nremarkable 26 awards, including an Achievement Medal for Civilian \nService.\n  I had the occasion to meet Patricia several times, and know the very \nhigh regard in which she was held by her co-workers, her countless \nfriends, and her loving family.

Mr. President, I rise today in praise of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act on the occasion of its 12th \nanniversary. The advances in law, health care, education, \ntransportation, and technology promoted in this historic legislation \nover the past 12 years have given Americans with disabilities a new \nlease on life.\n  Today, 53 million Americans live with a disability, of which 1 in 8 \nis severely disabled. Yet due to the landmark Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the stereotypes against these persons are crumbling \nand they are able to lead increasingly integrated fulfilled lives. The \nAmericans with Disabilities Act has provided disabled individuals \nprotection from discrimination in both the public and private sector, \nand guarantees equal access to employment, public services, and public \naccommodations. The Act has also spurred research and improved care for \nseniors, children and mentally disabled persons. In going so, this \nmonumental Act has ensured an improved quality of life for people \nliving with disabilities and has promised disabled children hope for a \nsuccessful future. The contributions of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct over the past 12 years are an inspiration for what can be done to \nimprove the lives of Americans living with disabilities, and a \nproponent of more progress in the future.\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\n  Once again, it gives me great pleasure to recognize and honor today's \ncelebration on behalf of the millions of disabled Americans who may \ncontinue to benefit throughout this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7308-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7308-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7308-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4775) making supplemental appropriations for further recovery \nfrom and response to terrorist attacks on the United States for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/24/senate-section/article/S7308-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1209.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the Economic Growth and Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with respect to the treatment of \nqualified public educational facility bonds as exempt facility bonds; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce. The Permanent \nTax Relief for School Construction Act to make permanent the tax \nbenefits we enacted last year relating to private activity bonds for \nschool construction.\n  Last year, we approved a tax bill which had many important \nprovisions. Unfortunately, these provisions only last until the end of \n2010. That's a pretty poor way to engineer the tax code. American \nfamilies and businesses only have nine years to reap the benefits of \nlower taxes, and right when they are getting used to the current tax \ncode, it will revert to its pre-2001 level. That is simply unfair. In \norder to plan for the long term, families and businesses need to know \nthat the lower taxes we enacted last year will be permanent.\n  An important part of the tax package that we approved last year was \nthe inclusion of elementary and secondary public education under the \nprivate activities for which tax exempt bonds are issued. This \nprovision will make it easier for States and school districts to raise \nmoney to build schools. In a State like mine, where there is a pressing \nneed for school construction and not much revenue to fund it, this tax \nprovision is very important. To see it end in 2010 would prevent many \nnecessary facilities from being built.\n  The harm caused by the sunsetting of this tax provision is clearly \nillustrated by the plight of many of my State's school districts. \nDuring may travels throughout Idaho, I visited quite a few schools, \nmany of which were the products of New Deal work projects in the \n1930's. These schools are falling part now, though, and school \ndistricts have a very difficult time raising the necessary revenue to \nconstruct new buildings. Idaho, like many States, is suffering from \nreduced tax revenue, so aid from the State is just not available to \nsupplement school districts' revenue. Another problem is that it takes \na super-majority to pass a levy to raise property taxes to finance \nschool districts, and in quite a few of Idaho's districts, taxpayers \nare already paying high taxes. In many instances, the revenue isn't \nthere for school districts.\n  We recognized that problem last year and helped out school districts \nby providing tax incentives for school construction bonds. This type of \ntax relief is the best way we in Washington can help school districts. \nEven though we've been increasing the Federal role in education over \nthe past few years, education matters such as school construction are \nstill primarily a local function, as they should be. Every step we take \nto insert a Federal role into this local authority is a step that must \nbe carefully considered. By providing tax incentives for these local \nschool districts, though, we are not undermining their authority. We \nare giving them tools to help themselves, and help the children they \nare serving. Let's make sure that the tax code lets them continue to \nhelp these children after 2010, so that no child is ever left behind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2780. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify the jurisdiction of the United States over waters of the United \nSates; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation to affirm Federal jurisdiction over isolated wetlands. I am \nplease to be joined by Representatives Oberstar and Dingell, who are \ntoday introducing companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In the U.S. Supreme Court's January 2001 decision, Solid Waste Agency \nof Northern Cook County versus the Army Corps of Engineers, a 5 to 4 \nmajority limited the authority of Federal agencies to use the so-called \nmigratory bird rule as the basis for asserting Clean Water Act \njurisdiction over non-navigable, intrastate, isolated wetlands, \nstreams, ponds, and other waterbodies.\n  This decision, known as the SWANCC decision, means that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers can no \nlonger enforce Federal Clean Water Act protection mechanisms to protect \na waterway solely on the basis that it is used as habitat for migratory \nbirds.\n  In its discussion of the case, the Court went beyond the issue of the \nmigratory bird rule and questioned whether Congress intended the Clean \nWater Act to provide protection for isolated ponds, streams, wetlands \nand other waters, as it had been interpreted to provide for most of the \nlast 30 years. While not the legal holding of the case, the Court's \ndiscussion has resulted in a wide variety of interpretations by EPA and \nCorps officials that jeopardize protection for wetlands, and other \nwaters. The wetlands at risk include prairie potholes and bogs, \nfamiliar to many in Wisconsin, and many other types of wetlands.\n  In effect, the Court's decision removed much of the Clean Water Act \nprotection for between 30 percent to 60 percent of the Nation's \nwetlands. An estimate from my home state of Wisconsin suggested that \nmore than 60 percent of the wetlands lost Federal protection in my \nState. My State is not alone. The National Association of State Wetland \nManagers have been collecting data from states across the country. For \nexample, Nebraska estimates they will lose more than 40 percent of \ntheir wetlands. Indiana estimates they will lose 31 percent of total \nwetland acreage and 74 percent of the total number of wetlands. \nDelaware estimates the loss of 33 percent or more of their freshwater \nwetlands. These wetlands absorb floodwaters, prevent pollution from \nreaching our rivers and streams, and provide crucial habitat for most \nof the nations ducks and other waterfowl, as well as hundreds of other \nbird, fish, shellfish and amphibian species. Loss of these waters would \nhave a devastating effect on our environment.\n  In addition, by narrowing the water and wetland areas subject to \nFederal regulation, the decision also shifts more of the economic \nburden for regulating wetlands to State and local governments. My home \nState of Wisconsin has passed State legislation to assume the \nregulation of isolated waters, but many other States have not. This \npatchwork of regulation means that the standards for protection of \nwetlands nationwide is unclear, confusing, and jeopardizes the \nmigratory birds and other wildlife that depend on these wetlands.\n  Therefore, Congress needs to re-establish the common understanding of \nthe Clean Water Act's jurisdiction to protect all waters of the U.S. \nthe understanding that Congress had when the Act was adopted in 1972 as \nreflected in the law, legislative history, and longstanding \nregulations, practice, and judicial interpretations prior to the SWANCC \ndecision.\n  The proposed legislation does three things. It adopts a statutory \ndefinition of ``waters of the United States'' based on a longstanding \ndefinition of waters in the Corps of Engineers' regulations. Second, it \ndeletes the term ``navigable'' from the Act to clarify that Congress's \nprimary concern in 1972 was to protect the nation's waters from \npollution, rather than just sustain the navigability of waterways, and \nto reinforce that original intent.\n  Finally, it includes a set of findings that explain the factual basis \nfor Congress to assert its constitutional authority over waters and \nwetlands, including those that are called isolated, on all relevant \nConstitutional grounds, including the Commerce Clause, the Property \nClause, the Treaty Clause, and the Necessary and Proper Clause. \nAdditionally, the findings clarify Congress' view that protection of \nisolated wetlands and other waters is critical to protect water \nquality, public safety, wildlife, and other public interests, including \nhunting and fishing.\n  I also am very pleased to be have the support of so many \nenvironmental and\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\nconservation groups, and well as organizations that represent those who \nregulate and manage our country's wetlands such as Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Earthjustice, National Wildlife Federation, Sierra \nClub, and the National Association of State Wetland Managers. They \nknow, as I do, that we need to re-affirm the Federal role in isolated \nwetland protection. This legislation is a first step in doing just \nthat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 2781. A bill to amend the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act to \nextend certain protections to franchised refiners or distributors of \nlubricating oil; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the 103rd Congress in 1994, the \nPetroleum Marketing Practices Act, PMPA, was amended to protect \nindependent petroleum wholesalers and retailers from arbitrary and \nunfair termination or non-renewal of their franchise relationships with \nmajor oil companies.\n  However, this protection was provided only to motor and diesel fuel \nfranchisees. Franchisees of other petroleum products sold by the major \noil companies lack similar protection.\n  Today, I rise with Senators Burns and Ensign to introduce a bill that \nextends the same protections enjoyed by the motor fuel industry to the \nlubricant industry.\n  I have heard from a constituent in Nevada that his franchise \nagreement to sell lubricating oils to car dealers in Las Vegas was \narbitrarily canceled with 30 days notice. In essence, he had thirty \ndays to convert all of his customers to a new brand.\n  This seem grossly unfair and, in fact, if the product sold by my \nconstituent were gasoline or diesel fuel rather than lubricating oil, \nit would have been illegal.\n  I have been made aware of similar terminations or non-renewals in \nother states.\n  Without equal protection under the law, lubricant franchisees are \nvulnerable to predatory cancellation by their suppliers. This situation \nis exacerbated by recent mergers and acquisitions in the petroleum \nindustry.\n  The merger of oil giants Chevron and Texaco and Shell Oil's recent \nacquisition of Penzoil-Quaker State will undoubtedly result in the \ntermination of many independent lubricant franchisees. In New Mexico, \nthere was a lubricant franchisee who had been promoting and \ndistributing a branded lubricant to his customers for over 30 years, \nonly be canceled with 30 days notice following a merger of refiners. \nThis unfair practice stifles competition in the marketplace and \ninvariably results in raising the price of the product, which hurts \nAmerican consumers and small business. This is especially troublesome \nin rural areas.\n  Given the increasingly anti-competitive nature of the petroleum \nindustry, the time has come to extend protections under current law for \nmotor fuel marketers to include lubricant franchisees.\n  There are approximately 3,500 independent distributors and nearly \n25,000 commercial retail lube oil outlets that could be impacted by the \nincreasing frequency of lubricant franchise cancellations. Refiners \nhave not suffered by complying with PMPA in motor fuels. Consequently, \nit is hard to believe it would be much of an imposition to include the \nmuch small segment of lubricant franchisees.\n  I introduce this bill today because it protects small businesses, \nbenefits consumers and ensure fair competition in the marketplace.\n  In short, this bill is the right thing to do and I hope my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2781\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will make Medicare's Social Health Maintenance Organization, SHMO, \ndemonstration a permanent part of the Medicare+Choice, M+C, program. I \nam joined by my colleagues from Oregon, New York, Arizona, and \nCalifornia. The Social HMO demonstration was authorized 17 years ago to \ntest models for improving care for frail seniors, expanding access to \nsocial and supportive services and better integrating these expanded \nbenefits with medical services. Clearly, a seventeen year test is long \nenough--it's time for this successful program to become a permanent \nchoice for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Close to 80 percent of national health care expenditures are for \npersons with chronic conditions. Medicare beneficiaries are \ndisproportionately affected by chronic illness. About 85 percent of \npeople 65 and older have one chronic condition, and two thirds have two \nor more. Fully a third of Medicare beneficiaries have four or more \nchronic conditions. This group accounts for almost 80 percent of all \nMedicare spending. Yet, despite the predominance of chronic illness \namong seniors, Medicare continues to operate as an acute care model. So \nmany of the services that are central to the health care needs of \nseniors are not covered by Medicare, including a number of preventive \nservices, care coordination and disease management services, and home \nand community-based support services.\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\n  Social HMOs provide the care coordination and disease management \nservices so critically important to frail and at-risk seniors with \nmultiple chronic conditions and complex care needs. They are required \nto provide expanded care benefits such as prescription drugs, ancillary \nservices such as eyeglasses and hearing aids, and community-based \nservices such as personal care, homemaker services, adult day care, \nmeals, and transportation. These services meet the chronic health care \nneeds of seniors, helping them remain independent, while reducing \nMedicaid expenditures by avoiding or delaying nursing home placement.\n  Several recent studies have shown that Social HMO members are about \n40 percent to 50 percent less likely to have long-term nursing home \nplacements than comparison group members. Further, in a recent survey \nof Social HMO beneficiaries, over three-quarter of respondents \nindicated that the special services offered by their Social HMO were \nimportant to allowing them to keep living at home. Enhanced Social HMO \nservices, such as early detection of illness, development of \ncoordinated care plans to address problems identified during routine \nassessments, screening, and ongoing monitoring of care, has paid off in \nimproved health outcomes for beneficiaries.\n  I am fortunate to represent one of the four original Social HMOs that \nwere approved as part of the initial Medicare demonstration project in \n1985. Senior Advantage II, offered by Kaiser Permanente's Northwest \nDivision, currently serves about 4,300 Medicare beneficiaries from \nSalem, OR to Longview, WA, with its primary service area in Portland, \nOR. Since Kaiser opened its Social HMO program, it has served close to \n15,000 beneficiaries with its enhanced benefits and special geriatric \nprograms, which have led to fewer overall nursing home care days and a \nmore consumer-oriented approach to care for frail or ill seniors.\n  The legislation I am introducing with my distinguished colleagues \ntoday would make permanent the existing Social HMO plans, like Kaiser, \nand would lay the ground work for evaluating whether to expand and \nreplicate this model. Our bill requires the Secretary to conduct a \ncomparative study of beneficiary and family member satisfaction to see \nhow Social HMOs compare to Medicare+Choice and fee-for-service \nMedicare. It also requires MedPAC to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of \nSocial HMOs with respect to reduced nursing home admissions, reduced \nincidence of Medicaid spend-down, and other aspects of the model that \nrepresent potential cost-savings. If MedPAC finds that Social HMOs are \ncost-effective, it must make recommendations to Congress on expanding \nand replicating this model.\n  To ensure that beneficiaries continue to receive the value added they \nhave come to enjoy under this program, the Social HMOs must continue to \nprovide the expanded benefit package currently offered under this \nlegislation. Further, this benefit could not be changed by the \nSecretary without notification of Congress. Finally, to ensure that \nSocial HMOs, which have significantly higher risk levels than average \nMedicare+Choice plans, can continue to finance a high level of \nbenefits, any changes in plans' existing payments would need to go \nthrough a formal rulemaking process.\n  The Social HMO demonstration project has been re-validated by six \nacts of Congress since its creation. It is time to make this program \npermanent and lend a measure of stability to the plans and \nbeneficiaries served by this innovative model. This program represents \na fiscally sound approach to helping manage the chronic health care \nneeds of our Nation's seniors, and I urge all of my colleagues to join \nwith me and the rest of this bill's cosponsors in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2782\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore \nthe tax exempt status of death gratuity payments to members of the \nuniformed services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk and ask that \nit be appropriately referred.\n  Today I am introducing legislation to correct a flaw in our tax \nsystem that penalizes the families of those who die while serving in \nour Armed Forces. The Honor Our Heroes Act will restore compassion to \nthe tax code. It exempts from taxation the money the government \nprovides following the death of an active duty servicemember. This \npayment is known as the death gratuity benefit.\n  Families are often crushed by the weight of funeral and other \nimmediate expenses after a spouse, parent, or child is killed while \nserving in the military. Congress recognized that, at the very least, \nwe owe these men and women assistance with this burden. In 1986, when \nthe benefit was set at $3,000, Congress made this payment tax free. \nOver the years, rising costs led Congress to increase the payment to \n$6,000, but Congress did not make a corresponding change in the tax \ncode. As a result, today, half of the payment is subject to the income \ntax.\n  Now, bereaved families receive this money with a red flag. Families \nare getting get less than the $6,000 Congress meant for them to have. \nWe end up giving with one hand and taking away with the other.\n  Missouri has given two of her sons in the War on Terrorism. The \nfamilies of these men made the greatest sacrifice possible. We should \nnot be asking them to pay taxes on the benefit the government gives \nthem to help pay for funeral expenses and other costs. But since 1991, \nthousands of families have had to pay these taxes. During this time, \nespecially, when so many of members of the military are putting \nthemselves directly in harm's way, we cannot let this unfair taxation \ncontinue.\n  Our colleagues in the House have taken an important step toward \nrepairing this flaw, but they neglect the families for whom a future \nincrease in the death gratuity would lead to tax liability. My bill \nleaves no such doubt. The Honor Our Heroes Act makes the entire amount \nof the death gratuity payment exempt from taxes, immediately and \npermanently. This bill ensures that payments made to families of \nservicemembers are never taxed again.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will make our Nation's \ngratitude tax-free to families coping with the death of a loved one. We \nowe this to our men and women in uniform, and pray that their families \nnever have to face such a loss. I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2785. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax filing delay for members of the Armed Forces serving in a \ncontingency operation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Armed Forces Filing Fairness Act of 2002.\n  Current law allows for servicemembers serving in a combat zone, like \nAfghanistan, to receive a tax filing extension. The Armed Forces Filing \nFairness Act will extend that filing deadline for military \nservicemembers serving in contingency operations as well. This bill \nwould allow the military servicemember to delay filing taxes until they \nhave returned to the United States, or when the combat zone or \ncontingency area is no longer designated as such by the Department of \nDefense.\n  As the father of a son who serves in the Army and has recently \nreturned from Afghanistan, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwill help to lift some of the burdens from our military men and women \nserving so bravely in combat zones and contingency operations around \nthe world. I am committee to improving the quality of life for our \nmilitary servicemembers and their families, and I am proud to introduce \nthe Armed Forces Filing Fairness Act of 2002, which will help make life \njust a little easier for our men and women in uniform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 2786. A bill to provide a cost-sharing requirement for the \nconstruction of\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nthe Arkansas Valley Conduit in the State of Colorado; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, water is a precious resource that \nnourishes our civilization and cultivates our society. Yet finding \nclean, inexpensive water in Southeastern Colorado, can be difficult. \nThat is why today I am introducing legislation that paves the way for \nexpedited construction of the Arkansas Valley Conduit, a pipeline that \nwill provide the small, financially strapped towns and water agencies \nalong the Arkansas River with safe, clean, affordable water. By \nproviding for the Federal Government to pay for 75 percent of the \nconstruction costs of the Conduit, we can put Southeastern Coloradans \nin the position of being able to provide themselves with the water that \nthey so vitally need.\n  The Conduit was originally authorized with the enactment of the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project in 1962. Due to Southeastern Colorado's \ndepressed economic status and the fact that the authorizing statute \nlacked a cost share formula, the Conduit was never built. Until \nrecently, the region has been fortunate enough to enjoy an economical \nand safe alternative to pipeline-transportation of Project Water: the \nArkansas River. Sadly, the water quality in the Arkansas has seriously \ndeclined. At the same time, the federal government has continued to \nstrengthen its water quality standards while providing no assistance to \nwater municipalities struggling to meet those standards. In order to \ncomply with these standards. In order to comply with these standards, \nthe region's municipalities have begun exploring options for water \ntreatment, some of which are estimated to cost between $20,000,000 and \n$40,000,000. Taken together, the municipalities alone are facing \npotential expenditures of $320,000,000 to $640,000,000, simply to \ncomply with federally mandated water quality standards. As you know, \nthis is not a financially feasible option for small farming \ncommunities.\n  The local sponsors of the project have initiated, and are nearing the \ncompletion of, an independently funded feasibility study of the \nConduit. They have developed a coalition of support from water users in \nSoutheastern Colorado and are exploring options for financing their 25 \npercent share of the costs.\n  Because forty years have passed between the enactment of the \nauthorizing statute and the current efforts to build the Conduit, the \nBureau of Reclamation has stated that a Reevaluation Statement, rather \nthan a Reconnaissance Study, is the next appropriate action. I would \nlike to see the Bureau begin the Reevaluation Statement as quickly as \npossible. To help make this happen, I have made a request for an \nadditional $300,000 in the Bureau's General Investigations account to \nbe used to prepare the Statement and to begin work in earnest on the \nConduit.\n  I am pleased to learn that the Appropriations Committee is currently \nworking to include the funding for the Reevaluation Statement, the \nConduit's next step.\n  With the help of my colleagues, the promise made by Congress forty \nyears ago to the people of Southeastern Colorado, will finally become a \nreality. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2786\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to revise the boundary of the Wind Cave National Park \nin the State of South Dakota; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wind Cave \nNational Park Boundary Revision Act.\n  Wind Cave National Park, located in southwestern South Dakota, is one \nof the Park System's precious natural treasures and one of the Nation's \nfirst national parks. The cave itself, after which the park is named, \nis one of the world's oldest, longest and most complex cave systems, \nwith more than 103 miles of mapped tunnels. The cave is well known for \nits exceptional display of boxwork, a rare, honeycomb-shaped formation \nthat protrudes from the cave's ceilings and walls. While the cave is \nthe focal point of the park, the land above the cave is equally \nimpressive, with 28,000 acres of rolling meadows, majestic forests, \ncreeks, and streams. As one of the few remaining mixed-grass prairie \necosystems in the country, the park is home to abundant wildlife, such \nas bison, deer, elk and birds, and is a National Game Preserve.\n  The Wind Cave National Park Boundary Revision Act will help expand \nthe park by approximately 20 percent in the southern ``keyhole'' \nregion. This land currently is owned by a ranching family that wants to \nsee it protected from development and preserved for future generations. \nThe land is a natural extension of the park, and boasts the mixed-grass \nprairie and ponderosa pine forests found in the rest of the park, \nincluding a dramatic river canyon. The addition of this land will \nenhance recreation for hikers who come for the solitude of the park's \nback country. It will also protect archaeological sites, such as a \nbuffalo jump over which early Native Americans once drove the bison \nthey hunted, and improve fire management.\n  This plan to expand the park has strong, but not universal, support \nin the surrounding community, whose views recently were expressed \nduring a 60-day public comment period on the proposal. Most South \nDakotans recognize the value in expanding the park, not only to \nencourage additional tourism in the Black Hills, but to permanently \nprotect these extraordinary lands for future generations of Americans \nto enjoy. Understandably, however, some are legitimately concerned \nabout the potential loss of hunting opportunities and local tax \nrevenue.\n  Governor Janklow has expressed his conditional support for the park \nexpansion, stating that there must be no reduction in the amount of \nlands with public access that currently can be hunted, that there must \nbe no loss of tax revenue to the county from the expansion, and that \nchronic wasting disease issues must be dealt with effectively. There \nare reasonable conditions that should be met as this process moves \nforward.\n  The legislation I am introducing today protects hunting opportunities \nfor sportsmen by excluding 880 acres of School and Public Lands \nproperty from the expansion. In addition, Wind Cave National Park and \nthe Trust for Public Lands are working with interested parties to find \na way to offset the loss of local county tax revenues. Finally, I \nunderstand that the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks Department has \nreached an agreement with Wind Cave officials to expand research into \nchronic wasting disease, which will benefit wildlife populations \nnationwide. I am satisfied that the legitimate concerns about the \npotential expansion have been effectively addressed and today am moving \nforward to begin the legislative phase of this process.\n  In conclusion, Wind Cave National Park has been a valued American\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\ntreasure for nearly 100 years. We have an opportunity with this \nlegislation to expand the park and enhance its value to the public so \nthat visitors will enjoy it even more during the next 100 years.

Congress approved the \n     Pick-Sloan Missouri River Basin program (referred to in this \n     section as the ``Pick-Sloan program'')--\n       (A) to promote the general economic development of the \n     United States;\n       (B) to provide for irrigation above Sioux City, Iowa;\n       (C) to protect urban and rural areas from devastating \n     floods of the Missouri River; and\n       (D) for other purposes;\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n       (2) the waters impounded for the Fort Randall and Gavins \n     Point projects of the Pick-Sloan program have inundated the \n     fertile, wooded bottom lands along the Missouri River that \n     constituted the most productive agricultural and pastoral \n     lands of, and the homeland of, the members of the Yankton \n     Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe;\n       (3) the Fort Randall project (including the Fort Randall \n     Dam and Reservoir) overlies the western boundary of the \n     Yankton Sioux Tribe Indian Reservation;\n       (4) the Gavins Point project (including the Gavins Point \n     Dam and Reservoir) overlies the eastern boundary of the \n     Santee Sioux Tribe;\n       (5) although the Fort Randall and Gavins Point projects are \n     major components of the Pick-Sloan program, and contribute to \n     the economy of the United States by generating a substantial \n     amount of hydropower and impounding a substantial quantity of \n     water, the reservations of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the \n     Santee Sioux Tribe remain undeveloped;\n       (6) the United States Army Corps of Engineers took the \n     Indian lands used for the Fort Randall and Gavins Point \n     projects by condemnation proceedings;\n       (7) the Federal Government did not give the Yankton Sioux \n     Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe an opportunity to receive \n     compensation for direct damages from the Pick-Sloan program, \n     even though the Federal Government gave 5 Indian reservations \n     upstream from the reservations of those Indian tribes such an \n     opportunity;\n       (8) the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe did \n     not receive just compensation for the taking of productive \n     agricultural Indian lands through the condemnation referred \n     to in paragraph (6);\n       (9) the settlement agreement that the United States entered \n     into with the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the Santee Sioux Tribe \n     to provide compensation for the taking by condemnation \n     referred to in paragraph (6) did not take into account the \n     increase in property values over the years between the date \n     of taking and the date of settlement; and\n       (10) in addition to the financial compensation provided \n     under the settlement agreements referred to in paragraph \n     (9)--\n       (A) the Yankton Sioux Tribe should receive an aggregate \n     amount equal to $23,023,743 for the loss value of 2,851.40 \n     acres of Indian land taken for the Fort Randall Dam and \n     Reservoir of the Pick-Sloan program; and\n       (B) the Santee Sioux Tribe should receive an aggregate \n     amount equal to $4,789,010 for the loss value of 593.10 acres \n     of Indian land located near the Santee village.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my admiration \nand gratitude to a woman who served the State of Louisiana and indeed \nthe entire Nation with devotion and sense of unwavering dedication. \nThroughout her life, she answered every call to service made to her.\n  Lindy came to Washington in 1940 with her husband, the late Hale \nBoggs and following his tragic death in 1972, she became the first \nwoman to elected to the House of Representatives from the State of \nLouisiana. She continued\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nher service to Congress until 1990, when she retired to New Orleans. In \nCongress she sat on the Appropriations Committee and the Select \nCommittee on Children, Youth, and Families, spearheading legislation on \nissues ranging from civil rights to pay equity for women. She chaired \nthe committees on the Bicentennials of the American Constitution in \n1987 and the House of Representatives in 1989. In 1997, President \nClinton asked her to assist her country once again, this time as the \nAmerican ambassador to the Vatican.\n  But the reasons to honor Lindy go far beyond a recitation of her \nresume, distinguished as it may be. Lindy Boggs continues to be a role \nmodel for those of us in Congress and thousands of young women across \nthis country who aspire to public service. She used her Southern charm \nand keen political mind to become one of the most formidable forces in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. She served as a mentor and teacher \nto me as well as the Congresswomen that followed her. She not only \ntaught them the rules and expectations of Members of Congress, she \ntaught us how to be a strong, independent women.\n  Lindy is the founder of the Congressional Women's Caucus, a \nlegislative body that has done so much in its 25-year history. Twenty-\nfive years ago, very few women had served in the Senate, and today we \nhave 13. Thirteen women, and that number is sure to grow. As women, we \nchampion the rights of women everywhere from Afghanistan to China and \neven here at home. We are a force to be reckoned with, and Lindy is our \nleader.\n  What is most impressive about Lindy is the long list of firsts that \naccompany her biography. She was the first female Representative \nelected from Louisiana, the first women to chair the National \nDemocratic Convention, the first women to sit on the Board of Regents \nof the Smithsonian Institution and the first woman to serve as \nambassador to the Holy See.\n  She continues to be my mentor and even more, my friend. It is an \nhonor to join the entire Louisiana delegation and I am sure women in \npublic service everywhere to honor this very special Louisiana and \nAmerican, Lindy Boggs.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution and \npreamble be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my admiration \nand gratitude to a woman who served the State of Louisiana and indeed \nthe entire Nation with devotion and sense of unwavering dedication. \nThroughout her life, she answered every call to service made to her.\n  Lindy came to Washington in 1940 with her husband, the late Hale \nBoggs and following his tragic death in 1972, she became the first \nwoman to elected to the House of Representatives from the State of \nLouisiana. She continued\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\nher service to Congress until 1990, when she retired to New Orleans. In \nCongress she sat on the Appropriations Committee and the Select \nCommittee on Children, Youth, and Families, spearheading legislation on \nissues ranging from civil rights to pay equity for women. She chaired \nthe committees on the Bicentennials of the American Constitution in \n1987 and the House of Representatives in 1989. In 1997, President \nClinton asked her to assist her country once again, this time as the \nAmerican ambassador to the Vatican.\n  But the reasons to honor Lindy go far beyond a recitation of her \nresume, distinguished as it may be. Lindy Boggs continues to be a role \nmodel for those of us in Congress and thousands of young women across \nthis country who aspire to public service. She used her Southern charm \nand keen political mind to become one of the most formidable forces in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. She served as a mentor and teacher \nto me as well as the Congresswomen that followed her. She not only \ntaught them the rules and expectations of Members of Congress, she \ntaught us how to be a strong, independent women.\n  Lindy is the founder of the Congressional Women's Caucus, a \nlegislative body that has done so much in its 25-year history. Twenty-\nfive years ago, very few women had served in the Senate, and today we \nhave 13. Thirteen women, and that number is sure to grow. As women, we \nchampion the rights of women everywhere from Afghanistan to China and \neven here at home. We are a force to be reckoned with, and Lindy is our \nleader.\n  What is most impressive about Lindy is the long list of firsts that \naccompany her biography. She was the first female Representative \nelected from Louisiana, the first women to chair the National \nDemocratic Convention, the first women to sit on the Board of Regents \nof the Smithsonian Institution and the first woman to serve as \nambassador to the Holy See.\n  She continues to be my mentor and even more, my friend. It is an \nhonor to join the entire Louisiana delegation and I am sure women in \npublic service everywhere to honor this very special Louisiana and \nAmerican, Lindy Boggs.\n  Mr. REID.
