The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Members of the Senate, we are very \nclose to working out an arrangement this morning that should be good \nfor everyone. I spoke to a number of farm State Senators last night and \nthey thought it was very important that Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas \nbe allowed to offer an amendment. We have worked throughout the night \nand the morning with Senator Hutchinson and worked out a time agreement \non that,N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2002, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $422 per year or $211 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $5.00 per copy.

DiMario, Public \nPrinter\n\n[[Page S13648]]\n\nso as soon as Senator Lugar arrives we will be ready to offer this \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is our intention to go to the \nHutchinson amendment. As I think our colleagues are aware, the \nHutchinson amendment is largely the Agriculture farm bill passed by the \nHouse. It may not be exactly the same bill, but that is the intent. \nCertainly Senator Hutchinson can speak for himself, and will.\n  It is my intent after that, then, to go to the cloture motion.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments also be laid aside; \nthat Senator Hutchinson be recognized to offer his amendment, No. 2678; \nthat there be 1 hour 15 minutes for debate with Senator Hutchinson in \ncontrol of 60 minutes, Senator Harkin or his designee in control of 15 \nminutes prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the vote; further, that the vote in \nrelation to the amendment occur at 12:50.\n  Immediately following disposition of the Hutchinson amendment, the \nSenate will proceed to the previously ordered cloture vote on the \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to cooperate in every way with the majority \nleader and the managers of the bill, but I wonder if the majority \nleader, trying to make a request to have the Hutchinson amendment--I \nhave no objection to that portion. I do know that Senator Grassley, \nSenator Dorgan, myself, and others have a lot of interest in the \npayment limitation. I am not positive whether or not it is germane \npostcloture.\n  I guess part of your request is that we go immediately to the cloture \nvote. I wonder if you are willing to delete that second paragraph or if \nyou are willing to make sure that the Grassley amendment would be in \norder, regardless of which way the result of the cloture vote would \noccur.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would want to consult with the Parliamentarian and \nSenator Harkin and others. We have attempted, as the Senator knows, to \naccommodate a number of Senators who have asked to be exempted from \ncloture limitations following the time when cloture is invoked. I am \nnot enthusiastic about expanding.\n  Again, it would be my understanding that these amendments would be \navailable to us postcloture, with clarification of the Parliamentarian, \nand we will offer this at another time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if I might inquire, at a previous time I \nasked the majority leader if this amendment would be in order, or part \nof the unanimous consent that this amendment would be in order \npostcloture, and we agreed to that. Does that agreement still carry? \nThere were four or five amendments, if I remember correctly, or one or \ntwo, and a couple of others. If they were agreed to, there were two \nadditional ones. If that still applies, that is fine with this Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I intended this as a new unanimous \nconsent request. Therefore, the other ones--because of the old \nunanimous consent request--have already expired. Technically, it would \nnot carry.\n  I think the best thing to do would be to consult with the \nParliamentarian in terms of germaneness and make a decision at a later \ntime.\n  I wonder if we might proceed. The cloture vote, by rules of the \nSenate, takes place within 1 hour after we come in. We do not need the \nsecond portion of the unanimous consent request in order to proceed \nwith cloture. But I would like to accommodate Senator Hutchinson. I \nwould make that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure what \nwe are doing. First, the leader said we would like to inquire whether \nor not Senator Grassley and others want to offer their amendments. I \nwant to protect their rights to offer their amendments.\n  There is an amendment dealing with payment limitation. Some of us are \nkind of concerned about the underlying Harkin bill that has payment \nlimitations of 250. That can be expanded to 500 per family. The \nGrassley amendment that Senator Dorgan and others have supported would \nreduce that. I want to make sure that amendment is going to be debated \nbefore we conclude the agriculture bill. I don't want that amendment to \nbe ruled nongermane postcloture. That is what I am trying to find out \nbefore we make an agreement.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is the Grassley amendment germane postcloture?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Is that the same as the original Dorgan amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment has not yet been \nreviewed for germaneness.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I didn't catch that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment has not been reviewed \nfor germaneness.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That wasn't my understanding. Regardless, I will \nvigorously oppose cloture if that is what the majority leader's \nintention is. I urge him to ask consent to postpone the cloture vote \nuntil we determine what the outcome of some of these amendments is. \nSome of us are going to continue to oppose cloture until we have a \nchance to have our amendments heard, debated, and voted on in the \nSenate.\n  If you insist--and I am sure the majority leader is correct most of \nthe time--cloture will expire after so many hours. But I will just tell \nhim that some of us are going to be opposing cloture vigorously until \nthe Senator from Iowa and others have a chance to have their amendments \nheard and voted on.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very sympathetic to the Senator from \nOklahoma. We have been on this bill for an awfully long time. I think \nwe are almost at a point where we have broken the record now for the \nlength of time we have been on a farm bill. Senators had many \nopportunities to offer amendments at night and during the day. I am not \nreally sympathetic to those who suggest that somehow we have not \naccorded enough time to some of these amendments.\n  I also say we have come to the conclusion that we are going to have \nto make a decision about the farm bill. If we are unable to invoke \ncloture, it is my intention to put it back on the calendar, \nregrettably, and then move to other issues. We have conference reports \nthat have to be done before we leave. There are other pieces of \nbusiness that are required of us. This will be the third cloture vote. \nThere will be no more cloture votes in this session of Congress on the \nfarm bill.\n  Senators are going to have to make up their minds: Do they want to \nindefinitely postpone and thereby kill our chances for completing work \non the farm bill this year or not? If they want to kill it, they will \nvote against cloture. If they want to support completing our work, they \nwill vote for cloture this afternoon and we will complete our work. \nThat still requires 30 hours of debate on the bill prior to the time we \ncomplete our work. That means that relevant amendments will be \nentertained, will be accepted, or voted upon and considered as germane \namendments. That is the prerogative of every Senator even after \ncloture. Perhaps amendments can be designed to be germane. I certainly \nthink a payment limit amendment is germane to the bill.\n  We ought to find the language that accommodates the Senator from \nOklahoma, if that is his intent.\n  But I will say we have been on this bill for a record amount of time. \nIt will be virtually a record if we complete our 30 hours. We do have \nother very important matters pending.\n  I want to make sure all Senators are put on notice. Three times, and \nwe are out in terms of cloture. And three times, it seems to me, ought \nto be adequate time for everybody to have had\n\n[[Page S13649]]\n\ntheir amendments considered. As we have noted, a number of other \ncolleagues have asked for special consideration for their amendments. \nWe are attempting to do that. We have to move on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the distinguished majority leader that I have \nreceived two notes from the cloakroom that they want to put out a list \nif in fact there is a postcloture list of amendments.\n  I also say that last night I had a conversation with a number of farm \nState Senators who have been voting against cloture. They said if we \nwould allow Hutchinson a vote, they would be willing to vote for \ncloture.\n  We worked last night and all morning trying to work out an \narrangement where there could be a vote on Hutchinson. We have given \nthe Hutchinson forces 1 hour. We have taken 15 minutes to show that we \nare serious about moving this bill forward. It appears that no matter \nwhat we do, it isn't quite enough.\n  I hope my counterpart, the distinguished assistant minority leader, \nwill allow us to go forward. This is an opportunity, in my opinion, to \npass a farm bill. We will live by whatever the rules are.\n  I was informed, obviously incorrectly, yesterday that \nthe Parliamentarian thought Dorgan would be in order postcloture. I \nhope it is. I think it is something we should debate.\n\n  But the fact of the matter is we have gone a long way this morning in \nworking this out. I applaud the Senator from Arkansas. He wanted more \ntime than the hour--an hour and 15 minutes. He believed, I guess, that \nwas fair.\n  I think we should go forward and then have a fair third and final \nvote on cloture.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada noted, our \ncolleague for good reason wanted to be able to offer the so-called \nCochran-Roberts alternative. We have done that. We have had very good \ndebates on a number of other questions over the last couple of weeks. \nIn order to accommodate the Senator from Arkansas and others who \nbelieve we ought to at least have a chance to vote on the House-passed \nbill, we are now going to do that.\n  I honestly think we have been as fair and responsible as we can be to \nthe request made by our colleagues. I hope now that we can get this \nagreement.\n  I renew my request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nparliamentary inquiry: Is the Grassley amendment germane postcloture?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is being reviewed at \nthis time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask the majority leader to modify his unanimous \nconsent request so that the Grassley amendment be considered germane \npostcloture in the event cloture is invoked.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, I think I have something \nbetter than being part of the unanimous consent agreement, or something \nbetter than even a veto to do this. I had the word of the Senate \nmajority whip that I was going to be able to bring my amendment up \nright after the Durbin amendment this morning after 11:30. It seems to \nme, if I have the word of a fellow Senator that I have a chance to \nbring my amendment up, I don't even have to be included in a unanimous \nconsent. If you want to nail it down that way, nail it down; it is OK \nwith me. But it seems to me I was told by the majority leader that I \nwas going to be able to bring my amendment up, and that word is better \nthan anything else that can go on in this body.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend from Oklahoma yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. There is nobody for whom I have more respect than the \nSenator from Iowa. We serve together on select committees. He is \nabsolutely right. We thought when we came here this morning we were \ngoing to go to the Durbin amendment and then a Republican amendment. He \nhad been standing around waiting for a while, and we did say that. But \nthe fact is, there have been intervening things. I am not going back on \nmy word. We thought we were going to do a totally different thing. And \nI am sorry there has been some misunderstanding. But I would never \nintentionally mislead the Senator from Iowa.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I can regain my right to the floor, \nlet me simply say that we moved the cloture vote to 1:30 to accommodate \nsome of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. That has been \nlocked in at 1:30. We also attempted to accommodate the Senator from \nArkansas with this unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is 1:15, not 1:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The UC was 1:15?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. OK. We hoped we could accommodate the Senator from \nArkansas with a vote on his amendment so that it could be taken before \nthe cloture vote. That is all this unanimous consent request is \ndesigned to do. So if we cannot get it, we will just proceed, the \nSenator from Arkansas can offer his amendment, and we can do it without \na UC. So if I cannot get that agreement, I will simply withdraw the \nrequest and perhaps we can proceed with the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want my friend from Iowa, because I want to protect \nhis interests on this amendment----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know you are.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader is basically saying we have an hour \nand 15 minutes to debate the Hutchinson amendment, and then we will \nvote on cloture. And then we are going to find out that the Grassley \namendment is nongermane postcloture if cloture is invoked. So it would \nnot be in order to take up the Grassley-Dorgan amendment.\n  I have been here for 3 or 4 days trying to make sure we get a vote. \nNo one has been filibustering this bill--no one. I know Senator \nGrassley was here late last night trying to offer this amendment. I \nknow yesterday, three or four times, I came up and said: I am ready to \ndo a payment limitation amendment. Every amendment we have had has been \ngermane to the bill.\n  We did not offer the energy package. We did not even offer the \nstimulus package; I thought about it. I might still do that if it is \nstill the pending bill. I want to get the stimulus done before we get \nout of here. The amendments have been germane on agriculture.\n  To have an amendment such as payment limitation, when the underlying \nbill allows a few farmers to make hundreds and hundreds of thousands of \ndollars, to be squeezed out because of cloture I think is wrong.\n  So I guess the essence is that I will not object to a time limit on \nSenator Hutchinson's amendment. If the majority leader proceeds with \nthe cloture vote, I will urge my colleagues, in the strongest terms, to \nplease vote no on cloture so amendments that are germane--that are \nreally germane that might fall on the strict interpretation of \npostcloture--that they will have a right to offer those amendments.\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, who respect \nindividual Senators having the right to amend a bill that is enormously \ncomplicated but important--that they have a right to offer those \namendments.\n\n  So I will not object to the majority leader's request to have a time \nlimit on the Hutchinson amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2678 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \npending amendments are laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2678 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n\n[[Page S13650]]\n\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add, as \ncosponsors to the amendment, Senators Lott, Helms, Sessions, and Kay \nBailey Hutchison.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, the \nmajority whip, and Senator Harkin for their cooperation and their \nwillingness to allow us to have this debate on, essentially, the House-\npassed bill.\n  This is the bill that was introduced earlier this year in an effort \nto break the logjam on a farm bill. It is a bipartisan bill, as it was \nintroduced with four Democrats and three Republicans. To me, there is \nno doubt, as we come to this impasse, that the only way--absolutely the \nonly way--we will get a farm bill signed into law this year is for us \nto take up an easily conferenceable bill with the House.\n  I have talked with the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. \nIf we would pass this bill--this amendment, and then the amended bill--\nwe would be able to conference it within an hour, and we would be able \nto send it to the President. That is the only prospect we have of \ngetting a much needed farm bill to the President this year. That is why \nI rise to urge my colleagues to move forward and support this \namendment.\n  Since the beginning of this debate, I have been urged by the farmers \nof my State to try to get a farm bill completed this year. Time and \ntime again, I have told them that I would do everything I could to get \na farm bill completed this year. I have expressed support for the House \nfarm bill. I have worked with my colleagues to craft and introduce this \nbipartisan proposal. It was originally, when introduced, sponsored by a \nnumber of Members on both sides. I supported, in the committee, the \nCochran-Roberts plan. I supported the chairman's commodity title. In \nfact, I believe I was the only Republican in committee to support the \nchairman's commodity title. I supported the passage of the chairman's \nfarm bill out of the Agriculture Committee. And I have supported \ncloture on the chairman's substitute two times.\n\n  I want a farm bill. I voted in support of moving forward at every \npoint during this debate.\n  If this substitute is not going to move forward and go to conference, \nperhaps it is time for a new approach. It is clear, after two cloture \nvotes, that the Harkin-Daschle substitute does not have adequate \nsupport to move to passage. And, may I say, if we were somehow able to \nmove the Harkin-Daschle substitute through, get cloture, and get it \npassed this week, we would have an enormous gap between this bill and \nthe House bill, and, as Senator Harkin admitted last night, it would be \nweeks before we could reach a consensus on those two bills. This is why \nI am offering the bill that I offered with Senators Lincoln, Helms, \nMiller, Sessions, Landrieu, and Breaux earlier this year.\n  We can debate the merits of the bills. There is no doubt that as this \nday and this debate goes on, we will engage in some substantial policy \nissues. However, at the end of the day, we must have a bill that can \nget the votes necessary to pass the Senate, be conferenced, and signed \nby the President this year. So far, the bill that has been offered has \nnot been able to garner the support necessary to get out of the Senate \nand provide the support and certainty that our farmers are asking for \nand desperately need.\n  The fact that these votes appear to be breaking down on party lines \nshould be troubling because agriculture is not a partisan issue. \nAgriculture spans across all of our States and should not be allowed to \ndegenerate into a partisan finger pointing contest. That is what I have \nbeen hearing: accusations that one party or the other is blocking the \nmove on a farm bill this year.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. It is my sincere hope that \nthis bipartisan proposal can help break this logjam which is keeping us \naway from our home States and, more importantly, is denying our \nNation's farmers the necessary fixes to what amounts to a broken farm \npolicy.\n  Is this the absolute best policy that can come out of this Senate? \nMaybe not. Will it have the type of funding numbers in it that everyone \ncan go back to their home State and expect resounding praise for? \nProbably not. That is probably unlikely as well.\n  However, we must also consider whether this proposal is, in fact, \nbetter than the policy with which our farmers are currently dealing. \nWhat I hear from the farmers in Arkansas--and I think this is true \nacross this Nation--is that they need certainty and predictability. If \nthey are going to have certainty and predictability, they need to have \na farm bill. As they go to seek financing arrangements for this next \nyear, bankers are looking for some predictability, some certainty in \nfarm policy. That can only happen if we pass a bill.\n  So the question is, is this amendment that I am offering today--one \nthat was originally offered as a bipartisan proposal in this Chamber, \nand that was a bipartisan vote in the House. In fact, in the House, \nthere were 151 Republicans, 139 Democrats, and one Independent who \nvoted for this bill. This is the only true bipartisan approach. If it \nis, in fact, better than current farm policy, and is the only prospect \nof getting a bill to the President this year, should we not, then, on a \nbipartisan basis, unite behind it?\n  I think it is clear that the farm policy in this amendment is much \nbetter than the current policy. We must also consider whether our \nfarmers are better off with no farm bill at all, which appears to be \nwhere we are headed right now. I think my farmers have been quite clear \nwith me on this issue, as I am sure farmers in other States have made \nit clear to their Senators.\n  This amendment, as I have said, is very similar to the House-passed \nfarm bill which ended up passing on a bipartisan basis. I realize there \nwere many hotly contested amendments throughout this process, but in \nthe end this bill in the House enjoyed resounding bipartisan support \nand should garner that kind of support in this Chamber as well.\n\n  I am keenly aware that a number of my colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle believe they have garnered concessions from Senator Harkin \nand Senator Daschle and that their concerns have been addressed in the \nHarkin-Daschle substitute. I am aware of that. I appreciate the \nwillingness of Senators Daschle and Harkin to make those concessions \nand to address concerns that various Senators had. But if those \nconcessions come at the price of refusing to support a bipartisan \napproach and the end result is that we have no bill that goes forward \nout of this Chamber this year, we have no bill that is passed and goes \nto the President for his signature, then I suggest that all those \nconcessions and all those improvements in the Harkin-Daschle substitute \nbill are in fact meaningless because they are not passed into law.\n  On Monday of this week, the American Farm Bureau sent a letter, a \npublic letter, in which they wrote:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation encourages the Senate \n     leadership to expedite debate and for the Senate to complete \n     a new farm bill by noon next Wednesday, December 19.\n\n  That is the moment we have just passed. The Farm Bureau continued:\n\n       It is vitally important that this legislation be enacted \n     this year to provide an important economic stimulus to rural \n     America before Congress adjourns.\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments of the American Farm \nBureau in this letter. This is why I am offering this amendment. If \nthis amendment is adopted, I am confident we will be able to move to \ninvoke cloture and we will pass a farm bill this year. I promised the \nfarmers of my State I would do everything I could do to get a farm bill \ncompleted this year. I am sure many of you have made the same promise. \nThis is our opportunity to make good on that promise and on that \ncommitment.\n  To say to the farmers of America, I am going to march in lockstep \nwith my party leadership in spite of the fact that the end result of \nthat approach will be no bill, no cloture, no Presidential signature, \nand no farm bill by December 31, is blind partisanship that\n\n[[Page S13651]]\n\nhurts the farmers of this country. This is our opportunity to pass a \nfarm bill this year.\n  The policies included in this amendment have been supported by both \nRepublicans and Democrats in the House. The policies included in this \namendment have been supported by both Republicans and Democrats in this \nSenate. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the amendment \noffered today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the completion of a farm bill this \nyear. It is not sufficient to say: I voted for cloture to end debate \nand get a farm bill this year, if you know in your heart that because \nof that stand, because of voting in lockstep and an unwillingness to \ntake a bipartisan approach, an approach that we know can be conferenced \nwith the House this year, that is a self-defeating approach that will \nnot be a sufficient answer to the farmers in this country.\n  This is our opportunity to get it done. Let's not waste it.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support for the amendment. Will it have \neverything in it? It most assuredly will not. It will in some areas. \nWill the funding be as high? Will the commodity title not be as high as \nit is in the Harkin bill? The answer to that is, that is true. In some \nareas, it won't. It won't be a bill that will satisfy everybody. But it \nis the only vehicle before the Senate. It is the only possible answer \nto the conundrum in which we find ourselves. It is the only possible \nway we can get a bill signed into law by the President of the United \nStates.\n  I repeat, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the House has \nsaid this amendment, if adopted, would be easily and quickly \nconferenceable with the House-passed bill, meaning that before we leave \nthis place for Christmas, we will be able to reward the farmers of this \ncountry with an end-of-the-year commitment that their farm policy is \ntaken seriously by Congress, that we have risen above blind \npartisanship, that we are willing to put the farmers of this country \nabove party loyalty, and that we have done absolutely our level best to \nget a bill signed into law by the President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the House \nAgriculture Committee's Web page statement today, December 19, 2001.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Senate Presented With Path to Speedy Farm Bill Conclusion\n\n\n   Arkansas Senator Tim Hutchinson moves for vote on House-based bill\n\n       December 19, 2001.--House Agriculture Committee Chairman \n     Larry Combest commended Arkansas Senator Tim Hutchinson for \n     giving farmers a real prospect of getting a finalized farm \n     bill this year by urging the Senate to pass the House-based \n     farm bill. The Hutchinson provision already has the bi-\n     partisan support of Senators who cosponsored the measure when \n     it was introduced in the Senate November 9. Ag Chairman \n     Combest noted the Hutchinson provision is more than 95 \n     percent identical to the October 5th House-passed ``Farm \n     Security Act of 2001,'' and Senate passage of the Hutchinson \n     provision is the only chance to finalize a farm bill this \n     year.\n       ``Senator Tim Hutchinson has worked for producers in a \n     positive, practical manner each step of the way to move the \n     Senate to completion of a farm bill, and today is holding \n     forth a light for Senators on the path to a speedy conclusion \n     of the farm bill,'' said Combest. ``Farmers and their lenders \n     need the certainty of a new farm bill as they prepare now for \n     the coming crop year. Senators can do a lot to ease farmers' \n     worries now and help our rural communities by passing the \n     Hutchinson provision today.''\n       Like the House-passed Farm Security Act, the bill \n     introduced by Senators Hutchinson, Blanche Lincoln, Jesse \n     Helms, Zell Miller, Mary Landrieu, and John Breaux not only \n     provides for a strong safety net, but it maintains planting \n     flexibility and avoids harmful market distortions. Also, like \n     the House-passed bill, the option offered for Senate vote \n     today complies with WTO commitments and with the Budget \n     Resolution passed by Congress while increasing investment in \n     conservation programs to the highest levels ever.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will quote a portion of this for my colleagues. \nThis was placed on their Web page today, December 19, 2001, from House \nAgriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest. He commends this \namendment ``for giving farmers a real prospect of getting a finalized \nfarm bill this year.'' He urges the Senate to pass this amendment. \nChairman Combest noted: ``The Hutchinson provision is more than 95 \npercent identical to the October 5 House-passed Farm Security Act of \n2001'' and ``Senate passage of the Hutchinson provision is the only \nchance to finalize a farm bill this year.''\n  To my colleagues who think there should be agreement on that point at \nthis place in our deliberations, I commend Chairman Harkin for a \ntremendous good faith effort to move forward the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee-passed farm bill. He has given it a wholehearted effort in \nthe Senate Chamber. He has provided opportunities for amendments to be \noffered. I commend him for that, though there are still a number of \nserious amendments outstanding. We have twice voted for cloture. We \nhave not seen any change in the breakdown. It is clear that as \ndedicated and as resolved as Chairman Harkin has been, the current \nHarkin-Daschle substitute cannot garner the support of the Senate and \ncannot be conferenced in time to get a bill for our farmers this year. \nChairman Combest is absolutely right: This is our last and best hope of \ndoing it.\n  I suggest many of my colleagues have told their farmers face to face \nin their States that they will come here and do their best to get a \nbill passed this year. I suggest we will not have done our best without \nthe passage of this substitute, this amendment I have offered today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a series of \nquestions?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This is a most interesting approach, it seems to me. I \ncredit the Senator for trying to find a road to break the logjam, to \ntry to get out of the box canyon we seem to be in with regard to \nconcluding the farm bill.\n  I must say at the outset that it is my understanding, basically, that \nyour amendment is in the form of a substitute; is it not?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is a substitute.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Basically what you are trying to do is take the House \nfarm bill as passed. I just asked staff what it passed by over there. \nIt was 291 to 120. That is a rather strong bipartisan \ndeclaration. Basically, what you are doing is taking the House farm \nbill under the banner that most people have been talking about--the \nfarm groups, the commodity groups, all the farm organizations, and many \nof us on this side of the aisle and that side of the aisle have said \nfor some time two key things: One, move the bill, make sure we move it, \nmake sure we expedite it.\n\n  I would like to respond to the distinguished leader on the other side \nof the aisle. Senator Daschle indicated we have spent probably more \ntime on this bill than at any time in the history of farm bills. The \nshortest amount of time we have ever spent in the Senate--and I can \nrefer to the House as well--is 5 days and the longest is 31. All this \ntime hasn't been spent on the farm bill. I am not advocating more time; \ndon't misunderstand me. Chairman Harkin has worked very diligently to \nmove this process along. I credit him for that. But if, in fact, we are \ngoing to get this done--and that was the key premise of the many farm \ngroups and commodity organizations and many of us who said we need to \nexpedite this in an odd-numbered year, don't put it off until a \npolitical year. And the other premise was, if I understand the Senator \nand from most of the rhetoric in this regard, to save the investment, \nthe money, the $73 billion. The administration has indicated basically \nthat they don't have any quarrel with the money. Oh, I am sure they \nwould like to come down somewhat, but I don't think that is the issue. \nIt is the policy that is the issue.\n  What the Senator is trying to do is say, OK, if we want to accomplish \nthat and save the investment and expedite the progress, this is the way \nto do it, and that all this talk about stalling and putting things off \ncould be answered by his amendment. Is that how he sees it?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Well, the Senator has articulated it very well. If we \nare serious about getting a farm bill done this year--and people have \nsaid they want a bill this year--this is it; this is the last \nalternative. If we want a bill that is conferenceable, that can go to \nthe President, this is it.\n  I think those who have said, ``let's expedite the farm bill, get a \nbill passed\n\n[[Page S13652]]\n\nthis year,'' this is the litmus test. We are going to find out whether \nthis is rhetoric or whether it is politics as usual, whether we want \njust an issue or a farm bill this year.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield further, I am not particularly \nenamored with the House bill. If you want to go a little bit further, I \nam really not enamored with the Senate bill. But we have been through \nthat. We have had the Roberts-Cochran debate and that was fair. I \ncredit the chairman and everybody else for giving us the time. I think \nwe are headed down the wrong track with the Senate bill. I am not \nparticularly enamored with the House bill.\n  Let me ask the Senator a couple of questions, if I might, to see if \nit is more preferable in my mind to the Senate bill because that is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  Now, the Senate bill frontloads the $73 billion to the tune of about \n$45 billion in the first 5 years. Then there is $28 billion on down the \nroad. So I think we are taking away from the future baseline--that is a \nfancy word for money--for future farmers. It is my understanding that \nthe House bill doesn't do that; is that correct?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is absolutely correct. That is one of the \nstrong reasons why this approach is preferable. I call it the 5 fat \nyears and the 5 lean years, the 5 years of plenty and the 5 years of \nfamine. That is the danger in frontloading.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I may ask another question, I know one of the \nsticking points we have here with many western Members is the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada regarding water. If there is one thing that \ncauses a lot of concern out West, where we don't have much of it, it is \nthe situation where people worry about the federalization of State \nwater rights.\n  I am not going to get into that argument one way or the other, but I \nknow that Senator Crapo and others have a lot of concern. Some of the \nfarm organizations have some concern also. That is in the Senate bill. \nTo my knowledge, that is not in the House bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Let me ask another question, if I might, if the Senator \nwill continue to yield. One of the reasons that in the Senate bill they \nwere able to move the loan rate up to $3--and I am not going to rehash \nthe old discussion on loan rates, as to whether they are market-\nclearing, or income protection, or it should be $4, or $5, or $3, or \nwhatever. But we get into a lot of problems in terms of market \ndistortion and not really enough support, and the money they use to \nincrease the loan rates comes from crop insurance reform additions on \ndown the road as we get into future years of the farm bill. To my \nknowledge, the House bill did not--I am using strong words--rob, steal \ndid not take away or find the offset from the crop insurance reforms \nthat we did just last year. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. In addition, I hesitate to bring this up, but we got \ninto a discussion of what is amber and what isn't in the progression of \nthe World Trade Organization talks. I quoted a statement from an outfit \nout of Missouri that tries to take a look at their crystal ball to \nevaluate the effects of farm bills. I think they said we had a 30-\npercent chance under the Senate bill that we would be in violation of \nthe WTO cap, and that that would be an amber light; that in 2 years it \nwas bound to happen. I don't know what the chances are in terms of the \nHouse farm bill, but it seems to me they could be less. I am not an \nacademic, in terms of fabric, to determine that. I don't have that \ncrystal ball. Would the Senator say that would be the case?\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to the Senator from Kansas that it is my \nunderstanding that because some of the decoupled payments in the \nHarkin-Daschle substitute are phased out, the likelihood in the course \nof the farm bill of it becoming out of compliance is greater than that \nof the House-passed bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Then the key question is this, if the Senator will \ncontinue to yield. As he knows, in agriculture, we are going through \nsome tough times. We are not in very good shape for the shape we are \nin. One of the real things I believe we have to do is get Presidential \ntrade authority and get our exports tracking. I am not going to go into \na long-winded speech on that, but no farm bill, whether it is the bill \nbeing proposed by the Senator from Arkansas, or Cochran-Roberts, or the \nSenate bill, the Daschle-Harkin bill, can be successful unless we sell \nthe product.\n  We have not been involved in the 133 trade negotiations--except for \ntwo--ever since we lost the Presidential trade authority. We exported \n$61 billion of farm products about 3, 4 years ago. Now we are down to \n50, maybe 51, 52. Subtract that difference in terms of what we are \nselling and whether that is what you add up to with emergency spending. \nI don't understand why we don't expedite consideration of the \nPresidential trade authority. That is on the back burner with the \nleadership. That should not be the case. In lieu of that, we are going \nto have to have protection for farmers. In your State there are rice, \ncotton, and soybean producers, and in my State of Kansas there are \ncorn, soybean, wheat, and cotton producers--40,000 acres.\n  So the question is this: In terms of the support that would be going \nto farmers, under the Senate bill that targets price, that \ncountercyclical payment doesn't come into effect until 2004. A lot of \nfarmers don't understand that, I don't think, or they would not be \nendorsing this bill. Under the House bill, however, that target price \ncomes in right away. I might not agree with target prices--I don't like \nthat system--but at least there is a countercyclical payment \nimmediately in regard to the bill. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have one other question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am asking the Senator from Arkansas would he yield.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me finish the colloquy with Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. WARNER. At an appropriate time, I would like the Senator to yield \nfor a minute, also. I will follow the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nArkansas should be advised that he has 19 minutes left under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will be very quick in terms of this question. The \nSenator heard me state many times, having been involved in six farm \nbills, that Kiki de la Garza, chairman emeritus of the House \nAgriculture Committee, from Texas, who served longer than any other man \nas chairman, used to talk about the best possible bill and the best \nbill possible. This could be the best bill possible if you believe you \nwant to move this process along, and conference it with the House, and \nget a bill and save the investment of $73 billion. That has been the \nmantra over and over and over again.\n  This is probably the best bill possible. Again, I don't particularly \ncare for it. It seems to me that it would fit the description. Where \nare the bravehearts of the farm organizations and the commodity groups? \nAre they still on the sidelines? What are they doing in this regard? \nThat is all I have heard for the past 2 weeks. Are the bravehearts \ngetting off the sidelines or at least indicating some interest?\n  I talked with the House this morning. They indicated that might be \nthe case, and I am talking about staff in terms of Mr. Combest and Mr. \nRoss. Are the bravehearts getting off the sidelines or what?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would expect that. But this was, as the Senator \nknows, filed last night and laid down this morning, so there has been \nlittle time for the farm groups to weigh in one way or the other.\n  But I think the strongest point in the question posed--while there is \na lot of debate about policy, we have spent the last 2 weeks at various \ntimes debating the policy of these various bills. The strongest point \nthat you made is the one that I have tried to base this entire \namendment upon, and that is, it is the only chance we have of getting \nimproved farm policy, a bill actually signed into law this year.\n  That has been the hue and cry. That has been the demand of farm \norganizations and farmers across this country,\n\n[[Page S13653]]\n\nthat we finish a bill this year. This is the only way we can do it.\n  Chairman Combest has said that. I think it is patently clear that, \neven were the Harkin-Daschle substitute to be agreed to at this point, \nthe differences between the House bill and the Harkin-Daschle \nsubstitute are so great that, in fact, it would take at least 3 weeks, \nas Senator Harkin said last night, for that conference to be completed. \nWe would not have a bill in time to help our farmers or to meet that \ndemand for it to be finished this year.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator for yielding. I have taken up too \nmuch time. There are very crucial questions, it seems to me, about what \nis in the Senate bill and House bill and how fast we can move.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have been told my time has been reduced. We started \nthis debate late and the vote is still scheduled for 12:50, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will yield if the time will come from that side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time were the proponents offered \non this unanimous consent request, and how much time are we offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the vote is called \nfor 12:50. After the reduction of the time, the Senator from Arkansas \nhad 45 minutes and the Senator from Iowa had 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is 45 minutes and 10 minutes. I am asking the Senator \nif he will yield for a brief question.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Not on my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask if the Senator will yield and I will use a \nmoment of time from the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a quick question?\n  I thank the Senator for his work on peanuts. This is an industry \nwhich is threatened. In my State, we are talking about small farmers, \nnot the billions going to the grain belt. I don't criticize that, but \nit is the small farmer out there.\n  We are dealing with people who are farming 40 acres, maybe 100 or so \nacres, sometimes 200. If I am correct, you are raising the target price \nto $5.50?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank you for that. Then 10 cents a pound quota buyout \nfor 5 years, that is there. And allowing the producer to assign their \nbase the first year and then reassign it the second year, that is very \nimportant. I thank the Senator and for that reason I give my strongest \nsupport for his legislation.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia, and \nI am grateful for that commitment of support.\n  I inquire of the Senator, my colleague from North Dakota, how much \ntime does he request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator to yield. I will use 2 minutes of \ntime that is allocated to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, parliamentary inquiry: We are using the time of the \nSenator from Iowa but he doesn't yield the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I so appreciate the generosity here. Let me ask the \nSenator from Arkansas a question.\n  He says this is the last opportunity for a farm bill, this amendment \nhe is offering. Is it not the case we will have a cloture vote \nfollowing that and the last opportunity for a farm bill will be for us \nto break the filibuster that has occurred now day after day after day \non the underlying amendment? Is that not the last opportunity for the \nSenate to move a farm bill?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. As I said, I have voted for cloture and I will again \nvote for cloture. But even if cloture were invoked and the Harkin-\nDaschle substitute were adopted, it is not possible to conference it \nand get a farm bill to the President this year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is a judgment I don't share. The Senator has, in \nfact, voted for cloture. Almost all of his colleagues on that side of \nthe aisle have not. We have decided today to allow the Senator from \nArkansas to offer his amendment, which is essentially a farm bill. We \nsay, yes, you offer yours; let's have a vote on that.\n  Why are the majority of the Members on your side not willing to do \nthe same for our farm bill?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I am sorry. I am not sure----\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have had a filibuster day after day after day. We have \nhad two unsuccessful votes to try to break it. Almost everyone on your \nside of the aisle has voted to continue the filibuster. You are now \noffering your amendment. We say go ahead and get a vote on your \nsubstitute farm amendment; go ahead. We will agree to a vote on yours. \nWhy do most of the members of the Republican caucus not agree to the \nsame thing with respect to the Harkin bill, or the Daschle bill that is \nthe underlying bill on the floor of the Senate?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I can't judge their motives and I do not seek to. I \nhave urged them to vote for cloture. I think it is very important we \nhave a farm bill this year. But time is running out and I urge they \nsupport cloture.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say the discourse between----\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The regular order is 2 minutes on our time. How much of \nthat is consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for the \nopportunity to visit.\n  I inquire as to exactly how much time we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 42 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I note many of the questions that \narise in a farm bill debate--some of those posed by both Senator Warner \nand Senator Roberts--deal with the commodity title. Obviously, those \nare great concerns because all of us have our own constituencies.\n  The Harkin substitute that we are seeking to amend includes many \nelements that farmers of Arkansas would support. It includes a yield \nupdate as well as a base acre update; it includes a 100-percent base \nacreage coverage versus the 85-percent base coverage included in the \nHouse bill and my amendment.\n  These are, frankly, changes that would benefit many farmers in \nArkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. That is one of the \nreasons that I have supported the chairman's mark.\n  However, this is what we must remember. If these changes mean we will \nnot be able to get a farm bill this year, it is time for us to seek a \ndifferent approach. While some of the funding levels for the various \ncommodities may not be as high as we have in this substitute, the \naverage gross receipts are rather attractive to many farmers in my \nState and other States as well.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to maybe take issue with the comments that were \nmade that Republicans have been conducting a filibuster on this bill. \nWill the Senator correct me, but haven't we had germane amendments \nevery day we have been on this farm bill?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Then on the issue of cloture, some people are assuming \nif you vote no on cloture you are filibustering the bill. I disagree.\n  Isn't it correct, if cloture were invoked, the amendment you are now \noffering would be nongermane?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Isn't it correct we have asked the Parliamentarian to \ngive us a ruling on Senator Grassley's amendment? Senator Dorgan was a \ncosponsor. I hope he still is. I am afraid that would be nongermane.\n  Isn't it correct that a lot of people who have very legitimate \ninterests in\n\n[[Page S13654]]\n\nagricultural policy want to offer amendments that, if cloture is \ninvoked, they are denied that opportunity to do so?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The Senator is, of course, correct. I respect that. \nThe fact is, the farm bill came very late in this session because we \nhave been very involved with a lot of important legislation dealing \nwith 9-11.\n  My support for cloture, and the reason I urge my colleague to support \nit, is because we are running out of time. While there are legitimate \namendments and there are important amendments, I think we had too much \nfinger pointing, too much of Democrats saying Republicans are \nfilibustering. Frankly, some of us question the motives on the other \nside. We are running out of time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, that is the reason why I came \nto the floor. I heard this ``filibuster'' and I thought, wait a minute, \nthis is a very complicated bill. We have been on it for a couple of \ndays. But every single amendment--I believe we have had just as many \namendments offered by Democrats as Republicans or very close and they \nhave all been germane.\n  I know there are several other amendments that are very germane but \nmight fall postcloture. I just wanted to understand from my colleague \nand maybe make an assertion that there is not a filibuster. There is a \ndesire to improve a bill that some of us believe is fatally flawed.\n  I will also ask my colleague, the bill we have pending, the so-called \nHarkin-Daschle bill that was reported out of the partisan Agriculture \nCommittee, isn't that unusual? The facts are that the markup of \nagricultural policy for decades has been bipartisan. Unfortunately, it \nwas not in this case in the markup of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I say to my colleague from Oklahoma that my history \non the Agriculture Committee is pretty thin. This is my first time on \nan agriculture bill markup, so I can't really answer this question. But \nI will say this. While the bill that came out of committee has been \ndescribed as being a bipartisan bill, I was the only Republican to \nsupport that bill. So that cannot be considered nearly as bipartisan as \nthe amendment I am now offering which originally, when offered as a \nfreestanding bill in the Senate, had four Democrats sponsoring it and \nthree Republicans.\n  So I would suggest if we are going to talk about a bipartisan \napproach, this is far more bipartisan than the bill that came out of \ncommittee, unfortunately.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I inquire of my colleague from Arkansas as to how \nmuch time she would request.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield Senator Lincoln 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today is December 19. Twenty days ago, on November 30, \nour leaders made a motion to move to debate on the farm bill. That was \njust after Thanksgiving. Many farmers in Arkansas probably thought, \nfinally, the Senate is going to start voting on the merits of the farm \nbill. Members on the other side of the aisle objected; they were not \nready to move to the farm bill. They said we did not need a farm bill \nthis year and we did not have to deal with that issue right now; we \ncould put it off for another year, just as we have been putting farmers \noff for the last 4 or 5 years. They forced us to have a procedural \nvote.\n  The White House continued issuing statements against considering a \nfarm bill this year, and our farmers waited. Our farmers all across \nthis Nation waited.\n  On December 5, 5 days later, we had a vote that is hard to explain to \nfolks outside the beltway. We voted on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to the farm bill. It passed 73 to 26. In other \nwords, 73 Senators thought we should begin debating the farm bill. But \nrather than allowing the Democratic leadership to move forward with the \nbill, Republicans forced us to wait several days and then vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the farm bill. \nNow, with that vote behind us, many farmers in Arkansas probably \nthought, finally, finally, the Senate is going to start voting on the \nmerits of a farm bill now.\n  Then, on December 5, December 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12, we discussed the \nfarm bill. Hanukkah came and went.\n  As my colleague from Oklahoma mentioned, this is a difficult bill. \nFarm bills always are. That is why we spent the last year and a half \ndiscussing the issues of this bill.\n  In years past, we have tested the issues of a 5-year farm bill. And \nin the last farm bill we found that the policy we enacted in 1996 was \ncompletely inadequate. We have been discussing that for a year and a \nhalf. We have been talking about it in committee. We have been talking \nabout it among ourselves and with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe Capitol.\n  The Senate is supposed to be the deliberative body, and we have \nproven that again with the weeks of debate on a farm bill that took up \n3 days of business in the other body. For 3 days the other body \ndeliberated this issue, and we have spent how much time here over the \ncourse of the last 3 weeks?\n\n  On December 12, the distinguished former chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, offered his alternative \nto the commodity title of this bill. We debated its merits, and then it \nfailed by a vote of 70 to 30.\n  Many farmers in Arkansas probably thought, finally, the Senate is \ngoing to finish up the farm bill. The leading Republican on the \nAgriculture Committee had offered up his best, and the Senate had voted \nno. Now maybe we could pass the farm bill. And then we continued to \ndeliberate. We deliberated on December 13, 14, on December 17 and 18.\n  Christmas grows near. Yesterday we had another procedural vote in an \nattempt to move the farm bill. The Senate voted on cloture. But we fell \n6 votes short of the 60 needed to move forward. Most Republicans voted \nno. They wanted more time to deliberate.\n  It is beyond me who it may be out there in our farmland of America, \nfrom whom they are hearing, who thinks we are not in an urgent \nsituation of providing good agricultural policy. And I do not know, but \nmaybe the Senator from Arkansas and I are the only ones who hear from \nfarmers who are extremely anxious about whether or not they are going \nto get their financing to put seed in the ground next year or whether \nor not they are going to be able to continue a family farm that has \nbeen in their family for generations, whether they are going to have to \ncontinue to farm out the equity of that farm in order to be able to \ncontinue farming.\n  Then the distinguished former chairman of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee and the former chairman of the House \nAgriculture Committee offered their alternative. Before yesterday, \nthere had not been any written copy of the Cochran-Roberts bill. We \ncould not review the bill on its merits. So it became known on this \nside of the aisle as ``what will it take to get your vote?''\n\n  A version of that bill had failed during committee consideration. But \nyesterday, it got its day in the Sun. And it was fully debated on the \nSenate floor. And it failed by a vote of 55 to 40.\n  With that vote behind us, many farmers in Arkansas probably thought, \nFinally, the Senate is going to pass the farm bill.\n  And that brings us to this day on the brink of another vote to bring \nthe Agriculture Committee's farm bill to an up-or-down vote in the \nSenate.\n  Now my good friend from Arkansas is prepared to offer a bill that he \nand I introduced prior to the Senate Agriculture Committee considering \nthe farm bill.\n  We introduced that bill when we were concerned that the Senate \nAgriculture Committee wouldn't pass a farm bill.\n  But the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nHarkin, worked closely with us to craft a bill that fits the needs of \nall producers.\n  I am proud of the bill that came out of committee. And I want to \ncommend Chairman Harkin for his hard work.\n  I am prepared to vote in favor of final passage of the Harkin farm \nbill right now. It is a good bill. A strong bill that has weathered 20 \ndays of debate.\n  But my friend from Arkansas wants a vote on the bill we introduced \nearlier this fall.\n  I will vote in favor of the Hutchinson amendment because it reflects \na bill that I wrote.\n\n[[Page S13655]]\n\n  But I warn my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Regardless \nof the outcome of this vote, if you vote against cloture at 1:15, you \nwill reveal your true intentions regarding U.S. farm policy for all \nAmerica to judge.\n  There will be no denying that you have no interest in moving a farm \nbill this year.\n  It will be obvious to every farmer who is watching this debate.\n  America's farmers will know, without qualification, that you \npreferred to turn your back on them. You will have abandoned them in \nthis time when they are desperate for a farm policy based on the \nrealities of American farming in the 21th century.\n  That is a fine ``Merry Christmas'' wish for rural America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. May I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the other Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask the Chair how much time is remaining on my \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Judging from the fact this is not a wholehearted \nendorsement of my amendment, perhaps the----\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I was just describing the debate so far.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Perhaps the request can be granted from the other \nside.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. May I inquire of the Chair, do I still control the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was inquiring who yields time, and \nthe Senator from Iowa made an inquiry and was recognized. The Senator \nfrom Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I simply was going to reserve the remainder of my \ntime for closing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is reserved.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has 4 minutes. The Senator from Iowa has \n7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself 5 minutes, and I would \nappreciate the Chair announcing when my 5 minutes is up.\n  Mr. President, first of all, this is not the House bill. This is not \neven the bill that my friend from Arkansas introduced last night. In \norder to comply with the budget, they made changes, and what were the \nchanges made? It is very interesting. Let's just take a look at two \nareas.\n  The Hutchinson amendment really does gut conservation. In the Senate \nbill we put $21.5 billion. The House has $15.8 billion. The Hutchinson \namendment lowers that to an even $14 billion. But here is where most of \nthe money came from. I say to my friend from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln \nand others, we are interested in the small towns and communities. We \nwant rural development.\n  In the Senate bill we had $1.7 billion--listen to this--over 5 years \nfor rural development. The House bill has $1.17 billion over 5 years \nfor rural development. So we are pretty close. The Hutchinson amendment \nhas--listen carefully--$200 million over 10 years for rural \ndevelopment. Gutted.\n  So if you want to have a balanced farm bill and one that helps our \nsmall towns and communities, forget about that amendment. He guts rural \ndevelopment and puts it all into commodities. But even putting it into \ncommodities, they backload it in 10 years.\n  What we have done is said there is a crisis out there right now and \nwe need to help farmers right now. For the life of me, I do not \nunderstand, Mr. President, why the Senator from Arkansas would want to \nhurt his own rice producers.\n  Next year, under the committee bill, the payment per acre for rice is \n$148.13 under our bill. Under the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas, the payment will be $96.18 per acre for his own rice farmers. \nWhy he would want to offer an amendment to penalize his own rice \nfarmers, I have no idea, because they go back to the old bases and \nyields. We update the yields. Look at next year. Our payment next year \nis $148 per acre on rice; the Hutchinson amendment is $96 per acre on \nrice.\n  With corn, we pay $36.67 per acre; the Hutchinson, $26 per acre. \nWheat is $18.90 under our bill, $15.54 under Mr. Hutchinson's \namendment.\n  This amendment is not well thought out. It is not even the House \nbill. It is not the House bill at all.\n  One more time for the record, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, nine \ntitles were approved in our committee unanimously--unanimously. \nBipartisan, not one dissenting vote. Senator Lugar and I worked it out. \nWe worked it out with Senator Hutchinson and all the Republicans and \nDemocrats on the committee. The only title that did not come out \nunanimously was the commodity title. Even the Senator from Arkansas \nvoted for that, so at least it has some bipartisan support.\n  When the Senator says this is some kind of hugely partisan bill, that \nis nonsense on its face. All you have to do is please check the record. \nThis bill had strong bipartisan support in the committee.\n  Again I respond to my friend from Kansas who said we robbed the crop \ninsurance program to increase loan rates. Let the record show, all we \ndid was include a provision that extends the very same provision that \nSenator Roberts put in his crop insurance bill last year. It was OK \nwhen he put it in last year. All we are doing is extending it. Now \nsomehow he says it is not OK. We did not gut the crop insurance. If it \nwas good enough for Senator Roberts last year, it is good enough for us \nto put it in now and extend it into the future. That is all we did. We \ndid not in any way touch or gut the crop insurance program.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is my hope to close for the amendment. Is it the \nintent of the opponents of the amendment to use the remainder of their \ntime?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes for the Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like 1 minute if I may.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 1 minute to my friend from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa yields 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have said many times that the House-passed farm bill \nrepresents a good starting point. But it is a starting point that can \nbe improved. For example, the House bill falls well short of the bill \nout of the Agriculture Committee in its treatment of commodities such \nas sugar, soybeans, sunflowers, canola, barley, and the pulse crops of \ndry beans, lentils, and chickpeas. In dairy, the Senate bill is \nsubstantially better than the House bill.\n  The House bill skimps on commodity support in its first year, \nproviding less than half the support provided by the Senate bill in its \nfirst year. If the House bill prevails, we may very well find ourselves \nback here late next year considering supplemental support for \nagriculture again. I believe our goal should be to improve the House \nbill. We cannot do it if we simply accept it today.\n  The chairman has made clear what is before the Senate is not even the \nHouse bill.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have 4 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer and my \ncolleague.\n  It seems to me we have a paradox of enormous irony. The majority has, \nfor weeks, talked about and urged passage of a farm bill to protect the \ninvestment in agriculture, the $73 billion provided\n\n[[Page S13656]]\n\nfor in the budget, and to expedite consideration with the House of \nRepresentatives, and we could pass the bill this year.\n  Today, let the record show, whether it might be minor differences \nbetween the bill offered by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas and \nthe House bill, the majority is now going to vote against the House \nposition before they go to conference. I think that is a paradox. I \nthink that is unique. I think that is unprecedented.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Let me say very quickly in wrapping up, I appreciate \nworking with the chairman, and I think he made a good faith effort.\n  As far as the conservation is concerned, I will respond by saying I \noffered increases: The average annual funding level from $200 million \nto $1.3 billion a year for the EQIP program. Livestock and crop \nproducers each receive 50 percent of the funding. On the issue of the \nrice, the average gross receipts over the 5 years is $11.90 per \nhundredweight under the House bill and the amendment I offered.\n  Yes, yours is higher, but they are not being penalized. It is a bill \nand a position that the Rice Federation and rice producers endorsed \nbecause they knew it was good for rice when the bill was introduced.\n  However, we could argue day and night about this funding and which \nbill is better for the various crops. The reality is, if Members want a \nfarm bill this year, if Members want a bill this year, this is it. You \ncan bump it up another few billion and maybe everybody in the world \nwill be happy, but if you cannot pass the bill, it doesn't help the \nfarmers.\n  The latest figures show that the Harkin substitute would cost $45.2 \nbillion over baseline in the first 5 years, leaving only $28.3 billion \nfor the second 5 years. Basically, if we do this, we will eliminate the \nfunding available in the years 2007 - 2011. That is why I say these \nwill be the years of plenty and those will be the years of famine.\n  This amendment is balanced, and it is reasonable, and it has broad \nsupport in the Agriculture Committee and the agricultural community. It \nis bipartisan. It was introduced as a bipartisan bill.\n  The basic, underlying, fundamental point is this: It is the only bill \nthat is conferenceable with the House. It is the only bill that has any \nchance at all of being signed into law this year. If you have told your \nfarmers that you are going to do everything within your power to get a \nfarm bill passed this year, then you need to vote for this amendment.\n  This will be the highest of ironies, I say to my friend from Kansas, \nthat those who have said they don't want to delay a farm bill are going \nto vote against the one vehicle by which they can get a farm bill this \nyear; that those who have said there are obstructionists trying to get \na farm bill passed will be in a position of voting against the one that \ncould be signed into law by the end of this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This does not wash--to stall for 2 months, to filibuster \nfor 2 weeks, then walk around here pretending you are out of breath \nfrom running so far. Every step of the way, we had people on that side \nof the aisle trying to prevent us from writing a farm bill, and now \nthey are coming to the floor saying: We are trying to move it along.\n  This is a sure way to try to move it along--filibustering through two \ncloture votes. We will see at 1:15 if they give us help to move it \nalong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 47 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The time for games is over. The fact is, the White House \nitself has said we should not have a farm bill this year. The ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, has said that. The \nSecretary of Agriculture has said that. The entire Republican hierarchy \ndowntown and here have said time and time again we should not have a \nfarm bill this year. Since this amendment is different from that of the \nHouse, it would still require a conference.\n  Again I say, Mr. President, now is the time to pass a good bill. If \nwe get cloture today and we can close this bill down, we can conference \nour bill in the next 2 days and we can go into conference with a good \nbill, not with an amendment that is less than what the House has.\n  I urge defeat of the Hutchinson amendment.\n  I move to table the Hutchinson amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The hour of 12:50 having arrived, under the previous order, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to table. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 376 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Akaka\n     Helms\n     Murkowski\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the order \nof business now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture vote is the next order of \nbusiness.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand there is no time remaining. I \nask unanimous consent that I be given 1 minute and that the other side \nbe given 1 minute prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we will now go to a cloture vote. It will \nbe the third cloture vote. The majority leader has said that will be \nit, because this is Wednesday. To finish the 30 hours after cloture, if \nwe got cloture, would require the rest of the week. We all want to get \nout of here by Friday or Saturday--I hope. So this really would be the \nlast opportunity to have closure on the farm bill.\n  We have had good votes. We voted on the Lugar substitute. We voted on \nCochran-Roberts. We voted on Hutchinson. There may be other amendments. \nThey should be germane. Somebody said about cloture, it cuts off \namendments. It does not cut off any germane amendments to this \nagriculture bill.\n  So let's have the cloture vote. We get our 30 hours. At least then we \ncan finish the bill. Then the staff can work on\n\n[[Page S13657]]\n\nit in January, and when we come back on January 23, we can meet in a \nshort conference and get the bill to the President before the end of \nthe month.\n  If cloture is defeated, I can assure you, all of my fellow Senators, \nthe President will not get this bill until sometime in March or April, \nif even then. So this is the last train out of the station. I hope we \ncan get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we worked with the distinguished chairman \ncarefully. There are a large number of issues that must be discussed \nbefore this bill is perfected.\n  In good faith, I ask the Senate to give us opportunities to perfect \nthis bill. It must be perfected, in my judgment, if the President is to \nsign it, if we are to have a successful conference, and in fact if we \nare to have successful agricultural policy.\n  In fairness, there are a number of amendments that must be heard \nthat, in due course, will have to be heard somewhere in the land. This \nis the proper forum and the proper time. I ask my colleagues to vote \nagainst cloture to keep the process alive because I am confident we \nwill improve the bill if we have that opportunity.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n           changes to h. con. res. 83 pursuant to section 213\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 213 of H. Con. Res. 83, the FY \n2002 Budget Resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to make adjustments to the allocation of budget authority and \noutlays to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, provided certain \nconditions are met.\n  Pursuant to section 213, I hereby submit the following revisions to \nH. Con. Res. 83.\n  The revisions follow:\nCurrent Allocation to the Senate Committee:\n                                                           ($ millions)\n  FY 2002 Budget Authority.......................................21,175\n  FY 2002 Outlays................................................17,856\n  FY 2002-06 Budget Authority....................................69,640\n  FY 2002-06 Outlays.............................................52,349\n  FY 2002-11 Budget Authority...................................114,692\n  FY 2002-11 Outlays.............................................80,210\n  Adjustments:......................................................\nFY 2002 Budget Authority............................................  0\nFY 2002 Outlays.....................................................  0\nFY 2002-06 Budget Authority......................................37,751\nFY 2002-06 Outlays...............................................34,465\nFY 2002-11 Budget Authority......................................66,150\nFY 2002-11 Outlays...............................................66,150\n  Revised Allocation to the Senate Agriculture Committee:...........\nFY 2002 Budget Authority.........................................21,175\nFY 2002 Outlays..................................................17,856\nFY 2002-06 Budget Authority.....................................107,391\nFY 2002-06 Outlays...............................................86,814\nFY 2002-11 Budget Authority.....................................180,842\nFY 2002-11 Outlays..............................................146,360\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been on this bill for almost a \nrecord length of time now. I am told that tomorrow we will break the \nrecord for the length of time a farm bill has been debated. If we get \ncloture, of course, we will still entertain 30 hours of debate for \ngermane amendments. As I have done on several occasions, we will also \nentertain unanimous consent requests to consider amendments that are \nnot germane.\n  But time has run out. This is the third cloture vote. We have a lot \nof other legislation that must be addressed before the end of the week. \nWe have three conference reports on appropriations that must be \ncompleted. We have other legislation of import to both sides of the \naisle that must be addressed and, hopefully, completed.\n  I announced earlier today that if we fail to get cloture on this \nvote, we will have no other choice but to go on to other issues. That \nwill terminate the debate and end any possibility that we could \ncomplete our work on the farm bill this year.\n\n  I put all my colleagues on notice, after three cloture votes we need \nto move on. It is up to both of us, Republicans and Democrats, to make \nthat decision. We can finish this bill. We can accommodate all the \nother items that need to be addressed, but we have to move on. Germane \namendments for 30 hours ought to be enough for everybody who has \ndebated this bill now for over 2 weeks. I ask my colleagues to vote for \ncloture. Let's get this work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself leader time so I may respond. \nI know Senator Daschle might want to close the debate.\n  Let me just emphasize on this issue, first of all, I don't believe \nthis is a record. I think if you go back and search the record, we have \nspent as long as 30 days on an agriculture bill. We could go back and \nforth over what the length of time was. The important thing, though, is \nto get the right thing done.\n  This legislation does not expire until next year. We are not going to \nget a conference agreement on this legislation whether we complete \naction now or next week or sometime before the end of the year. The \nconference will go well into the next year. I suspect this will be a \npretty difficult and long conference. There is no need to continue to \nhave this vote.\n  Unfortunately, this is the most partisan farm bill I recall seeing in \nmy 29 years in the Congress. Farm bills are almost always, if not \nalways, very bipartisan in the way they are brought out of committee \nand the way they are considered on the floor. Unfortunately, that has \nnot been the case here.\n  Farm legislation is very important. We should make sure, when we come \nback next year, this is the first issue pending and complete action. In \nthe meantime though, we should keep our focus on the three \nappropriations conference reports, seeing if we can get a bill through \nthat will help the families and the unemployed on the stimulus package, \nand see if we can get an agreement on the terrorism reinsurance and \nbioterrorism. Those are the issues we really can do, should do, and I \nhope we will do.\n  I urge my colleagues, do not rush to judgment. Let's not be forced to \ninvoke cloture when there are important amendments that would be cut \noff, such as the one Senator Grassley has on limitations.\n  There is no need to be panicked here. We can do this. We can do it \nright. We cannot cut off our colleagues who have good amendments. We \ncan complete action in due time and get a good farm bill well before \nthe law expires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond briefly. First of all to the Grassley \namendment, we are told now that it is germane, and certainly it would \nbe eligible for consideration. That goes to the point I made just a \nmoment ago. A lot of amendments that are still pending will certainly \nbe entitled to consideration, entitled to a vote, and that is as it \nshould be.\n  I also note the Republican leader's comment that this has been a \npartisan process. I am told by the chair of the committee that we have \nnever had as many unanimous votes in a markup as we had with \nconsideration of this farm bill. Of the titles that were passed out of \nthe committee relating to this bill, nine of them passed unanimously. \nOnly one failed unanimity. That doesn't sound partisan to me.\n  The commodity title was the only title that generated votes on both \nsides. Every other vote, in all nine titles, was passed unanimously.\n  Again, as to the assertion that we can wait, I must say I urge you \nall to refer to the Budget Committee and their projections that, by \nwaiting, we chance losing $25, $30, $40 billion in budgetary authority. \nThis in essence is a vote to cut agriculture by a substantial amount of \nmoney, if we fail cloture now, if we don't take full advantage of the \nbudget window we have available to us.\n  We can't wait. I know the administration has urged that we wait, the \nSecretary of Agriculture has urged that we wait. I must say, 32 or more \nfarm organizations have urged us to act now. Why? Because they are \nworried about the budgetary implications. Why? Because they want \nfarmers and ranchers to have the opportunity to make the transition. \nWhy? Because the Department of Agriculture normally needs 6 months to \nmake the transition. There are plenty of reasons it is important for us \nto bring this debate to a close. Let's do it. Let's move on to the \nother issues we have to confront. Then let's going home for Christmas.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader referred to the fact that a lot of \nfarm\n\n[[Page S13658]]\n\norganizations support this bill. Was the majority leader aware that the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation wrote a letter today, December 19, \nwhich reads in part:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors in a \n     special meeting on Tuesday, December 18, 2001 voted to oppose \n     senate passage of the farm bill if it contains the water \n     language that your amendment is intended to strike.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              American Farm Bureau\n\n\n                                                   Federation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Michael Crapo,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I am writing to convey the strongest \n     support possible of the American Farm Bureau Federation for \n     your amendment to strike the Reid water rights language from \n     the conservation title of S. 1731. This language poses an \n     extraordinary new threat to agriculture and the ability of \n     farmers and ranchers to remain economically viable.\n       The water provisions in the bill set a dangerous precedent \n     that would erode historic state water law. Additionally, it \n     will expand the scope of the Endangered Species Act to cover \n     a new category of species that are not in fact threatened or \n     endangered. These changes are unacceptable to agriculture and \n     will affect agricultural producers well beyond those who \n     participate in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation board of directors in a \n     special meeting on Tuesday, December 18, 2001 voted to oppose \n     Senate passage of the farm bill if it contains the water \n     language that your amendment is intended to strike.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is just one farm organization, but it happens to be \nthe largest farm organization in the country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I haven't seen the letter, but I will \ntell you, the Farm Bureau has probably been the leader of all farm \norganizations in urging the Senate not to delay. It is one thing to \nvote for or against a particular piece of legislation relating to \namendments that may or may not be offered. But it is another thing \naltogether to complete our work. The Farm Bureau, the Farmers Union, \nvirtually every farm organization known to this country has urged the \nSenate to complete its work, and to do it this week--not next week, not \nin February, not March, but now.\n  The Farm Bureau, the Farmers Union, all the other farm groups have \nsaid that. I think those positions ought to be made clear as well.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond to my friend from \nOklahoma. I spoke with Mr. Bob Stallman this morning on the phone. He \nis the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He referred to \nthis letter. He referred to the conference call they had yesterday. \nThat is true, they are opposed. He said to me--and I asked, May I \nrelate this? He said yes--they are absolutely in favor of cloture, of \nbringing this to an end. But then again he said they would be opposed \nto the bill if it had that water right in it. But he told me on the \nphone this morning they were absolutely in favor of cloture and \nbringing it to a close.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the time has come for us to move to the \nother important pieces of legislation that have to be addressed. Let us \ncomplete our work on this bill. We have been on it long enough. We have \ndebated every conceivable amendment. I think the time has come for us \nnow to complete our work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will yield. I know there is a Senator on the floor who \nneeds to catch an airplane. This will be the last time I yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My request would be that there be one last attempt to \nmake a bipartisan compromise here. We have people such as Senator \nLugar, Senator Cochran, Senator Grassley, Senator Roberts, with deep \nhistories in farm legislation, who are troubled by this bill. I believe \nwe can work it out, as we have in several other last-minute \ncircumstances. But to just shelve it with no willingness to give on the \nmajority leader's side is not healthy.\n  Will the majority leader try that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say, we will have 30 hours, 30 \nhours of debate, to try every conceivable new avenue to reach some \ncompromise. I am more than willing to sit down with our two managers, \nwith other Senators who have an interest in completing our work.\n  The real question is whether or not we want to finish the farm bill \nthis year. I hope people can say on both sides of the aisle in the \naffirmative, yes, we will finish our bill this year. We will complete \nour work as all farm organizations and as our responsibility dictate.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to \na close the debate on the Daschle for Harkin substitute amendment No. \n2471 to Calendar No. 237, S. 1731, the farm bill:\n\n         Paul Wellstone, Tim Johnson, Bill Nelson, Harry Reid, \n           Blanche L.

Leahy, Fritz Hollings \n           and Jean Carnahan.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall under the rule has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nsubstitute amendment No. 2471 to S. 1731, the farm bill, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 54, and nays are \n43. Three fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I enter the motion to reconsider the cloture vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my grave disappointment \nat the failure of the Senate to achieve cloture on S. 1731, the Senate \nfarm bill. Today, as on two other occasions in the last 13 days we have \ndebated the farm bill in the Senate, a majority of our body has voted \nfor cloture, a parliamentary tool applied to end excessive debate and \nto ensure we could finish the farm bill by the end of the year. \nUnfortunately, even though a majority of the Senate wants to pass a \nfarm bill\n\n[[Page S13659]]\n\nthis year, the Senate Republican leader has blocked an up-or-down vote \non the farm bill, forcing the Senate to revisit this issue next year. \nIt requires 60 votes to terminate a filibuster and to allow the Senate \nto proceed with its work.\n  Today, farmers and ranchers across South Dakota and the entire \ncountry are busy doing their jobs. They are maintaining their \noperations, feeding livestock, deciding what to plant for the 2002 crop \nyear, discussing prices, expenses and economic matters with their \nlenders, all in anticipation that Congress will do their jobs and \ncomplete a farm bill this year. The only problem is that Congress, \nnamely a certain number in the Senate, has failed family farmers and \nranchers by rejecting action on the farm bill this year. Despite the \nfact that every major farm and ranch organization in the country wanted \nto complete action on the farm bill this year, a certain number in the \nSenate ignored these 32 groups. In fact, Mr. Bob Stallman, the \nPresident of the American Farm Bureau Federation has been quoted as \nsaying that a vote against cloture is a slap in the face to farmers. \nUnfortunately, Farm Bureau, Farmers Union, and all the other farm \ngroups were ignored today and on two prior cloture votes. On three \nseparate occasions the U.S. Senate was given an opportunity to \ndemonstrate how important family farmers, ranchers, and rural \ncommunities are to the overall well-being of the country, because the \nSenate had cloture votes on three separate days. On three occasions the \nSenate was given a chance to say we'll write a new farm bill this year, \nwe'll go to conference with the House, and we'll send a bill to the \nPresident. On three occasions the Senate was given an opportunity to \nsend a message to farmers and ranchers all across the country that we \ncare about them, that we want a better farm bill for rural America, and \nthat it was important to us to deliver a new farm bill to them. Yet, on \nThursday, December 13, the Senate obstructed action on the farm bill by \na 53-45 vote. Then on Tuesday, December 18 and today, Wednesday \nDecember 19, the Senate rejected cloture on a 54-43 vote each day. \nRejecting cloture simply means a rejection of the farm bill this year. \nThat is very unfortunate.\n  I have repeatedly said it is crucial for Congress to complete action \non the farm bill, conference with the House, and send a bill to the \nPresident for his signature this year, if not very early next year, in \norder to ensure two very important things.\n  First, that we capitalize upon the $73.5 billion in additional \nspending authority provided by this year's budget resolution, because \ngiven the shrinking budget surplus and unprecedented demands on the \nFederal budget now, there are no assurances this money will be \navailable in 2002, when a new budget resolution will be carved out of a \nvery limited amount of resources. Second, that we mend the farm income \nsafety net now because the experience of the 1996 farm bill has \npainfully taught us that it does not provide family farmers and \nranchers a meaningful income safety net when crop prices collapse. Thus \nthe need for a new farm bill is clear.\n  Some will allege the Senate did not have time to fully debate the \nmerits of S. 1731, the Senate farm bill. However, that is clearly not \nthe case. Rather, in the last 13 days we have debated the farm bill, \napproximately 20 amendments were proposed to the underlying bill. Three \nof these amendments were comprehensive alternatives to the farm bill \npassed out of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Of these three \nsubstantial alternatives, one was a proposal by Senator Lugar to \noverhaul the farm bill's commodity title with a severe reduction in \nsupport to South Dakota's crop producers, essentially by eliminating \nthe marketing loan program. On December 12, the Senate voted against \nthe Lugar amendment on a 70-30 vote. Then, yesterday, the Senate \ndebated at great length an alternative to the farm bill offered by \nSenators Cochran and Roberts. Their alternative would have revamped \nmany titles of the farm bill, including major changes to the commodity \nand conservation titles. Yesterday, the Senate rejected the Cochran-\nRoberts alternative by a 40-55 vote. Finally, today, Senator Tim \nHutchinson offered a near identical version of the House-passed farm \nbill (HR 2646) for consideration and debate in the Senate. Today, the \nSenate soundly rejected the House proposal by a 38-59 vote. In the \nfinal analysis, a clear majority in the Senate has gone on the record \nin opposition to three major farm bill alternatives. I am confident \nthat if we were allowed a straight up-and-down vote on the Senate farm \nbill, we would pass it. However, certain Senators have resorted to \nstall out the farm bill, essentially killing it for the year.\n  Finally, I will do all I can to make sure the farm bill is the very \nfirst order of business that we take up in 2002. We may still have time \nto pass a farm bill in the Senate, conference with the House, and send \na bill to the President. In the meantime, I will continue to fight for \nSouth Dakota's priorities in the farm bill. Some of these priorities \ninclude; my provision to forbid meatpacker ownership of livestock, \nwhich will restore fair competition in the marketplace; my provision to \nprovide for country-of-origin labeling of beef, lamb, pork, fruits, \nvegetables, peanuts, and farm-raised fish; my provision to prohibit \nUSDA quality grade stamps on imported meat; an energy title that \npromotes value-added ethanol, biodiesel and wind production in South \nDakota; a conservation title increasing the Conservation Reserve \nProgram to 41 million acres; and; a commodity title containing higher \nloan rates than the House farm bill and a provision that rewards \nfarmers with an allowance for an update on a farmer's yields and \nplanted acreage for the purpose of making price support payments. None \nof these provisions are contained in the House farm bill.\n  We have more work to do. In addition to completing action on the farm \nbill, we should address common-sense payment limitations in the farm \nbill so family farmers and ranchers truly benefit from it. I look \nforward to next year and our endeavor to provide America's family \nfarmers and ranchers with a new farm bill.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nDaschle substitute to the committee-passed bill.\n  Let me begin my statement by pointing out that every farmer I talk \nwith in Nebraska wants Congress to pass a new farm bill this year. This \nlegislation is awfully important to tens of thousands of farm families \nin Nebraska and they are asking me to get it done.\n  For my State, with its 55,000 farm families where we have more cows \nthan people there may be no greater economic stimulus package than the \nfarm bill.\n  Many of my colleagues have thanked Chairman Harkin, ranking member \nLugar, and their staffs for their hard work in getting this bill \ntogether. Let me add my thanks. It was not an easy job.\n  But then, neither is farming in an environment where commodity prices \nfor crops remain at historic lows for the fourth straight year.\n  Or where livestock producers--the largest sector of agriculture in my \nstate--are facing costly new environmental regulations with frightfully \nfew federal resources to help share the burden.\n  So I rise in support of this legislation and ask my colleagues to \njoin me in its consideration.\n  This bill breathes new life into our commodity programs, provides \nnutrition programs for hungry children and adults, supports our \ninternational food donation and trade efforts, and protects millions of \nacres of environmentally sensitive land, among many other important \npriorities.\n  It makes a real commitment--both in programs and funding--to rural \ndevelopment. I have worked with many Nebraskans involved in rural \ndevelopment in their communities, and these are the provisions they \nasked for: Access to venture capital. Adequate funding for water and \nsewer projects. Greater access to broadband service. More funding for \nvalue-added product development.\n  A modest investment in these programs will have tremendous return in \nrural communities all across America. I hope my colleagues have heard \nfrom their constituents about the importance of these provisions and \nthat they are as enthusiastic as Nebraskans are.\n  This bill also includes, for the first time, a title devoted to \nagriculture-based energy. It's a terrific idea and\n\n[[Page S13660]]\n\none whose time has come. I only wish the Agriculture Committee had the \njurisdiction to go further!\n  Nevertheless, the provisions in the energy title that provide grants, \nloans and technical assistance to farmers and ranchers to develop and \nincorporate renewable energy use will be, I predict, widely \noversubscribed.\n  In five years we will be back here trying to expand these programs, \nlike we have our conservation programs, because demand has far \nsurpassed the funding available.\n  Speaking of conservation, let me briefly comment on the conservation \ntitle. The Chairman and Ranking Member of our committee deserve special \nrecognition for their vision in moving farm programs toward a more \nconservation-oriented policy.\n  Environmental and sportsmens' groups--the hook and bullet coalition, \nI heard them called recently have been working toward the expansion of \nthese programs for years, and their efforts pay off in this bill.\n  CRP, WRP, WHIP, FPP . . . the acronyms all run together, but each \nprogram has a distinct and invaluable purpose.\n  Of particular interest to Nebraskans are the significant new \nresources for the EQIP program, which will allow it to ramp up to $1.25 \nbillion a year by 2006 from just $200 million now.\n  It will provide assistance to thousands of livestock producers, in \nparticular, to comply with new regulations. Just as importantly, it \nwill assist row crop producers in protecting water supplies, soil \nquality and wildlife habitat. The House also made a significant \ncommitment to EQIP and I commend them for that.\n  A critical title of this legislation reauthorizes and expands \nnutrition programs. Included is a provision of particular importance to \nNebraska and other states with military installations.\n  The privatization of housing on military bases has had the unintended \nconsequence of jeopardizing eligibility for the free and reduced cost \nschool lunch program for qualifiying children. Because of the reporting \nrequirements in the privatization legislation, service members' housing \nallowances are now being counted as income making children who \npreviously qualified for the free and reduced cost school lunch program \nineligible.\n  So, unfortunately, as a result of a policy that I support--privatized \nhousing on our military bases--we are improving quality of life with \none hand and taking it away with the other.\n  This bill creates a stop-gap solution to this problem, until child \nnutrition programs can be reauthorized.\n  Finally, the commodity title is of course the engine driving this \ntrain. I cannot overstate how important it is to Nebraska.\n  Farmers, as we all know, are deriving an ever-increasing share of \ntheir income from farm program payments under Freedom to Farm.\n\n  The law that was supposed to rid them of the shackles of Federal farm \nprograms has instead made them more dependent on the government than \never before. It has cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars in \nemergency assistance.\n  Farmers in Nebraska have said resoundingly, ``Enough!'' and they are \nright. It is time for a new program that offers some stability and a \nreasonable chance at profitability. And it's time for a program that no \nlonger offers its benefits based on what you may have planted 20 years \nago.\n  This legislation provides a modest increase in loan rates, and I do \nmean modest. Corn goes from $1.89 to $2.08; wheat from $2.56 to $3.00.\n  Farmers in Nebraska have been calling for an increase in loan rates \nfor years, but this is hardly what they had in mind.\n  And still, there are those who call it excessive. Who say that these \nloan rates--still well below what it costs farmers to raise a crop--\nwill ``stimulate production.''\n  I ask them: where? Freedom to Farm sent farmers checks when prices \nwere at record highs and they did what any business would do--they \ninvested in greater productivity. And they were successful.\n  As we know too well, it took only two years of Freedom to Farm for \nprices to collapse. And they have not recovered. And still the \ngovernment signals, ``Plant more.'' ``Buy more land.'' ``Expand your \noperation.''\n  The current program, I say to my colleagues, stimulates production. \nSo I do not see where all this new production is going to come from.\n  What I do see is a loan rate that offers producers a fighting chance \nat making a cash flow work with their banker this spring. A safety net \nthat leaves them less dependent on the continued largesse of Congress. \nAnd I like that, and so do they.\n  The commodity title reauthorizes programs for sugarbeet growers, \nwhich is also important to my state. To the 550 families growing \nsugarbeets in western Nebraska, this bill is critical.\n  And it meets other needs of other regions and senators that make it \ntruly a national program--including peanuts and fruits and vegetables.\n  So I thank Chairman Harkin for putting this bill together and I urge \nthe Senate to invoke cloture and move to its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last week we voted on an amendment by \nSenator Johnson that would prohibit meat packers from feeding, owning, \nor controlling livestock. I voted for this amendment because of \nconcerns from my livestock producers that the packers have too much \ncontrol of the market.\n  Since that time, I have received more information on how this \nprovision would be implemented. It has come to my attention that the \nlanguage as written would prohibit forward contracting, future \ncontracts, and other pricing mechanisms.\n  This is significant information. Indeed, had I known it at the time \nof the vote, I would have voted differently.\n  For that reason, I took the only action available to me to correct \nthe situation. I filed two alternative amendments to the farm bill: one \nthat would prohibit the Johnson language from going into effect, and \nanother that would substitute a study to determine the economic impact \nof such a proposal. The proposed ban on packer ownership, as offered by \nSenator Johnson, could cause widespread economic harm in the livestock \nand packing industries, but no one has explored what the true \nimplications would be. My amendment would require the US Department of \nAgriculture to complete this study within nine months.\n  I have always been a free market conservative; however, I regularly \nhear from ranchers expressing concerns about concentration in the meat \npacking industry. In Idaho we have two packers, and the only thing \nworse than just two packers, is to have only one. I am concerned that \nthe language as passe4d could result in further consolidation within \nthe packing industry.\n  While I agree with my producers that we have a problem, we must be \nsure that our solution does not create an even bigger long-term \nproblem.\n\n\n                              meat packers\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week the Senator from South Dakota \nand I offered an amendment which would prohibit meat packers from \nowning, feeding or controlling livestock prior to slaughter. Together, \nwe had introduced legislation in the Senate to accomplish the very goal \nof our amendment. A majority of our colleagues in the Senate voted in \nfavor of our amendment. However, since that time, concerns have been \nraised by the Secretary of Agriculture and some in the livestock \nindustry that the language of the amendment, specifically the word \n``control'' would affect forward contracts or marketing agreements. I \ndo recall that the Senator from Montana inquired as to whether this \namendment affected such contracts and that the Senator from South \nDakota responded that the amendment did not affect them. However, I \nwould ask the Senator from South Dakota for further clarification on \nthat issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership on this \nissue. Additionally, I thank him for his concern for livestock \nproducers and for the opportunity to clarify any misunderstandings. The \namendment is not intended to affect forward contracts or marketing \nagreements. Such arrangements have caused or can cause problems in the \nmarket, but they are outside the scope of this amendment.\n  The intent of the word ``control'' must be read in the context of \nownership. In other words, control means substantial operational \ncontrol of livestock production, rather than the mere\n\n[[Page S13661]]\n\ncontract right to receive future delivery of livestock produced by a \nfarmer, rancher or feedlot operator. ``Control'' according to legal \ndictionaries means to direct, manage or supervise. In this case, the \ndirection, management and supervision is directed towards the \nproduction of livestock or the operations producing livestock, not the \nsimple right to receive delivery of livestock raised by someone else.\n  The word control is intended to close any loophole which may allow \nclever attorneys to circumvent congressional intent. Such loopholes \ncould include situations where a packer that owns livestock engages in \na transaction where a farmer takes nominal title to livestock or \nlivestock feeding operations, but a packer has substantial operational \ncontrol over the livestock production which is similar to ownership. \nAnother situation is where a packer could exercise such operational \ncontrol through a related entity. However, where a farmer or rancher \nholds true operational control, this amendment would not affect him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from South \nDakota does not intended the word ``control'' to include forward \ncontracts and marketing agreements. However, how are such contracts \ndifferent from operational control?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. There are two reasons that forward contracts and \nmarketing agreements are not within the definition of control. First, \nthese contracts do not allow a packer to exercise any control over \nlivestock production operation. Rather, the contracts merely provide \nthe packer with the right to receive delivery of livestock in the \nfuture and most include a certain amount of quality specifications. \nThere is no management, direction or supervision over the farm \noperation in these contracts. The farmer or rancher makes the decision \nto commit the delivery of livestock to a packer through the contract \nwithout ceding operational control. In fact, the farmer or rancher \nstill could make a management decision to delivery the livestock to \nanother packer other than the one covered in the contract, albeit \nsubject to damages for breach of contract. Even where such contracts \ninclude detailed quality specifications, control of the operation \nremains with the farmer. The quality specifications simply related to \nthe amount of premiums or discounts in the final payment by the packer \nfor the livestock delivered under the contract.\n  Second, several states prohibit packer ownership of livestock, such \nas Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska. The Iowa law, for example, prevents \npackers from owning, operating or controlling a livestock feeding \noperation in that state. But packers and producers may still enter into \nforward contracts or marketing agreements without violating that law \nbecause operational control, in the context of ownership, is the issue. \nThe term control is intended to be similarly interpreted and applies in \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I concur and understand the distinction between control \nof livestock production in the operational sense and a mere contract in \nwhich a packer has the right to receive delivery of livestock in the \nfuture. I also understand that farmer owned cooperatives, including \nfederated agricultural cooperatives, are exempt if they own a packing \nplant. But there is yet another situation in which some packers enter \ninto joint ventures with farmer-owned cooperatives that has members \nwhich would supply the jointly owned packing plant.\n  It has never been our intent to prevent cooperatives from engaging in \nrelationships with packers, and the amendment does not do that. For \nexample, in Iowa, Excel, which is owned by Cargill, is in negotiations \nwith a beef cooperative to build a packing plant to be owned by a joint \nventure. If that deal is completed, the actual packer would be the \njoint venture entity formed by Cargill/Excel and the beef cooperative. \nCo-op members who chose to participate in that endeavor can freely \ncommit all or a portion of their cattle for slaughter without violating \nthis amendment. The reason is that the packer in the exercises no \noperational control over livestock production. Rather, the package \nagain has a mere contractual right to receive delivery of cattle that \nmeet its specifically on graduate and quality. That contract may be a \nstandards forward contract or marketing agreement, or the contract may \ntake the form of a membership agreement between each farmer member and \nthe beef cooperative. In either even, this amendment does not affect \nthis joint venture arrangement.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is absolutely correct Senator Grassley, and we have \nadvocated this position all along. Thank you from clarifying that issue \nwith me. While forward contracts and marketing agreements can pose \nproblems for the marketplace, they are outside the purview of our \namendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank Senator Johnson for clarifying the scope of the \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13661-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

What was the final vote, I inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas are 54; the nays are 43.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We would have had 55. Senator Akaka was missing, of \ncourse.\n  This is a sad day and not a very bright Christmas next week for \nfarmers and ranchers and people who live in rural America. What we have \nsaid to them is: You don't count; you will come on the tail end of \neverything else. We will do this, we will do that around here, but when \nit comes to our farmers and ranchers, you are at the tail end. That is \nwhat my Republican colleagues have said. Go take a hike, they said to \nrural America. We will deal with you later. We will deal with you \nlater.\n  I come from a town of 150 people. I was born and raised there. I bet \nI am the only Senator in this Chamber who lives in the house in which \nhe was born. I wasn't born in the hospital; I was born in the house. I \nstill live in that house in a town of 150 people. I have a strong \nfeeling about people who live in small towns and communities that need \nrural development, that need sewer and water, need better \ncommunications, telecommunication centers in our country, who need job \nopportunities. Our farmers surround these small communities and this is \nwhat they need for them and their families and their livelihood.\n  We tried everything humanly possible to get this bill passed, in good \nfaith, working in a bipartisan manner. Facts are devilish little things \nbecause facts give lie to rhetoric. We hear all this rhetoric from the \nother side that this is a partisan bill. If it wasn't so partisan, we \ncould get it through.\n  But the facts are devilish things. And the facts are that every \nsingle title of this bill we worked on, I worked closely with my \nranking member, a good friend, an honorable person, someone who cares \ndeeply about agriculture. We worked on these. We worked them out in \ncommittee. Every single title got a unanimous vote, all Republicans, \nall Democrats, but one title, commodities.\n  Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas voted with us, so it was bipartisan. \nBasically, the same thing happened in 1995. We had to deal with the \ncommodity title in the Chamber. I understood that. But then we had all \nthe amendments that gutted nutrition, gutted conservation, that went \nafter rural development. And we had all decided in the committee, \nunanimously, on what we reported out.\n  The facts give lie to rhetoric. They have the rhetoric. They have \nbeen hit with the rhetoric, but the facts are on our side. This is one \nof the most bipartisan farm bills ever to come out of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. The facts are there and cannot be denied. Again, \nthey talked about reaching more of a bipartisan consensus. Again, the \nfacts are devilish little things.\n  We had three big amendments offered on the Republican side that were \nsort of in the nature of substitutes for a committee bill. One was the \namendment offered by my friend from Indiana, the ranking member, \nSenator Lugar. Then we had the amendment offered by Senators Cochran \nand Roberts. And then this morning we had the amendment offered by \nSenator Hutchinson. If you listened this morning, you heard Senator \nHutchinson and others saying this would be the only bill; if only we \nwould pass the Hutchinson bill, it could be the only bill that\n\n[[Page S13662]]\n\ncould get through conference and get to the President.\n  The facts are devilish things. The Lugar amendment got 30 votes. The \nCochran-Roberts amendment got 40 votes. The Hutchinson amendment this \nmorning got 38 votes.\n\n  What are they talking about? I assume what they mean when they want a \nbipartisan bill is they want the 30 or the 40 people to decide. That is \nnot bipartisan. We had the votes. What it showed was the majority of \nthe Senate wants the committee bill, but for some reason they will not \nvote for cloture to give the 60 votes.\n  I ask, what is partisan about somewhat higher or lower rates? What is \npartisan about that? What is partisan about fixed payments, which we \nhave in our bill? What is partisan about countercyclical payments, so \nthat if the price goes down we come in and help farmers out? What is \npartisan about a strong conservation program, that even the Secretary \nof Agriculture, in the book they published earlier, touted widely?\n  This is a balanced package. It was right down the middle. It was not \nradical. It was not partisan. When you get a bill that can get \nunanimous votes on our committee on every title except one, I say that \nis a pretty doggone good bipartisan bill. It may not be what every \nsingle person wants. Not everything in that bill is something I would \nwant. But I recognize you have to balance interests--not only between \nparties, but you have to balance them geographically and between crops.\n  That is what we did.\n  Now, let me talk about the cloture vote. Cloture is a funny sounding \nword. I assume when farmers and the people in my small towns in Iowa \nand places where I live are watching this on C-SPAN, or they pick up \nthe newspapers, or watch it on television, or hear it on the radio, \nthey wonder what cloture means. All it means is that we bring the bill, \nfinally, to an end at some point. There is some point at which we end. \nEven after the cloture vote, 30 more hours are added onto the almost 3 \nweeks we have already been on it--30 hours with germane amendments \nallowed. Obviously, nongermane amendments would not be allowed.\n  Is the other side saying they want a farm bill on which they can add \neverything that is not germane? Go out and tell that to the farmers. \nTell them they stopped this bill because they wanted to add a stimulus \npackage--some tax giveaway program or some other extraneous matters.\n  I say to the farmers and ranchers and people in my small towns, all \ncloture means is we were going to reach the point of a final vote. It \ndid not say how you vote. But there would be 30 more hours with \namendments that were all germane to the farm bill.\n  Even my friend from Iowa, my colleague, had an amendment on payment \nlimits. He was upset this morning. There was a little to-do last night \nand this morning about it. We worked it out so his amendment would be \ngermane. Yet he still voted against cloture.\n  What more can you do? What more can you possibly do? This is not a \ngood day for farmers, for agribusiness, for our bankers and lenders all \nover rural America. I have been here 27 years. Not as long as my \ncolleague from Indiana, but I have been here 27 years. I have been on \nthe Agriculture Committee 27 years--in the House and then here in the \nSenate. I have been through over a half dozen farm bills; about four of \nthose in the Senate. Some of them have been pretty tough debates. We \nhave had tough debates here. Farm bills engender tough debates. \nSometimes I kind of like it. They are good debates.\n\n  But in all of those years, I have never seen a more partisan attack \non a committee-reported bill than I have seen in the last couple of \nweeks on the floor of the Senate. The administration, time after time \nafter time, and the President's chief advisers, have said they do not \nwant a farm bill this year. They want to put it off until next year \nsometime. The Secretary of Agriculture has also repeated those words.\n  I would say with all due deference to my friend from Indiana, I \nassume he has said repeatedly we should not have a farm bill this year; \nwe should do it next year.\n  All right. That is OK, if that is their point of view. But let's vote \non it. Let's let the majority of the Senate work its will.\n  Yet we did not. So I would say, look to the administration. \nObviously, they have their troops in order here because, I have to tell \nyou, it is not in the best interests of a lot of people who voted \nagainst cloture to vote against cloture. They know it. Their farmers \nknow it. Their farm organizations know it.\n  Yet because the administration lowered the boom and said no, no farm \nbill this year, we don't get cloture. We do not bring it to a close.\n  Again, hope springs eternal. I said I would do everything humanly \npossible to try to bring this to a close this week. I believe that I \nhave met that commitment. I am not a dictator. I cannot force anyone on \nthe other side of the aisle to vote one way or the other. I can only \nuse reason, logic, and the facts, that is all--and have votes and let \nthem debate and then have the amendments.\n  We have done that. I am fearful next year when we come back, we are \ngoing to have new budget estimates. We are going to lose a lot of money \nout of this. There will be a hue and cry out of the administration that \nwe cannot afford this. We are going to put our farmers and our ranchers \nin a terrible situation next year, all because of the vote that was \nheld 15 minutes ago.\n  How do we plan? How do farmers plan? There is huge uncertainty out \nthere. So I hope as Senators who voted against cloture--have a Merry \nChristmas. I wish them all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. \nThink about those farm families out there who are going to be worrying \nabout what kind of farm program they are going to have next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the distinguished chairman for wishing us Merry \nChristmas. I reciprocate. In the same serious vein, however, we both \nreciprocate with farmers across our land and all citizens who watch \nthis debate and who are deeply interested, as we are, in this bill.\n  Let me recognize, first of all, the leadership of our chairman, \nSenator Harkin, who came into the chairmanship in June, and organized a \nstaff in a very difficult year. The farm bill cycle, one that comes \nwith this Congress, requires a great deal of organization. He has \nbrought together a skilled group of staff members who have worked well, \nthe staff members I was privileged to serve with when I was chairman of \nthe committee.\n  Nevertheless, it was a difficult time to begin the farm bill \nconsideration, the drafting, pulling together, at least, of the \nmaterials as well as the consensus that was required. I pay tribute to \nthe chairman for doing that very skillfully.\n  But as has been pointed out throughout the debates, many times \nmembers complained during the markup that they were not aware of the \ntext of the bills until a few hours before consideration. These are \ncomplex titles. Even then, we proceeded and cooperated with the \nchairman, for reasonable debate and votes.\n  The chairman is correct. In the case of the titles other than the \ncommodities title, we often came to unanimity. I think I would make \nonly the slight correction that I offered amendments in committee to do \nconsiderably more in nutrition and food stamps and feeding of the poor \nthan was the will of the committee at that time. Likewise, more on \nagricultural research. Essentially, a majority of the members of our \ncommittee were deeply concerned throughout all the other titles about \nthe amount of money that would be left for the commodities. They wanted \nto follow the money. It was all right to take a look at research and \nnutrition and the rest of it, but these were perceived as preliminaries \nto the main goal.\n  As a result, we do not all get what we want in these priorities. \nNevertheless, I had a chance to express it. We had votes, I think \nfairly narrow losses on both of those, and came back to the floor to \ntry again--unsuccessfully, as it turned out. I accept that fact. This \nmay be a year in which the majority of the committee and a majority of \nthe Senators were eager to literally appropriate more taxpayer money \nfor the traditional crops and bits and pieces of other situations to \nsatisfy Senators necessary to build a coalition.\n\n[[Page S13663]]\n\n  I also observe the driving force for all of this was a statement that \nthe Budget Committee had reserved $172 billion over a 10-year period of \ntime for agriculture. If this was not seized, the moment was not \nseized, the money was not seized, it would be gone. Therefore, even if \nthere might be inadequate consideration of titles and texts and \nprocedure, or even if, in this debate on the floor, amendments could \nnot be heard, again and again we returned to the thought that if this \ndid not occur in calendar 2001, the $172 billion might be lost.\n  The majority leader in his comments thought maybe $30 billion or $40 \nbillion might be left. Therefore, those voting against cloture were \nvoting for a cut in the Agriculture bill.\n  Admittedly, we considered a 5-year bill, the House bill with the $172 \nbillion 10-year situation, but we even came back to that in a vote \ntoday. This preoccupation with that money is an important fact. But I \ntried to reason during some of our debate in this Chamber that we are \nall aware as Senators, quite apart from the technicalities of the \nBudget Committee, that our country is at least in a mild recession. We \nare, hopefully, going to take up stimulus spending to get it out and \nmove people along--farmers included. There is not $172 billion and \nthere has not been for a long time. We have continued to operate in a \nfashion in which we spent every last dime, pushing each commodity \nsituation to the nth degree.\n  I and others argued that that is a mistake for agriculture in \nAmerica; it is not in the best interests of a large majority of \nfarmers. This bill was crafted to benefit a fairly small number of \nfarmers in America. Those of us who have talked about it have detailed \nin our own States precisely who gets the money. In Indiana, 66 percent \nof the money goes to 10 percent of the farmers. The bill we have been \nconsidering would concentrate it even more. What about the other 90 \npercent? Are they of no consequence in this debate?\n  When we talk about farm families in my State, 90 percent might say: \nIs no one looking out for us?\n  And I say: I am.\n  Let's get that straight. The bills we were taking a look at narrowly \nfocus a lot of money to a very few people.\n  They would say: We deserve it. We are the most efficient. We are the \nbiggest. We are getting bigger. We have the best research, the best \nmarketing.\n  We applaud that, but that does not justify the American taxpayers \ntransferring money to them.\n  We applaud their efficiency because they make money doing what they \nare doing.\n  I have no idea how the final product might have looked if we had \ninvoked cloture today. But we have a pretty good idea. How interesting \nit is that so many farm groups said: We are looking at two bad bills--\nthe House bill and the Senate bill. But vote for a bill anyway to get \non with the process because the $172 billion might disappear, and \nsomehow a miracle might occur in conference between two bad bills. That \nis highly unlikely.\n  What we have done today is given ourselves a second chance to let the \nAmerican people in on the secrets, the facts, and then to deliberate a \nlittle more carefully as to how in fact we should not encourage \noverproduction and overconcentration of the money. The problems will \nsurely come in the trade situation of this country when we take steps \nsuch as this that are clearly not tied to all of the opening up \nelsewhere in the world that we espouse.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. I am grateful we have a second \nchance to do much better for American farmers.\n  As I have said throughout the debate, as one who is among that group, \nI take farming seriously and personally--in my family as well as in my \nState. I think I have a pretty good idea, as a matter of fact, of what \nmay be beneficial to Indiana agriculture.\n  The bill that was before us without amendments and without \nsubstantial changes would have been harmful to my State. That is \ncounterintuitive. Indiana is one of the big winners as you look down \nthe number of farmers receiving subsidies and the amounts of money.\n  The fact is we have been running the markets off the tracks by the \nGovernment interfering and stimulating overproduction year after year. \nYou depress prices year after year. There is no way prices could get \nup, given the bill we are taking a look at. You depress it by the very \nnature of the bill and then complain that prices are at all-time lows. \nOf course, they are. If we passed this bill, prices would be low for 10 \nyears. That would guarantee a crisis.\n  I predict that unless we cure this, we will be back in July and \nAugust despite the protestations, and we will say somehow this just \ndidn't work; it wasn't the right formula; we need more money, and we \nwill vote for more money, as we have annually year after year, because \nthe politics of competition between the parties would really not permit \nanyone to opt out at such a moment.\n  I am more optimistic than my colleague from Iowa. I think we are \ngoing to progress and do the right thing, as we always attempt to do in \nthis body. I think we are going to have more constructive deliberation \noutside of the Chamber and then hopefully have a more focused debate \ninside the Chamber and come to the right conclusions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes allowed each Senator to \nspeak in morning business.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me thank both my colleagues for different reasons.\n  First of all, I thank Senator Harkin, who I think has done a yeoman \njob of reporting not a perfect bill but a good bill out of the \nAgriculture Committee and bringing together a lot of different people \nrepresenting a lot of different viewpoints with a unanimous vote on all \nof the provisions of the bill except the commodity provision.\n  I thank Senator Lugar for his typical graciousness and civility. Let \nme add that the differences I have with him are not ever personal but \nmore a matter of policy.\n  These are the facts as I see them. When Senator Lugar talked about \ntoo much AMTA payments being inverse in relationship to need, I quite \nagree with him. But I see a good part of that as being the outgrowth of \nthe failed ``freedom to fail'' bill and the AMTA payments that have \ngone out to people. I can't think of a more failed farm policy, I say \nfor all of my colleagues who supported that bill.\n  There are many who filibustered this bill and supported what was \ncalled the Freedom to Farm bill--what we call the ``freedom to fail'' \nbill.\n  Essentially what has happened, because it was such a miserable \nfailure, is we now have farmers and agriculture in a large part of \nrural Minnesota and rural America dependent on these Government \npayments. Quite frankly, these AMTA payments especially are inverse in \nrelationship to need. There is no question about it.\n  Farmers in our State--livestock producers, corn growers, wheat \ngrowers, and dairy farmers--hate being dependent on the Government \nchecks.\n  I think what is going on here is as follows: This administration's \ndefinition of a good farm bill is low loan rates and low prices for \nfamily farmers. It is that simple. As a matter of fact, in the \nsubstitute Senator Hutchinson presented today, the House bill actually \nwould enable the Secretary of Agriculture to lower the loan rates from \nwhere they are right now.\n  There is a lot of arcane language that goes with agricultural policy. \nBut basically what we are talking about is a way in which farmers have \nsome negotiating power vis-a-vis grain companies, or other exporters, \nwith the loan rates so they can get a better price. When they get the \nbetter price, they do not have to take out any loans. The Government \ndoesn't pay them any money.\n  If I had my way, if Senator Dayton had his way, and if other farmers \nhad their way, we would have had a Grassley-Dorgan amendment which \nwould have made this more targeted. We would raise the loan rate.\n  Let us be clear about this. What is at issue is that this \nadministration's definition of a good farm bill is low prices for \nfamily farmers. They want the loan rate down. For the large \nconglomerates--be they the grain traders or other exporters--low prices \nare great. They pay the independent producers low prices, they export, \nand they make a big profit. That is what this is about.\n\n[[Page S13664]]\n\n  I was the last to join the Agriculture Committee. I was so hopeful \nthat we would write a new farm bill. It is not just strategy here in \nthe Senate, or strategy here in Washington DC; it is a lot of people \nwho are being spat out of the economy--broken lives, broken dreams, \nbroken families. All family farmers say: That is what I care about.\n  Frankly, my passion isn't for all of the food industry. I am not \nworried about Tyson Foods or IDP. I am not worried about the big grain \ncompanies. They do fine. The part of agriculture or the food industry \nfor which I have the passion is the family farmers--the people who not \nonly live the land but work the land, and who are basically saying: We \nwant to have a living wage. We want to have a price whereby we can make \na little bit of profit based on our hard work so that we can support \nour families and live in the part of Minnesota and America that we \nlove--rural America and rural Minnesota.\n  I am not a farmer. But in an odd way, when we moved to Northfield, \nMN, in 1969, I started organizing with farmers. I have been organizing \nwith farmers now for almost 30 years. If there is one thing I advocate \nfor, it is for trying to make sure farmers have some leverage to get a \ndecent price.\n  We had rural economic development provisions in this bill. We had \nenergy provisions in this bill. We had good conservation measures in \nthis bill. We had food nutrition in this bill, which wasn't as strong \nas Senator Lugar would like or that I would like, but much better than \nthe House bill. A number of us had amendments ready that we thought \nwould have strengthened it.\n\n  In addition, it was not perfect, but the effective target price, loan \nrate, with some additional assistance, would have provided some real \nhelp to family farmers--not as in you are directly now dependent upon \nall Government payments, but as in you are going to have a chance to \nget a better price in the marketplace.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. My distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, has been in this body for 10 years. This is my first year in \nthis body. I know, from my own experience in Minnesota, that it is \nunusual for the Minnesota Farm Bureau and the Minnesota Farmers Union \nto be in complete agreement. In this case, I believe we were both \nhearing from those organizations and many other farm organizations in \nMinnesota that represent the farmers in our State, that they wanted \nthis bill. They wanted this bill to pass the Senate.\n  My question is, not having been in this body as long as my senior \ncolleague, in the 10 years my colleague has been in this body, is the \nSenator aware of a time when both national farm organizations--the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union--were \nstanding at a press conference, the two of them, with Senators such as \nourselves, and saying the same thing about this bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Minnesota, no. I think the \nreason for it is, if this bill had passed, it would have been an \nincrease of net farm income of $3 billion a year over the next 10 \nyears.\n  We need that in farm country. I have never seen the Farm Bureau and \nthe Farmers Union so united. I cannot believe that Senators actually \nvoted to block this bill, obstruct this bill from passing.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I also ask the Senator--again, this is my first year in \nthis body--I have just been in awe of Chairman Harkin. And I expressed \nlast week my deep respect for Senator Lugar, who was the former \nchairman and now ranking member of the committee.\n  I have never before, in this process, seen anyone lead a committee as \nhe has hold hearings for months, and have the committee markup, where \nall points of view were recognized, where we voted and passed it out.\n  Has the Senator ever seen a committee chairman give any stronger and \nbetter leadership to a committee bill than this one?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Minnesota, no. I think \nSenator Harkin made such an effort to reach out that he would infuriate \nsome of us on the committee. He really went out of his way to work with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle. The proof of that, again, is that \nevery provision in the bill--except for one--was passed with a \nunanimous vote. It was a good markup. It was substantive. I think \nSenator Lugar had a lot to do with that as well.\n  I think Senator Harkin did everything he could to make this bill a \nbipartisan bill.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I would hope all the farmers in the State of Iowa, the \nSenator's home State, and all the farmers in America would understand \nand know that Chairman Harkin has done everything for countless hours \nand hours over the last months to bring this bill to the floor, making \nit a good bipartisan bill, and one that, most importantly, speaks to \nthe critical financial circumstances in which many Minnesota and other \nAmerican farmers find themselves. I think it was extraordinary and \nheroic. I want to give the chairman that due credit.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree with my colleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, before I get into my statement, I just want \nto say one thing about all of this deliberation on the farm bill. As \nfar as family farmers are concerned, I am glad for Virginia family \nfarmers in the peanut business that this law is not going to be changed \nbefore October of 2002. Changing those laws would have been devastating \nto those family farmers. And while the Cochran-Roberts and Hutchinson \namendments were better, because of the fact this is not going into \neffect now, they can plan, with their leases for equipment, in this \nfinal year of this farm bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allen and Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1848 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13664-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13664-S13666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LTV SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is a piece in the New York Times \ntoday, the business section, ``LTV Seems on the Verge of a Shutdown,'' \nsubtitled ``Without Loan, Steel Giant Could End Its Labor Contract \nToday.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 19, 2001]\n\n                  LTV Seems on the Verge of a Shutdown\n\n                           (By Riva D. Atlas)\n\n       After more than half a century in business, the LTV \n     Corporation will soon shut its doors, barring a government-\n     supplied miracle.\n       One of the nation's biggest steel makers, LTV put its mills \n     earlier this month on what is called ``hot idle,'' which \n     would allow the company to restart them quickly if a \n     government-backed loan comes through at the last minute.\n       But if help does not arrive by today, the company will ask \n     the bankruptcy judge to end its labor contract.\n       A shutdown would leave about 70,000 retirees and recent \n     employees with no or reduced pensions and health care \n     benefits, and force the government to pick up at least some \n     of the tab for what remains. The pension costs alone would be \n     at least $2 billion.\n       LTV's predicament--with creditors on one side saying life \n     support no longer makes sense and workers on the other \n     fighting to preserve jobs and benefits--may become all too \n     familiar in the future. More companies are liquidating in \n     bankruptcy under pressure from creditors.\n       In the steel industry alone, 12 companies have shut down \n     since 1998, according to the United Steelworkers of America, \n     and 17 more are now in bankruptcy. The steelworkers union is \n     lobbying for government assistance--as are Bethlehem Steel, \n     U.S. Steel and Wheeling-Pittsburgh, which want permission to \n     consolidate in an effort to avoid LTV's fate.\n       LTV's decision to shut down, announced last month, comes a \n     year into its second bankruptcy. In its first bout with \n     Chapter 11, the company spent seven years in bankruptcy--one \n     of the longest reorganizations of any American company. Now, \n     LTV's management has concluded that its losses, $2 million a \n     day, are simply too large.\n\n[[Page S13665]]\n\n       ``The company was running out of cash,'' said James Bonsall \n     Jr., chief restructuring officer of LTV. Unless it began to \n     liquidate, it would be unable to pay off $100 million in bank \n     debt due at the end of the year, he said. Officials at J.P. \n     Morgan Chase, which provided LTV with $582 million shortly \n     after the bankruptcy filling in return for first claim on \n     LTV's assets, declined to comment.\n       If LTV closes, it will mean the end of a company with roots \n     far from the steel industry. Founded by James Ling, a high \n     school dropout from Hugo, Okla., the predecessor company, \n     known as Ling-Temco-Vought, had interests in electronics and \n     aerospace. An avid conglomerator, Mr. Ling's endless stream \n     of acquisitions landed his company in 14th place on the \n     Fortune 500 in 1967. The following year, he entered the steel \n     business with LTV's $425 million acquisition of Jones & \n     Laughlin Steel. (Mr. Ling was ousted in 1970 under pressure \n     from LTV's banks and has since emerged as an oil industry \n     entrepreneur in Texas.)\n       LTV sold off the other businesses during its first \n     bankruptcy. ``We tried to get rid of the steel business, but \n     we couldn't,'' said Mark Tomasch, a company spokesman. The \n     steel business was unattractive to buyers, he said, in part \n     because of the large health care obligations.\n       With $5 billion in revenues last year, LTV was the third-\n     largest integrated steel producer in the United States, \n     operating steel mills in Cleveland and East Chicago, Ind.\n       LTV's employees, aware that jobs are hard to come by, are \n     fighting to keep the company alive. Their situation has won \n     them the support of members of Congress from the region. \n     Analysts and investment bankers say the workers' expectations \n     are unrealistic, and ultimately side with LTV's management. \n     Demand for LTV's product is too meager to justify the company \n     staying in business, these executives said.\n       [On Tuesday, the U.S. and 38 other nations agreed to reduce \n     world output of steel by nearly 10 percent over the next \n     decade in an effort to drive up demand. C8.]\n       ``All these politicians want the steel mills to open or \n     reopen, but they never look at the other side of the \n     equation,'' said Charles Bradford, an independent steel \n     industry analyst and consultant based in New York. ``They \n     say, `Let's make steel,' '' Mr. Bradford said, citing a \n     rallying cry of the steelworkers. ``But they never think \n     about who's going to buy the stuff.''\n       LTV's business, along with that of the other large steel \n     makers, has steadily weakened in recent years, thanks in part \n     to cheap foreign imports that have been flooding the United \n     States since 1998. (Operators of so-called ``mini-mills,'' \n     which are not always small and recycle scrap steel into new \n     products, have generally remained profitable.)\n       All the integrated steel companies, including LTV, are also \n     paying benefits to a population far larger than their \n     employees. At LTV, there recently were at least 10 retirees \n     for every worker. The precise number is unclear because the \n     union counts 10,000 more retirees than the company does.\n       Waves of layoffs beginning in the 1980's and continuing in \n     the last 2 years have swelled the ranks of retirees at most \n     steel companies. A provision in many steelworkers' contracts \n     guarantees them the right to claim retirement benefits early \n     if they are dismissed or if their mills shut down, said Cary \n     Burnell, a member of the research staff at the steelworkers \n     union. As part of their push for industry consolidation, U.S. \n     Steel and Bethlehem Steel asked Congress two weeks ago to \n     assume some of their health care costs.\n       LTV's workers are laboring furiously to pull off an 11th-\n     hour rescue, but their prospects are dim. Their union is \n     hoping for a $250 million loan backed by the Emergency Steel \n     Loan Guarantee Board, an arm of the Commerce Department. \n     ``We're going to fight like hell to get this loan, and fight \n     like hell to save this company,'' said Leo Gerard, \n     international president of the steelworkers union.\n       The company's banks, National City and KeyBank, suspended \n     their efforts to secure such a loan last month, after \n     deciding that they could not adequately demonstrate that the \n     loan could be repaid.\n       Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota, was \n     hoping to attach an amendment to the economic stimulus bill \n     that would loosen such loan standards, but it is unclear when \n     the bill will come to a vote, said a member of his staff. The \n     union also delivered a letter, signed by 91 members of \n     Congress, to the Commerce Department on Friday urging \n     approval of the loan.\n       But with the union due to report its progress to the \n     bankruptcy judge today, time may be running out for LTV's \n     workers. Even if the loan is approved, the company says it \n     will not be enough to keep LTV alive. ``The company would \n     need close to $1 billion to return to business,'' said Mr. \n     Tomasch, the spokesman.\n       If the bankruptcy judge permits, LTV will soon stop paying \n     retirement and health benefits. Some of these expenses will \n     be assumed by the government. The Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation will take over LTV's retirement plan, at what it \n     estimates will be a cost of $2 billion. Retirees over 65 will \n     qualify for Medicare.\n       Many of LTV's remaining employees will be out of luck. \n     There are limits on the benefits the pension agency will \n     cover, according to Mr. Burnell of the steelworkers. It will \n     not cover, for example, a payment of $400 a month from the \n     company to many steelworkers dismissed between the ages of 50 \n     to 62, intended to tide them over until they qualify for \n     Social Security. Someone with 20 years at LTV typically \n     qualifies for a pension of $1,450 a month, including the $400 \n     monthly payment, but the pension agency would exclude recent \n     enhancements to the pension plan and probably pay about half \n     that amount, Mr. Burnell said.\n       Employees younger than 65 will also be on their own for \n     medical costs. A fund set up by LTV when it last emerged from \n     bankruptcy to pay for employees' health care probably will be \n     out of money in less than a year, said Mr. Tomasch, the LTV \n     spokesman. Among the benefits that will be lost is a medical \n     plan that covers 80 to 90 percent of the costs of \n     prescriptions ordered by mail. Last year, the company paid \n     $200 million in health care costs, he said.\n       If LTV's unions are unable to secure the loan, their best \n     hope is to find a buyer for the mills.\n       ``Plan A is to keep LTV operating and to do our work in \n     Washington, D.C.,'' said Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democratic \n     representative from the Cleveland area, where LTV has it's \n     biggest mill. ``Plan B is to prepare our community to invite \n     a new buyer for LTV, including providing incentives.''\n       Finding a buyer for the Cleveland mill will not be easy. \n     ``There is excess capacity around the world, and the \n     Cleveland mill is one of the highest-cost mills,'' said Mr. \n     Bradford, the independent analyst.\n       Even if a buyer is found, that might not help LTV's current \n     employees. The mills will be more attractive to a buyer \n     without the workers, Mr. Bradford said, because then they \n     would not be forced to assume the health care costs.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will read a paragraph:\n\n       LTV's workers are laboring fiercely to pull off an 11th-\n     hour rescue, but their prospects are dim. Their union is \n     hoping for a $250 million loan backed by the Emergency Steel \n     Loan Guarantee Board, an arm of the Commerce Department. \n     ``We're going to fight like hell to get this loan, and fight \n     like hell to save this company,'' said Leo Gerard, \n     international president of the steelworkers union.\n\n  Mr. President, I along with other Senators who try to represent \nworkers and working families and steelworkers, have written a letter to \nthis Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board in the Commerce Department \nasking them to grant this loan. On the Senate floor today, I wish to \nassociate myself with President Gerard's comments. If there is any \nvehicle--we are down to the wire here--if there is an economic stimulus \npackage or economic recovery package, I will have an amendment which \nwill give that loan board better authorizing language to make it clear \nthat, indeed, this is their mandate to guarantee just these kinds of \nloans. I don't know whether or not we are going to have that package. \nThat is being negotiated.\n  I have also made it clear that I think if there is any other bill \nthat passes through in terms of providing relief for this sector of the \neconomy or that sector, that from my point of view there also has to be \nan amendment which represents relief for those people who are flat on \ntheir back, out of work, without unemployment insurance any longer, \nwithout health care coverage or soon to be without coverage, or to help \nthese steelworkers.\n  I wanted to cite this article because I am sure President Gerard and \nthe steelworkers sometimes think they are shouting in the wind, that \nthey are not being heard. Industrial work is being spit out of the \neconomy. LTV shut down. At the taconite plant in the Iron Range of \nMinnesota, 1,400 workers are out of work.\n  I went with them the day the local president called everybody \ntogether to tell them it was over. And I got really mixed advice about \nwhether to go because people said, if you are there, like a politician, \npeople are just going to turn on you because they are so angry about \nlosing their jobs. They didn't do that. People appreciate the fact you \ngo up and you are with people, especially in these times.\n  But the fact is, not just for the sake of these workers who want \nnothing more but to work, but for financial security as well, we ought \nto pay attention to what has happened in the steel industry. We should \npay attention to what is happening to certain vital sectors of the \neconomy.\n  Again, just so President Gerard and the International Steelworkers \nUnion don't think there aren't Senators who support them, I know others \ndo as well. Senator Rockefeller has been at this a long time. This was \nSenator Byrd's original idea. This Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board \nof the Commerce Department can do this. This is\n\n[[Page S13666]]\n\ntheir mission and mandate. They can say: We guarantee this loan. So far \nthey have not done so. I wish we could rush through some additional \nlanguage to make it clear this is their mission and mandate. We may not \nbe able to do so. But they ought to go forward with this loan. If they \ndon't, the consequences are going to be very harsh.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been hearing a steady drumbeat of \ncomplaints from our Republican colleagues about the pace of judicial \nconfirmations by the Senate. For all who know the facts, there is no \nbasis for the charge that Democrats have engaged in delay tactics on \njudicial nominees. In fact, the Democratic Senate has been \nsignificantly more diligent in confirming judges under the Bush \nadministration than the Republican Senate was at any point under the \nClinton administration.\n  In the 5 months since Democrats gained control of the Senate, the \nJudiciary Committee has already held 11 hearings on judicial nominees. \nUnder Chairman Leahy's leadership, we held hearings during the August \nrecess, and also just 2 days after the terrorist attacks. In addition, \nwe held a hearing in the Capitol Building, when the Senate offices were \nclosed by the anthrax contamination.\n  As a result, 27 judges have already been confirmed in the 5 months \nsince Democrats took control of the Senate. By the time the Senate \nadjourns, we are likely to have confirmed more than 30 judges--more \nthan were confirmed during the entire first year of President Clinton's \nfirst term in office when Democrats controlled the Senate, and more \nthan double the number confirmed during the entire first year of the \nfirst Bush administration.\n  Our record is good by any measure. It becomes even better when we \ncompare it to the record of the Republican majority when they \ncontrolled the Senate during the Clinton administration.\n  We have held 11 judicial nomination hearings in just 5 months, almost \nall of which have included several judges per hearing. In 1999 and \n2000, the Republicans held an average of only seven hearings for the \nentire year.\n  In confirming 24 judges since the August recess, we have had a more \nproductive post-August-recess period than any Republican-led Senate did \nfor a comparable period in the last 6 years.\n  Some Republicans are now blaming Democrats for the current number of \nvacancies on the Federal bench. But these vacancies were largely caused \nby the tactics of the Republican majority over the last 6 years. We \nknow that our colleagues worked to impede President Clinton's executive \nbranch nominees such as Bill Lann Lee, nominated to head the civil \nrights division, and Dr. Satcher, the nominee for Surgeon General. Our \ncolleagues also blocked or attempted to block President Clinton's \njudicial nominees by delaying or refusing to hold hearings, and \nrefusing to allow the Senate to vote on some nominees. The average \nlength of time a circuit court nominee waited for a hearing under the \nRepublican Senate was about 300 days. Some nominees waited up to 4 \nyears for a hearing. In 6 years, the Republican Senate failed to \nconfirm nearly half of President Clinton's nominees to the circuit \ncourts. As a result, vacancies in the Federal courts increased by 60 \npercent.\n  No one suggests that Senate Democrats should follow the example the \nRepublicans set over the past 6 years. The Judiciary Committee should \nand will continue to move forward in confirming nominees to the Federal \ncourt in a prompt manner. But it is wrong for any of us in the Senate \nto abdicate our responsibility to thoroughly review the record of each \nnominee. Lifetime appointments are at stake. The need for careful \nreview is important not just for Supreme Court nominees but for \nnominees to the lower Federal courts as well. These courts hold immense \npower. Many important legal issues in this country are decided at the \nCourt of Appeals level, since the Supreme Court decides fewer than 100 \ncases per year.\n  I voted to confirm most of the judges nominated by President Reagan \nand the first President Bush. The Senate's constitutional duty of \n``advice and consent'' does not mean that the Senate should be a rubber \nstamp. It certainly does not require the approval of Federal judges who \nhave displayed hostility to core Federal constitutional and statutory \nprotections, or who have an extreme ideological agenda. Judges who are \nhighly qualified, have a balanced judiciary temperament, and who are \ncommitted to upholding the Constitution and Federal law are judges that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle can support. But we should not \nsupport nominees with records that suggest they will roll back the \nrights and protections that Americans consider vital.\n  All nominees should have their records examined thoroughly, and they \nshould have hearings to answer questions about their records. Because \nthese are lifetime appointments to courts that make decisions deeply \naffecting the nation, full and fair review is the least the Senate owes \nthe American people.\n  The Senate has worked well together this year on a number of \nbipartisan efforts, including education, airline security, and \nbioterrorism. On the issue of judges, all of us on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee know that we can work well with the administration and with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to confirm nominees for our Federal \ncourts who are highly qualified, fair, and committed to upholding the \nConstitution and the Nation's laws. I look forward to greater efforts \nin the time ahead to achieve that very important goal.\n  I am reminded of the fact, in reviewing the Constitutional \nConvention, that perhaps the last major decision made at the \nConstitutional Convention was to change what had been initially \naccepted by the Founding Fathers, and that was the Senate was going to \nappoint Federal judges. The Senate would do it by itself. One of the \nlast decisions made by the Founding Fathers was to have this as a \nshared responsibility.\n  It seems to me that is something that sometimes this institution \nloses sight of, as do the American people sometimes. They believe that \nonce nominated, we, in effect, should be a rubber stamp to these \nnominees. In reading constitutional history, we will find, to the \nFounding Fathers this was an issue of enormous importance and \nconsequence. They made it extremely explicit that they believed the \nresponsibility ought to be an equally shared responsibility between the \nPresident and the Senate. It does seem to me we should meet that \nresponsibility in ways that are fair, that reveal the qualities of the \nindividual, and make a judgment and a decision based upon that process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13666-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13666-S13667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN T. O'CONNOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to remember my friend John T. O'Connor, who passed away on \nNovember 30, 2001. A lifelong fighter for social justice, John died \nsuddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 46 while playing basketball, a \nsport he loved, at the YMCA near his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n  John O'Connor's zest for life and boundless energy were apparent from \nthe moment you first met him, and those extraordinary qualities \ncontinued to amaze even those who knew him best and longest. His \nundeniable charisma helped win an enormous circle of friends. But his \nlife was always about causes larger than himself. He credited his \npassion for social justice to the example of his parents, Katherine and \nGeorge, to the Catholic faith and training he felt so deeply, and to \nhis many\n\n[[Page S13667]]\n\ninspiring teachers, especially at Clark University in Worcester, his \nalma mater.\n  John's public journey began when he was still in college in the late \n1970s, organizing fellow students to volunteer at the Mustard Seed, a \nCatholic worker collective in Worcester dedicated to feeding the poor \nand homeless. There he perfected his trademark eggplant parmesan. After \ngraduation, John went to work for Worcester Fair Share, knocking on the \ndoors of the three deckers of Grafton Hill in a successful campaign to \nend arson-for-profit in that neighborhood, a pattern he identified \nthrough disciplined research. The fire station built in response to \nthat campaign remains a testament to John's first venture into \ngrassroots organizing.\n  The combination of community organizing and strategic research led \nhim to understand that the environment was also an urban issue, \naffecting the quality of life in low income neighborhoods as surely as \nin the great outdoors. He began this new work by organizing citizens to \nresist an ill-conceived landfill proposal and to negotiate with local \nfactory owners to reduce emissions.\n  Soon, John moved on to a large national campaign, setting out to rid \nthe country of environmental threats such as the asbestos contamination \nhe lived next to in his hometown of Stratford, CT. At a time when \nenvironmental activism was out of fashion among some in Washington, he \nbegan traveling across the nation, speaking out against polluters, and \nconvincing more than a million Americans to sign petitions to support \ntoxic waste cleanup. He built his organization, The National Toxics \nCampaign, into a grassroots campaign to mobilize people from across the \ncountry, providing timely and passionate support for the appropriation \nof $8 billion for the Federal Superfund law in the mid-eighties, and \nhelping to realize the promise of that historic legislation.\n  First and foremost, John was a community organizer. He took on a \nremarkable range of issues, and he always did so with great dedication \nand effectiveness. He worked with scientists to document health \nconcerns for veterans of the Gulf War. He made the case for \nenvironmental cleanup programs from Boston Harbor to the Rio Grande. He \nargued against the misuse of pesticides and other chemicals in \nagriculture. He was a strong believer in the importance of organized \nlabor, and he fought alongside union members for strict protections for \nhealth and safety in the workplace. He co-authored a number of books on \norganizing and the environment, and a book on agricultural democracy \nwas near completion. He was also interested for many years in \nresponsible energy policy, and he led an effort in 1998 to repeal a \nMassachusetts electricity deregulation law, which he felt was unfair to \nconsumers and the environment.\n  For John O'Connor, environmental-\nism was always as much about people as about our physical surroundings. \nIt was logical that he would turn in recent years to the cause of \nassuring the best possible health care for every citizen. In 1999, he \nled efforts that obtained more than one hundred thousand citizen \nsignatures in support of a health reform measure for the Massachusetts \nballot. Momentum generated by that successful signature drive led to \nthe passage of important but long-delayed legislation on the rights of \npatients in managed care. Looking ahead, he was poised to play an \nimportant and growing role in revitalizing prospects for universal \ncoverage in Massachusetts.\n  John O'Connor was also an intense and tireless champion of racial \njustice. He was endlessly fascinated by the diversity of human \nexperience. As an American of Irish heritage, he led the 1997 drive to \ncreate the first permanent U.S. memorial to the victims of the Irish \nFamine on Cambridge Common. To John O'Connor, ethnic background and \nculture were intended to enrich the world, not divide it. He was proud \nto be known as an ``ABC''--an Armenian-by-Choice--after his marriage to \nCarolyn Mugar, an outstanding leader and activist in the Armenian \ncommunity. John enthusiastically joined her to make his own impressive \ncontributions to that community.\n  His passionately-held beliefs made John an intense and frequent \ncritic of the status quo in general, and of politics in particular. Yet \nhe was profoundly optimistic about what this nation could achieve. He \nbelieved deeply in democracy. He looked for inspiration to the early \nyears of our country and the nation's founders, and he read widely \nabout them. In his campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in \n1998, he told voters he wanted an America that truly reflected the \nbasic values enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution--not an America that was simply the sum of its commercial \nenterprises or parochial concerns. Although he did not prevail in that \ncampaign, he ran a strong race that impressed many people and made \ncountless new friends along the way.\n  With John O'Connor's death, we in Massachusetts have lost one of our \nstate's most active and effective champions of working families, \nconsumers, and the environment. John left us much too soon. I mourn his \nloss, and I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Carolyn Mugar, \nhis daughter, Chloe, his parents, his brothers and his sister, his \nnieces and nephews, and his many godchildren. In his memory, we pledge \nto recommit ourselves to the many great causes in which John did so \nmuch to lead the way.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to \ntwo members of my staff who are retiring this week. These are two \npeople who have really made a difference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Joan Douglass is a real gem, a classy, \nknowledgeable woman who connects with people of all ages. She has had \none of the toughest and most important jobs in our office. Joan has \nbeen on the front line. Joan is the first person you see when you come \ninto our Columbus office. She is the person whose voice you hear when \nyou call our Columbus office, the first person to answer the phone. \nThat is an office that actually is not just my office. It is also \nSenator Voinovich's office. We have, in Ohio, a joint casework office, \nwhich has worked out very well. Joan is the person there who greets \neveryone.\n  Over the years, Joan has put up with just about everything: bomb \nthreats, sit-ins, now even anthrax scares. Joan is a rock. She is as \nsolid as they come.\n  Everyone who knows Joan speaks of her with such fondness. She is \nreally a person with no enemies. Her love, her compassion for people is \nunmatched. She loves people. They love her back.\n  You know, it takes quite a lady to take a new job at the age of 72, \nwhich is what Joan did when she came to work for us--especially the job \nworking for two Senators. What could be tougher than that? Who in the \nworld would ever think of doing that? Who goes from being a State \nlegislator, which Joan was, a real estate broker, and many other \nexciting jobs, to working for two Senators? Only Joan.\n  Actually, before she worked for us she worked for then-Governor \nVoinovich for 8 years. Four of those years I was the Lieutenant \nGovernor. Every day when I would come to work, Joan would be the first \nperson I would see--always smiling, always happy, always professional.\n  Joan continues to amaze me in everything she does. I am astounded by \nher energy and her great sense of adventure. Nothing ever seems to slow \nher down.\n  Joan really is a terrific role model for all of us. In fact, she \nshould be the poster child for how Federal employees should treat \npeople. No matter what, Joan has always greeted everyone who walked \ninto our office with great respect and great compassion. It didn't \nmatter if it was someone who loved me or hated me. It didn't matter, \nJoan was steady. She treated them the right way. She treated everyone \nin that same sweet, nurturing, nonthreatening, and friendly way.\n  Joan has always handled herself with such professionalism, and no \nmatter what, no matter how busy she was, she always has had time for \npeople, especially for the younger people, younger members of our staff \nin the office. She really has been a role model. She has been a mentor. \nEvery time I see her, Joan always asks about Fran, asks about our \nchildren and now our grandchildren. I have always appreciated that.\n  I speak for so many in our office and many across the State of Ohio \nwhen I\n\n[[Page S13668]]\n\nsay that, although we are happy for Joan upon her retirement and we \nwish her nothing but the best with her new post-Senate endeavors, we \nare saddened by her departure and we will miss her dearly.\n  We will miss her dedication to the people of the State of Ohio. We \nwill miss her optimism and her cheerful nature. We certainly will miss \nher terrific sense of humor. Most of all, we will just miss Joan.\n  She is one great lady. My wife Fran and I wish her all the best in \nthe world.\n  In conclusion, I thank Joan for her dedication to the people of the \nState of Ohio, for her friendship, and for the work she has done for \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13668-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JENNY OGLE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to good friend \nand member of my staff, Jenny Ogle, for all the great work she has done \nfor the people of Ohio. Jenny, who runs the joint casework office we \nhave with Senator Voinovich, is retiring today. We are going to miss \nher dearly.\n  When I started thinking about her retirement, my mind was flooded \nwith fond memories and so many laughs and good stories. There is no one \nelse like Jenny. Before coming to work for our joint casework office, \nshe ran my Senate casework office worked for me when I was in the House \nof Representatives for 8 years, and also worked for Congressmen Bud \nBrown and Dave Hobson.\n  She is a true professional--someone who has been really a stabilizing \nforce in our whole casework operation. The casework operation, of \ncourse, is what reaches out to people. It is where people of the State \nof Ohio go when they have a problem. They do not come to us, and they \ndo not come to Jenny unless they are already frustrated with the \nFederal bureaucracy or the State bureaucracy or something else. When \nthey come in, they already have plenty of problems. Jenny has been the \none who worked out those problems.\n  It takes a good deal of patience to handle the kinds of things Jenny \nhas seen over the years in that casework office. She has seen just \nabout everything.\n  That is why I have always been amazed by her steadiness--her \nunbelievable ability to deal with the kinds of cases and the kinds of \nproblems that are seen on a daily basis. What really impresses me is \nthat she is always still smiling and laughing at the end of the day. \nShe always has done her job with great professionalism and great \ncompassion.\n  Jenny also has been a real leader in our office. For example, she \npioneered the military academy nomination process, a very complex \nprocess. She essentially wrote the book on it. What she has developed \nis today being used around the country in congressional office after \ncongressional office. She wrote the bible on how Congressmen should \nhandle their academy nominations. I thank her for that.\n  I have known Jenny for a long time--since those days when she was \nworking for Congressman Bud Brown, and when she came to work for me at \nour Springfield office. I remember how her Aunt Tilly used to come in \nthe office and do her filing. I also fondly remember the doughnuts \nJenny would bring in from her brother's doughnut shop. Those are great \nmemories.\n  Jenny is also a rare person--a person with great compassion and \nempathy for people and their concerns.\n  Let me thank her from the bottom of my heart for the great job she \nhas done to assist countless thousands and thousands and thousands of \nOhioans over the last 20 years.\n  I am truly privileged to have had the extraordinary opportunity to \nwork with Jenny and to call her my friend.\n  We wish her and her family all the best in the world.\n  In conclusion, let me thank Jenny for her dedication to the people of \nthe State of Ohio--for her friendship, and for the work she has done \nfor our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last few weeks, many \nconservatives have launched an extensive public relations campaign to \nassail Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and particularly \nChairman Pat Leahy. They have been critical of the pace of judicial \nnominations. This campaign is wholly unwarranted. Coming during a war \nwhen Democrats are committed to working with the President to shore up \nour Nation's defenses, it is particularly ill timed.\n  The Washington Times has compared Democrats to terrorists, referring \nto the pending nominations as a ``hostage crisis.'' Another \nconservative publication, Human Events, labeled my colleague, Chairman \nLeahy, as ``Osama's Enabler.''\n  Sadly, these outrageous charges are not limited to right-wing media \noutlets. Many colleagues in the Senate from the other side have leveled \nthe following accusations: One Senator said the Democrats are guilty of \nracial profiling. Another Senator said the Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee are actively hindering the war effort. Another Republican \nSenator said we are drawing out a session to deny the President a \nchance to make recess appointments.\n  In truth, Senator Leahy has done an excellent job of moving the \nPresident's nominees along--far better than the Republicans ever did \nover the previous 6\\1/2\\ years. We have already confirmed 27 judges \nsince July of this year. When all is said and done, we may well end up \nconfirming more than 30. That is more judicial nominees than were \nconfirmed during the entire first year of President Clinton's term in \noffice, when the Senate was controlled by the same party. It is double \nthe number of nominees confirmed during the entire first year of the \nfirst Bush administration.\n  Chairman Leahy has had to contend with Senate reorganization, \nterrorists attacks, a massive antiterrorism bill, and anthrax \ncontamination that shut down his personal and committee offices. We all \nrecall the news reports about the anthrax letter being sent to Chairman \nLeahy. He has had ample occasions to delay hearings. Yet he has not. He \neasily could have used any of these obstacles as an excuse to cancel \nhearings, and he did not.\n  In little more than 5 months, Chairman Pat Leahy has held more \njudicial nomination hearings than Republicans held in all of 1996, \n1997, 1999, and the year 2000.\n  The Democrats, under his leadership, have eliminated the anonymous \nholds that crippled the judicial confirmation process for the last 6 \nyears.\n  If you are not here in the Senate, anonymous holds may be a term you \ndon't understand. Let me explain it. Under Republican leadership, any \nSenator could block a nominee for any reason, without even identifying \nhim or herself to the rest of the Senate. A nominee would come before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and sit there week after week, month \nafter month, and in some cases year after year without any Senator \nstanding up and saying: I am the person who is holding this judicial \nnominee. It was totally unfair.\n  On some of the nominees, I used to go around the Chamber begging \nRepublican Senators to tell me: Do you have a problem with the nominee? \nI want to talk about it.\n  They wouldn't say. It was anonymous. That is over. Under Senator \nLeahy's leadership, the anonymous holds that have crippled this process \nfor the last 6 years has been eliminated. We have made public a \nSenator's support or opposition to judicial nominees from their home \nState. We have moved nominees approved by the committee swiftly to the \nfloor. I presided personally over two or three of these hearings. And \nthose nominees went straight from the committee to the floor in a \nmatter of days. We have voted unanimously to confirm nominees vetted by \nthe committee. The only vote against all of President Bush's nominees \ncoming out of committee was cast by minority leader Trent Lott.\n\n  Quite frankly, it is a bit ironic to hear many of our Republican \ncolleagues complain about unfair delays in judicial nominations. It is \nno secret that many of our colleagues systematically blocked Democratic \nappointments, regardless of qualifications, to the Federal courts of \nappeal. In 1996, for example, the Republicans failed to confirm one \nsingle appellate court nominee--not one.\n\n[[Page S13669]]\n\n  In the 106th Congress, Republicans failed to act on an astonishing 56 \npercent of President Clinton's appellate nominees, despite the fact \nthat his nominees received extraordinarily high ratings from the \nAmerican Bar Association, and support on a bipartisan basis.\n  Some of President Clinton's nominees languished after a hearing or \ncommittee vote; many more never even got a hearing.\n  Let me tell you about one: Helaine White, a nominee for the Sixth \nCircuit in Michigan. She waited in vain for over 1,400 days for the \nJudiciary Committee to schedule a hearing. For approximately 4 years, \nshe sat in that committee.\n  If my Republican colleagues got a letter marked ``Return to Sender'' \nafter 1,400 days, they would abolish the Post Office.\n  They thought it was all right to let Ms. White, a nominee for this \nimportant judicial vacancy, sit there for approximately 4 years.\n  The situation was so bad under the Republican leadership of the \nJudiciary Committee that Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Rehnquist \ncriticized the Republican leadership for creating so many vacancies in \nthe Federal courts. In fact, one of President Bush's own judicial \nnominees, who was unanimously voted out of the committee last Thursday, \ncriticized the Republicans last year for employing a double standard \nfor a Democratic nominee to the courts.\n  Chairman Pat Leahy of Vermont has already held more hearings for the \nFifth Circuit than the Republicans held in over 6 years. In 6 months, \nPat Leahy has held more hearings to fill vacancies in that circuit than \nthe Republicans held in 6 years. The Democrats have confirmed the first \nnew judges to the Fifth and Tenth Circuits since 1995--6 years.\n  Details like this demonstrate there is simply no comparison between \nDemocratic and Republican records.\n  Our Republican colleagues would have you believe the Democrats are \ndragging their feet because the ratio of President Bush's confirmations \nto the number of vacancies is relatively low. But what they don't tell \nyou is this: Close to 70 percent of the current vacancies in the \nFederal courts have been open since President Clinton was in office, \nseveral of them since 1995. They are decrying the number of vacancies \nnot filled, and yet during President Clinton's Presidency they would \nnot fill them, even though he sent qualified nominees to the Senate.\n  The number of judicial vacancies increased by 60 percent during the \n6\\1/2\\ years the Republicans were in charge of the Senate. Due to \nconcerted opposition by their party, President Clinton appointed \nproportionately fewer appellate judges than either President Reagan or \nthe first President Bush. Now, with a Republican President back in the \nWhite House, our Republican colleagues are suddenly very concerned \nabout judicial vacancies.\n  In the wake of September 11, President Bush called on Members of the \nHouse and Senate to come together--and we have--to improve air safety, \nto stabilize the airline industry, to give law enforcement additional \ntools to fight terrorism, and to strengthen our economy. That is \nexactly what the Democrats have done. We put aside partisanship to meet \nthe demands of our country at war.\n  Quite frankly, we would have had an easier time of it, and fewer \ndisputes with the Republicans over judicial nominees, if the President \nand his Attorney General had sent up more judicial nominees like those \nwe have already confirmed, especially for the Federal Court of Appeals. \nThis simple fact is often lost in the din of partisan rhetoric.\n  The Democratic leadership has worked hard, in just a few months, to \nconfirm men and women of real integrity and accomplishment to the \nFederal judiciary. We have advanced judges who enjoy widespread \nbipartisan support. They have records which demonstrate a commitment to \nmainstream American values, including the protection and advancement of \ncivil rights and civil liberties for everyone. We have intentionally \navoided a contentious and draining fight over controversial nominees.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, with the immediate national crisis we \nface, we will still have to confront many controversial nominees. But \nlet me remind my colleagues that we are filling lifetime appointments. \nThese are not temporary. Judges sit on the Federal bench long after \nmany of us have delivered our last speeches and after Presidents have \ncome and gone. We will scrutinize them fairly, but carefully.\n  Our Republican colleagues have said they want us to work three times \nas fast because when they were in control they went three times as \nslow. Sadly, many of the nominees we have been sent do not really hew \nto the mainstream of American politics. The end result--if we follow \nand appoint every nominee sent--would be a judiciary that would not \nrepresent the values of this country, the mainstream values which we \nshould push for when it comes to these important judicial appointments.\n  The American electorate has been evenly divided over the last 10 \nyears. This country is entitled to a judiciary that reflects that \ndiversity, not one hijacked by any political extreme, right or left.\n  Chairman Pat Leahy has done an excellent job as the Senate Judiciary \nchairman, and his critics on the right should read the facts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I also have come to the floor, along \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Illinois, to \ntalk about this very important topic; and that is, the confirmation \nprocess for Federal judges.\n  The first thing I want to do is commend the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, for the professional and diligent way in \nwhich he has handled the confirmation process this year, since taking \nthe helm of the committee in June. His, in some way, is a thankless \njob, because, as we have observed, no matter how many hearings he holds \nor judges he moves through the committee, there are those in this body \nwho will never be satisfied. Indeed, it seems that the only thing that \nwill satisfy the critics is for Chairman Leahy to shortchange the \nimportant constitutional role that the Senate and the committee play in \nthe confirmation process. But that, I know, he will never do, and the \nNation should be very grateful to him for that.\n  There has been some harsh criticism of Chairman Leahy from our \ncolleagues on the other side, and in the press. Given how President \nClinton's nominees were treated during 6 years of Republican control of \nthe Senate, I find it kind of hard to believe some of the arguments we \nnow hear. We have here, really, a numbers game. The argument has \nreached a new level of absurdity when our Republican friends start \ntalking about things such as the average number of nominees per \nhearing. It is pretty obvious that is a meaningless calculation. To the \nextent that statistics matter, the numbers that count are the number of \njudges for which hearings have been held and the number of judges \nconfirmed.\n  When you look at those numbers, the numbers that really matter, I \nhave to say that our chairman really does have the better of the \nargument. In just 5 months since taking over the committee, Senator \nLeahy has already held hearings for 34 judges. That is more than the \nnumber of judges who received hearings in the entire firs year of the \nGeorge H.W. Bush administration and the entire first year of the \nClinton administration. And so far, we have confirmed 27 judges this \nyear. Remember again that the Democrats have only been in control since \nJune I understand that probably 3 more judges will be confirmed before \nthis session concludes, meaning that 30 judges will be confirmed this \nyear. That would be more than were confirmed during the entire first \nyear of President Clinton's first term in office and more than double \nthe number confirmed during the entire first year of the elder \nPresident Bush's administration. Think about that. Given all that we \nhave had to deal with on the Judiciary Committee this year, I think \nChairman Leahy has shown more than good faith in trying to move the \nprocess along, especially since September 11.\n  There have been times this year when I have been concerned about \nhearings being held too soon on some\n\n[[Page S13670]]\n\nnominees. A hearing that is held before Senators can review the records \nof the nominees is really nothing more than just a formality. \nParticularly given the large number of circuit court nominees, I think \nour colleagues on the Republican side are asking us, in a way, to \nignore our constitutional responsibilities when they make blanket \ndemands such as: You should confirm all judges who were nominated \nbefore the August recess. Those kinds of arguments are particularly \ninappropriate when you think about the appointments we are being asked \nto confirm with to little scrutiny. Lifetime appointments to the \ncircuit courts and district courts are not to be taken lightly. With \nthe Supreme Court taking only about 100 cases each year, the decisions \nmade in the lower courts are usually final, and have a huge impact on \nthe development of the law. They also have a huge impact on the \npeople's lives. In addition, there are a number of circuits in this \ncountry that are extremely unbalanced ideologically, and the \nnominations made by President Bush seem to be designed to exacerbate \nthat imbalance. It is entirely reasonable--indeed, our constitutional \nrole demands--that we examine the records of individuals chosen for the \ncircuit courts very carefully before we approve their nominations\n  It is clear to me that neither side in a fight such as this is ever \ngoing to be satisfied. In the current situation, despite everything \nthat the chairman has tried to do to move quickly on judges--including \nholding hearings in August, holding more hearings after September 11 \nwhen our committee was more than occupied with the so-called anti-\nterrorism legislation, and even holding a hearing in October when the \nSenate office buildings were closed and some of our staffs had had \nnowhere to work for the previous 2 days--despite all of this, my \nRepublican colleagues continue to complain. At one point, they even \nheld up appropriations bills on the floor for over a week, something \nthat our side never did despite our frustration with the pace of \nconfirmations under President Clinton. And now we understand that the \nminority leader placed a hold on every Judiciary Committee bill because \nof his displeasure with the pace of the nomination of a judge he has \nchampioned to the Fifth Circuit.\n\n  Let us recall that in the last 6 years of President Clinton's term, \nthe Judiciary Committee did not hold a single hearing on a Fifth \nCircuit nominee. No fewer than three highly qualified nominees for \npositions on that court never got a hearing, much less a vote in \ncommittee or on the floor. The thing that has troubled me the most \nabout the criticism of the pace of judicial confirmations is the \ncomplete unwillingness of those who are now criticizing Chairman Leahy \nto acknowledge that they really contributed to the judge shortage that \nthey are complaining about today, or that they did anything in the last \n6 years to deserve our criticism of them at that time.\n  It is particularly frustrating to hear our Republican colleagues \ninvoking the ABA review in support of President Bush and the Republican \nleadership in the Congress broke with over 40 years of tradition, \ndating back to the administration of Dwight D. Eisenhower, when they \nrefused to submit the names of nominees to the ABA prior to the \nnominations being formally made. Now they complain about the delays in \nconfirming nominees and invoke the ratings of the ABA panels as \nevidence that these nominees are beyond reproach. It just does not add \nup.\n  The very act of forcing the ABA to begin its assessment after a \nnomination has been made has delayed confirmation hearings for at least \na month and often longer. Chairman Leahy very sensibly has insisted \nthat an ABA review on a nominee be completed before scheduling a \nhearing. So I suppose that if we are playing a numbers game and are \ngoing to compare apples to apples, we should subtract 30 to 45 days of \nconsideration from each of President Bush's nominees.\n  My conclusion is that until I hear the critics of Chairman Leahy say, \n``Yes, it was wrong to let Judge Helene White go 4 years without even a \nhearing; yes, we now agree that Kathleen McCree Lewis should have at \nleast had a hearing; yes, the delays in voting on the confirmations of \nJudge Berzon and Judge Paez were unconscionable; yes, it was wrong to \nnot confirm a single circuit court nominee in 1996; yes, it was wrong \nto confirm only 44 percent of the circuit judges nominated by President \nClinton in the last Congress of his term; yes, it was wrong to have 68 \nof President Clinton's nominees in the 106th Congress never come up for \na vote in the Judiciary Committee; and yes, we are in large part \nresponsible for the fact that there are now so many vacancies to fill \non our federal courts,'' until I hear those statements, the statistics \nthey cite, and the argument that they make ring a little hollow. If and \nwhen I do hear those statements accepting responsibility, I think a \nbipartisan solution will emerge. Because of my Republican colleagues \nacknowledge that they bear some responsibility for the situation we \nfind ourselves in today, they can suggest to the President that he try \nto ``change the tone'' on this issue in a tangible and meaningful way. \nHe can do that by renominating some of those highly qualified \ncandidates who never got a hearing or a vote in the Judiciary Committee \nwhen it was chaired by my friend, the Senator from Utah. The President \ndid that with Roger Gregory, and I applauded him for it. We can wipe \nthe slate clean with some courageous work, and there are enough \nvacancies to do this in many circuits. That is the challenge. Are we \ngong to continue the numbers game? Are we going to continue the \nrecriminations? Or are we going to move forward in a bipartisan way and \nget on with our business on this committee and in the Senate. I think \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee is doing an admirable job under \nthe circumstances. I urge him and the majority leader not to submit to \npressure tactics. The ball is in the President's and the minority's \ncourt. They can decide if they want to ``change the tone in \nWashington.'' We simply cannot do it alone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss judicial nominations \nand the pace being set by the Judiciary Committee. It is the Senate's \nresponsibility to confirm judges and fill the vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary. Unfortunately, this constitutional responsibility has become \nincreasingly politicized in the last few years. It seems that the \npeople accused of slowing the process last year are the same ones that \nare pushing for faster confirmations today. And those who wanted more \njudges confirmed last Congress are now defending the pace of current \nconfirmations. While we all expected that dynamic once the party in \ncontrol of the White House and the Senate changed, it is still \ndisappointing.\n  It would be a good idea to agree upon a set of rules that governed \nthe pace of the confirmation process regardless of the party in control \nof the White House or the Senate. Since that is unlikely, we are now \nrequired to defend our rate of confirmations. The only way to do that \nis to compare the pace this year with that of past years. When we do \nthat, we find that there is little to criticize in the performance of \nthis year's Judiciary Committee.\n  By the end of this session of Congress, we will have confirmed at \nleast 27 district court judges and 6 circuit judges. The Judiciary \nCommittee has held 11 nominations hearings for judges since control of \nthe chamber changed.\n  To put that in context, by the end of the year, the Senate will have \nconfirmed more judges in the first year of the Bush Presidency than in \neither the first year of the first President Bush or President Clinton. \nIt is also far more than the 17 judicial confirmations in 1996 and \nalmost the exact number confirmed in 1999 and 2000 when 34 and 39 were \nconfirmed respectively.\n  The record also shows that close to 70 percent of the vacancies have \nexisted long before President Bush took office. The Senate chose not to \nact, in some cases for years, on President Clinton's nominees to fill \nthe positions. The cries of judicial emergencies and demands for \nimmediate action now ring a bit hollow when the judgeships could have \nbeen filled years ago.\n  Nonetheless, it is our responsibility to take action on the judicial \nnominees in a timely manner. We have been doing just that. As we go \nforward, I want to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto confirm more judges. The Judiciary Committee has a noble tradition \nof cooperation in approving judges who are qualified, respectful of the \nlaw, and moderate in their approach. It is our responsibility\n\n[[Page S13671]]\n\nto return to that tradition and confirm judges who represent the \nideological middle ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank my friend from Kansas. I know \nhe has some things to say. I will try to be brief. I was in the line to \ntry to talk about this very subject. I will make it brief so we can get \non and we can get an explanation of the lovely pictures he has behind \nhis podium.\n  I, too, rise to say a few words about judicial nominations and in \nparticular to defend the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy of Vermont. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have made \na lot of hay about our record on judicial nominations, but the facts \nsimply don't bear out the allegation.\n  Patrick Leahy has conducted the Judiciary Committee, both when we had \nthe hearings on Senator Ashcroft's nomination to be Attorney General, \nwhen he was chairman for 17 days, and now as chairman for 5 months, in \nthe most gracious, fair, bipartisan way that I have seen a chairman \nconduct him or herself. It is sort of unfair to demonize. That seems to \nbe a new technique used by some. They are doing it to our majority \nleader, Senator Daschle, another gracious and fairminded man, because \nhe doesn't agree with them. That seems to be the thing that has \nhappened. Maybe it started a few years back with the contract on \nAmerica and all the cohorts there. But it is not a nice way to do \npolitics, to demonize an opponent.\n  I know there are certain newspapers and TV shows and radio shows that \ntry to spread the word. I just want to say, first, I don't think the \nAmerican people appreciate it. Second, it is not going to cower Senator \nDaschle or Chairman Leahy. I know them both. They are very estimable \npeople. They are very nice people. They are very strong people. To say \nthat taking personal shots and demonizing somebody is going to make \nthem back off is a silly policy. Put yourself in their shoes.\n  When we are all under the gun and personally attacked, that doesn't \nmake us back off. It makes us maybe review what we have done, and then \nif we think we are right--and I know Senator Daschle and Chairman Leahy \nhave--we are all the much stronger. Let's go over the facts instead of \ntalking about just kind of rhetoric.\n  First, under Chairman Leahy's leadership in the first 5 months since \nthe Senate reorganization, despite the disruptions caused by the \nSeptember 11 tragedy in my city and the anthrax in our offices, we have \nheld 11 hearings on nominations. That is more than two per month. There \nwas an unprecedented August recess nomination hearing that Chairman \nLeahy held. I chaired a hearing 2 days after the closure of all three \nSenate office buildings due to anthrax. We had to meet in the Capitol, \nin a cramped and crowded room. I believe it was on a Friday afternoon.\n  In 1999 and 2000, by contrast, when the committee was controlled by \nthe people of the other side, there were only seven hearings per year, \nand that was the entire year, not just the 5 months we had.\n  Second, my friends from the other side of the aisle complain that we \nare confirming too few judges. We have put 27 on the bench up to now; \nthat is in 5 months of being in the majority. We should get up to 32 by \nthe time we leave this week. Let me underscore 32. That is 5 more than \nwere confirmed in the entire first year of the Clinton administration, \nwhen Democrats controlled the Judiciary Committee. They argue we are \nstalling, but we are putting in more judges nominated by a Republican \nPresident, George Bush, in the first year or first 5 months, than we \nput in when there was a President of our own party, President Clinton, \nwho was nominating. Claims ring hollow when you look at the facts.\n\n  Again, the idea of taking a 2 by 4 and trying to hit the chairman or \nthe members of our committee over the head without the facts is not \ngoing to bear fruit. You can give as many speeches as you want.\n  Third, when we point to raw numbers, our colleagues change their \narguments, and then they point to the percentage of seats that remain \nvacant. You can't create a problem and then complain that someone else \nisn't solving it fast enough.\n  Why are there vacant seats? There are vacant seats because when \npeople from the other side controlled the Judiciary Committee during \nthe last 6 years of the Clinton administration, vacancies on the \nFederal bench increased 60 percent--a 60-percent increase during the \ntime they were in control. Now they are complaining there are record \nvacancies and we have to fill them all in 1 year. Give me a break.\n  We are not going to play games and say what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander. We are not suggesting two wrongs make a right. We \nare not going to increase the percentage of vacancies. Instead, we are \ngoing to decrease it, and we have gotten a good start to the task. But \nthe proof is in the pudding or, in this case, in the numbers. We are \ngoing to fill these open seats as quickly as possible, but we are going \nto do it right. No one is going to cower us in the time-honored, \nconstitutional way in which we select judges, which has been always in \nthe history of this country, at least during our better moments, when \nwe do it with care.\n  That leads to my fourth point. Because so many Clinton nominees never \ngot a hearing and never were voted on by the Senate when it was \ncontrolled by the folks from the other side, the courts now more than \never hang in the balance. Some of the nominees have records that \nsuggest extreme viewpoints. We need to examine their records closely \nbefore we act.\n  Again, one of the most awesome powers we as Senators hold is the \npower to approve judges. We can't just blindly confirm judges who \nthreaten to roll back rights and protections won through the courts \nover the last 50 years: Reproductive freedom, civil rights, the right \nto privacy, environmental protection, worker and consumer safety.\n  In my State of New York, the administration has so far worked with us \nin good faith to select nominees who have met what I told them are my \nthree criteria for nominating people to the bench: Excellence, \nmoderation, and diversity.\n\n  Nominees who meet those three criteria will win my swift support. But \nfor those nominees whose records raise a red flag, whose records \nsuggest a commitment to extreme ideological agendas, we have to look \nmore closely.\n  These days, the Supreme Court is taking fewer than a hundred cases a \nyear. That means these trial and, particularly, appellate court \nnominees will have, for most Americans, the last word on cases that are \noftentimes the most important matters in their lives.\n  We need to be sure the people to whom we give such power--for life--\nare fairminded, moderate, and worthy of such a deep, powerful, and \nawesome privilege.\n  We have worked well together with our Republican colleagues on \nseveral matters since September 11. By and large, we have done well to \nkeep things bipartisan. On judicial nominees, both sides must work \ntogether to correct the imbalance on the courts and keep the judiciary \nwithin the mainstream--not too far left and not too far right.\n  We need nominees who are fair and openminded, not candidates who \nstick to a narrow ideological agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13671-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13671-S13673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             INDIAN GAMING\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I have an issue I want to explain to \nmy colleagues before the Labor-HHS conference report comes before the \nbody. In that conference report, there was an item that was going to \naddress a wrong that had been placed in an earlier appropriations bill \nand that was not the Interior appropriations bill. This body passed a \nparticular piece of legislation, a very small paragraph, that dealt \nwith a situation in Kansas that was then taken out of the conference \nreport. That is why I am objecting to the Labor-HHS conference report \nuntil I get some assurances that we are going to have this issue dealt \nwith next year. It has to do with a cemetery in Kansas.\n  The pictures I have here are of a beautiful site in Kansas City, KS, \nthat is called the Huron Indian Cemetery. The area overlooks the Kansas \nRiver. It is up on a bluff. It is in downtown\n\n[[Page S13672]]\n\nKansas City, KS. It is where a number of Native Americans are buried \nwho lived in this area--the Wyandotte Tribe who lived in this area, \nbefore a number of them moved to Oklahoma, before the tribe moved to \nOklahoma.\n  You can see the pictures we have of a peaceful site in Kansas City, \nKS. It is virtually a park for a lot of people, a very solemn cemetery \nthat is maintained quite nicely in this area.\n  We have Indian gaming in Kansas, and four tribes are recognized in \nKansas. Each has a casino in the State. There is a tribe in Oklahoma, \nthe Wyandotte Tribe, that wants to build a casino in Kansas, even \nthough they are now located in Oklahoma. Initially, they wanted to \nbuild it on top of the cemetery. Local people protested, saying: Why \nare you ruining this sacred site to put in a casino?\n\n  They said: OK, we will put stilts on it and you will still have the \ncemetery, but this will sit on top of it.\n  Next they said: We want to build it right next to it. We are going to \nbuy property next to the cemetery and we want to put in a casino, even \nthough we are not a Kansas tribe and we are from out of State; some of \nour ancestors from the Wyandotte Indians were buried here 200 years \nago, so we want to be able to claim this as an Indian reservation in \nKansas, even though we are an Oklahoma tribe; we want to be able to \nclaim it in Kansas so we can build a casino in Kansas.\n  That is what they desired to do.\n  The four recognized tribes in Kansas opposed it and said: Look, you \nleft the State, and we stayed here; we have the appropriate \nauthorization to build casinos; we don't want another one in the State; \nwe don't want you coming here. The unofficial Wyandottes who stayed in \nKansas said: We don't want you to have a casino next to our graveyard. \nIt is a sacrilege to put a casino on it, on top of it, or next to it. \nWe oppose that.\n  The Governor of Kansas opposed them doing that, saying this isn't \nfair to our tribes in the State. It isn't fair to the Wyandotte Indians \nand their ancestors who stayed in the area for an Oklahoma tribe to \ncome in. They fought them on doing that. This matter was litigated \nfirst in Federal court, lower court, and in the Tenth Circuit Court. In \neach case, Kansas, and the tribes in Kansas, the local people who \nstayed in Kansas, won against the Oklahoma tribe. They won at all \nlevels--lower court, district court, and Tenth Circuit Court. So they \ncould not declare this land adjacent to the cemetery as part of the \nOklahoma Wyandotte Reservation in Kansas. That is what they were trying \nto do. The court said they disagreed with that.\n  Let me take you to the Department of the Interior Appropriations \nbill. In that appropriations bill, nothing was passed regarding this \nissue on either side, the House side or Senate side. In the conference \ncommittee that met, there was a handwritten sentence that was written \nin by a staff member that overruled the court ruling and allowed for \nthe creation of a casino next to this cemetery. That was done in the \nInterior Appropriations bill.\n  Both Senator Roberts and I are opposed to doing this. This was not \nbrought to the Senate floor, not handled here. This was a handwritten \nsentence that was inserted. They declared: We are going to overrule the \ncourt case, overrule what the Kansas Senators want to do. They are \ngoing to allow them to build a casino next to the cemetery, regardless \nof what the local tribes and the Governor and what the people in the \nState of Kansas or what the two Senators say.\n  It is an egregious abuse of the appropriations process to do this--\nand in my State where people don't want this to take place--just for \nthe financial advantage of an Oklahoma tribe. If they want to do this \nin Oklahoma, build casinos there. That is up to them. Fine. But in \nKansas this is not appropriate. Yet they slipped in that handwritten \nnote to the Interior conference report.\n  This body, the Senate, corrected that in the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill. We said this is not appropriate to take place in Kansas. That was \nthe amendment that was on the floor and was accepted. That was the \nposition of this body.\n  In the conference meeting that took place last night, the House would \nnot agree with the Senate position, so the Senate position was taken \nout and now we are left with the Oklahoma Wyandottes being allowed to \nbuild a casino right next to this cemetery in Kansas City, KS, and \noverrule a court ruling of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I have been in touch with Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd agrees \nwith me that, on the Interior bill next year, it would be possible for \nyou to do it in subcommittee, or committee, or any member of the \nsubcommittee has an absolute right to offer that amendment. We know how \nstrongly you feel about it. I personally feel it should not have been \nin the Interior bill in the first place. I indicated that to the \nSenator. We will work with you on the minority and majority sides to \nmake sure this issue is raised in the subcommittee and at the full \ncommittee level next year.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate that being raised by my colleague from \nNevada--his assurance that we get this dealt with next year. We have \ntalked off the floor about that. He agrees this is not the right way \nfor this to come in. I point out that this is something we are going to \nhave to deal with next year because this matter will still be under \nconstruction, or starting to be constructed at that point in time. It \nneeds to be changed back in the Department of the Interior \nappropriations bill. I am very pleased that the Senator from Nevada \nrecognizes that as well.\n  I point this out because I think this is such an abuse of the \nprocess. It is just wrong for this to take place.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Governor of the State of Kansas regarding this matter and also one \nfrom the four Indian nations in Kansas, the four recognized tribes, all \nopposed to the expansion of the Oklahoma Indian tribe into Kansas to \nbuild a casino.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  State of Kansas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Topeka, KS, October 10, 2001.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pat Roberts: On behalf of the State of Kansas, \n     I am writing to express my strong opposition to language \n     proposed for inclusion in H.R. 2217, the Department of the \n     Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 2002. \n     Language that proposes to clarify the authority of the \n     Secretary of the Interior should not be included in the final \n     text of the bill.\n       The language proposed as a technical amendment states, \n     ``the authority to determine whether a specific area of land \n     is a `reservation' for purposes of sections 2701-2721 of \n     title 25, United States Code, was delegated to the Secretary \n     of the Interior on October 17, 1988.''\n       As you are aware the State of Kansas has been actively \n     involved in litigation concerning the authority of the \n     Secretary of the Interior. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals \n     in Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri v. Norton, recently upheld \n     the position of the State of Kansas that ``. . . the \n     Secretary lacked authority to interpret the term \n     `reservation' as used in IGRA.'' The decision of the Tenth \n     Circuit Court of Appeal has been appealed and the Wyandotte \n     Nation has requested a writ of certiori to the Supreme Court \n     of the United States. If the proposed language were to be \n     included in the final version of H.R. 2217 it has the \n     potential to negatively impact ongoing litigation. This is \n     simply another effort to avoid IGRA and expand gaming by non-\n     residential tribes.\n       I request your support in opposing the inclusion of this \n     proposed language in the final version of H.S. 2217.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bill Graves,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Indian Nations in Kansas,\n\n                                                    June 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Bill Graves, Governor of Kansas,\n     Topeka, Kansas.\n     Re: Four Tribes' Joint Resolutions Opposing Gaming Within the \n         State of Kansas by Out-of-State Indian Nations.\n       Governor Graves: The four (4) Indian Nations in Kansas \n     (``INIK'') have unanimously supported the governor of the \n     State of Kansas in opposition to out-of-state Tribes \n     attempting to gain land holdings in the state of Kansas for \n     purposes of establishing gaming enterprises. At this \n     juncture, the Four Nations have passed joint resolutions \n     similar to the Kansas Legislative Resolution (SCR 1611) \n     opposing such efforts. Enclosed herein are INIK's originals \n     of both of their resolutions. Resolution I opposes the \n     Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma's efforts, and Resolution II \n     opposes all out-of-state Tribes.\n       The Kansas Tribes join with the State of Kansas in this \n     effort, and want you to have this information to see their \n     formal position. if you have any questions, please feel free \n     to contact any of the Tribal Chairpersons.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n                                                       Nancy Bear,\n                            Chairperson, Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas.\n\n\n[[Page S13673]]\n\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to read from the Governor's letter:\n\n       I continue to support the rights of the four existing \n     residential Native American tribes to conduct gaming in \n     Kansas in accordance with approved compacts. Efforts to side-\n     step IGRA negatively impact the rights of our residential \n     tribes as well as the rights of the State of Kansas.\n\n  This is a quote from the Indian Nations of Kansas, the four tribes--\nthe Kickapoo, Sac and Fox, Prairie Band, and Iowa Tribe:\n\n       The four Indian Nations in Kansas have unanimously \n     supported the governor of the State of Kansas in opposition \n     to out-of-state Tribes attempting to gain land holdings in \n     the state of Kansas for purposes of establishing gaming \n     enterprises.\n\n  They are all united and opposed to what was stealthily slipped in the \ndark of night by staff in a handwritten note, and it is wrong for this \nto take place.\n  I put my colleagues on notice, I put the House on notice, and I put \nthe Wyandotte Tribe in Oklahoma on notice: This is going to be back \nnext year. You have bought the land, and you may have won this round, \nbut we will be back at this next year.\n  The way this happened is not fair. I think it is a sacrilege for them \nto desecrate this sacred site for their own gaming purposes, their own \nincome purposes, their own purposes of making money that they would \ntake this upon this sacred site. In all traditions, burial grounds are \ntreated as a sacred site. This is wrong. It should not happen, and it \nwas slipped in the wrong way.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your understanding of this \nsituation. I hope we can correct this next year. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13673-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13673-S13674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as we approach the end of this first \nsession of the 107th Congress, there are many significant legislative \nachievements of which we should be proud. In the wake of the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, Democrats and Republicans, Senators and \nRepresentatives, came together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to \npass a resolution authorizing the President to use military force in \nthe war against terrorism.\n  Then we immediately appropriated, on a bipartisan basis, $40 billion \nin emergency funds to help fight the war against terror and aid in our \nongoing recovery, cleanup, and rebuilding efforts in New York, \nWashington, and Pennsylvania.\n  We came together to pass antiterrorism legislation, the USA Patriot \nAct, that will provide law enforcement in this country with the \nnecessary tools to fight terrorism at home and abroad.\n  In an effort to improve our homeland security, we also passed \nimportant legislation that will dramatically improve the security of \nour Nation's airports.\n  We passed these initiatives and other legislation because we made a \ncommitment to set aside bipartisan bickering and devote the collective \nefforts of this Congress toward working on behalf of the best interests \nof the American people.\n  I was asked recently by a member of the press how far bipartisanship \nshould go during wartime and whether it should apply only to military \nmatters.\n  I responded that bipartisanship should apply at all times, in peace \nand, of course, in war. Unfortunately, it seems our commitment to \nbipartisanship has been unable to produce an economic stimulus package \nthat our economy and so many American working families desperately \nneed.\n  As I am speaking, I see the chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. \nBaucus, the senior Senator from Montana. He has made a valiant effort. \nThere is still a glimmer of hope maybe something can be done, but he \nhas made a valiant effort. He has worked for weeks to come up with an \neconomic recovery package. It is too bad his efforts have not been \nrewarded with some bipartisan legislation in keeping with some of the \nthings I have outlined that we have been able to accomplish.\n  We need to pass an economic stimulus package before the end of this \nsession that would extend unemployment and health benefits for the \nhundreds of thousands and even millions of Americans who have lost \ntheir jobs since the recession started in March. We need to pass an \neconomic stimulus package that will provide much needed relief for the \nAmerican businesses that have been hit hard by the downturn in the \neconomy.\n  An economic stimulus package is also important because we need to \naddress one sector of the American economy that has suffered more than \nany other as a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11: \nthe travel and tourism industry. It would be wrong for this Congress to \nadjourn for the year without doing something to address what has \nhappened to the American travel and tourism industry since that fateful \nday in September.\n  Prior to September 11, the travel and tourism industry employed more \nthan 18 million people with an annual payroll of almost $160 billion. \nIn 30 States, tourism is the No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 industry. It is \nestimated that travel and tourism generated $93 billion in tax revenues \nduring the year 2000 for State, Federal, and local governments. When \nour Governors and other State officials find themselves strapped for \ncash to pay for basic services such as education, $93 billion in tax \nrevenue becomes even more significant. Moreover, during the past \ndecade, travel and tourism has emerged as the Nation's second largest \nservices export, generating an annual trade surplus of about $14 \nbillion. This, of course, is no surprise to the people and workers of \nNevada where travel and tourism is by far the largest industry.\n  In the year 2000, 36 million people visited Las Vegas, contributing \napproximately $32 billion to local economies and sustaining \napproximately 200,000 hospitality and tourism-related jobs. Since \nSeptember 11, these impressive numbers have declined. According to the \nHotel and Restaurant Employees International Union, 41 percent of hotel \nand restaurant employees in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area have \nbeen laid off. In Washington, DC, 41 percent of hotel and restaurant \nemployees have been laid off.\n  In Las Vegas, the fastest growing metropolitan community in the \nUnited States, 30 percent of the hotel and restaurant employees have \nlost their jobs. Similar cuts have been seen in other cities throughout \nthe country, including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, \nHonolulu, and Miami.\n  Jonathan Tisch, one of the premier businessmen in the world, has told \nme on many occasions--he is based in New York--how drastic September 11 \nhas been to his business. I spoke yesterday to Barry Sternly, another \nfine, outstanding businessman in American today. The tourism industry, \nthe hotel business in which he is involved, has suffered \ntremendously. Around the country, 450,000 jobs directly related to \ntravel and tourism will be lost this year. Think of those jobs that \nwill be indirectly affected as a result of what has happened since \nSeptember 11.\n\n  The forecast for the industry from this point on is not much better. \nThe Travel Industry of America estimates travel by Americans will \ndecrease by 8.4 percent this winter compared to the 3 months of \nDecember, January, and February a year ago.\n  These months are always down months, but they are drastically down \nnow. Many hotels use these months to do renovations and things they can \nafford to do with the money they would normally have earned in the \nother months, but they did not make money as they anticipated they \nwould in the months of October and November, which are normally very \ngood months for them. So with the decline of 3.5 percent for the entire \nyear 2001 when compared to the year 2000, the Travel Industry of \nAmerica estimates it will result in nearly $43 billion in lost travel \nexpenditures in 1 year.\n  Even more chilling, the International Labor Organization projects up \nto 3.8 million jobs related to the American travel and tourism industry \ncould be lost in the next few years--$43 billion and almost 4 million \njobs. How can we possibly consider leaving without doing something to \naddress this critical sector of the economy?\n\n[[Page S13674]]\n\n  Certainly there should be bipartisan support for tourism since it is \nso important in so many States, whether it is the State of Montana, the \nState of Michigan, the State of Nevada, or the State of Iowa. Tourism \nis important in all of these States, and I mention them because I see \ntheir Senators in the Chamber today. How can we possibly consider \nadjourning without doing something to help the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who have already lost their jobs and do something so that \nmillions more will not lose their jobs? How can we possibly discuss an \neconomic recovery package without addressing the needs of travel and \ntourism? I say if we do nothing except something related to tourism, we \nwill be doing a good job. It has such an important impact on our \neconomies.\n  Since September 11, I, with a number of other Senators, have come to \nthe Senate floor on various occasions to urge action on a travel and \ntourism package in conjunction with the so-called economic stimulus \nplan. We have urged our colleagues in the Senate, the House, and the \nadministration to include legislation that will encourage people to \nstart traveling again in order to stimulate the economy and get workers \nback on the job. We have taken some important first steps.\n  A few days after September 11, Congress acted quickly and responsibly \nto enact crucial legislation to help stabilize our Nation's airline \nindustry with $15 billion in grants and loans. Since September 11, the \nairline industry has cut 20 percent of its flights and laid off more \nthan 100,000 workers. The financial package for the airline industry \nwas the right thing to do, but it was just the first step toward making \nsure travelers truly feel safe to fly.\n  We then passed a comprehensive airline security bill to dramatically \nincrease the number of sky marshals, strengthen cockpit doors, and \nfederalize the screening of passengers and luggage at our Nation's \nairports.\n  While we were right to enact these measures, it is important for us \nto remember travel and tourism in this country entails so much more \nthan just the airline industry. Travel and tourism has many different \nfaces: Hotels, car rental agencies, cruise ships, theme parks, resorts, \ncredit card companies, family-run restaurants, big city convention \ncenters, tour operators and travel agencies. These are just some of the \nmany diverse elements of an industry that in some way reaches every \nState, virtually every community in America.\n  More importantly, it is from these nonairline sectors of the travel \nand tourism industry that the vast majority of the jobs have been lost. \nThat is why I proposed a comprehensive travel and tourism package as \npart of any economic stimulus plan we would consider.\n  There are many Senators who have been interested in travel and \ntourism, but I would specifically mention Senators Conrad, Dorgan, \nInouye, Kyl, Bill Nelson, Boxer, Miller, Akaka, Schumer, Clinton, \nEnsign, Allen, Stevens, and there are many others.\n  My plan calls upon Congress to enact tax credits for leisure travel \nto encourage Americans to get back on the airlines, to rent a car, to \nstay a few nights at their favorite hotel or enjoy a few meals at their \nfavorite restaurants. The tax cuts would be temporary and would provide \nimmediate results. Travel tax credits would encourage people to take \nadvantage of all the many wonderful things the travel and tourism \nindustry in this country has to offer while at the same time spending \nmuch needed dollars to stimulate the economy.\n  My plan also calls for a temporary increase in the deduction for \nbusiness meals and entertainment expenses.\n  This proposal will encourage businesses to increase their \nentertainment expenses. And, because the average expensed business meal \nis less than $20, this proposal will assist small businesses. This \nproposal by itself will have an enormous and positive impact on our \nNation's restaurants and the millions of Americans they employ.\n  We need to address the needs of our nonairline travel business such \nas rental car companies, hotels, travel agencies, airport \nconcessionaires, to name only a few. These businesses need our help. My \nplan will provide a financial package of loan guarantees similar to \nthat for the airline industry. Finally, we need to do a better job of \npromoting tourism at home and abroad by establishing a Presidential \nadvisory council on travel and tourism to assist in the development of \na coherent and comprehensive national tourism policy designed to help \nstrengthen the travel and tourism industry. My plan provides for the \nnecessary funds to help carry out this mission. We need to make sure \nthat this country advertises the great tourism attractions in Florida, \nNew York, Michigan, California, and Nevada. Most other countries spend \nsignificant amounts of money advertising tourism. We see advertisements \non television and radio all the time. Australia, New Zealand, and other \ncountries advertise and promote tourism to their countries. We need to \ndo the same for America.\n  The travel and tourism industry is too important to our Nation's \neconomy, too important to my State and other States and communities \nthroughout the country to be ignored. I hope everyone understands the \nimportance of travel and tourism and how important it is to our \ncountry.\n  I have a letter from the former majority leader of the Senate, George \nMitchell. The letter says:\n\n       I know how hectic these days are for you and so I will be \n     very brief.\n       Some of the people who were most adversely affected by the \n     events of September 11 are the working poor. Welfare reform \n     in the 1990s forced them into the job market, and \n     fortunately, many found work in the travel and tourism \n     industry. Many have lost their job or face unemployment \n     unless we can get the industry moving again.\n       By embracing the travel credit, [we] can keep the focus of \n     the economic stimulus bill on individuals and on doing \n     everything we can to help the working poor stay in the job \n     market.\n\n  I also have a letter addressed to me from the chair and chief \nexecutive officer of the Carlson Group, one of our nation's largest \ntravel agencies. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 18, 2001.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Assistant Majority Leader of the Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I cannot tell you how dismayed I was to \n     read the article in the Washington Post, today, concerning \n     the impact of September 11th on the travel and tourism \n     industry.\n       As I am sure your constituents have told you, domestic air \n     travel has remained down 31% for the past seven weeks. All \n     elements of the travel and hospitality industry dependent on \n     air travelers have watched their revenue drop by at least \n     this amount.\n       Since personal travel is down 37-40%, tourist destinations, \n     resorts, cruise ships, and many other segments of the \n     American travel and hospitality industry have suffered \n     declines as much as 60% over the same period and it \n     continues.\n       We believe that a personal travel credit and elimination of \n     the 50% penalty on business meals and entertainment expenses \n     are desperately needed to keep Americans employed.\n       Obviously, being employed is far superior to receiving \n     unemployment compensation and far more beneficial to our \n     wonderful people and their families and the states, which \n     bear the burden of such unemployment costs.\n       To the extent some in the industry seem to suggest that \n     such assistance is too expensive or impracticable, they are \n     not speaking for our people, our franchisees, our company and \n     many others who have been the casualties of the fallout from \n     9/11.\n       We know that you understand this. We deeply appreciate your \n     efforts and those of your colleagues, in particular Senators \n     Jon Kyl and Bill Nelson, to help our employees and our \n     businesses regain their economic footing through an amendment \n     to the stimulus bill.\n           Best Regards,\n                                           Marilyn Carlson Nelson,\n                                Chair and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to express a little \nhometown and a little home State pride. Last Saturday, the University \nof Montana Grizzlies defeated the Northern Iowa Panthers, I say to my \nvery good friend from Iowa who attended Northern State, and is the \nstrongest northern State booster I have ever run across. I will not \nembarrass my good friend by giving the score of that game, but I will \nsay to my good friend from Iowa and to the world that we are proud that \nthe University of Montana Grizzlies\n\n[[Page S13675]]\n\nprevailed. It was a hard fought football game, and I give utmost credit \nto the Panthers, who were terrific.\n  This win gave the Grizzlies the privilege of going to the 1-AA \nchampionship game in Chattanooga, TN. They will play the Furman \nUniversity Paladins Friday at 5:30 eastern time. Everyone tune in.\n  In Montana, folks travel from every corner of our big State. We call \nourselves the big sky State. We are a pretty large State, at close to \n149,000 square miles. People around Montana come from all corners of \nour State to see the University of Montana Grizzlies, the Montana State \nUniversity Bobcats. There is a fierce rivalry between the Cat fans and \nthe grizzly fans.\n  From Eureka to Ekalaka, from Havre to Virginia City, in buses, vans, \ncars, and trucks, Montanans travel great distances to cheer on their \nsons and daughters, their friends and neighbors. When our team, the \nGrizzlies, made it to the national championship, understandably we were \na little bit excited. We are very proud of our team. I wish you could \nfeel the energy and excitement going on in Montana right now. We are \nvery excited.\n  This is not new for the Grizzlies. They have been to the I-AA \nplayoffs 8 out of the last 9 years. Friday's championship game will be \nthe fourth the Grizzlies have been to since 1995 when they won the \nchampionship. I will never forget. I was there. Man, did we have fun.\n  It is also important to note that most of the UM players are from \nMontana. We are proud of that. They are great athletes, but they are \nalso good students first. The team averages a 2.9 GPA, virtually a 3.0 \nteam average. They are from small towns, rural communities. Some of \nthem came up playing 6- and 8-man ball--football in small towns known \nas ``iron man'' ball.\n  They are excellent student athletes, like big sky defense man of the \nyear and Academic All-American Vince Huntsberger from Libby, MT. I was \ntalking to Vince the other day after a game, and Vince remembers when I \nwalked throughout the State of Montana running for office. He even told \nme he carried a sign in a parade I was in when he was a little kid.\n  We have Brandon Neil from Great Falls, T.J. Olkers from my hometown \nof Helena. Our star quarterback, John Edwards, is from Billings. Then \nthere is Spencer Frederick from a little town called Scobey in the \nnortheastern part of our State. These young people and all the others \nmake us very proud.\n  If you ask anyone who follows I-AA football, they will tell you that \nthe Washington Grizzly stadium is the premier place to play in the \ncountry. I commend the UM president, George Dennison, for his \nleadership at the university and for investing in the program. Also, \ncongratulations to UM athletic director, Wayne Hogan, and his staff. He \ncame about 7 or 8 years ago and is doing a great job. He is from \nFlorida. And Grizzly coach Joe Glenn, with his vision, his leadership, \nthat has earned him the big sky coach of the year for the second \nstraight year.\n\n  I think all of these individuals have done so well. I thank them for \nthe pride we have.\n  Finally, I have a wager with my very good friend from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings. If the Paladins win--he went to the University of \nFurman--I will come to the floor and recite the words of the Furman \nfight song. If the Grizzlies win, Senator Hollings has agreed to come \nto the floor and recite the UM fight song. Fair wager, for fun. I will \nsend his office the words to our song so he can get started and get the \nrehearsal going so he can boom forth with the University of Montana \nfight song at the next opportunity in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13675-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SOFTWOOD LUMBER--A CALL TO ACTION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I rise today to focus attention on the ongoing softwood \nlumber dispute between the United States and Canada. I believe we have \nan excellent opportunity to permanently remove this blemish on our \nstrong bilateral trade relationship.\n  In the past 3 months, the U.S. Department of Commerce found that the \nCanadian Government unfairly subsidizes this lumber industry and then \ndumps those products in the U.S. market, both of which are prohibited \nby U.S. law. These activities have caused unprecedented upsets in the \nU.S. market, resulting in record low prices, disruption in supply, mill \nclosures, layoffs, people out of work.\n  Good jobs in my State of Montana and across the Nation have been put \nat risk by Canada's foul play. Now is the time to bring this matter to \nresolution once and for all. The U.S. negotiators have a meeting with \ntheir Canadian counterparts to work out what is a desirable solution.\n  As I have stated many times before, this solution must completely \noffset the subsidies and dumping. It must bring true competition to the \nmarketplace and must take into consideration the cross-border and \nenvironmental issues with the objective of a truly level playing field.\n  With that said, the offers of our neighbors to the north have been, \nto date, short of the mark. If we are serious about resolving the \nissue, the Canadians need to put something on the table, something that \nreflects a true, open, competitive market for softwood lumber. Some in \nCanada would prefer to let international tribunals decide this matter. \nI think they misjudge both the legal strength of their position and the \nunderlying merits of their case. At no other time in history have the \nfacts been so squarely in favor of the U.S. industry--no other time in \nthe many years this dispute has been ongoing. At no other time have we \nbeen so close to a detente. Let's not forget, many of the reforms are \nbeneficial and cost effective to the Canadian softwood industry as well \nas to Canadian taxpayers.\n  That said, the clock is ticking. Unfair Canadian lumber imports are \nhurting our American producers. In a regrettable setback on December \n15, the preliminary countervailing duties expired temporarily. It is my \nunderstanding that due to a customs reporting loophole, Canada was able \nto avoid paying payment earlier than the duties' temporary expiration. \nThis is wrong. It emphasizes the need to close the gap from now until \nfinal determination.\n  The statute does not require that this case drag on until next \nspring. There is simply no reason for further foot dragging. The U.S. \nlumber industry cannot afford to suffer further injury. Neither can our \nremanufacturers, who are at the mercy of Canadian blackmail threats to \ncut off supply if we do not support Canada's position.\n  Simply put, if a decision cannot be reached in the next few weeks, \nthe Commerce Department should accelerate their final determination.\n  That said, I would like to begin 2002 with this matter resolved. \nAfter two decades of fighting, it is time for a durable solution to the \nsoftwood dispute. I hope our administration and my Canadian friends \nwill rise to the occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13675-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13675-S13676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FOOTBALL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I compliment the University of Montana. \nThey did, in fact, play well--too well--against the University of \nNorthern Iowa.\n  Before I had bragged to Senator Daschle 2 weeks ago about how we were \ngoing to show the University of Montana how to play football, I wish I \nhad researched how they have done so well in the last few years. I \nprobably would not have been so boastful. But we had just come away \nfrom a tremendous victory, the UNI Panthers over the University of \nMaine Black Bears, just the week before. I thought if the Panthers \ncould beat the Black Bears, they could surely beat the Grizzlies. But \nit did not turn out that way.\n  You played tremendous football, and I thank you very much for being \nso temperate in your remarks about the Panthers of the University of \nNorthern Iowa.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator begins a more serious \ndiscussion, and I will wait my turn, may I intervene to discuss this \nissue for just a moment, coming from a State that has won Division II \nchampionships more than any of you, and one that this year for the \nfirst time in a long while did not make it in the playoffs.\n  I want my friend from Montana to know I warned my seatmate from\n\n[[Page S13676]]\n\nSouth Carolina about you all. We understand about the Grizzlies in \nDelaware. They have been a very powerful Division I-AA team actually \nthe last--almost the last decade, the last 8 years or so. I just want \nyou to know that, even though the Presiding Officer is from a State \nthat has a team called the Spartans--and they only get 100,000 folks or \nso to show up to their games; they don't understand, as the Presiding \nOfficer prior to this, from the University of Michigan and Michigan \nState, where they get 110,000 people--they don't understand real \nfootball that the three of us understand.\n  At some point we should have a more far-reaching discussion about \nfootball as it is really still played, where there are student athletes \nwho take seriously that undertaking, as they do their football.\n  I want to say that people who do not follow and understand that--and \nmany do not because of the media--who do not follow Division II \nfootball, should understand there are some very serious ballplayers. It \nis very good football, high-caliber football. And, in any given year, \nsuch as this year, a team such as the Grizzlies is able to compete with \nDivision I teams. They couldn't do it day in and day out. They could \nnot do it 10 games a year. But it is very serious football.\n  I have been through these bets myself over the last 29 years here \nbecause my alma mater has been engaged in this national championship \nmore than once. Delaware this year had a lousy season, relatively \nspeaking--a winning season but a lousy season. But we have a coach who \nthis year made it to the ranks of only 6 coaches in the history of \ncollege football to win over 300 football games.\n  I just want to rise and salute Division II football, where it is not \na 40-hour-a-week job to attend school, but it is serious, serious \nfootball. I would argue the pressure on some of the fine athletes at \nNorthern Iowa and the University of Montana, the University of \nDelaware, to play this caliber football and what is also expected of \nthem off the field, is a real strain, a real burden on some of them \nbecause they do not get the same opportunities, same scholarships, same \ntreatment, on occasion, that some of the major Division I school \nathletes do.\n\n  I salute the Grizzlies. They are one tough team. When I told my \nfriend from South Carolina about your record, because I was very \nfamiliar with it, he blanched and said, as only he could say because he \nis one of the most humorous guys here: My Lord, if that's the case and \nthey lose, and I have to recite that, they should change that fight \nsong.\n  Having said that, I yield the floor and wait my turn to speak on a \nmore serious subject.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I may ask the indulgence of my good friend, one of the \nteams in the home State of the Presiding Officer, of course, is the \nBadgers. For the previous occupant of the chair, it was the Wolverines, \nand the Grizzlies of Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The Chair would observe the \nteam in Minnesota is the Gophers. The Badgers are Wisconsin.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So we have the Gophers, Wolverines, Panthers, Grizzlies, \nand Maine has the Black Bears. I am going to ask my good friend from \nDelaware, whom do we have in Delaware?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Delaware has proudly named after the \nstrongest group of revolutionary fighters in the Revolution from the \nState of Delaware. Back in those days, cock fights were very much in \nvogue. The toughest of those competitors were the Blue Hens of \nDelaware. I want the record to show the Blue Hens have taken Panthers, \nBadgers, and Bears in their stride, including the Black Bears of Maine. \nWe are little, but we are very strong.\n  I often wish the mascot in the Revolutionary War for the Delaware \nregiment had been a panther or a lion, but it happened to be a blue \nhen. So we are the Delaware Blue Hens, and proud to be such.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will bet they are the strongest, \ntoughest Blue Hens that have ever existed on this Earth.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is a fact.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I look forward to next year when the Senator from \nDelaware stands in the Chamber and gives a recitation of the Grizzlies' \nfight song. I hope we can come to that day.\n  I thank all Senators for indulging me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa \nwith the good-looking holiday sweater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13676-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13676-S13678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the session is about to end. I would \nlike to call to the attention of colleagues one proposition that I hope \ncomes before the Senate before we adjourn. That is the so-called \neconomic stimulus package. You might call it an economic security \npackage.\n  Nothing I say is going to in any way detract from the working \nrelationship that I have with Senator Baucus as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  Maybe in this instance we did not reach an agreement involving he and \nI having complete agreement on a final product. There were other \nfactors that came into play that maybe kept those negotiations from \nbeing one-on-one negotiations where people could freely negotiate and \nreach an agreement as you should in a conference. But all of this \ndiscussion, plus other forums I have been in with Senator Baucus as \nchairman of that committee, have been very cordial and productive \nsessions, even when they have not come out with a product.\n  I only wish that when the stimulus package comes to the floor I have \nthe privilege of doing as we did last spring defending that package, \nalong with Senator Baucus, with the two of us working together to get \nit through the Senate. Hopefully that can still happen. It may not \nhappen, but it doesn't mean that Senator Baucus has not worked hard to \nhelp that happen. Hopefully, we can continue next year to do some \nthings in other areas that fall within the jurisdiction of the Senate \nFinance Committee that will bring bipartisan bills to the Senate floor \nfor successful passage by the Senate.\n  Probably what we are ending up with here, instead of what might come \nout of the conference committee which I was referring to in my work \nwith Senator Baucus, is kind of a hybrid that involves some individual \nnegotiations and some people who aren't even on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over most of the product. But this is \na bill that is going to be introduced in the House. It is my \nunderstanding that it is a bill in which I will have some input, and \nthe White House, and a group in the Senate called the centrists, a \nbipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans who might call themselves \nkind of middle-of-the-road types. It is an economic stimulus package \npresumably passing the House and coming to the Senate. I hope people \nwill see it as a very rich proposal that will help displaced workers \nand give a boost to the economy.\n  Since September 11, we have focused on dislocated workers and \nunemployed people who have been hurt. But there are also a lot of \npeople who are working and who are in anguish over what the future \nholds for them. Even if they have very good jobs, that might be the \ncase because things aren't the same since September 11.\n  When we talk about an economic security package, even though we might \ntend to concentrate on the dislocated workers, we are concerned about \nall workers because people have some questions about the future. \nBecause of what happened on September 11, they see the future a little \ndifferently with a little less security than they did prior to that \ntime.\n  An economic security package addresses the needs of people who are \nworking as well as people who are dislocated. It does what we can to \nhelp those who are dislocated through troubled times. But it also is \nmeant to give some confidence to those who are working and to beef up \nthe economy so we will be able to find jobs for people who are \ndislocated.\n  We are in a state of war. We don't know how long that state of war \nwill be there. But it is not going to end when we find the last Taliban \nin Afghanistan, or the last al-Qaida member. It isn't going to end when \nwe find bin Laden and other leaders responsible for what happened on \nSeptember 11. How long the war is going to go on I do not know. But it \nis not over.\n  We are talking about America being in a state of war since September \n11.\n\n[[Page S13677]]\n\n The Congress of the United States has addressed that and has given the \nPresident the backing that our Constitution demands from a partner in a \nwar act, as Congress is a partner in that.\n  We need to remember that we are in a state of war and that things \naren't the same. The Senate ought to respond as if we were in a state \nof war.\n  I think one of the ways to responsibly respond is for the Senate to \nvote on the economic security or economic stimulus package. I hope the \nSenate majority leader will let his caucus vote the conscience of the \nindividual Member. I hope there isn't any attempt to put the position \nof the party ahead of the good of the country in the closing hours of \nthis session so we can pass this bill.\n  It is time to finish our work, but it is also time to do the people's \nbusiness. There is nothing more important right now than responding to \nthe needs of the people of our country in a time of war when there is a \ngreat deal of anxiety and anguish about the future, not only among the \ndislocated but among those who are even working.\n  We are in the position of finishing the last of the appropriations \nbills. It is time to help the dislocated workers and those who are \nworking and create jobs for the employed to give a shot in the arm to \nthe economy.\n  I believe the White House centrist agreement is bipartisan and \nbicameral and is a product that ought to be brought before the Senate \nafter it passes the House.\n  Remember that this isn't something coming to the Senate just on the \nspur of the moment in the sense that there is a rude awakening and we \nought to do something about the economic situation and pass some \nstimulus. The President recommended it in early October when he \nproposed a program of accelerated depreciation, tax reduction, tax \nrebates for low-income people, enhancement of unemployment \ncompensation, and help for the health care needs of the unemployed. The \nPresident did that. It wasn't the President who started it. There were \nlots of meetings held by Senator Baucus with Democrats and Republicans, \nand maybe meetings with only Democrats. We held separate Republican \nmeetings in early October on whether or not we ought to have a stimulus \npackage. We sought the advice of Chairman Greenspan.\n  There was some question in late September or early October when these \nmeetings were being held about whether or not we needed an economic \nstimulus. But it was just a matter of a couple weeks until the \nPresident, probably on his own, made a determination and a proposal to \nCongress.\n  Parallel with that, there was a growing conclusion within both Houses \nof Congress and both parties that an economic stimulus package was \nneeded. So we have been working in this direction for a long period of \ntime.\n\n  There is a product before us now that is bicameral and bipartisan. \nPartisanship has been evident in this body, by the Senate Finance \nCommittee voting out a bill on party-line votes, bringing it to the \nSenate, and finally coming to the determination that that partisan bill \ncould not pass. It is not because everything in it was wrong but just \nbecause partisan legislation does not get through this body. You have \nto have some bipartisanship in order for a product to successfully \nclear this body.\n  So we have now a further compromise. It is not the President's \nproposal. We have gone way beyond what the President wanted to do in \nsome of these areas. It does not have some of the baggage of a bill \nthat previously passed the House of Representatives had, such as, for \ninstance, the retroactive alternative minimum tax, where there is a lot \nof money just coming out of the Federal Treasury back to corporate \nAmerica. It has many of the things the Democrats wanted and many of the \nthings the Republicans wanted. But it is going down the same road now \nbecause it is bipartisan, bicameral, and it is coming to the Senate.\n  As to things such as accelerated depreciation, there are some changes \nin the alternative minimum tax that reflect the realities that \naccelerated depreciation will not work if there are not some changes in \nthe alternative minimum tax. It speeds up tax brackets for middle-\nincome taxpayers by reducing the 27 percent bracket down to 25 percent, \nand doing it January 1, 2002, instead of January 1, 2004, and January \n1, 2006.\n  We recognize the needs of stimulating the consumer demand by tax \nrebates to low-income Americans. We increase unemployment compensation \nby 13 weeks. We have, for the first time in 70 years, a very dramatic \nchange in the social policy of this country for unemployed people by \nproviding health insurance for unemployed people. That is welcomed by a \nlot of Republicans. And it ought to be welcomed by a lot of Democrats. \nSo I want to describe that.\n  I would also like to take an opportunity to clear up the record on \npress conferences that are being held by my friends in the Democrat \nleadership. Too often it is said, in a disinformation way, that what is \nreally holding this up is that Republicans do not want health benefits \nfor dislocated workers.\n  I think I have just now said, in this new policy--the first in 70 \nyears; the biggest social change in the policy for dislocated workers \nin 70 years--that we support this. It is part of this package. So why \nwould anyone say that Republicans do not care anything about health \nbenefits for dislocated workers?\n  The President proposed it early on--not in a way I thought was very \nworkable, but he proposed spending money on it. We have a package that \nhas $23 billion of such benefit in it. In fact, it is a package with $2 \nbillion less which helps more people than what some of the Democratic \nproposals would do.\n  So if you can help more people for less of the taxpayers' money, \nisn't that good? And isn't it good, too, that there is agreement that \nit needs to be done? I do not think it is fair for people in the \nDemocratic leadership to say Republicans are against helping with the \nhealth benefits for unemployed workers when it has been in every one of \nour plans and even the President was the first to propose it.\n  I think the bipartisan, bicameral provisions that are coming before \nthe House and Senate within the next 48 hours represent a genuine \ncompromise. Not only does it provide an unemployment insurance \nextension of 13 weeks, but it also has Reed Act transfers--more money--\nto the States for them to spend for enhancing their own----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the time \nallocated in morning business to the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am not sure I was aware of it or I would have asked \npermission to go beyond that because I know all the previous speakers \nspoke longer than 5 minutes and the gavel was never rapped. So if that \nis the case----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have no objection to the Senator continuing his speech. \nI am wondering how long he is likely to speak.\n  Will the Senator say roughly how long he is going to speak?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think now that I have spoken this long, I would say \nabout 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We give more money to the States if they want to \nimprove even more their unemployment benefits. We are giving a 60-\npercent tax credit for health care tax for unemployed workers, \nincluding people who can use it to extend COBRA insurance benefits.\n  States will have the ability to address problems such as part-time \nworkers. There is a modest proposal to accelerate income tax rate \nreductions in the 27-percent bracket.\n  I am sure there are a lot of Members of this body, particularly those \nwho voted against the bipartisan tax bill last spring, who are not \ngoing to want to speed up, from 27 percent to 25 percent, the reduction \nof that tax rate. Somehow there is an insinuation that if you do that, \nyou are helping the wealthy. I want my colleagues to remember that this \nbenefits a single taxpayer earning as little as $27,051 and going up to \n$65,000. And then, for a married couple, that would kick in at $45,201, \ngoing up to $109,000.\n  For people making $27,000, where this bracket starts, or for married \ncouples making $45,000, these are not rich people or rich families. \nWhat we are talking about is a 2-percentage-point tax cut for these \nfolks.\n  So is there anything wrong with a single person paying $770 less in \ntaxes or a married couple paying $1,281 less in taxes if they fall into \nthis income tax bracket that we would call middle income?\n\n[[Page S13678]]\n\n  It seems to me it is fair, but, most importantly, it is meant to be a \nstimulus. This is something that middle-of-the-road Democrats and \nRepublicans support. This is part of the original centrist package.\n  We also have a 30-percent bonus depreciation. That is something that \nwas in everybody's package, Republican or Democrat, House or Senate.\n  We have also a 5-year net operating loss carryback. That was not in \nthe President's package. That was not in the Senate Republican package. \nThat was in the Senate Democratic package.\n  On corporate alternative minimum tax, there is no repeal, no \nretroactivity, like was lambasted when it came out of the House that \nway. There is no corporate AMT repeal, retroactive or otherwise, in the \nWhite House-centrist package. There are some well thought out reforms \nthat cost about one-twentieth of what the House bill did on alternative \nminimum tax. That is a very major movement. That is why the centrists \nsupport this compromise.\n\n  The White House-centrist package extends expiring tax provisions by 2 \nyears.\n  Finally, the White House-centrist package includes bipartisan tax \nrelief proposals for victims of terrorism and business in New York \nCity. These are much needed, and they are urgent matters. I believe the \nSenators from New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut ought to find it \ninviting that these things are in there for their constituents and \nsupport this package.\n  Let's get the record straight. Let's have a good debate. Let the \nvotes fall where they may. I can't help but ask our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Daschle, to give the people what they want--a \nbipartisan economic stimulus bill with the largest aid going to \ndislocated workers in a generation.\n  It is clear that the people and the President don't want stalling, \ndon't want muddling, don't want delay and, most important in this state \nof war we are in, don't want partisanship.\n  I urge the Senate majority leader to do the right thing: End this \nsession by delivering a bipartisan priority. By doing it, we put the \npeople's business first. If I were the majority leader, I would not \nknow how to explain to the American people, as I returned home to the \nState of Iowa to enjoy the holiday season there with my family on the \nfarm at New Hartford, why millions of Americans are desperately waiting \nfor the Senate to pass an economic and job security bill that has been \nin this body for the last 2 months. If I were the majority leader, I \ndon't know how I would explain to the people of Iowa, how I could look \nmy constituents straight in the eye, and all of my taxpayers and all \nthe small business owners of Iowa, and explain, by not passing this \nbill, how I would choose politics ahead of people.\n  It is time to get the job done. There is still time to do it. If \npeople are allowed to vote their conscience and not have the \nrestriction of party, we can get the job done, I believe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13678-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I speak on what I came over to the \nfloor to discuss today, I would like to respond in 60 seconds to the \nSenator from Iowa.\n  I don't think the stimulus bill is about partisanship. The stimulus \nbill is about whether we are going to take care of workers and \ndisplaced people because of the economy or whether we are going to \nreward corporate entities that are not going to reinvest instantly in \nthe economy and stimulate the economy. How can we stimulate the economy \nif what we are going to be ``spending'' through either tax expenditures \nor direct expenditures doesn't spend out for 2 years or more?\n  This is about fairness. The stimulus package I have seen so far is \nnot remotely bipartisan and is in fact a serious mistake, based on what \nI know, unless there is some iteration in the last 12 hours of which I \nam unaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13678-5", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13678-S13679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAINTAIN OUR BALKAN COMMITMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to take issue with Secretary \nof Defense Rumsfeld's comments yesterday in Brussels, in which he \ncalled for reducing NATO forces in Bosnia by one-third by the end of \nnext year.\n  I find Secretary Rumsfeld's proposal both faulty in its logic, and \ndangerous in its implications.\n  Mr. Rumsfeld based his suggestion upon the allegation that the size \nof the NATO mission in Bosnia, known as SFOR, is ``putting an \nincreasing strain on both our forces and our resources when they face \ngrowing demands from critical missions in the war on terrorism.''\n  From this assertion, one might think that the United States and NATO \nhave massive numbers of troops in Bosnia. In fact, SFOR's strength is \nnow about 18,400 troops. The U.S. contingent is only 3,100.\n  According to the Pentagon's new Quadrennial Defense Review, we must \nbe able to ``swiftly defeat aggression in overlapping major conflicts \nwhile preserving the option of decisive victory, including regime \nchange or occupation and conduct a limited number of smaller-scale \ncontingency operations.''\n  By any calculation, therefore, we should have plenty of troops and \nmateriel to handle the smaller-scale operation in Bosnia and still meet \nour commitments elsewhere in the war on terrorism.\n  In short, Secretary Rumsfeld's argument that Bosnia is a serious \ndrain on our war-fighting capabilities simply doesn't wash.\n  I should also point out that we have already greatly reduced the size \nof the NATO-led operation in Bosnia. The current level of 18,400 troops \nis down from an original 60,000. The 3,100 Americans are down from an \noriginal 20,000.\n  Moreover, why should we quit a game in the fourth quarter when we're \nwinning? Bosnia and Herzegovina still has many problems, but even the \nharshest critic of our policy there must admit that significant \nprogress has been made since the Dayton Accords were signed six years \nago. For example, there non-nationalist, multi-ethnic coalitions now \ngovern both the Federation and the national parliaments. All of the \npolitical, economic, and social\n\n[[Page S13679]]\n\nprogress has been made possible by the umbrella of SFOR.\n  But the victory is not complete. In that context, I'm rather \nsurprised that Secretary Rumsfeld juxtaposed Bosnia with the war on \nterrorism, because al-Qaeda is known to have cells in Bosnia. The Saudi \nArabian who co-starred with Osama bin Laden in the grotesque video from \nAfghanistan, which nauseated the civilized world, had previously fought \nwith the mujahedin in Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, extirpating al-Qaeda from Bosnia is reason enough to \nkeep the three thousand American troops there.\n  I have been to Bosnia nearly every year since the outbreak of \nhostilities in 1992. I have talked with most of the leading politicians \nof all ethnic groups. I have visited the headquarters of the combined \nMuslim-Croat Federation Army outside Sarajevo and reviewed the troops \nthere. I have met with local officials from Banja Luka and Brcko in the \nnorth to Mostar in the south. No one, Mr. President, no one - - thinks \nthat the current peace and progress in Bosnia could survive a premature \nwithdrawal of NATO, especially American, troops.\n  Rather than setting an artificial date for withdrawal of NATO forces \nfrom Bosnia, we should concentrate on finishing the job, and then \nwithdraw victoriously.\n  Moreover, the United States is sending a totally confusing message to \nthe world, friends and foes alike. The same week that we reopen our \nembassy in Kabul, and James Dobbins, our envoy to Afghanistan, declares \nthat we are there to stay, we announce that we will leave Bosnia within \ntwelve months!\n  How seriously can Afghans take Mr. Dobbins' declaration? Can the \nAfghans possibly think that we will stay the course there when we won't \ndo it in the Balkans?\n  Or are we perhaps planning to transfer some American troops from \nBosnia to peacekeeping duty in Afghanistan? I don't think so. Secretary \nRumsfeld and others in the Administration frequently declare that \npeacekeeping duty is a poor use of the American military.\n  Unfortunately, however, the Administration's mantra runs afoul of the \nso-called Strategic Concept, the document which guides overall NATO \nstrategy. The Strategic Concept lists ethnic and religious conflicts \nlike Bosnia among the greatest threats to the Alliance.\n  If we're going to opt out of NATO peace enforcing missions, and we're \ngoing to exclude NATO from our anti-terrorist military campaigns as we \nhave done in Afghanistan, then what does that tell our allies about our \ncommitment to NATO? I suppose we'll agree to keep an American general \nas Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n  Unfortunately, Secretary Rumsfeld's arbitrary deadline-setting in \nBosnia fits right into the Administration's announcement that we will \nwithdraw unilaterally from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with \nRussia, a decision whose folly I criticized on this floor less than a \nweek ago.\n  This administration's foreign and defense policy is driven by \nideology, not by a realistic threat assessment. A stable Europe is the \nprecondition for our pursuing terrorists in Central Asia, the Far East, \nor the Middle East. Since we continue to preach ``in together, out \ntogether'' in the Balkans, what will we do if our European NATO \npartners point out twelve months from now--as is likely to be the \ncase--that there is still need for SFOR to remain in Bosnia?\n  In that case the administration's theory will collide with the hard \nfacts of reality. Whether reality or ideology will win out will be more \nthan an academic question. The future, both of the Balkans, and of \nNATO, may depend on the answer.\n  The American people should recognize the risky gamble that Mr. \nRumsfeld's rigid ideology asks us to embark upon.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to comment to the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee about how much I appreciate \nhis leadership, how much of a privilege it has been for me to be a \nmember of that committee, along with the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, another leader of the committee, and how much you have \ntaught me and how much you have encouraged me.\n  With that background, I am going to Afghanistan on January 3, and I \nam really looking forward to bringing back a report to the committee \nthat might be of value as we discuss the future of the coalition, \nkeeping it together, of all of those countries in the region that we \nwill visit, as well as for the future of Afghanistan.\n  I commend the chairman of the committee for how he has been so \nsteadfast in his insistence for the role of women in the new Government \nof Afghanistan. Afghanistan has a history of having very prominent \nwomen in the professions. Of course, all that disappeared with the \nTaliban. It is time to reassert the rights of women and, particularly, \nin our case, to insist on that as they form the government. It is with \na great deal of appreciation I say to my chairman and to the chairman \nof the subcommittee how much I thank them for their leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13679-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13679-S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly on \nthe subject of terrorism insurance because in the closing couple of \ndays of this session, there is some question as to whether or not we \nwill even get a bill. I want to say if we don't, that is a mistake. It \nis a mistake because to do nothing would leave us in the condition that \nwe are in now, where so many of the businesses and homeowners and \nautomobile owners of America would be in a position of not knowing if \nthey are covered by terrorism or not because a number of companies have \nalready filed with the insurance commissioners of the 50 States, \nwithdrawing terrorism as a risk that would be covered.\n  The flip side of that is where terrorism may be covered, and with no \nplan, the opportunity is ripe for the rates to go up considerably. \nTake, for example, the issue of Giant Stadium in the Meadowlands. I am \ntold that they have upwards of a 400-percent to 500-percent increase in \nthe rates. Is that a fair rate? Only the insurance commissioners of the \n50 States would know, but an insurance commissioner has to determine if \na rate is fair by looking at data and looking at experience.\n  In this particular case, we have precious little data or experience. \nTherefore, the insurance departments of the 50 States are simply not \ngoing to know or, even if they thought a rate was excessive and \narbitrary, they are not going to be able to deny the rate because they \ncan only deny it if they went into court and proved to a judge in an \nadministrative law court, or in a court of law, that it was excessive. \nBut they don't have those tools.\n  So what should we do? Well, let me say as a backup, if all else \nfails, and I hope it doesn't--and I am talking to the Senator from \nConnecticut, who is a leader; I want to talk about his bill--instead of \nus doing nothing, we ought to take a period of time and pass a bill \nthat would say that the Federal Government will treat this as an act of \nwar for this short period of time, and assuming the terrorism risk for \ninsurance purposes, that there would be no rate hikes and there would \nbe the guaranteed terrorism coverage on all the insurance policies--in \nother words, a moratorium on the cancellations that are going on right \nnow on terrorism coverage, and a rate freeze on the rates that are \npresently being jacked up sky high in many cases.\n  That is what I would suggest that the Congress consider as a backup, \nbut we should not have to get to the backup.\n  I want to talk to the Senator from Connecticut and the rest of the \nSenate to say that if we took a vehicle such as the Dodd-Sarbanes \nbill--it could be that or it could be the Fritz-Hollings approach but \nan approach that blends the risk being shared by insurance companies \nfor the lower amounts, generally in a range of about up to $10 billion \nof losses from a terrorist event, and above that the Federal Government \nwould share in an 80-20 or 90-10 arrangement, depending on the size of \nthe terrorism loss.\n  All of these bills have similarities. But what I would urge, and will \nurge if such a vehicle comes before the Senate by the offering of this \namendment, is that there be a limitation on the\n\n[[Page S13680]]\n\namount that the rates can be raised for terrorist insurance risk \npurposes and that part of the premium that would go to the terrorist \nrisk would be set aside in the insurance company for accounting \npurposes from the rest of the premium so that we would know how much \nwould be there, and if there were no terrorist loss, that could \ncontinue to be set aside for a catastrophe, which would include the \nterrorist loss. And--this is the part I am not sure those sponsors of \nthe bill understand--even though I want to limit the rate increase, \nbecause I, indeed, think the rates are being raised using the September \n11 horrible tragedy as an excuse to jack up the rates, nevertheless we \nhave a responsibility to act, and we could limit those rate increases \nand, in the case that another terrorist event occurs and the loss were \nto occur, there is a portion of my bill on page 2 that would then have \na surcharge on the policyholders up to the amount of the loss. That \nsurcharge would be approved by the insurance departments of the 50 \nStates.\n  In other words, since we would segregate the premium as allocated to \nthe terrorist risk, and that limitation of the rates would be a 3-\npercent increase only, but if there were a terrorist event that \nexceeded an industry-wide--we are talking about $6 billion of premium--\nthen the surcharge would kick in. That is the part that I do not think \nthose sponsors understand. They know I am a former insurance \ncommissioner and I am quite concerned about rates being jacked through \nthe roof and the consumer taking it on the chin, and that is why I \nwanted to come to the Chamber to speak. That is why I am so \nappreciative that the Senator from Connecticut is here.\n  I just got off the phone with the general counsel of State Farm, \nsomeone whose advice I valued over the 6 years I was insurance \ncommissioner prior to coming to the Senate. I will be talking to \nseveral other CEOs and general counsel. This is, in part, what we have \nbeen talking about all along, and it is not something that insurance \ncompanies should think is an anathema to their position.\n  What is an anathema to their position is for them to gouge the \npublic, the consumers, because it sets a limitation on the rates, but \nit is a fair way of approaching it. Clearly, at the end of the day, it \nis a way of protecting the businesses of America, the homeowners of \nAmerica, and the automobile owners of America who, if we do nothing, \nare facing the prospect that insurance companies have withdrawn their \ncoverage for a terrorist attack.\n  I thank the President for the opportunity to speak on this very \nimportant subject that is so important particularly at the eleventh \nhour of this session of Congress.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senators were advised by the Foreign \nRelations Committee through a hotline of the desire of the Senate to \nact on H.R. 3167. I have objected, and will continue to object, to the \nSenate considering this bill. It is a very significant bill, and I felt \nobligated to come to the Chamber and state to the Senate exactly why I \nobject at this time in the few hours remaining in this session--I say a \nfew hours, tonight and tomorrow--to proceeding to consider such an \nimportant document as this.\n  The document is an affirmation of a policy statement by President \nGeorge W. Bush who said as follows on June 15, 2001, in a speech in \nWarsaw, Poland:\n\n       All of Europe's new democracies from the Baltic to the \n     Black Sea and all that lie between should have the same \n     chance for security and freedom and the same chance to join \n     the institutions of Europe as Europe's old democracies have. \n     I believe in NATO membership for all of Europe's democracies \n     that seek it and are ready to share the responsibility that \n     NATO brings.\n\n  Basically, I share the President's view on that, but this particular \ndocument goes on and cites the following. It says:\n\n       Declarations of Policy by the Congress of the United \n     States.\n       1. Reaffirms its previous expressions of support for \n     continued enlargement of NATO alliance contained in the NATO \n     Participation Act of 1994, the NATO Enlargement Facilitation \n     Act of 1996, and the European Security Act of 1998.\n       2. Supports the commitment to further enlargement of the \n     NATO Alliance expressed by the Alliance in its Madrid \n     Declaration of 1997 and its Washington Summit Communique of \n     1999.\n       3. --\n\n  And this perhaps is the more significant declaration of policy.\n\n       The Congress endorses the vision of further enlargement of \n     the NATO Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on \n     June 15--\n\n  That was the statement I just read--\n\n       and by former President William J. Clinton on October 22, \n     1996, and urges our NATO allies to work with the United \n     States to realize its vision of the Prague Summit of 2002.\n\n  My views are as follows. I think NATO--and I think every Member of \nthis body shares this with me--has done a magnificent job for over a \nhalf century. It is perhaps the strongest and most effective alliance \nand accord in terms of security that this Nation has ever entered into.\n  Last year we had a very significant debate, and that is my basic \nproblem; there is no urgency for this. This Chamber should resonate \nagain with a strong debate on future membership in our NATO.\n  We had several days of debate last year. I put forward an amendment \nlimiting the number of nations.\n  My concern is there are nine nations referred to in this particular \ndocument, all seeking NATO membership. That would be 9 plus 19, which \nwould come to 28. The debate was in 1998. That is a very significant \nincrease.\n  This document does not proclaim each is going to be admitted, but it \ngives a strong inference and overtone that could come to pass. As a \nmatter of fact, it is authorization to the effect that certain sums of \nmoney--and I support each and every one of these authorizations for \nfunds going to the nations to enable them to continue their efforts to \nincrease their military, to strengthen that military, to enable that \nmilitary to become an important part of the overall military collection \nof the NATO countries.\n  Before we speak to all nine indirectly and subscribe in whole to the \nPresident's policy, this body has a responsibility to examine each \nnation, to have a formalization from the administration and others as \nto which of those nations should be considered for inclusion in NATO, \npresumably in 2002. I see no urgency that we should proceed on a UC, \nwithout any Members except myself so far rising to address this.\n  I respect the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He was in \nthe Chamber, which prompted me to speak, hoping I could engage him.\n  The distinguished ranking member has communicated his desire to have \nthis passed. I respect both of those fine Senators, but I think this \ndeserves very careful consideration. We had hearings in the Foreign \nRelations Committee in 1998 regarding those members that desired to \njoin. We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee, on which I am \nprivileged to serve. I certainly encourage my chairman, Senator Levin, \nto have hearings on any thought with regard to increasing the size of \nNATO and specifically looking at those nations and providing our \ndetermination, as the committee, to the Senate as to the contribution \nthey wish to make and the verification of the capabilities to make that \ncontribution, both militarily and politically.\n  By the way, these authorizations are contained in the foreign \noperations bill such that they can go forward. It will not impede the \ndistribution of these funds.\n  From time to time, Members put holds on matters. I take that \nobligation very seriously and come to state with some precision exactly \nwhy I take that step and will continue to do so for the balance of this \nsession of the Congress, namely that it deserves the full attention of \nthe Senate, preceded by a debate in the chamber with consideration by \nthe two committees that have specific oversight of these matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13680-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Brady Center to Prevent Gun \nViolence issued a very important report on ``Guns and Terror,'' and \nthey pointed out the link between terrorist activity and our lax gun \nlaw in the United States. It is a compelling report that should urge us \nto action. We have seen throughout the last few weeks newspaper reports \nindicating terrorists are exploiting our lax gun laws, particularly \nwhen it comes to gun shows.\n  When Attorney General Ashcroft testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on December 6, he held up an al-Qaida manual and talked about \nhow terrorists are instructed to use America's freedom as a weapon \nagainst us, and he talked about the way they are urged to lie to \ndeceive our law enforcement authorities.\n  He neglected to point something else out. These terrorists have been \ntrained to exploit our gun laws. A few weeks ago, I mentioned a \nterrorist manual was seized in Kabul in which these jihad trainees were \nurged to obtain an assault rifle legally, enroll in American gun clubs \nto take courses in sniping, general shooting, and other rifle courses. \nWe have to understand if this is their playbook, using gun shows is one \nof their plays and we have to stop this loophole.\n  I introduced legislation last year based upon the Lautenberg \nlegislation this Senate passed. I hoped we could bring this legislation \nto the Senate very quickly, and we could move to close this gun show \nloophole, that we could apply the Brady law to every purchase at a gun \nshow, that we could ensure there is a full-time period for law \nenforcement to evaluate, up to 3 days, the purchase.\n  These things are necessary. I think it would be a mistake to delay \nfurther, and I think also it would be a mistake to take and embrace a \nweaker version of the law when we have already passed a corrected bill \nthat can make huge progress in closing off this loophole.\n  We already know individuals on behalf of Hezbollah have used gun \nshows, that individuals on behalf of the Irish Republican Army have \nused gun shows, that American militia movements have used gun shows. \nThey do that because they know they can go to the shows, find \nunlicensed dealers and avoid any type of Brady background check. So I \nhope we could move very promptly in the next session to close this \nloophole.\n  There are 22 cosponsors of my legislation. It is a bill we have \nalready passed in the Senate. It is something I believe is long overdue \nand I hope indeed we can do it to ensure terrorists do not exploit our \nlaws to do damage to our country and to our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The major majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island for his comments now and for the leadership he has \nshown on this issue now for several years. Our caucus and the Senate \nowe him a debt of gratitude for the job he has done in sensitizing us \nto the importance of this legislation and our efforts to address this \nissue.\n  As the Senator noted, this legislation has a very favorable history. \nSenator Lautenberg, our former colleague from New Jersey, has also \nworked with the Senator from Rhode Island to pass this legislation at \nsome point in the past, and because it has such overwhelming support I \nam confident this Senate can pass it as well.\n  The Senator has talked to me on several occasions about the \nimportance of taking this legislation up this session. It is \nregrettable at least to date we have not had the opportunity to do \nthat. I share the Senator's expressions of urgency with regard to the \nconsideration of this legislation, and as I committed to him privately \nI will commit as well publicly that we will take this legislation to \nthe Senate, hopefully early in the session next year.\n  There is no reason why we cannot complete our work. There is no \nreason why the Senate cannot go on record again, as it has before in \npassing this bill, and send a clear message, at least when it comes to \nthe gun show loophole, that we can take steps to protect ourselves and \nprotect this population, and find ways in which to do it in a \nreasonable way. That is what the Senator is asking.\n  Again, as I say, I thank him for his leadership, his commitment, and \nI will work with him to assure this legislation can be taken up \nsuccessfully sometime next year.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the majority leader for his kind comments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13681-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13681-S13687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is after 6 p.m. in the evening and I \nsuspect that many normal people are sitting down having dinner, \nenjoying a quiet moment with their families. I hope in fact that many \nof our colleagues are doing that since there are no longer any votes \nthis evening. We are about to make an announcement, my colleague and \nfriend from Kentucky, and, if he can make it, our colleague from \nMissouri, along with my friends from New York and New Jersey and others \nwho have joined us in crafting an election reform compromise.\n  Mr. President, the Chamber may be sparse in participation at this \nlate hour and it may be after working hours for most, but may I suggest \nwhat we are about to introduce is ``landmark'' legislation. It will \nhave been 36 years, I think, since the last time this body dealt with \nthe issue of voting rights from a Federal perspective. The Voting \nRights Act was the last major civil rights legislation dealing with the \nvoting rights of the American public.\n  I begin these remarks by, first of all, expressing my deep gratitude \nto my friend from Kentucky who has been my chairman on the Rules \nCommittee, and is now my ranking member on the Rules Committee, for his \nefforts, and those of his staff and others over these many weeks in \nputting this proposal together which we now offer to our colleagues as \na bipartisan compromise. Our hope is that on our return, at some early \ndate--and again, we will ask leadership for advice and counsel--we \nmight bring this matter before the Senate when we return to the second \nsession of Congress to adopt this election reform proposal.\n  Everyone is aware of what the world was like a year ago when the \nmajor story was not about Afghanistan and terrorism but about the \ncondition of the election system in the country, particularly the \nevents surrounding the Presidential race. I am not here today to talk \nabout what happened. What happened last year was not an occurrence in \none State or one election but a wake-up call for everyone about the \ndeteriorating condition of our election system across the country. This \ndoes not happen on one night, in one State, in one election. There has \nbeen a lot spoken about that race, those particular events.\n  We have tried with this bill to look forward and not look back as to \nhow we can respond to this in a responsible way so we may live up to \nour historic obligations in this Chamber to see to it that the rights \nof all Americans--specifically, the most fundamental of rights, the \nright to vote--is protected and the votes are counted.\n  Thomas Paine said very appropriately more than 200 years ago that the \nright to vote is ``the primary right by which other rights are \nprotected.''\n  It is about as basic a statement and basic a right as we can \nidentify.\n  The very credibility of every other action we take as a people, not \nto mention as a Congress, but as a people, in this Chamber and \nelsewhere, depends upon the American people's belief in the integrity \nof the election system which puts everyone in these seats as well as \nthe seats occupied in every office, from the lowest political body in \nthe country to the most exalted in the Presidency of the United States.\n  This bipartisan compromise we introduce today is not a condemnation \nof the past at all but rather a reflection of the promise of the \nfuture. The problems faced by voters across the Nation last November \nserved, as I said a moment ago, as a wake-up call that our system of \nFederal elections was in serious need of reform and help. That is what \nwe tried to do with this bill.\n  This is landmark legislation. Our task is to provide the necessary \nFederal leadership and resources to assist State and local officials \nwithout in any way usurping their historic responsibility to administer \nFederal elections.\n\n[[Page S13682]]\n\n This bipartisan compromise reflects the necessary balance between the \nFederal interests in assuring the integrity of Federal elections and \nthe authority of State and local officials to determine the best means \nby which to conduct those very elections.\n  I am very grateful to my colleagues for their considerable \ncontributions to this compromise. I thank the ranking member of the \nRules Committee, Senator McConnell, for his leadership, for his \nperseverance on this issue, and for his very significant contributions \nwhich I will identify shortly. Senator Schumer of New York, a member of \nthe Rules Committee, has been active working on election reform since \nthe beginning of this Congress when he became interested in the subject \nmatter. My good friend from the State of Missouri, Senator Bond, early \non recognized the need for Federal leadership in this area, \nparticularly the need for Federal antifraud standards. And Senator \nRobert Torricelli, along with Senator McConnell, introduced one of the \nvery first election reform measures in the Senate following the \nelections of last year. There are many others involved in the debates \nand discussion, but those are the principals who have worked the \nhardest to craft this package and to present it to this Chamber.\n\n  I acknowledge the tireless work of my coauthor in the House, \nCongressman John Conyers, the dean of the Congressional Black Caucus. \nThroughout this long year of hearings, debate, and negotiation, he has \nbeen a friend and a stalwart believer in the responsibility of the \nFederal Government to ensure that every eligible American has an equal \nopportunity to vote and to have their votes counted. This compromise \nowes much to his vision and dedication to producing a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  Simply put, this bipartisan compromise makes it easier for every \neligible American to vote and to have their vote counted while ensuring \nthat protections are in place to prevent fraud. As my colleague and \nfriend from Missouri has said so succinctly, it ought to be easy to \nvote in America and it ought to be very hard to cheat. We think we have \nstruck that balance. We do not claim perfection, but we believe we put \ntogether the provisions which will certainly advance the measure of \nboth goals: to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat in this system \nand thus devalue the legitimate vote of those who honestly go about the \nbusiness of counting ballots.\n  The bipartisan substitute we introduce today represents a strong \nresponse to the first civil rights challenge, in our view, of the 21st \ncentury and protects the voting rights of every eligible American, \nregardless of the individual's race, ethnicity, disability, English \nproficiency, or the level of financial resources available to the \ncommunity in which he or she lives and votes.\n  This compromise preserves the fundamental philosophy of the original \nbill: The Federal Government must set minimum standards for the conduct \nof Federal elections. We have expanded the original standards to \ninclude minimum requirements to defer fraud and have created a new \nElection Administration Commission to assure that, going forward, \nexpertise and assistance will be available to the States and localities \nto meet these minimum standards.\n  Specifically, this compromise sets the following three minimum \nstandards for Federal elections: Beginning in the year 2006, election \nsystems must meet voting system standards providing for acceptable \nerror rates, and provide notification for voters who overvote, while \nensuring such systems are accessible to every blind and disabled \nperson, and to language minorities, in a manner that ensures a private \nand independent vote.\n  Second, beginning in the year 2004, States must have in place \nprovisional balloting systems so that no registered voter in America \ncan ever be turned away from the polls without the opportunity to cast \ntheir ballot.\n  Third, States must establish a statewide computer voter registration \nlist, and beginning next year, provide for verification for voters who \nregister by mail in order to prevent fraudulent voting.\n  Those are minimum standards. They do not require a one-size-fits-all \napproach to Federal elections, nor do they require that any particular \nvoting system be used or discarded, for that matter. Instead, the \nminimum standards ensure that every voting system--be it electronic \nmachines or paper ballots--meet certain basic standards. And we \nexplicitly guarantee to every State the ability to meet these standards \nin a way that best serves the unique needs of their communities.\n\n  Most importantly, this bipartisan compromise provides the funds to \nhelp States meet these requirements. For the first time, the Federal \nGovernment will contribute its fair share to the cost of administering \nelections for Federal office. That, in and of itself, is a historic \nchange.\n  The compromise authorizes a total of $3.5 billion over 5 years \ntowards this end. A total of $3 billion is authorized to fund the \nminimum standards, and an additional $400 million is authorized in \nfiscal year 2002 for incentive grants to allow States to immediately \nmove forward to implement election improvements, particularly in the \nantifraud area.\n  There is $100 million in fiscal year 2002 provided for grants to make \npolling places physically accessible to those with disabilities. Never \nagain should our fellow Americans who are blind or wheelchair bound \nhave to suffer the indignities of being lifted into polling places or \nheld at a curbside waiting for an accessible machine.\n  This significant commitment of resources underscores the fact that \nnothing in this bill establishes an unfunded mandate on States or \nlocalities. To the contrary, this compromise reflects a commitment on \nthe part of Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber to provide not \nonly the leadership but the resources at the Federal level to ensure \nthe integrity of our Federal elections.\n  The Senate majority leader, Senator Daschle, has publicly committed \nto bringing S. 565, the Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act to the \nfloor early next year, at which time this bipartisan compromise will be \noffered as a substitute.\n  I encourage my colleagues and the leader to make this bill one of the \nfirst measures--maybe the first measure--in the second session of the \n107th Congress. I can think of no better way to begin the second \nsession of this historic Congress than with a bipartisan measure whose \nsole purpose is to ensure the integrity of our system of Federal \nelections and the continued vitality of our democracy.\n  In the midst of all that has happened since September 11, I couldn't \nthink of a better way to begin the new year than to work together in \nthe Chamber to do something so critically fundamental to the success \nand soundness of our Nation.\n  I thank, again, my cosponsors--Senator McConnell, specifically for \nhis crafting of the commission concept, which I think is a wonderful \nidea, so we will have a permanent venue to begin to deal with these \nissues. I am sure he will explain in greater detail how this commission \nworks. But without his contribution we might have only ended up with a \ntemporary commission that would have gone out of existence in a short \nperiod of time and allowed, once again, the system to deteriorate.\n  There is no guarantee it will not. But with a commission in place, we \nwill be in a much stronger position over the years to respond to these \nissues on a continuing basis.\n  I thank Senator Bond. His contribution was to the fraud area. Without \nhim coming to the table and adding that element here, we might have \nleft that out. It is a serious issue, one that deserves consideration. \nHe has crafted some very sound provisions in this bill which add a very \nimportant leg to this.\n  With what I have talked about in the area of disabilities and \nprovisional voting in addition to our requirement of statewide voter \nregistration, these minimum standards, the broad provisions and the \ncommission, we have not solved every problem at all. We are not dealing \nwith every single issue that comes up. But that is one of the reasons \nwhy the commission can make a significant contribution.\n  I want to thank specifically our staff: Tam Sommerville and Brian \nLewis of Senator McConnell's Rule Committee staff; Julie Dammann and \nJack Bartling of Senator Bond's office; Sharon Levin and Polly \nTrottenberg of Senator Schumer's office; Sarah Wills and Jennifer Leach \nof Senator Torricelli's office; and, in my office,\n\n[[Page S13683]]\n\nKennie Gill, Veronica Gillesie, and Stacy Beck, along with Shawn Maher \nand others, for helping put this together.\n  I look forward, in the early part of the year, to debate and \ndiscussion on the subject matter.\n  Again, I appreciate the wonderful work of my colleagues.\n  It has been a long road but we think we have produced a very good \npiece of legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues when \nwe return.\n  I see the distinguished leader. I know he probably has other \nobligations. My colleague from Kentucky is here, but if the leader \nwould care to make a comment on this, we welcome it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I congratulate the \ndistinguished Senators from Connecticut, Kentucky, and Missouri for \ntheir extraordinary work in this regard. I would not have bet we could \nhave gotten to this point when the effort began many, many months ago.\n  There was a great deal of concern for how the last election was \nconducted--on both sides. Given the acrimony and difficulty in reaching \neven some consensus about how to approach this issue, I knew the odds \nwere long. But these leaders overcame the odds. They articulated a \nvision for how this country ought to perform in every election and \nworked together, in spite of these difficulties, and have achieved a \nresult that I think is extraordinary.\n  I do not think the Senator from Connecticut is far off when he talks \nabout this being landmark legislation. Indeed, if it can incorporate \nthe opportunities for millions of voters who have been disenfranchised, \nit will be landmark legislation. If we can deal with the fraud that has \nexisted on occasion in elections in the past, it will be landmark \nlegislation.\n  I cannot think of any higher priority. I cannot think of anything for \nwhich there is greater cause for excitement than the opportunity to \naddress this issue in the comprehensive and very commendable way the \nSenators from Connecticut and Kentucky have.\n  I commit to work with the two Senators to find a time very early in \nthe next session of Congress where we can take this bill up on a \nbipartisan basis, and maybe even set the tone that could be taken into \nother legislation as well. I think that would be conducive to bringing \nabout the kind of result we would like as we begin all of our work in \nthe next session. I will work with them. I will commit to them that we \nwill find the time in the schedule to ensure that this legislation can \nbe considered early.\n  I, again, congratulate both Senators for the extraordinary job they \nhave done getting us to this point tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for his kind comments about the work of the three of us here, \nand others, on this important piece of legislation. We are grateful \nthat he thinks he will be able to schedule this debate sometime early \nnext year.\n  Rarely do you get the feeling around here that you are involved in \nsomething that is truly unique and has the potential, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut indicated, to be a landmark piece of legislation. We \nare all working on issues that are important to somebody in the country \nall the time. But nothing is more fundamental, obviously, than the \nright to vote.\n  I say at the outset to my friend from Connecticut, it has been a \npleasure working with him. And to my colleague from Missouri, he has \nbeen a joy to work with.\n  We had three areas about which we cared a great deal. Senator Dodd is \na passionate advocate for the disability community and for reducing, to \nthe maximum extent possible at the Federal level, any barrier to the \nability to vote. They may not be intentional, but as a practical \nmatter, barriers still exist. Senator Dodd, as we worked through these \n13 long months of negotiations, was always looking for a way to \nstrengthen that part of the bill. If there is any hero in America to \nthe disability community, it ought to be the Senator from Connecticut. \nOn this legislation, he was constantly trying to strengthen it to the \nbenefit of that community. I will be happy to testify on his behalf at \nany time that that was his focus.\n  The Senator from Missouri was relentless in pursuing the notion that \nwe should, to the maximum extent possible at the Federal level, make it \ndifficult to cheat. It has been a tradition in some parts of the \ncountry, including a number of counties in my State, that death not be \na permanent disability to continuing to exercise the franchise. I think \nthat practice is disapproved of by all ethical people, but it does go \non.\n  Senator Bond was relentless in pursuing whatever avenues he could \npursue to make it possible for this bill to deal with the business of \ncheating. We want everybody to vote, but only once. It is important \nthat they still be alive when they exercise the franchise. If we were \ndedicating the various parts of the bill, the fraud part of the bill \nshould be dedicated to the senior Senator from Missouri.\n  I was interested in the entity, the commission, that would oversee \nthis subject matter down through the years. As the distinguished \nchairman of our committee indicated, it was my feeling, and I am \npleased Senator Dodd and Senator Bond agreed, that there be a permanent \nrepository for the best, unbiased, objective evidence States and \ncommunities across America could go to for advice about their needs in \nconducting elections.\n  Right now the typical county official, or in some States the State \nofficial, is besieged by a hoard of vendors who want to sell their \nproduct. Where can you get objective advice about what might make sense \nfor a sparsely populated State such as North Dakota versus a teeming \nmass in the city of New York? This new commission will hopefully be \nthat place.\n  With this new commission, there will be no equipment to sell. It will \nbe a place where you can get the best advice currently available in \nAmerica about your particular election needs.\n  We structured this commission in such a way that it would operate on \na bipartisan basis. I believe it is the case that in every precinct in \nAmerica there is an equal number of Republicans and Democrats in that \nprecinct who conduct the election, usually in a friendly manner. They \nkeep an eye on each other. They insist that the business of \nadministration of elections be fairly done. Occasionally the system \nmalfunctions. But fairness is certainly the intent of the structure in \nevery State in America.\n  The question of just how much the Federal Government should do in \nthis regard is complicated. None of us wants to dictate a voting system \nfrom Washington to the rest of America. On the other hand, we \ncollectively agreed that there ought to be some standards below which \nyou would not be allowed to fall. If we did that, we were convinced we \ncould improve the administration of elections in this country.\n  It was a long, tortuous process. We had 13 months of hearings, \nnegotiations, compromises, offers, counter-offers, a bill, a compromise \nbill, a deal, and a new deal. By the time we finally were able to iron \nthis out, I think we had about all the deliberations we could handle. \nOn the other hand, it was a classic example, it seems to me, of the \nlegislative process working as it should, because what we all have in \ncommon is the desire to do this job on a truly bipartisan basis.\n  What brought us together at the end was the common belief that \nAmerica would be better off if we did this. None of us was trying to \nrig the system to the benefit of either side. I wasn't trying to make \nit easier for Republicans to win. Senator Bond wasn't either. Senators \nDodd, Schumer and Torricelli were not trying to make it easier for the \nDemocrats to win. We were genuinely motivated by the desire to help, to \nthe maximum extent possible at the Federal level, make the system \nbetter. And in doing that, for this to mean anything, there had to be \nsome funds attached to it. We realized we needed to be able to spend \nsome money in order to allow these communities to upgrade their \nsystems.\n  We are here tonight knowing this is only the beginning and there is \nstill a long road ahead of us. Even though the House has acted, we have \nto get this through the Senate and then through the conference.\n  I have a belief, which I think my colleagues share, that a lot of the \nhurdles we could have encountered on the floor we have already \nencountered, thought\n\n[[Page S13684]]\n\nthrough, and worked out. Hopefully, we can convince our colleagues when \nwe get out here on the floor, where it is always potentially a free-\nfor-all, that there is some rational basis for the decisions we \nreached. And on amendments which may unravel it, hopefully we can make \na bipartisan argument that we have been there, we have talked about \nthat, and we have worked our way through that and we can say this is \nwhy we think that is not a good idea and why we believe what we came \nout with is a superior position.\n  They may or may not take our advice. But at least we have spent a lot \nof time going into these uncharted waters wrestling with these issues \nand working them out.\n  As Senator Dodd, the chairman of our committee, pointed out, there \nare not many people still around tonight. But we feel good about this. \nWe thought we would share it with the Senate. We are pleased to be able \nto introduce this legislation today with a sense of real pride of \naccomplishment. We look forward to not only getting it through the \nSenate early next year, as the majority leader indicated, but getting \nit through the conference, getting it on the President's desk, and \nmaking a difference for America in the most basic thing we do--cast our \nvotes.\n  The Senate is commonly known as the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. After 13 months of hearings, negotiations, compromises, offers, \ncounter- \noffers, bills compromise bills, deals, and new deals, I think I speak \nfor all of us by saying: we have had about all of the deliberation we \ncan handle on one issue.\n  Today's bill introduction is the result of 13 months of work and \ncountless hours of negotiations.\n  Senator Dodd and I began discussions about election reform at the \nRules Committee more than one year ago.\n  Exactly one year ago last week, I introduced an election reform bill \nwith Senator Torricelli.\n  Last winter, Senator Dodd and I began a series of hearings on \nelection reform.\n  Last May, I introduced a new bill with Senator Schumer and Senator \nTorricelli--that garnered strong bipartisan support with 71 Senator \ncosponsors. Although many in the press seem to have forgotten--We were \nfully prepared to go to the Senate floor and pass that bill last June--\nbut were sidetracked on the way to the Senate floor with a little thing \nwe'll simply call Senate reorganization.\n  The agreement we announced last week incorporates three key \nprinciples that I have been promoting since the original McConnell-\nTorricelli bill last year.\n  Those principles are:\n  No. 1, respect for the primary role of States and localities in \nelection administration;\n  No. 2, establishment of an independent, bipartisan commission \nappointed by the President to provide nonpartisan election assistance \nto the states; and\n  No. 3, strong antifraud provisions to cleanup voter rolls and reduce \nfraud. No longer will we have dogs, cats, and dead people registering \nand voting by mail.\n  On this last point, I want to tip my hat to Senator Bond, who has \nbeen a tireless champion and advocate for strong anti-fraud provisions. \nHis work on this issue has been instrumental in achieving today's \nagreement.\n  Today's bill is a classic example of compromise. None of us got \neverything we asked for, but all of us got what we wanted: a bipartisan \nbill to dramatically increase the resources for and improve the process \nof conducting elections in America.\n  My goal throughout this process has been to ensure that everyone who \nis legally entitled to vote is able to do so, and that everyone who \ndoes vote is legally entitled to do so--and does so only once.\n  I believe today's agreement will help us achieve this goal.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his unending and sometimes unrelenting \ndevotion to this issue. I would also like to thank Senators Schumer, \nBond, and Torricelli for their hard work and significant contributions \nto this legislation.\n  I thank the staffs of my colleagues who worked tirelessly on this \neffort over the past months. Specifically Kennie Gill and Veronica \nGillespies of Senator Dodd's staff, Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of \nSenator Bond's staff; Sharon Levin of Senator Schumer's staff; Sarah \nWills and Jennifer Leach of Senator Torricelli's staff; and Tamara \nSomerville, Brian Lewis, and Leon Sequeira of my staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut and the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. \nThese Senators are experts in laws of elections. Having both served as \nchairman of the Rules Committee, they are well known as experts in this \nfield. I appreciate their permitting me to join them as we work to \ncraft what I think has rightly been described as a very important piece \nof legislation.\n  We are in this joyous holiday season. We hope we have delivered a \npackage that is not only wrapped nicely but contains provisions that \nwill be of significance and a significant improvement in our election \nsystem.\n  As has been said already, truly, voting in elections is the heart of \nour democracy. If you do not do it, if you exclude some people, and \nsome people do not do it right, then our entire system suffers. One of \nthe great freedoms we enjoy in this country is the freedom to have \nevery qualified person vote.\n  As Senator Dodd has pointed out, even if a person has certain \ndisabilities, we ought to make it easier for that person to vote. \nPeople ought not be denied a right to vote where they are otherwise \nqualified if they are poor or in places where in the past they have not \nhad adequate opportunity.\n  Senator Dodd started to work on this process of reforming elections \nto make it easier to vote. I had some experiences that suggested to me \nwe ought to add a second part to that; that is, make it easier to vote \nbut tough to cheat. I think both sides of that equation are important \nif we are to assure the fullest and fairest participation in our \nelectoral system. I think this compromise achieves that.\n  We need to make it easier to vote. For those who have been confused \nby machines or confounded by lack of phone lines to get questions \nanswered, this proposal says we should let the voter know if he or she \nhas made a mistake. If the system has made a mistake, then we set up a \nnew system to give that voter an opportunity to cast the ballot which \ncan be counted after the voter is identified as being a legitimate \nvoter.\n  As has always been mentioned, we don't try to throw out any \nparticular system. We don't say that ``one size fits all'' and \nWashington is going to tell every local election official that this is \nthe kind of system you have to use.\n  Some 23 different States, I believe, use at least in part paper \nballots. In some areas that is how they vote. In my hometown we vote by \npunch cards. I do not know when anybody has challenged the balloting \nthere as having problems. Voter election officials might say check your \ncard to make sure it is punched out. It is a simple thing. But it \nworks. In St. Louis County, the largest voting jurisdiction in Missouri \nwith the most diverse population--from some very wealthy areas to areas \nin great need which qualify as an enterprise and empowerment zone, a \nwonderful diversity of people with long-time residents and newly \narrived immigrants--they use punch cards. Their error rate is 0.3 \npercent--one of the lowest in the country. Clearly, it isn't a problem \nthere. We don't say you can't use punch cards.\n  For disabled voters, as has already been mentioned by Senator Dodd, \nwho has been a true champion, we require polling precincts to improve \ntheir voting system so voting machines are accessible even for those \nwho are visually disabled. For those new citizens whose English \nproficiency is still a work in progress, we want to make sure that \nnewly arrived people with different languages are not excluded from the \nprotections of voting laws. If we have a credible population in a \njurisdiction that speaks a different language and has literacy \nproblems, we must publish the election information in their \nlanguage. All of these steps go a long way toward achieving the goal of \nmaking it easier to vote.\n\n  Senator McConnell's insistence on a commission--which would be a \nfull-\n\n[[Page S13685]]\n\ntime commission, a bipartisan commission, that would help solve these \nproblems--is a tremendous contribution. I think that is going to make a \ndifference.\n  But let me tell you how my interest and enthusiasm for challenging \nvoter fraud was reignited. You have heard that old story about: Deja vu \nall over again. Well, on the night of the general election, in November \nof 2000, we were ready to see the votes start to come in in St. Louis.\n  But lo and behold, a case was filed in the court in St. Louis City \nchallenging the voting process, saying that people were being illegally \nexcluded. As a matter of fact, the plaintiff who filed the case had \nbeen dead for over a year. He alleged that long lines were keeping him \nfrom voting. I suggest that the long lines may not have been at the \npolls that kept him from voting. He probably had other problems that \nwere keeping him from voting.\n  But we heard wind of this and lawyers went in and went to the court \nof appeals. And the court of appeals shut down that scheme within about \nan hour, after a few votes were cast.\n  I say deja vu all over again because--the funniest thing--I first ran \nfor Governor in 1972. I am from an outstate area. I ran against a \ncandidate who was from St. Louis City. I had a pretty good lead in the \noutstate area, and on election night we were starting to get ready to \nsee the votes counted and we heard that in St. Louis City they kept the \npolls open. They kept the polls open hour after hour after hour, and it \nreached around midnight. The charge was that, in a Democratic-\ncontrolled city, in a Democratic-controlled State, the Democratic \nelection officials were making it more difficult for Democratic voters \nto cast votes for Democratic candidates. Now, if that raises some \neyebrows, I think it should.\n  But we set about cleaning up the system and getting good election \nboards in place. And we thought that old trick of keeping open the \nvoting machines in areas where they are heavily partisan was over. But, \nno, it came back on election night 2000. We asked for an inquiry.\n  As we started kicking over damp rocks, more and more little election \nfrauds crawled out.\n  We found out that, for example, there was sort of a system of \nprovisional votes. Voters could go before a judge and say: I have been \ndenied the right to vote.\n  And the judge would say: Here is an order. You can go vote.\n  Well, they voted. They cast their ballot. And they were not \nsegregated. When we went back to look at them, we were kind of \ninterested.\n  They said: You have to put down what your reasons for not being able \nto vote were. And one of them wrote on the line: I'm a convicted felon.\n  Sounds like a good reason for keeping them from voting. But the judge \nordered that person be allowed to vote.\n  Another one said: I just moved here, and I wanted to vote for Al \nGore.\n  It seemed like a good reason to that judge, so that person was \nallowed to vote.\n  The Missouri Secretary of State went back and examined those 1,300 \nballots that were cast. Ninety-seven percent of them were illegal, \npeople who were not lawfully registered as required under the Missouri \nConstitution. They were allowed to cast their votes anyhow.\n\n  There were 13,000 of those provisional votes in St. Louis County. We \nhave not even completed an examination of those. But we also went and \nwe started taking a look and doing some research, and we found there \nwas some mess in the city of St. Louis. Some 25,000 voters--10 percent \nof the voters in St. Louis were double registered. Some voters were \nregistered three times. Some were registered four times. The champions \nwere registered five times.\n  We have not completed an investigation to find out how many of those \npeople took advantage of their multiple registrations, but we believe \nthere were significant numbers. There are investigations going on by \nthe appropriate authorities. Obviously, if they find specific evidence, \nwe trust they will take appropriate actions.\n  While I was accused of being partisan in calling attention to the St. \nLouis City fraud in November of 2000, something happened. There was a \npartisan primary for the mayor's race in March of this year. And lo and \nbehold, on the last day of registration, 3,000 mail-in registration \ncards were dumped on the City Election Board. The interesting thing \nabout them was that most of them were in the same handwriting and the \nsame ink. Many people who had accused me of being partisan, though of \nthe other party, now found it to be of great interest to look into the \nbona fides of these registrants.\n  Fortunately, we had a very aggressive and inquiring media in St. \nLouis that went out and started looking. It is amazing how many vacant \nlots in St. Louis City were teeming with voters. Where they were \nregistered were empty lots.\n  The secretary of state did a little investigation of multiple \nregistrations at one location. This is not apartment houses; this is \nsupposedly a single family dwelling. They limited their examination to \nthose places where eight or more adults were registered from one single \nfamily unit. They found over 250 of them--truly remarkable living \nconditions, and probably warrants some further investigation.\n  These drop houses were potential sites for massive voter fraud. Under \nthe current system, mail-in registration allows you to register to vote \nby mail, motor-voter. When motor-voter passed, most people focused on \nregistering people where you get your motor vehicle licenses. You have \nto show up. You are buying a car. You have an address. That makes a lot \nof sense.\n  But mail-in registrations required the local government to register \nthose voters. Then they said the only way you could get off the rolls \nwas if you showed up on the list of dead people, if you asked to be \nremoved, or if you had not voted in two Federal elections.\n  The problem with people who were registering from these drop houses \nis, No. 1, there probably were not any people to die. They are not \ngoing to show up on the dead rolls. They certainly were not going to \ncall in and ask their names be registered. Frankly, if you had gone to \nthe trouble of registering a bunch of phony names, you certainly were \nnot going to fail to vote them. Simple common sense.\n  Those things kind of heightened my interest. They got me looking at \nwhat we could do. We have agreed, in this bill, that, No. 1, one of the \nmost important things we are going to do is have a statewide voter \nregistration base, a database. This is important to make it easier to \nvote. And it is important to make it tougher to cheat. And that list \nhas to be cleaned up. But it also says, if you are registering by mail, \nyou cannot just send in a ballot with no further identification. We \nrequire some identification. Either you show up in person to vote the \nfirst time or you send in--either with your registration or with your \nvote--a photo ID or a bill mailed to you at that location with your \nname and address on it. If you pay a water bill there, and your name is \non it, it is a pretty good indication that you are there. If you are \npaying bills from there, that is a start.\n  There are a lot of things that need to be done. I think there are a \nlot of jurisdictions, given the power that these new statewide \ndatabases will give them to check, to cross-check, that will be able to \nfind if there are phony voters and clean up some of these multiple \nregistrations, some of these double, triple, quadruple, quintuple \nregistrations, and maybe begin to shut down on fraud.\n  There has not been any final determination other than the initial \nreviews of the secretary of state, but I can tell you, just in St. \nLouis City and St. Louis County, there was enough evidence of \nquestionable voting that the warning given by the court of appeals in \nSt. Louis should be taken to heart.\n  That is, that it is a significant denial of the right to vote if you \nhave your vote diluted by multiple votes cast by some other person or \nby votes cast in the name of a nonexistent person. If people are not \nregistered to vote and they are permitted to vote, that is a denial of \nthe right of franchise. This bill takes very significant steps towards \ncuring that.\n  One other thing. The Carter-Ford Commission said all people who \nregister to vote must affirm their citizenship. That seems to be \nreasonable. I understand that one of the al-Qaida members actually \nvoted in Colorado. A couple more illegal immigrants suspected of being \ninvolved with the September 11 activities were registered in Michigan. \nI don't know whether or not they managed to vote.\n\n[[Page S13686]]\n\n  I guess my favorite, one that was uncovered by the media in St. \nLouis, was when they looked at the mail-in registrations, they did some \ngroundwork and they focused on Ritzy Mecker. They went to inquire about \nthe whereabouts of Ritzy Mecker. They finally tracked down her owner \nand found out it was a mixed-breed dog.\n  I don't know what Ritzy's preference in the election was. I don't \nknow whether Ritzy was a Democrat or a Republican. Maybe she voted a \nsplit ticket; I don't know. But the kind of thing that went on there is \na kind of Ritzy Mecker-voting system.\n  We want people who are adults, U.S. citizens, not felons, registered \nto vote, to be able to cast one vote, but the people who don't fall in \nthat category should not be voting. And the dogs that don't fall in \nthat category should not be voting.\n  One of my dear friends in State government when I served there, Tom \nVilla, his father was a legendary alderman, Red Villa, Albert ``Red'' \nVilla, legendary; he died in the early 1990s. But in this most \nwonderful of seasons, I can tell you that he came back to register for \nthe 2000 election. Does your heart good to know that, yes, you can come \nback from the dead and register. We would like to see the photo ID of \nthose people who have registered to make sure they have not departed \nus. As I said some time ago, I like dogs. I have a great respect for \nthe dearly departed. But I really don't think they ought to vote.\n  When we talked about the fraud in the city of St. Louis, another good \nfriend of mine, State representative Quincy Troupe, talking about the \ndanger he saw in the primary of illegal registration, said about St. \nLouis:\n\n       The only way you can win a close election in this town is \n     to beat the cheat.\n\n  Time is long gone when we ought to have to ask candidates for office \nto beat the cheat if they want to hold office. This legislation we have \ncrafted will be worked on in the Chamber. I imagine it will be worked \nover good, and we may be able to improve on it. But as my colleague \nfrom Kentucky said: We have hashed out a lot of these issues. I hope we \ncan explain what we have done to our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle so we can get strong support.\n  It is incumbent on us and the time is now. We have come to this place \nafter a lot of blood, sweat, and tears that we and our staffs have put \nin, and I thank the staffs of my colleagues, my colleague from New \nYork, Senator Schumer; my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nTorricelli; their staffs. I thank particularly my chief of staff Julie \nDammann and my counsel Jack Bartling. I haven't seen them for 3 months. \nI am looking forward to having them back in the normal office business \nafter the Christmas recess.\n  I hope that the mutually worked on effort is going to produce \nsomething that will be a real present for all Americans in this holy \nseason.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also thank the staffs of all of the \nSenators involved. I think we couldn't have made it without them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this could be a fairly historic moment \nfor our country. I thank my friends from Connecticut and Kentucky and \nMissouri for their good work. This is an issue that is vital to the \npeople of our country. In fact, in light of September 11, which caused \nsuch problems for my city and for our country, if you had to think of \nthe No. 1 reason that those overseas, those terrorists, hate us, it is \nbecause we vote, because we don't have a dictator, religious or \notherwise. It is because we vote.\n  We have to make voting as perfect as possible. It is never going to \nbe perfect. But such a sacred right, such a vital right should be made \nperfect.\n  This bill comes a lot closer to doing that. It has taken a lot of \nwork. We all know what the bill is. The week after the Florida election \nI said we had to do something and came out with the idea that we ought \nto give the States money if they upgrade their machines, and that is at \nthe core of this bill.\n  We all worked together. I compliment my colleague, particularly from \nConnecticut, who pulled everybody together, who, as I mentioned \nearlier, had the patience of Job. And my colleague from Kentucky, he \nand I had a bill originally. It probably would have been the bill on \nthe floor had Mr. Jeffords not switched. But this is a better bill. I \nam proud to be on it because it not only provides money, but it \nrequires the States to upgrade.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri as well. His addition in terms of \nelection fraud is something of which we on this side of the aisle \nshould not be afraid. When there is fraud in elections, it jaundices \nelections, and elections are sacred.\n  I am not going to go into the details of the bill. My colleagues have \nspoken eloquently about the need for the bill. It is a little sad that \nwe came to our agreement only this week of this session, but Senator \nDodd has mentioned that our leader, the floor leader, the majority \nleader, Senator Daschle, has said we will move this bill early next \nyear. That will give us enough time to make sure the Presidential \nelection in 2004 is not a repeat of the election in 2000.\n  In New York State, we need help, too. I voted for the first time in \n1969. I voted exactly on the same clunky old voting machine in 2001 for \nmayor a few weeks ago.\n  I want to share with you something that stays in my mind. You go to a \npolling place in the early evening. You find people, all kinds of \npeople, working people in their plaid shirts and jeans, people who have \nworked in the office towers in their shirts and ties. They are tired. \nBut they know it is their obligation to vote. They go over to the \npolling place. And in my city and in many parts of my State, because of \nthe oldness of the machines, there are long lines. They wait patiently. \nMany are studying the ballot and studying the literature that has been \ngiven out, particularly these days with so many names on the ballot.\n  Then you ought to see the looks on their faces when they get up, \nready to vote, and they say: You are at the wrong polling place, or we \ndon't have your card here, or you can't vote for some reason. It is a \nlook of complete and utter sadness and almost despondency. In this bill \nwe found ways to avoid it. The number of people who will be turned away \nwho should have the right to vote will be many fewer. We have made \nprovisions for provisional voting so, if you are not on the list, you \ncan vote by a paper ballot, and then they will check. And if your vote \nshould be counted, it will be. If it shouldn't, they will notify you.\n  I thought that is a very clever and good provision in the bill. They \nwill tell you why so you can correct it. Within a few years of this \nbill becoming law, not only will voting be modernized but fraud will \ndecline, and the ability of people to vote quickly and easily and \ncorrectly will have greatly improved.\n  So I just again want to say that this could be a fairly historic \nmoment in the history of the Republic. We have had poll taxes, \nlimitations on voting by sex, by property, by income, and by race. \nThank God, we have eliminated those. But we have also had limitations \non voting just because of the method we vote. On its face, it may not \nbe as pernicious as those others, but it is every bit as detrimental to \nthe Democracy. We are going to end that with this legislation--or at \nleast greatly reduce it.\n  I hope that when we return, we will move quickly. Again, I thank our \nleader in the Rules Committee, somebody who really has patiently and \ndiligently tilled the vineyards, improved the product over and over \nagain, and then came to a consensus. One of the reasons I look forward \nto coming back--and I look forward to coming back for many reasons--is \nto work to see that New York gets its $20 billion, to get a stimulus \nbill to move the economy and help the unemployed and those who don't \nhave health insurance. We have so many things to do.\n  One of the main reasons I want to come back next year--and that is a \nshort time away because it is late in the year--is to get this \nlegislation passed and stop the scene that I mentioned before: People \nwho wait and wait and wait and, through no fault of their own, are \ndenied the right to vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S13687]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13687-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13687-S13688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. Before \nhe arrived, I thanked him. In his presence, I thank him. The Senator \nplayed a very critical role in putting this product together. He is a \nnew Member of the Senate, but he has already demonstrated, as others \nhave pointed out, that he is very much a seasoned legislator. He brings \nfrom the New York legislature and from the other body years of \nexperience, and it is a pleasure to do business with my colleague from \nthe neighboring State of New York.\n  I hesitate to use the word ``landmark'' because we haven't finished \nit, but you can sense the enthusiasm we all feel about this compromise \nand at being able to arrive at a moment where we have the names already \nas cosponsors of a substitute that demonstrates a bipartisan commitment \nto this issue.\n  We don't claim perfection with this bill, but we do claim we are \ngoing to certainly improve the process immeasurably. My hope is that \nthe leaders will find a time, if not as the first bill, as one of the \nearly proposals we can bring to the floor for consideration.\n  I didn't want the Senator to leave the floor because I wanted to \nchange the subject briefly. I will leave the record open for others who \nmay want to comment about this bill. The hour is getting late and the \ntime is running short. We all want to depart.\n  I want to mention the terrorism insurance bill, which is of critical \nimportance to my colleague from New York. It is very important to many \npeople across the country. I don't know what is going to happen with \nthe so-called stimulus bill, but the terrorist insurance proposal is \nabout as important a piece of legislation as this body could consider.\n  We have been at this now for a couple months trying to craft a \nproposal that would allow us to bridge this time from the September 11 \nevents to a time when the industry would be able to calculate risk \nthrough the reinsurance efforts, and then through competitive pricing, \nbe able to get back into this business.\n\n  It is a very complicated and arcane subject. It is not one that is \ngoing to be easily understood because the subject matter is \ncomplicated. Suffice it to say this: A critical leg of a healthy \neconomy is the insurance industry. You cannot really have a healthy \neconomy without it. People can't buy a home without fire insurance. You \ncan't get loans today without having proper insurance.\n  The Presiding Officer, of course, brings a wealth of experience in \nthis area because of his previous work in State government, where he \ndealt with insurance both in the private sector as well as a Governor. \nWe have heard from Senator Nelson of Florida, also.\n  I know the Senator from New York is running off, but I hope--and it \nis my fervent plea this evening with a day left--there is still time \nfor us to get this matter up. We are very close. I hope that Members on \nboth sides will allow a motion to proceed to go forward. Give us a day, \nif that is what we can have, to consider various amendments on this \nbill. The House already passed one.\n  Bob Rubin, the former Secretary of the Treasury, when asked how he \nwould calibrate the importance of this issue--and I can paraphrase his \nremarks and I think my friend from New York may have been there--said \nthat this was as important, if not more important, than the stimulus \npackage we have been considering.\n  Our failure to address and deal with this issue could mean that small \nbusinesses, construction projects, all across America, come January, \nwill cease. Unemployment will go longer--not of CEOs of insurance \ncompanies, but of construction workers, small business people, \nshopkeepers--all of whom need to have this bill if they are going to \nget the bank loans to continue to operate.\n  This has to get done. If we don't do it, this body will be held \naccountable, in my view. We have known about this issue for weeks. Yet, \nwe have not yet brought the matter to the floor. I hope that will \nchange in the next 24 hours, because if we leave here and don't deal \nwith this, more than 70 percent of these contracts are up for renewal, \nand we will create a further problem for our economy.\n  So I know it is not at an issue that attracts a lot of support \nautomatically. It is complicated. There is no great affection for the \nissue of insurance. Those knowledgeable about the importance of this \nissue for the strength and vitality of our economy, to leave and go \nhome for the holidays and leave this unattended to, I think, is a \nproblem. I think we need to come back over the next day and address \nthis. We may not succeed, but you have to try. I hope this matter will \ncome up on the floor so we can at least debate it and, hopefully, pass \nit.\n  I know my colleague has a deep interest in the subject matter because \nof the facts concerning his own city and State. I wanted to give him an \nopportunity to comment on this as well. I am happy to yield to him or \nhave him claim the floor in his own right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding. He is so right. If \nthere was ever a time when the perfect should not be the enemy of the \ngood, it is on this insurance bill. If you think this doesn't affect \nyou because it is the arcane Dickensian, almost, world of insurance, it \ndoes. My colleague is exactly right. If we don't have terrorism \ninsurance, and as of January 1--less than 2 weeks away--no one will \nwrite terrorism insurance, then your banks, whether they be in small \ntowns or in large cities, will not lend to new projects. They may not \neven refinance existing loans, and that means, as my friend has \ncorrectly pointed out, new projects come to a halt. No more new jobs. \nNo construction jobs. No jobs that those projects create.\n  Each of us in the course of these few weeks as we debated this has \nhad a different view as to how to do this better. But no one disputes \nthat we have to do it. I don't know hardly a person in this body--maybe \n10 of the 100--who would say we should not do anything. And so if there \nwere ever a time that we all should sort of give in a little bit and \nsay, well, it is not going to be done my way--if I had my druthers, I \nwould have an FDIC for terrorism insurance. That is what I would do.\n  Warren Buffet, from the State of the Presiding Officer, proposed \nthat. But that is not going to happen. I know there is too much \nopposition in the other body and in the White House for that.\n  So the proposal that the Senator from Connecticut and my good friend \nfrom Maryland, our chairman of the Banking Committee, and the Senator \nfrom Texas, the ranking member from the other side, and I, and the \nSenator from New Jersey, and so many others have put together, is sort \nof a grand compromise. Is it perfect? No. Is it a lot better than \nletting terrorism insurance lapse? You bet.\n  This is a test, I say to my friend from Connecticut, for this body, \nthis Congress, this Government. If in the post-September 11 world, when \nwe have new necessities and new urgencies, we all cannot pull together \na little bit to deal with the problems and instead we let rumor-\nmongering, egos, or whatever else get in the way, we are going to hurt \nthis country.\n  This ain't beanbag, as Boss Tweed said in Plunket's book on New York \nCity politics. This ain't beanbag, this is serious stuff. As my friend \nfrom Connecticut said, it probably means more to the country, even \nthough it is more esoteric than the stimulus package in terms of the \neconomy heading south. If we do not try to grapple with this difficult, \nthorny issue, it is at our own peril.\n  I join my colleague in his heartfelt plea that we make an effort to \ntake this bill up and deal with one of the hidden but very seriously \nvexing problems facing our economy in the post-September 11 world.\n  I yield back to my friend.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I know Senator Daschle \nand others are working on this. Colleagues who are paying attention to \nthis and heard the comments of our colleague from New York and myself, \nthere are matters involved in this that I know are important to some \nbut, in terms of the centerpiece of what we are trying to do, are \nreally extraneous.\n  We are talking about a brief period of time for this bill to work. I \nknow there are matters others would like to use dealing with other, \nmore profound, long-term issues on this bill, and I urge\n\n[[Page S13688]]\n\nthem to hold up if they can and not allow a larger debate on those \nquestions and not stop the debate on something that needs to be dealt \nwith in the next 24 hours before we recess for the year.\n  The President has urged us to do this. Every single industry group I \nknow of beyond the insurance industry--the private sector--is calling \non us to deal with this issue. Even the Consumer Federation has \ndifferent ideas but understands our failure to act could create a \nserious problem. For us to not even try I think would be a huge \nmistake.\n  I urge before we recess that we make an effort, starting early \ntomorrow, to give this body time to hear some of the various ideas my \ncolleagues may have. I may disagree with them on those ideas, but I am \nprepared to spend the time necessary tomorrow to engage in debate on \nthose ideas, resolve them one way or another, and send this bill from \nthis Chamber to conference with the one adopted in the House and \nresolve it, so we can finish the business of giving the President a \nproposal that will avoid the kinds of problems the Senator from New \nYork has very properly described.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13688-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13688-S13690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand some of my colleagues were on \nthe floor today trying to make some points about judges, and I would \nlike to set the record straight because I think they protest too much. \nThere is just far too much protesting and far too much misinformation \nbeing given out about judges by some in this body.\n  Having been intimately involved in trying to get as many judges \nthrough as I could over the last 7 years, I have to say I find some of \nthe comments that were made were a little unctuous and perhaps to some \npeople who have been involved and have worked so hard to do a good job \na little bit irritating and maybe offensive.\n  As Congress nears the end of its current session, we are beginning to \nsee the end result of the systematic and calculated effort by some \nSenate Democrats to confirm the absolute minimum number of President \nBush's judicial nominees they believe will be acceptable to the \nAmerican public.\n  Some of the Senate Democrats want us to believe they have done \neverything that can be expected because they have confirmed as many \njudges during President Bush's first year in office as were confirmed \nin President Clinton's first year 8 years ago. What they are not \ntelling the public is the Senate has purposefully ignored more judicial \nnominees than in any other President's first year in office in recent \nhistory.\n  Thirty-two of President Bush's nominees have been prohibited from \neven having a hearing, the first step in the Senate's constitutionally-\nrequired process of advice and consent.\n  Some Senate Democrats want to use an inaccurate measure of \nperformance focused on the end result of 8 years ago rather than \nexposing the percentage of their work they left uncompleted this year. \nThe percentage is a much more appropriate gauge for the simple reason \nour current President Bush sent many more judicial nominations to the \nSenate than the previous President did in his first year.\n  So let us look at the percentages. The Senate has exercised its \nadvice and consent duty on only 21 percent of President Bush's circuit \nnominees this year. The other 79 percent of our work remains \nunfinished. This is despite the fact that President Bush sent his first \nbatch of 11 circuit nominations to the Senate on May 9 of this year, \nwhich gave the Judiciary Committee plenty of time to act on them. Even \nso, only 3 of those 11 have been confirmed. A significant number of \nthose have the highest possible rating from the American Bar \nAssociation. Even so, only three, as I say, have been confirmed. \nPresident Clinton, on the other hand, did not send his first circuit \nnominations to the Senate until August 1993, but still saw 60 percent \nof his circuit court nominees confirmed before the Senate adjourned in \nNovember of 1993.\n  The Senate's record on overall judicial nominations is not much \nbetter than our record on circuit nominees. Since some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are so fond of comparing their record to \nthe first year of the Clinton and first Bush administrations, let us \nsee how they stack up. President Clinton had nominated 32 judges by \nOctober 31 of his first year in office. Eighty-eight percent of those, \nor 28 nominees, were confirmed by the time Congress went out of session \nin 1993. The first President Bush had nominated 18 judges by October \n31, 1989, of which 89 percent, 16 nominees, were confirmed by the time \nCongress recessed at the end of that year. In contrast, as of today, \nthe current President Bush has nominated 66 judges and only 27 have \nbeen confirmed, a mere 41 percent. (I hope that tomorrow we will \nconfirm the five who are presently on the Senate calendar.)\n  The importance of this percentage is that the Senate has done only 41 \npercent of its job this year. In other words, nearly 60 percent of \njudicial nominees are somewhere in the Senate's black hole. We will \nconclude our work by leaving nearly 100 vacancies in the judicial \nbranch, which means more than 11 percent of all Federal courtrooms in \nthis country are presided over by an empty chair.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues recently asserted the present \nvacancy crisis is the result of Republican inaction on judicial \nnominees during the Clinton administration. Incredibly, some have \nasserted that the vacancy rate increased 60 percent under Republican \ncontrol of the Senate. That is a wild exaggeration. The truth is that, \nduring the 6 years when I was chairman of the judiciary committee, the \nvacancy rate was never above 8 percent at the end of any session of \nCongress.\n\n  In December 1995, there were 63 vacancies in the Federal courts, \nwhich is a vacancy rate of 7.4 percent. In December 1996, after \nCongress had been out of session for nearly 2 months during which it \ncould not immediately fill any vacancies, there were 75 openings in the \nFederal judiciary. December 1997, 81 vacancies; December 1998, only 54 \nvacancies; December 1999, 68 vacancies, and last year, only 67 \nvacancies. All tolled, the average number of vacancies under my \nchairmanship in the month of December is 68--a vacancy rate of 8 \npercent.\n  Contrast this to 2001: We are about to adjourn with nearly 100 \nvacancies, a rate of over 11 percent. This year will indeed go down in \nhistory as a black hole--and a black mark--for the failure to confirm \njudicial nominees.\n  Of course, trying to shift the blame for this present vacancy crisis \nignores the end result of how Republicans treated President Clinton's \njudicial nominees. During the Clinton Administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 377 judicial nominees. This number is only 5 short of the \nall-time record of 382 judges confirmed during the Reagan \nadministration. And keep in mind, for 6 years of the Reagan \nadministration the Senate was controlled by the President's party. But \nfor 6 of President Clinton's 8 years, the Senate was controlled by \nRepublicans. So the Republican--controlled Senate confirmed essentially \nthe same number of judges for Clinton as it did for Reagan. We have not \nheard a single Democratic Senator acknowledge this fact because it \nproves that the Republicans treated Democratic nominees fairly. The \nfact is, contrary to the assertion that Republicans held up President \nClinton's judicial nominees, the Republicans who controlled the Senate \nduring 6 years of the Clinton administration put a near record number \nof judges on the bench. What is more, those 377 confirmed judges \nrepresent nearly 80 percent of all of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees.\n  As for the pace of moving nominees, it is worth noting that 20 \nClinton judicial nominees received a hearing within 2 weeks of their \nnomination. Thirty-four Clinton judicial nominees received a hearing \nwithin 3 weeks of their nomination, and 66 received a hearing within a \nmonth of their nomination.\n  In contrast to the Republican Senate, the present Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate has only contributed to the vacancy crisis. In the \nfirst 4 months of\n\n[[Page S13689]]\n\nDemocratic control this year, only six Federal judges were confirmed. \nAt several hearings, the Judiciary Committee considered only one or two \njudges at a time. The Senate has been behind the curve ever since, and \nthe Federal judiciary continues to suffer for it. The number of \njudicial emergencies has increased by 17 in the last year.\n  Now I must pause a moment to talk about the Tenth Circuit since it \nencompasses my home state of Utah. Several of my Democratic colleagues \nremarked that the present leadership held the first hearing for a Tenth \nCircuit nominee since 1995. The implication, of course, is that the \nRepublican-controlled Senate failed to approve Clinton nominees for the \nTenth Circuit.\n  A closer examination of the facts reveals that there were no Tenth \nCircuit nominees for most of the 6 years the Democrats cite. After the \nconfirmation of three Tenth Circuit Clinton nominees in 1995, there was \nnot another Tenth Circuit nominee until 1999, and that nomination was \nsubsequently withdrawn. The next Clinton Tenth Circuit nominee was not \nnominated until just before August recess in 2000, which left the \nSenate little time to act on the nomination given the dynamics of last \nyear's election.\n  So the suggestion that the Republicans deliberately failed to act on \nClinton nominees for the Tenth Circuit for 6 years is inaccurate at \nbest and downright misleading at worst.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the Judiciary Committee's \npresent leadership. We have an eminently well qualified candidate from \nUtah for the 10th Circuit, Michael McConnell, who has been awaiting a \nhearing for more than 7 months. He received the highest rating given by \nthe American Bar Association and is considered one of the true legal \nintellects in the country today.\n  Not long ago, I talked with one of the leading law deans in the \ncountry. He is a very liberal Democrat. I asked him about Michael \nMcConnell. He knows him intimately. He said: I have met two absolute \nlegal geniuses in my lifetime and Michael McConnell is one of them.\n  In addition, both Timothy Tymkovich of Colorado and Terrence O'Brien \nof Wyoming are awaiting hearings on their nominations to the Tenth \nCircuit. So, despite the recent confirmation of one Tenth Circuit \nnominee, there is still substantial work left undone in the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  The Senate's constitutional obligation to provide President Bush \nadvice and consent on his judicial nominations is not a game, as some \nof my Democratic colleagues seem to believe. This is not football, or \nbaseball, or basketball, where the whole point is to beat the other \nteam. Neither the Senate nor the American public scores a victory when \nsome Senate Democrats execute a deliberate strategy of ignoring more \nthan half of President Bush's picks for the Federal Judiciary.\n  Any excuse for not moving a nominee that hinges on his or her \nsupposed ideology is just that--an excuse. If we start imposing an \nideological litmus test, then we will not get people of substance to \nsit on the Federal benches in this country. If we start denying \nhearings to nominees simply because they are personally pro-abortion or \npro-life, it would be a tremendous mistake.\n  We should confirm the President's nominees where we can. Sometimes \nthere are reasons why we cannot. I understand that. I have been there. \nI have had people on both sides of this floor mad at me, and I was \ndoing everything I could to support President Clinton's nominees \nthrough the Senate process. I don't expect the current Judiciary \nCommittee chairman to have an easy time, either. He is a friend. But \nthe fact of the matter is, I don't think the job is getting done.\n  There are myriad reasons why political ideology has not been, and is \nnot, an appropriate measure of judicial qualifications. A nominee's \npersonal opinions are largely irrelevant so long as a nominee can set \nthose opinions aside and follow the law fairly and impartially as a \njudge. I am very concerned that the statements made today by some of my \nDemocratic colleagues indicate a renewed intention to subject judicial \nnominees to a political litmus test, instead of focusing on their \nintellectual capacity, integrity, temperament, health, and willingness \nto follow precedent.\n  Despite the unfortunate decisions made this year, I believe there is \nsome room for hope in 2002. The same results-oriented strategy that led \nthe Judiciary Committee this year to match President Clinton's first \nyear, should lead the committee to equal his second year, as well. \nDuring President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate confirmed \n100 of his judicial nominees. The American people should join me in \nexpecting Senate Democrats to do the same for President Bush. In fact, \nI think we should take this year's systematic and calculated \nperformance as a pledge that the Senate will confirm at least 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in 2002.\n  Mr. President, there is another fact that I think ought to be brought \nup. That is, when the first President Bush left office, there were \naround 67 vacancies and 54 nominations pending that were never acted \nupon. But on election day of 2000, only about 42 Clinton nominees were \nleft pending, several of whom were sent here so late in the year that \nthere was no way the Judiciary Committee could have processed them.\n\n  I tried to do my best as Judiciary Committee chairman, and I don't \nthink anybody on the other side has a right to complain. Admittedly, \nthere were a few judges that we just couldn't get through, but it \nwasn't for lack of trying. There are some Senators in each party who \nmay not want to see many of the other party's judges get through, and \nthey make it tough. But those Members are very much in the minority. I \nthink most Members in both parties would like to see a better job done.\n  Now, I have great hope we will do a better job next year. It is an \nabsolute disgrace to allow 79 percent of President Bush's circuit court \nnominees to languish. In particular, I will mention three of them.\n  Michael McConnell is one of the greatest minds in the field of law \ntoday. He has all kinds of Democrat support, but one or more single-\nissue special interest groups are mouthing off against him. He has wide \nbipartisan support and everybody that knows him knows he would make a \ngreat circuit court of appeals judge. I would like to see him on the \nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals because I think he would help that court \na great deal.\n  Another one is Miguel Estrada. Here is one of the leading minorities \nin the country today, an immigrant who graduated from Columbia \nUniversity and Harvard Law School. But the Senate leadership has been \nsitting on his nomination for 7 months, preventing him from having a \nhearing. He received the American Bar Association's highest rating, \nwhich some Democrats have touted as the gold standard for nominees, but \nstill cannot get the time of day from the Judiciary Committee.\n  John Roberts is another excellent nominee. He is considered one of \nthe greatest appellate lawyers in the country today. My friends on the \nother side left him languishing as a nominee of the first President \nBush, back in 1992. Here he is, languishing for another 7 months, not \neven being given a chance to have a vote up or down.\n  Now let me just say a few words about two executive branch nominees \nwho also have been mistreated. One is Eugene Scalia, the nominee for \nSolicitor of Labor. Listening to his critics, you might think the plan \nis to turn OSHA over to Eugene Scalia, who disagrees with the efficacy \nof some of the rules on ergonomics. But he will have nothing to do with \nthat. And besides, both Houses rejected those rules by a majority vote. \nThe Solicitor of Labor basically has no power other than to issue legal \nopinions, and Scalia is one of the brightest young legal minds in the \ncountry today.\n\n  I suggested last week that Mr. Scalia's nomination is being stopped \nfor two reasons--at least these are the ones that keep cropping up. And \nI hope these are not the true reasons why any Senator would stop an \nexecutive branch nominee. I would be tremendously disappointed at our \nSenate if they were the true reasons.\n  The first is that he is a pro-life Catholic. This is not a persuasive \nargument for voting against Eugene Scalia's nomination. It is offensive \nto me if anyone in this body would actually vote against someone for \nthat reason. The fact that he is a pro-life Catholic has nothing to do \nwith whether or not he can do a good job as Solicitor of Labor. \nEverybody knows he is\n\n[[Page S13690]]\n\nan excellent lawyer. He has said he will abide by the law, whatever it \nis. Whether he agrees or disagrees with it, he will enforce the law. \nWhat more can you ask of a nominee? And he is the President's choice \nfor this position. He deserves to have a vote.\n  If people feel so strongly against him that they want to vote him \ndown, let them vote against him. But at least let this man, and the \nPresident, have a vote on this nomination.\n  The second reason that Eugene Scalia's nomination is being stopped, \nis that some may hold it against him that his father happens to be \nJustice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court. I hope nobody in this \nbody would hold it against a son, the fact that they might disagree \nwith the father. I do not have to speak in favor of Antonin Scalia. He \nis one of the greatest men in this country. He is a strong, morally \nupright, decent, honorable, intellectually sound, brilliant jurist--\njust the type we ought to have in the Federal courts. The fact that he \nmay be more conservative than some in this body is irrelevant.\n  But even if there were some good reason to criticize Justice Scalia, \nthere is no basis at all for using such a criticism against his son, \nwho is a decent, honorable, intelligent, intellectual, brilliant young \nattorney who deserves the opportunity to serve his Government, and who \nhas already said that as Solicitor of Labor he will abide by the law \nwhether he agrees with it or not. Knowing how honorable he is, I know \nhe will do exactly that.\n  The second executive branch nomination I want to mention is Joseph \nSchmitz for Inspector General of the Department of Defense. I happen to \nknow a lot about him; he is one of the brightest people I have ever \nmet. He is not even getting a committee vote. At least Mr. Scalia got a \nvote in committee--he received a majority vote in his favor in the HELP \nCommittee. But Mr. Schmitz isn't even getting a vote in committee. That \nis no way to treat a nominee, or the President who nominated him.\n  Frankly, these jobs--solicitor and inspector general--are not \npolitically sensitive positions. And both of these men I know \npersonally to be honest, decent, honorable men. They deserve votes in \nthis body. If they lose, then I can live with that result. I do not \nbelieve they will lose.\n  The purposeful delay on all of these nominations bother me a great \ndeal, and I hope we do something about it. If we can't do anything \nbefore the end of the current session, then I hope we will do it \nshortly after we get back.\n  I will continue to do my very best to work as closely as I can with \nSenator Leahy. We are friends, and I respect him. I want to support him \nin every way. But some of the comments I have heard in this Chamber \ntoday are nothing more than a distortion of the facts, a distortion of \nthe numbers, and a distortion of the record. I personally resent it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on December 12, 2001, the Senate passed \nthe Administrative Simplification Compliance Act, by unanimous consent. \nAs the title states, this is a bill about compliance with the \n``Administrative Simplification Act'' and not a proposal to delay \nenforcement of it.\n  This bill permits healthcare organizations, health plans, providers \nand clearinghouses, which cannot meet the current deadline for \ncompliance with the transactions and code sets rule, to seek and obtain \na one-year delay. Such flexibility was necessary due to the complexity \nand novel nature of the changes mandated under the Administrative \nSimplification Act. At the same time, certain provisions were built \ninto the rule to allay concerns that entitles that request the delay \nmay merely continue to avoid preparing for compliance. The first of the \nprovisions designed to provide compliance impetus is the requirement to \nsubmit a plan no later than October 16, 2002, stating, among other \nthings, how the covered entity will come into compliance by October 16, \n2003.\n  These plans must include: (1) an analysis reflecting the extent to \nwhich, and the reasons, why, the person is not in compliance; (2) a \nbudget, schedule, work plan, and implementation strategy for achieving \ncompliance; (3) whether the person plans to use or might use a \ncontractor or other vendor to assist the person in achieving \ncompliance; and (4) a timeframe for testing that begins not later than \nApril 15, 2003.\n  I am concerned that there will be a year in which some covered \nentities are using compliant standard transactions, as prescribed by \nthe Administrative Simplification Act, and others who are not compliant \nand sought the delay according to them by H.R. 3323. For those in \ncompliance, it is important that they are not penalized for using a \ncompliant standard transaction format, as prescribed by the \nAdministrative Simplification Act, after the original compliance date \nof October 15, 2002. That is, transactions should not be rejected, \nburdened, or penalized with additional costs, for being in conformity \nto the standard transaction format.\n  In order to avoid burdening complying health care entities, those \nentities seeking delay should also set forth how they will accept and \nnot unduly burden conforming transactions from compliant health care \nentities between October 16, 2002, and October 16, 2003.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \nAdministrative Simplification Act accomplishes what it was set out to \ndo, which is to save money for covered entities on transactions costs, \nprovided administrative efficiency, and protect the privacy of \npersonally identifiable health information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13690-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13690-S13691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOLD ON S. 1803\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in keeping with my policy on public \ndisclosure of holds, today I placed a hold on further action on S. \n1803, legislation reported out by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to authorize appropriations under the Arms Export Control Act \nand the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.\n  I am particularly concerned with Section 602 of this legislation.\n  Section 602(a) expresses the sense of Congress that the United States \nTrade Representative should seek to ensure that Free Trade Agreements \nare accompanied by specific commitments relating to nonproliferation \nand export controls.\n  Section 602(b) specifically directs the United States Trade \nRepresentative to ensure that any Free Trade Agreement with Singapore \ncontains or is accompanied by a variety of specific nonproliferation \nand export control commitments.\n  Both of these matters--what sort of commitments Free Trade Agreements \nshould contain, and specific negotiating instructions to USTR relating \nto the United States-Singapore FTA negotiations--are matters under the \njurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Apart from the fact that Section 602 deals with matters that pertain \nto the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, I have an additional \npractical concern as well.\n  According to the Trade Act of 1974, the United States Trade \nRepresentative is required to consult with and report to Members of the \nSenate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means on \nthe status of trade negotiations. This includes ongoing negotiations, \nlike the US-Singapore FTA talks, and future FTAs in general.\n  If enacted into law, Section 602 would likely result in a confusing \nsituation in which the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is advancing \nnegotiating instructions to USTR on behalf of Congress, even though the \noversight responsibility for such negotiations lies with the Finance \nCommittee. USTR would have to consult with the Finance Committee about \nits implementation of negotiating instructions developed by the Foreign \nRelations Committee, instructions Finance Committee Members had no role \nin developing, and are not familiar with.\n  As far as I know, no Member of the Finance Committee has even seen \nSection 602 before.\n\n[[Page S13691]]\n\n  Just a few days ago, the Finance Committee approved a bipartisan \nTrade Promotion Authority bill by a vote of 18-3. This bill contains \nspecific and detailed negotiating instructions relating to \nmultilateral, regional, and bilateral trade negotiations. The issues \nraised in Section 602, especially those framed as negotiating \ninstructions, should have been considered by the Finance Committee in \nthe context of the mark-up of TPA legislation, not on the floor in the \ncontext of legislation authorizing appropriations under the Arms Export \nControl Act.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I will continue to hold this \nlegislation until the concerns I have raised here are addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13691-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CAMBODIA KILLINGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, an article in last week's New York \nTimes highlighting the continued problem of wildlife poaching in \nCambodia. A conservation expert predicted that within the next 3 to 5 \nyears several species will cease to be biologically viable. Without a \ndoubt, this is a legitimate concern and I applaud efforts to protect \nthese endangered species.\n  But there are other species which may be endangered that the New York \nTimes did not cite--these species are called ``Cambodian democrats''.\n  The killing of democracy activists in Cambodia deserve increase \nattention from the press and the international community. A total of 11 \npolitical activists and candidates from the royalist FUNCINPEC party \nand the opposition Sam Rainsy Party have been killed in the runup to \nlocal election scheduled for February, 2002.\n  Officials from the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) have blamed \nthese murders on witchcraft and business deals gone sour. This is \npoppycock. Diplomats in Phnom Penh must show some spine in demanding \nthe CPP to cease the killings and to hold credible and competitive \nelections--something they did not do prior to the 1998 parliamentary \nelections. I hope that the importance of free and fair commune \nelections in 2002 and parliamentary elections in 2003 is not lost on \nthis crowd, who seem more willing to embrace ``stability'' at the \nexpense of democracy and the rule of law. Long term development in \nCambodia is possible only under new and dynamic leadership.\n  There will come a day when the CPP is held accountable for its \nextrajudicial and corrupt activities. This Senator has not forgotten \nthose killed and injured in the horrific grenade attack against the \ndemocratic opposition in March 1997--nor American Ron Abney, injured by \nshrapnel and who continues to bear physical reminders of that awful \nday. I have not forgotten the 100 FUNCINPEC supporters killed during \nthe July 1997 coup d'etat organized and executed by CPP Prime Minister \nHun Sen. Nor have I forgotten those killed and injured during the July \n1998 elections. I ask Hun Sen: what kind of government kills Buddhist \nmonks?\n  The international community can be part of the problem or part of the \nsolution. It is past time they held the CPP and Prime Minister Hun Sen \naccountable for their repressive actions. Failure to do so will ensure \nthat ``Cambodian democrats'' will join the list of species facing \nextinction in this Southeast Asian nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13691-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EMERGENCY SMALL BUSINESS LOAN ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. KYL.

That is why I have \nenthusiastically endorsed the Bush administration's ongoing, active, \nand aggressive efforts to provide emergency small-business loan \nassistance.\n  Unfortunately, S. 1499 came to the Senate floor without debate, \nwithout committee hearings, and without an opportunity for concerns \nabout the bill to be raised and addressed. No CBO score was released, \ndepriving those who are fiscally-responsible of a cost estimate of this \nlegislation. Yet the Senate leadership attempted to pass this bill \nwithout affording us any opportunity to offer amendments.\n  Scarcely any explanation of this bill's provisions was ever offered \nbefore it was moved to the Senate floor--and that is extremely \ntroubling.\n  We do know now that the costs of this bill--as much as $815 million--\nwould actually exceed the entire 2002 budget for the Small Business \nAdministration, nearly doubling it, at a time of a economic slowdown.\n  Additionally, the agency responsible for carrying out this \nlegislation--the Small Business Administration (SBA)--has raised a \nnumber of concerns about this bill that have not been adequately \naddressed.\n  First, some of the provisions of the Kerry bill duplicate efforts \nalready underway by the Bush administration. After the terrorist \nattacks, the SBA established the September 11 Emergency Injury Disaster \nLoan, EIDL, assistance program to make loans available to small \nbusinesses throughout the United States, who could demonstrate economic \ninjury as a result of the terrorist attacks.\n  This was an appropriate and necessary response. I emphasize, Mr. \nPresident: these loans already are being made available.\n  In addition to duplication of ongoing efforts, the SBA also expressed \nthe concern that provisions of the Kerry bill would actually increase \nthe number of small-business loan defaults, at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  As the SBA wrote in a letter to the sponsors of this measure:\n\n       By relaxing credit requirements, reducing interest rates, \n     eliminating fees, increasing the government guarantee, \n     deferring principal payments, forgiving interest and \n     increasing government liability, S. 1499 could make \n     government-guaranteed small business loans more attractive \n     than conventional loans, potentially displacing private \n     sector options. In addition, S. 1499 significantly reduces \n     lender and borrower stakes in a loan, thereby increasing the \n     likelihood of default.\n\n  Certainly the sponsors of this measure do not want to promote \ndefaults. After all, the goal of small-business assistance is to help \nentrepreneurs build, sustain and grow small businesses, with sound and \nfiscally-responsible loan assistance programs.\n  The existing EIDL assistance program provides a reasonable mechanism \nfor needed aid by offering up to $1.5 million in emergency loans to \nsmall businesses at four percent interest over 30 years. Loans are not \nintended purely as a means of disaster relief.\n  Additionally, S. 1499's language is so broad that loan assistance \ncould be provided to any small business that have ``been, or, that \n(are) likely to be directly or indirectly adversely affected'' by the \nterrorist attacks. Obviously, such language is ripe for abuse and could \nlead to exorbitant costs for the American taxpayer. Surely, this is not \nwhat the bill sponsors intended from this provision.\n  Lastly, the Small Business Administration expresses concerns \nregarding S. 1499's provisions providing emergency relief for Federal \ncontractors. The provisions would allow an increase in the price of a \nfederal contract that is performed by a small business in order to \noffset losses resulting from increased security measures taken by the \nFederal government at Federal facilities. As the SBA points out: \n``providing equitable relief through SBA acting as a central clearing \nhouse would prove inefficient, costly, and burdensome on the Federal \nacquisition process.''\n  All of us want to come to the aid of small businesses adversely \naffected by the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. But we can do \nso in a cost-effective and responsible way, instead of a rushed, \nhaphazard process designed to thwart compromise.\n  I am confident that a bipartisan compromise on this issue can be \nfound in the near-term, so that the concerns raised by the \nadministration can be taken into account, and we can pass something the \nPresident will support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13691-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13691-S13692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to a \ngroup of Americans who have worked tirelessly to protect all of us. \nFollowing the tragic events of September 11, Al Lenhardt, the Senate \nSergeant at Arms and Chairman of the U.S. Capitol Police Board \nrecognized the value of bringing together a group of experts from \noutside the legislative branch to provide the expertise necessary to \nrespond to this unprecedented attack on America. He brought in a team \nof experts and created the Legislative Branch Emergency Preparedness \nTask Force to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Capitol Complex \nand provide recommendations that would enhance our security .\n  This extraordinary group of experts could quite easily have taken a \nsimplistic approach and recommended turning the Capitol into an armed \ncamp. Fortunately, they recognized that this building, known throughout \nthe world as a symbol of freedom and democracy, is first and foremost \nthe public's domain and must remain so. Instead of taking the easy \nroute, they developed a carefully crafted series of measures which \nenhanced the security of everyone who walks through these doors Members \nof Congress, staff and visitors alike without denying the American \npeople their right to see and meet with their elected representatives. \nThey ensured that the Capitol remained ``the People's House.''\n  Mr. Gary Quay of the Department of Defense, Colonel Richard \nMajauskas, Lieutenant Colonel Donald Salo and Lieutenant Colonel \nStanley Tunstall of the Army, Lieutenant Commander David Klain of the \nNavy, Deputy Chief Chris McGaffin and Captain Edward Bailor of the U.S. \nCapitol Police, Mr. Michael DiSilvestro of the Office of Senate \nSecurity, Mr. Michael Johnson of the Senate Sergeant at Arms, Mr. Kevin \nBrennan of the House Sergeant at Arms, and Mr. Bill Weidemeyer and Mr. \nJim Powers of the Architect of the Capitol dedicated themselves to the \ntask of looking at every aspect of emergency preparedness on Capitol \nHill.\n  All of us remember the confusion that reigned on September 11. In \nlight of what happened, that confusion was perfectly understandable. \nAfter all, never before had someone turned one commercial airliner into \na weapon of mass destruction, let alone four. I am convinced that the \nrapid implementation of the Task Force's recommendations by Jeri \nThomson, the Secretary of the Senate, Alan Hantman, the Architect of \nthe Capitol, and Jim Varey, Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, has \nsignificantly enhanced our ability to respond to emergencies and will \nprevent a repeat of that day's confusion.\n  In a world where cynicism and selfishness rule the day for some, I am \nproud to say this is not the case for these dedicated Americans. The \nsafety of our nation's Capitol, and all who work in and visit it, is \nenhanced by their efforts. On behalf of Americans everywhere and the \n107th Congress in particular, I am proud to stand here today and say \n``Thank you--job well done!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13692-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13692-S13693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION TO ESTABLISH AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND \n                             CULTURE MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one of the most important chapters in \nour national story of human freedom and dignity is the history and \nlegacy of the African American march toward freedom, legal equality and \nfull participation in American society. Yet in our Nation's front yard, \nthe national mall, there is no museum set aside to honor this legacy.\n  Yesterday, the Senate began the very important step toward \nestablishing a national museum in Washington, DC to honor the rich \nhistory of African Americans.\n  With the passage of H.R. 3442, a bill that creates a Presidential \ncommission that will develop a plan to establish and maintain the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, the Senate has \ntaken a tremendous step closer to honoring those African Americans who \nnot only fought for their own freedom but fought for the freedoms in \nthis country that we enjoy today.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Max Cleland for his leadership in the \nSenate on this issue. Senator Cleland worked diligently with me to \ndraft a bill that would properly honor the history of African \nAmericans. This legislation will enable our Nation to start the process \nthat will honor this important aspect of American history.\n  Specifically, the legislation creates a 19-member commission made up \nof individuals who specialize in African American history, education \nand museum professionals. The commission has 9 months to present its \nrecommendations to the President and Congress regarding an action plan \nfor creating a national museum honoring African Americans.\n  The commission will decide the structure and makeup of the museum, \ndevise a governing board for the museum, and among other action items, \nwill consider planning the museum within the Smithsonian's arts and \nindustries building, which is the last existing space on the national \nmall.\n  As a Kansan, I feel a special connection to honoring the legacy of \nAfrican Americans. The State of Kansas not only played a significant \nrole in the civil war but also was chosen by many African American \nfamilies as a place to begin their new life of freedom and prosperity \nin the ``exodus'' to Kansas.\n  I believe that it is long over due that we properly honor African \nAmerican history by establishing a world class museum that showcases \nthe achievements of African Americans in this country. I look forward \nto the commission's recommendations for establishing this museum on the \nnational mall in Washington, DC, where African American history \nbelongs.\n  I do not pretend that this legislation is a cure-all for the problem \nof racial division, it is, however, an important and productive step \ntoward healing our nation's racial wounds. This museum will both \ncelebrate African American achievement and serve as a landmark of \nnational conscience on the historical facts of slavery, the \nreconstruction, the civil rights struggle and beyond.\n  Dr. King expressed his hope for national reconciliation. I too hope \n``That the dark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass away and the \ndeep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched \ncommunities and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of \nlove and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their \nscintillating beauty.''\n  Today, we are one step closer to fulfilling this goal. I am proud to \nbe a part of honoring this magnificent history. As a nation we have an \nextraordinary opportunity before us--a chance to learn, understand and \nremember together our nation's history and to honor the significant \ncontribution of African Americans to our history and culture.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the gas additive MTBE has \nbecome a huge concern for millions across the nation because of the \ncontamination that it has caused.\n  That is certainly true of many communities throughout New Hampshire \nwhere it has become a crisis, and the crisis will continue to escalate \nunless it is dealt with.\n  I have been fighting for the past two years to get the Senate to act \non legislation that will solve this problem and up to now, unfortunate \nroadblocks have prevented this from happening.\n  I was pleased last week when the majority leader made a commitment to \nme that the Senate will vote on MTBE legislation before the end of \nFebruary and I know that the majority leader will honor that commitment \nand I want to express my appreciation to him for working with me.\n\n[[Page S13693]]\n\n  Until the day that vote arrives, I will continue to come to the floor \nto remind Senators of the terrible impact that MTBE is having on the \nnation and remind them why it is important that we act now.\n  Make no mistake about it--cleaning up MTBE contamination and \npreventing further contamination is something that the residents of New \nHampshire are demanding and I will do all that I can to solve this \nproblem.\n  Let me step back and provide some background on how we got where we \nare and why this legislation is so important to those many States that \nhave suffered from MTBE contamination.\n  MTBE has been a component of our fuel supply for two decades.\n  In 1990, the Clean Air Act was amended to include a clean gasoline \nprogram.\n  That program mandated the use of an oxygenate in our fuel--MTBE was \none of two options to be used.\n  The problem with MTBE is its ability to migrate through the ground \nvery quickly and into the water table.\n  Several States have had gasoline leaks or spills lead to the closure \nof wells because of MTBE.\n  MTBE is only a suspected carcinogen, but its smell and taste do \nrender water unusable.\n  Many homes in New Hampshire and across the nation have lost use of \ntheir water supply because of MTBE contamination.\n  According to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, \nthere may be up to 40,000 private wells with some MTBE contamination \nand of those, up to 8,000 may have MTBE contamination over State health \nstandards.\n  Because of MTBE, New Hampshire has been left with no option but to \ndivert funds from other programs in order to pay for safe water for \nresidents with contaminated wells, in many instances, the State has had \nto provide bottled water.\n  They are also installing and maintaining extremely expensive \ntreatment equipment and these costs are so expensive that an average \nfamily could not afford to have clean drinking water without \nassistance.\n  Yesterday, I came to the Senate floor to talk about the hardships \nfaced by many in the Western part of New Hampshire and I focused on the \nplight a small business owner and two families in the Richmond area.\n  Today I want to talk about those in the Southern part of New \nHampshire that have faced similar problems.\n  This past spring, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I held a hearing in Salem, NH, at the hearing, the committee \nheard about the nightmares caused by MTBE.\n\n  I want to take a moment to tell you about one particular witness who \nlives in Derry, NH, Mrs. Christina Miller shared with the committee the \nexperience that her family and neighbors have been dealing with because \nof MTBE.\n  Mrs. Miller, her husband Greg, and their infant son Nathan live in \nthe Frost Road community in Derry, the area has been particularly hard \nhit by MTBE.\n  The gas additive was first detected there a little over three years \nago and the concentration of MTBE in the well water was over ten times \nhigher than the level where a person can smell it and taste it.\n  Since the discovery of MTBE in the wells, testing in the neighborhood \nhas been on-going.\n  Currently, some 40 homes in the Frost Road community are being \nmonitored for MTBE and so far, seven treatment systems, including one \nin the Miller home, have been installed in homes on and around Frost \nRoad.\n  In April of last year, while Mrs. Miller was pregnant with Nathan, a \nwater sample from the Miller well showed a high MTBE contamination \nlevel, and due to this discovery, the Millers began receiving bottled \nwater from the State to replace the contaminated drinking water.\n  But while bottled water is fine for drinking, Mrs. Miller pointed out \nthat it doesn't help with other daily needs such as: bathing; washing \nfruits and vegetables; and cooking.\n  There is also the potential health concerns associated with the \ncontamination and not much is known about the health affects of MTBE--\nbut when you have a new born, as the Miller's do with Nathan, the \nhealth uncertainties add to the already existing anxiety.\n  The State has installed a treatment system in their basement and it \nis a large, cumbersome intrusion in their house--it is also expensive.\n  This system consists of a residential air stripper and two carbon \nfilter units and while the State is currently paying for the system, \nthere is the concern about how long this will last and whether they \nwill pay for any upgrades as well.\n  Needless to say, with the MTBE contamination and the presence of a \nlarge treatment system in their home, the Millers' are quite concerned \nwith impact on the home's resale value.\n  What adds to the concerns is that the State still has not been able \nto determine the source of the MTBE.\n  It is a bad situation--one that begs for a remedy and the people of \nDerry are looking for help and relief from this federally mandated gas \nadditive that has caused so much pain.\n  This problem is not unique to new Hampshire, it exists in Maine \nCalifornia, Nevada, Texas, New York, and on and on.\n  In fact, in Maine, one single car accident rendered 12 drinking wells \nunusable--just like that--we must do something.\n  I have a bill that has been reported out of committee two years in a \ntow--briefly, the bill will: Authorize $400 million out of the Leaking \nUnderground Storage Tank Fund (LUST Fund) to help the states clean up \nMTBE contamination; Ban MTBE four years after enactment of this bill; \nAllow Governors to waive the gasoline oxygenate requirement of the \nClean Air Act; Preserve environmental benefits on air toxics, and; \nProvide funds to help transition from MTBE to other clean, safe fuels.\n  Also, I am very pleased to be joining our subcommittee ranking \nmember, Senator Chafee in introducing a new underground storage tank \nbill that includes MTBE cleanup funding.\n  The time to act is now--Just as I said yesterday, I will continue to \ncome to the floor until the Senate acts on this issue. It is time to \nhelp out the families who have fallen victim to a Federal mandate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13693-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13693-S13694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PORT AND MARITIME SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we worked hard with the administration \nto incorporate many of their suggested changes in this bill to sharpen \nthe policy and create a better legislative product. I had intended to \nwork with Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary Committee to modernize and \nupdate some of our maritime criminal laws to reflect the realities \nfollowing the attacks of September 11th, and to strengthen our laws to \nprotect against maritime terrorism. Unfortunately, the administration \ndid not consult or share with the Judiciary Committee the changes in \ncriminal laws and other matters within the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction that were provided to me. I ask the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee if he would be willing to work to work with me and \nSenator McCain next year to consider whether new criminal provisions \nare necessary to enhance seaport security?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am also very concerned that we develop \npolicies to more adequately protect our maritime vulnerabilities and \nprotect the public from the threats emerging as a result of maritime \ntrade. I would be happy to work with Chairman Hollings and Ranking \nMember McCain next year to evaluate whether any gaps in our criminal \nlaws to protect our maritime safety and seaport security exist and the \nappropriate steps we should take to close those gaps.\n  Additionally, I have expressed to Chairman Hollings my concerns that \nwe properly limit access to and use of sensitive law enforcement \ninformation relating to background checks which are provided for in \nthis bill. Chairman Hollings has assured me that the bill sets strict \nand appropriate limits as to both when such access will be required and \nhow the information will be used once obtained. I would like to ask \nChairman Hollings if he could explain those provisions?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I share Chairman Leahy's concern that we \nprovide adequate safeguards for both access to and use of this \nsensitive\n\n[[Page S13694]]\n\ninformation. That is why we have included important protections and \nlimitations for such use and access in the bill. Background checks will \nbe limited to those employees who have access to sensitive cargo \ninformation or unrestricted access to segregated ``controlled access \nareas,'' that is defined areas within ports, terminals, or affiliated \nmaritime infrastructure which present a demonstrable security concern. \nIn addition, under this bill the use of such material, once it is \nobtained, will be restricted to the minimum necessary to disqualify an \nineligible employee. In other words, only the minimum amount of law \nenforcement information necessary to make eligibility decisions will be \nshared with port authorities or maritime terminal operators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13694-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER ON PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP IN FOREIGN POLICY\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues a recent \ncolumn by Charles Krauthammer entitled ``Unilateral? Yes, Indeed.'' It \nran in the December 14 issue of the Washington Post.\n  Once again, Krauthammer has done a fine job of articulating \nsentiments shared by many of us regarding the President's conduct of \nforeign policy. The essence of the issue can be summarized in one word: \nleadership. Since the start of his presidency, George W. Bush has been \nthe target of innumerable criticisms emanating from his approach to the \nconduct of foreign policy. Greatly exaggerated fears of isolationism \nhave been voiced by the president's critics, both at home and abroad. \nWith the conduct of the war against terrorism and the decision to \nwithdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, however, the President \nhas demonstrated not isolationism, but leadership. Leadership, as \ndefined by the willingness to make unpopular decisions and accept the \nconsequences out of a conviction that the decisions in question are in \nthe best interests of the United States.\n  Pre-war concerns that the entire Muslim world would rise up against \nus if we went after Al Qaeda and its Taleban protectors have proven \nunfounded. Worst-case scenarios surrounding the President's decision to \nwithdraw from the ABM Treaty have similarly failed to materialize. \nThere are consequences to both decisions, but they were the right \ndecisions and the consequences are far less than the benefits accruing \nto the United States from their having been implemented.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a minute to read the article by Charles \nKrauthammer. It articulates better than could I the importance of \nleadership in international affairs, and I highly recommend it.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 14, 2001]\n\n                        Unilateral? Yes, Indeed\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       Last month's Putin-Bush summit at Crawford was deemed an \n     arms control failure because the rumored deal--Russia agrees \n     to let us partially test, but not deploy, defenses that \n     violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty--never came \n     off.\n       In fact, it was a triumph. Like Reagan at the famous 1986 \n     Reykjavik summit, at which he would not give up the Strategic \n     Defense Initiative to Gorbachev, Bush was not about to allow \n     Putin to lock the United States into any deal that would \n     prevent us from building ABM defenses.\n       Bush proved that yesterday when he dropped the bombshell \n     and unilaterally withdrew the United States from the treaty, \n     and thus from all its absurd restrictions on ABM technology.\n       This is deeply significant, not just because it marks a \n     return to strategic sanity, formally recognizing that the \n     ballistic missile will be to the 21st century what the tank \n     and the bomber were to the 20th, but because it unashamedly \n     reasserts the major theme of the Bush foreign policy: \n     unilateralism.\n       After Sept. 11, the critics (the usual troika: liberal \n     media, foreign policy establishment, Democratic ex-officials) \n     were clucking about how the Bush administration has beaten a \n     hasty retreat from reckless unilateralism. President Bush \n     ``is strongly supported by the American people,'' explained \n     former Senate leader George Mitchell, ``in part because he \n     has simply discarded almost everything he said on foreign \n     policy prior to Sept. 11.''\n       Bush had wanted to go it alone in the world, said the \n     critics. But he dare not. ``It's hard to see the President \n     restoring the unilateralist tinge that colored so many of his \n     early foreign policy choices,'' wrote columnist E. J. Dionne \n     just two months ago. ``Winning the battle against terror \n     required an end to unilateralism.''\n       We need friends, they said. We need allies. We need \n     coalition partners. We cannot alienate them again and again. \n     We cannot have a president who kills the Kyoto Protocol on \n     greenhouse gases, summarily rejects the ``enforcement \n     provisions'' of the bioweapons treaty, trashes the ABM \n     Treaty--and expect to build the coalition we need to fight \n     the war on terrorism.\n       We cannot? We did.\n       Three months is all it took to make nonsense of these \n     multilateralist protests. Coalition? The whole idea that the \n     Afghan war is being fought by a ``coalition'' is comical. \n     What exactly has Egypt contributed? France sent troops into \n     Mazar-e Sharif after the fighting had stopped, noted that \n     renowned military analyst Jay Leno. (``Their mission?'' asked \n     Leno. ``To teach the Taliban how to surrender.'') There is a \n     coalition office somewhere in Islamabad. Can anyone even name \n     the coalition spokesman who makes announcements about the \n     war?\n       The ``coalition'' consists of little more than U.S. \n     aircraft, U.S. special forces, and Afghan friends-of-the-\n     moments on the ground. Like the Gulf War, the Afghan war is \n     unilateralism dressed up as multilateralism. We made it plain \n     that even if no one followed us, we would go it alone. \n     Surprise: Others followed.\n       A unilateralist does not object to people joining our \n     fight. He only objects when the multilateralists, like \n     Clinton in Kosovo, give 18 countries veto power over bombing \n     targets.\n       The Afghan war is not a war run by committee. We made tough \n     bilateral deals with useful neighbors. Pakistan, Uzbekistan, \n     Tajikistan, Russia. The Brits and the Australians added a \n     sprinkling of guys on the ground risking their lives, and we \n     will always be grateful for their solidarity. But everyone \n     knows whose war it is.\n       The result? The Taliban are destroyed. Al Qaeda is on the \n     run. Pakistan has made a historic pro-American strategic \n     pivot, as have the former Soviet republics, even Russia \n     itself. The Europeans are cooperating on prosecutions. Even \n     the Arab states have muted their anti-American and anti-\n     Israeli rhetoric, with the Egyptian foreign minister \n     traveling to Jerusalem for the first time in three years.\n       Not because they love us. Not because we have embraced \n     multilateralism. But because we have demonstrated astonishing \n     military power and the will to defend vital American \n     interests, unilaterally if necessary.\n       Where is the great Bush retreat from unilateralism? The ABM \n     Treaty is dead. Kyoto is dead. The new provisions of the \n     totally useless biological weapons treaty are even deader: \n     Just six days before pulling out of the ABM Treaty, the \n     administration broke up six years of absurd word-mongering \n     over a bio treaty so worthless that Iraq is a signatory in \n     good standing.\n       And the world has not risen up against us--no more than did \n     the ``Arab street'' (over the Afghan war), as another set of \n     foreign policy experts were warning just weeks ago.\n       The essence of unilateralism is that we do not allow \n     others, no matter how well-meaning, to deter us from pursuing \n     the fundamental security interests of the United States and \n     the free world. It is the driving motif of the Bush foreign \n     policy. And that is the reason it has been so \n     successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13694-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13694-S13696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RUSSIA AND ENERGY SECURITY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to point out that while the \nattention of the world is now rightly focused on Afghanistan and the \nwar against terrorism there, we should not forget that a large part of \nthe oil and gas consumed by the United States and the rest of the \nindustrialized world comes from the conflict-ridden Middle East.\n  In addition to addressing the issue of energy independence through \nnew domestic sources of supply, conservation, and the development of \nrenewable energy resources, it is imperative for us to be thinking abut \nthe best possible way of protecting the security of alternative sources \nof oil and gas outside the United States. The Caspian Sea is also on \nRussia's doorstep, and we should encourage development that will foster \npositive political as well as economic relations with the world's \nsecond largest oil exporter.\n  Russia's recent refusal to follow OPEC's lead in slashing production \nis one more example of its ability to play a positive role on world oil \nmarkets, and the recently opened $2.5 billion Caspian oil pipeline, \nRussia's largest joint investment to date, and one in which U.S. firms \nhold more than a one-third interest, is an example of the kind of \nproject that will encourage Moscow to continue to look westward.\n  Akezhan Kazhegeldin, an economist, businessman, and former prime \nminister of oil-rich Kazakhstan, has written a thoughtful article on \nthese subjects that appeared in the Russian\n\n[[Page S13695]]\n\njournal Vremya Novostei on October 15, 2001. In his article, Dr. \nKazhegeldin states that oil and gas from Kazakhstan and the other \nenergy producing nations of the former Soviet Union could provide an \nimportant backup source of energy, complementing what now comes from \nthe Persian Gulf countries.\n  Moreover, referring to the debate surrounding the route of future, \nadditional pipelines carrying oil to consuming countries, Dr. \nKazhegeldin asserts that there is no reason for the West and Russia to \nbe at loggerheads now that the Cold War is over. He goes on to describe \nhow the West and Russia could, in his view, work together on a \ncomprehensive pipeline solution that would benefit everyone.\n  Some of Dr. Kazhegeldin's ideas will undoubtedly elicit healthy \ndebate. I urge my colleagues to read his provocative article, and I ask \nthat the text be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                 [From Vremya Novostei, Oct. 15, 2001]\n\n``Global Arc of Stability: The way Russia and the Caspian Can Make the \n                             World Stable''\n\n                        (By Akezhan Kazhegeldin)\n\n       The September 11 tragic events and launching of the Afghan \n     campaign, seen as the first stage in ``the global war against \n     terror'', have changed the world dramatically. Protection of \n     peaceful citizens from possible terror acts appears as just a \n     tip of the huge pyramid of new problems. We are facing an \n     acute and more global problem, the problem of ensuring the \n     industrial world's economic safety.\n       The supply of the developed nations' energy, above all, oil \n     and gas, is a critical and vulnerable element in the world's \n     economic relations. A great part of the developed oil fields \n     are concentrated in the highly insecure and conflict-ridden \n     Middle Eastern region, which makes the threat of oil blockade \n     and energy crisis for the industrial countries, the main oil \n     and gas consumers, a perpetual nightmare. Unpredictable \n     dictators are no less dangerous than terrorist groups. Should \n     the interests of both in the region coincide, the rest of the \n     world would find itself in an impasse.\n       Even if everything goes very well and the antiterrorist \n     campaign ends quickly, the community of industrial countries \n     will have to make sure that the threat of energy blackmail is \n     ruled out in principle. In the global energy system, it is \n     necessary to use reserve and back-up methods in order to \n     ensure safety. Caspian oil reserves can play a major role \n     here.\n       For the past decade, politicians and journalists have been \n     debating about the problem of Caspian oil perhaps more \n     heatedly than the industry professionals. It has almost been \n     made into a stake in the new Great Game, the U.S-Russian \n     rivalry over the control of the region and its riches. This \n     confrontation has become the legacy of the old ``bloc'' model \n     of the world. Wayne Merry, a former U.S. State Department and \n     Pentagon official, now a senior associate at the American \n     Foreign Policy Council in Washington, describes its sources: \n     ``. . . Washington concentrated its efforts on one great \n     strategic project to assure US primacy in the region. . . . \n     The idea was to bypass existing pipelines in Russia, squeeze \n     out Iran, bring energy supplies from the Caspian region to a \n     transhipment point in a NATO country, and thereby assure the \n     independent futures of the producing and transit countries.''\n       Understandably, Moscow clearly saw the threat to its \n     interests and resisted U.S. plans. However, both sides played \n     their parts by force of habit, without their usual passion. \n     The reason is that the interests of Russia and the West (not \n     only the U.S.) in the region are actually not conflicting. \n     Some regional leaders tried to artificially keep alive the \n     conflict between them as they hoped to secure foreign support \n     for their authoritarian regimes.\n       Now that many old patterns have been left behind in the \n     20th century for good, the common interests of the industrial \n     and democratic countries allow them to work out joint \n     approaches to ensure their energy independence. Owing to \n     this, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have a historic \n     opportunity to become stable partners of both Russia and the \n     West, and to be integrated into the world economy.\n       Naturally, this integration should entail bringing their \n     political systems in line with the international democratic \n     and market economy standards. ``A glance at other post-\n     colonial regions in Africa and Asia shows that the first \n     generation of `Big Man' leaders often does as much harm to \n     their countries as did the departing imperial powers, \n     creating a painful legacy for future generations to sort \n     out,'' concludes Wayne Merry. ``American long-term interests \n     in Central Asia are best served by seeking to engage \n     tomorrow's leaders and assuring that, when the region's \n     energy reserves do become important to the outside world, \n     these leaders will look to the United States as a friend and \n     not as yet another external exploiter.''\n       Setting aside the controversial definition of the Central \n     Asian countries as post-colonial ones, one should admit that \n     the time when the region's energy reserves do become \n     important to the outside world is nearing. Though geological \n     exploration of the Caspian shelf is far from being completed, \n     and many experts are not inclined to share the fanciful \n     expectations of ``dozens of new Kuwaits'', it is clear that \n     the region's oil and gas reserves are extremely large. \n     However, energy projects can't become global automatically, \n     thanks only to rich oilfields. Stable export routes are \n     required to deliver oil and gas to the global markets. Even \n     all the reserves of the Caspian states put together won't \n     make the Caspian project global. It is necessary to select \n     and develop the routes to transport oil and gas to the \n     global markets--to the consumers in Europe, U.S., and \n     Asian countries.\n       The most politically and economically viable option is to \n     transport the Caspian ``big oil'' up to the north, into \n     Russia and further on into Eastern and Western Europe, to the \n     consumers and transshipment ports. Economically, this option \n     seems much more attractive, since the construction is to take \n     place on a plain, in populated areas with a developed \n     infrastructure. Russia's European region has enough qualified \n     manpower and electricity for oil pumping. Russian plants \n     produce pipes and other equipment. Stability in Russia and \n     the neighboring countries guarantees safety of the route and \n     its uninterrupted operation.\n       If chosen, the Russian option would mean turning the energy \n     flow from south to north. It will permit the in-depth \n     integration of Russia and Central Asia into a united Europe \n     and simultaneously charge Europe and Russia with a common \n     political mission of ensuring energy independence for the \n     industrial countries. It will allow oil-producing countries \n     of the Caspian region to play a major role in the global \n     energy market. Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and--in the \n     long term, Turkmenistan, could, along with the North Sea oil \n     producing countries, become a real alternative to OPEC and \n     get significant political benefits.\n       The main advantage of the northern export route for Caspian \n     oil consists in the availability of a branched pipeline \n     network in Russia. It is much easier and cheaper to improve \n     and develop the existing system than to construct a new one. \n     I mean the pipelines owned by the Transneft company and the \n     recently constructed CPC line from Western Kazakhstan to the \n     Black Sea. The CPC alone cannot provide exporters with access \n     to the global market. For natural reasons, the Bosporus and \n     Dardanelles have a limited carrying capacity. The Black Sea \n     ecosystem is vulnerable, as this sea is warm and almost \n     closed. Turkey has already announced its intention to limit \n     the number of giant tankers passing through its straits. \n     Instead of forcing Turkey to agree by means of political \n     pressure, we should respect its fundamental interests and \n     seek other solutions in addition to the CPC capacities.\n       The pipeline would enable Russia to solve several of its \n     specific problems. For instance, to strengthen the special \n     status of the Kaliningrad region as Russia's outpost in \n     Western Europe. If the pipeline goes via the Kaliningrad \n     region, the region could not only solve some of its economic \n     problems, but also get additional security guarantees in case \n     of NATO's expansion to the East. A place of its own in the EU \n     economy would be the best guarantee for the region.\n       In any case, with any combination of routes, Russia would \n     be the main player in a Caspian-European project. Moreover, \n     Russia should initiate its realization. Technological and \n     economic calculations will give optimal solutions. However, \n     political will and vision are still primary considerations. \n     History teaches us that it is they rather than mathematical \n     and economic calculations that have brought into existence \n     such giant projects as the Suez and Panama Canals that formed \n     the global markets of those days.\n       Looking into the future and putting aside the required \n     political decisions, I would like to stress that the Russian \n     route could give an incredibly promising opportunity of \n     opening up global markets for Eurasian oil and gas. This \n     opportunity includes building an oil-carrier port in the \n     Murmansk region on the Barents Sea. The non-freezing, deep-\n     sea port would become the gateway to the global market for \n     Caspian, Siberian and, prospectively, for Timanoperchersk oil \n     as well, as the northern oil will require outlets to world \n     markets. In the Murmansk region, some former military ports \n     can reportedly be used right now by tankers. From there, they \n     can quickly and safely reach not only Western European ports, \n     but also the U.S. and Canada's eastern coast.\n       If gas-liquefying installations are built there, it would \n     be hard to imagine a more natural route for a pipeline which \n     will transport gas from the Russian polar regions and the \n     Arctic Ocean's shelf.\n       In addition to the oil pipeline, a parallel gas pipeline \n     should be built to provide Kazakh and Turkmen gas access to \n     global markets that will not compete with the existing \n     Russian gas routes to Western Europe. Constructing gas and \n     oil pipelines simultaneously will make it possible to \n     significantly cut capital expenditures and make \n     transportation for long distances economically viable. By the \n     way, the length of this route can be compared to the gas \n     export line running from Tyumen's north to Western Europe.\n       Today's situation on the gas market is such that the \n     Central Asian countries will long sit on their riches waiting \n     for investors hindered by the lack of access to global \n     markets. I am speaking not only about the\n\n[[Page S13696]]\n\n     Turkmen gas. The share of gas in the Caspian hydrocarbon \n     reserves can be much higher than those suggested by the most \n     optimistic forecasts. On the one hand, Caspian gas should be \n     available when the industrial world needs it badly. On the \n     other hand, Caspian gas won't be a rival for Russian gas and \n     a source of contention between Russia and its neighbors in \n     Central Asia.\n       Where the two huge pipelines run side by side, where a \n     joint exploitation system exists, one will naturally expect \n     to have a transcontinental highway and info-highway--a \n     powerful communication line originating from Europe and going \n     further to the south.\n       These prospects are both exciting and distant. However, \n     they should be taken into account when addressing today's \n     problems. No doubt, the global economy does have enough \n     investment resources for such a large-scale project. The U.S. \n     Congress has given $40 billion for primary measures to \n     safeguard national security. Much less investment is needed \n     to ensure energy security of the industrial states. \n     Especially as it is much more reasonable and profitable to \n     invest in crisis prevention than in recovering from them.\n       A pipeline bridge between the Caspian region and Western \n     Europe, Central Asia and the world's oceans will help solve \n     the problem of the globalization of Eurasian energy \n     resources. It could become a basis for an ``arc of \n     stability'' in Europe. It not only shifts the so-called arc \n     of tension running close to Russia from the Balkans via the \n     Caucasus, Central Asia, Iran, and Afghanistan, but will also \n     exclude the Caspian states--the critical link--from this \n     chain. When involved in the global economy, these countries \n     could turn into strongholds of stability in a part of Asia \n     that today poses major threats to the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13696-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN HONOR OF LUCY S. CICILLINE ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President. I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize a dear friend on her 90th birthday.\n  Lucy Cicilline, the daughter of Italian immigrants, was born Lucy \nMiragliuolo on December 26, 1911 in Providence, RI.\n  Lucy is the mother of four, the grandmother of twenty-one and the \ngreat grandmother of twenty-five. But more than this, Lucy is a vital, \nactive personality who has always lent a helping hand to others.\n  When I was a boy, Lucy lived close to our family's summer home at \nScarborough Beach in Narragansett, RI. Together with her husband, John, \nand her children, she was a wonderful friend to me and to my family. \nAlways a kind and caring person, she showered her affection and \nattention on all her neighbors. As a nurse, it was Lucy who tended to \nmy injured elbows and knees, and sometimes bruised spirit, during all \nthe times I fell down and encountered the other mishaps of childhood.\n  As a Registered Nurse, employed at St. Joseph's Hospital in \nProvidence, Lucy shared her kind and giving personality with her \npatients until her retirement.\n  But retirement did not stop her either. In 1980, at the age of sixty-\nnine and after the death of her husband of forty-seven years, Lucy \ndecided it was time for her to learn how to drive.\n  Lucy approached this task with the same dogged determination and \npositive attitude that she has with everything in her life. She took \ndriving lessons, received her license and continued to drive for the \nnext ten years until her declining eyesight took her off the road.\n  Still, despite her eyesight and her getting on in years, Lucy is an \nimportant member of her community. For over fifty years, she has been \ncontributing to the St. Joseph's Indian Tribe and has been named an \nhonorary member of their community.\n  Now at the Village at Waterman Lake in Smithfield, RI, Lucy is an \nactive adult who exercises and socializes with her fellow residents.\n  When I think of Lucy Cicilline, I recall the magic days of youth when \nI was surrounded and protected by adults like my parents and the \nCicillines who set an extraordinary example of kindness and commitment \nto faith and family and country. At many moments in my life, I drew on \nthose memories for inspiration and strength. Her example is with me \ntoday.\n  So today, I would like to thank Lucy for her kindness and her \nfriendship and also wish her the happiest of birthdays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13696-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13696-S13697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE URGENT NEED FOR BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to submit for the Record an \narticle written by Brian T. Kennedy, vice president of the Claremont \nInstitute, entitled ``The Urgent Need for Ballistic Missile Defense.'' \nPublished in the Imprimis publication of Hillsdale College, Mr. Kennedy \npersuasively argues that ``the United States is defenseless against \n[the] mortal danger . . . of a ballistic missile attack.''\n  In view of the events of September 11, I commend this article to the \nSenate for review as a cautionary warning to the U.S. Government of the \npotential danger of failing to meet its fundamental constitutional \nobligation to ``provide for the common defense.''\n  The article follows.\n\n                       [From Imprimis, Nov. 2001]\n\n             The Urgent need for Ballistic Missile Defense\n\n                         (By Brian T. Kennedy)\n\n       On September 11, our nation's enemies attacked us using \n     hijacked airliners. Next time, the vehicles of death and \n     destruction might well be ballistic missiles armed with \n     nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads. And let us be \n     clear: The United States is defenseless against this mortal \n     danger. We would today have to suffer helplessly a ballistic \n     missile attack, just as we suffered helplessly on September \n     11. But the dead would number in the millions and a \n     constitutional crisis would likely ensue, because the \n     survivors would wonder--with good reason--if their government \n     were capable of carrying out its primary constitutional duty \n     to ``provide for the common defense.''\n\n\n                           The Threat is Real\n\n       The attack of September 11 should not be seen as a \n     fanatical act of individuals like Osama Bin Laden, but as \n     deliberate act of a consortium of nations who hope to remove \n     the U.S. from its strategic positions in the Middle East, in \n     Asia and the Pacific, and in Europe. It is the belief of such \n     nations that the U.S. can be made to abandon its allies, such \n     as Israel, if the cost of standing by them becomes too high. \n     It is not altogether unreasonable for our enemies to act on \n     such a belief. The failure of U.S. political leadership, over \n     a period of two decades, to respond proportionately to \n     terrorist attacks on Americans in Lebanon, to the first World \n     Trade Center bombing, to the attack on the Khobar Towers in \n     Saudi Arabia, to the bombings of U.S. embassies abroad, and \n     most recently to the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, likely \n     emboldened them. They may also have been encouraged by \n     observing our government's unwillingness to defend Americans \n     against ballistic missiles. For all of the intelligence \n     failures leading up to September 11, we know with absolute \n     certainty that various nations are spending billions of \n     dollars to build or acquire strategic ballistic missiles with \n     which to attack and blackmail the United States. Yet even \n     now, under a president who supports it, missile defense \n     advances at a glacial pace.\n       Who are these enemy nations, in whose interest it is to \n     press the U.S. into retreating from the world stage? Despite \n     the kind words of Russian President Vladimir Putin, \n     encouraging a ``tough response'' to the terrorist attack of \n     September 11, we know that it is the Russian and Chinese \n     governments that are supplying our enemies in Iraq. Iran, \n     Libya, and North Korea with the ballistic missile \n     technology to terrorize our nation. Is it possible that \n     Russia and China don't understand the consequences of \n     transferring this technology? Are Vladimir Putin and Jiang \n     Zemin unaware that countries like Iran and Iraq are known \n     sponsors of terrorism? In light of the absurdity of these \n     questions, it is reasonable to assume that Russia and \n     China transfer this technology as a matter of high \n     government policy, using these rogue states as proxies to \n     destabilize the West because they have an interest in \n     expanding their power, and because they know that only the \n     U.S. can stand in their way.\n       We should also note that ballistic missiles can be used not \n     only to kill and destroy, but to commit geopolitical \n     blackmail. In February of 1996, during a confrontation \n     between mainland China and our democratic ally on Taiwan, Lt. \n     Gen. Xiong Guang Kai, a senior Chinese official, made an \n     implicit nuclear threat against the U.S., warning our \n     government not to interfere because Americans ``care more \n     about Los Angeles than they do Taipei.'' With a minimum of 20 \n     Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) currently \n     aimed at the U.S., such threats must be taken seriously.\n\n\n               the strategic terror of ballistic missiles\n\n       China possesses the DF-5 ballistic missile with a single, \n     four-megaton warhead. Such a warhead could destroy an area of \n     87.5 square miles, or roughly all of Manhattan, with its \n     daily population of three million people. Even more \n     devastating is the Russian SS-18, which has a range of 7,500 \n     miles and is capable of carrying a single, 24-megaton warhead \n     or multiple warheads ranging from 550 to 750 kilotons.\n       Imagine a ballistic missile attack on New York or Los \n     Angeles, resulting in the death of three to eight million \n     Americans. Beyond the staggering loss of human life, this \n     would take a devastating political and economic toll. \n     Americans' faith in their government--a government that \n     allowed such an attack--would be shaken to its core. As for \n     the economic shock, consider that damages from the September \n     11 attack, minor by comparison, are estimated by some \n     economists to be\n\n[[Page S13697]]\n\n     nearly 1.3 trillion dollars, roughly one-fifth of GNP.\n       Missile defense critics insist that such an attack could \n     never happen, based on the expectation that the U.S. would \n     immediately strike back at whomever launched it with an equal \n     fury. They point to the success of the Cold War theory of \n     Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). But even MAD is premised \n     on the idea that the U.S. would ``absorb'' a nuclear strike, \n     much like we ``absorbed'' the attack of September 11. \n     Afterwards the President, or surviving political leadership, \n     would estimate the losses and then employ our submarines, \n     bombers, and remaining land-based ICBMs to launch a \n     counterattack. This would fulfill the premise of MAD, but it \n     would also almost certainly guarantee additional ballistic \n     missile attacks from elsewhere.\n       Consider another scenario. What if a president, in order to \n     avoid the complete annihilation of the nation, came to terms \n     with our enemies? What rational leader wouldn't consider such \n     an option, given the unprecedented horror of the alternative? \n     Considering how Americans value human life, would a Bill \n     Clinton or a George Bush order the unthinkable? Would any \n     president launch a retaliatory nuclear strike against a \n     country, even one as small as Iraq, if it meant further \n     massive casualties to American citizens? Should we not agree \n     that an American president ought not to have to make such a \n     decision? President Reagan expressed this simply when he said \n     that it would be better to prevent a nuclear attack than to \n     suffer one and retaliate.\n       Then there is the blackmail scenario. What if Osama Bin \n     Laden were to obtain a nuclear ballistic missile from \n     Pakistan (which, after all, helped to install the Taliban \n     regime), place it on a ship somewhere off our coast, and \n     demand that the U.S. not intervene in the destruction of \n     Israel? Would we trade Los Angeles or New York for Tel Aviv \n     or Jerusalem? Looked at this way, nuclear blackmail would be \n     as devastating politically as nuclear war would be \n     physically.\n\n\n                  roadblock to defense: the abm treaty\n\n       Signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972, \n     the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty forbids a national missile \n     defense. Article I, Section II reads: ``Each Party undertakes \n     not to deploy ABM systems for a defense of the territory of \n     its country and not to provide a base for such a defense, and \n     not to deploy ABM systems for defense of an individual region \n     except as provided for in Article III of this Treaty.'' \n     Article III allows each side to build a defense for an \n     individual region that contains an offensive nuclear force. \n     in other words, the ABM Treaty prohibits our government from \n     defending the American people, while allowing it to defend \n     missiles to destroy other peoples.\n       Although legal scholars believe that this treaty no longer \n     has legal standing, given that the Soviet Union no longer \n     exists, it has been upheld as law by successive \n     administrations--especially the Clinton administration--\n     and by powerful opponents of American missile defense in \n     the U.S. Senate.\n       As a side note, we now know that the Soviets violated the \n     ABM Treaty almost immediately. Thus the Russians possess \n     today the world's only operable missile defense system. \n     Retired CIA Analyst William Lee, in the ABM Treaty Charade, \n     describes a 9,000-interceptor system around Moscow that is \n     capable of protecting 75 percent of the Russian population. \n     In other words, the Russians did not share the belief of U.S. \n     arms-control experts in the moral superiority of purposefully \n     remaining vulnerable to missile attack.\n\n\n                     How to Stop Ballistic Missiles\n\n       For all the bad news about the ballistic missile threat to \n     the U.S., there is the good news that missile defense is well \n     within our technological capabilities. As far back as 1962, a \n     test missile fired from the Kwajaleen Atoll was intercepted \n     (within 500 yards) by an anti-ballistic missile launched from \n     Vanderberg Air Force Base. The idea at the time was to use a \n     small nuclear warhead in the upper atmosphere to destroy \n     incoming enemy warheads. But it was deemed politically \n     incorrect--as it is still today--to use a nuclear explosion \n     to destroy a nuclear warhead, even if that warhead is racing \n     toward an American city. (Again, only we seem to be squeamish \n     in this regard: Russia's aforementioned 9,000 interceptors \n     bear nuclear warheads.) So U.S. research since President \n     Reagan reintroduced the idea of missile defense in 1983 has \n     been aimed primarily at developing the means to destroy enemy \n     missiles through direct impact or ``hit-to-kill'' methods.\n       American missile defense research has included ground-\n     based, sea-based and space-based interceptors, and air-based \n     and space-based lasers. Each of these systems has undergone \n     successful, if limited, testing. The space-based systems are \n     especially effective since they seek to destroy enemy \n     missiles in their first minutes of flight, known also as the \n     boost phase. During this phase, missiles are easily \n     detectible, have yet to deploy any so-called decoys or \n     countermeasures, and are especially vulnerable to space-based \n     interceptors and lasers.\n       The best near-term option for ballistic missile defense, \n     recommended by former Reagan administration defense \n     strategist Frank Gaffney, is to place a new generation of \n     interceptors, currently in research, aboard U.S. Navy Aegis \n     Cruisers. These ships could then provide at least some \n     missile defense while more effective systems are built. Also \n     under consideration is a ground-based system in the \n     strategically important state of Alaska, at Fort Greely and \n     Kodiak Island. This would represent another key component in \n     a comprehensive ``layered'' missile defense that will include \n     land, sea, air and space.\n\n\n                   Arguments Against Missile Defense\n\n       Opponents of missile defense present four basic arguments. \n     The first is that ABM systems are technologically \n     unrealistic, since ``hitting bullets with bullets'' leaves no \n     room for error. They point to recent tests of ground-based \n     interceptors that have had mixed results. Two things are \n     important to note about these tests: First, many of the \n     problems stem from the fact that the tests are being \n     conducted under ABM Treaty restrictions on the speed of \n     interceptors, and on their interface with satellites and \n     radar. Second, some recent test failures involve science and \n     technology that the U.S. perfected 30 years ago, such as \n     rocket separation. But putting all this aside, as President \n     Reagan's former science advisor William Graham points out, \n     the difficulty of ``hitting bullets with bullets'' could be \n     simply overcome by placing small nuclear charges on ``hit-to-\n     kill'' vehicles as a ``fail safe'' for when they miss their \n     targets. This would result in small nuclear explosions in \n     space, but that is surely more acceptable than the \n     alternative of enemy warheads detonating over American \n     cities.\n       The second argument against missile defense is that no \n     enemy would dare launch a missile attack at the U.S., for \n     fear of swift retaliation. But as the CIA pointed out two \n     years ago--and as Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld reiterated \n     recently in Russia--an enemy could launch a ballistic missile \n     from a ship off one of our coasts, scuttle the ship, and \n     leave us wondering, as on September 11, who was responsible.\n       The third argument is that missile defense can't work \n     against ship-launched missiles. But over a decade ago U.S. \n     nuclear laboratories, with the help of scientists like Greg \n     Canavan and Lowell Wood, conducted successful tests on space-\n     based interceptors that could stop ballistic missiles in \n     their boost phase from whatever location they were launched.\n       Finally, missile defense opponents argue that building a \n     defense will ignite an expensive arms race. But the \n     production cost of a space-based interceptor is roughly one \n     to two million dollars. A constellation of 5,000 such \n     interceptors might then cost ten billion dollars, a fraction \n     of America's defense budget. By contrast, a single Russian \n     SS-18 costs approximately $100 million, a North Korean Taepo \n     Dong II missile close to $10 million, and an Iraqi Scud B \n     missile about $2 million. In other words, if we get into an \n     arms race, our enemies will go broke. The soviet Union found \n     it could not compete with us in such a race in the 1980s. Nor \n     will the Russians or the Chinese or their proxies be able to \n     compete today.\n\n\n                          Time For Leadership\n\n       Building a missile defense is not possible as long as the \n     U.S. remains bound by the ABM Treaty of 1972. President Bush \n     has said that he will give the Russian government notice of \n     our withdrawal from that treaty when his testing program \n     comes into conflict with it. But given the severity of the \n     ballistic missile threat, it is cause for concern that we \n     have not done so already.\n       Our greatest near-term potential attacker, Iraq, is \n     expected to have ballistic missile capability in the next \n     three years. Only direct military intervention will prevent \n     it from deploying this capability before the U.S. can deploy \n     a missile defense. This should be undertaken as soon as \n     possible.\n       Our longer-term potential attackers, Russia and China, \n     possess today the means to destroy us. We must work and hope \n     for peaceful relations, but we must also be mindful of the \n     possibility that they have other plans. Secretary Powell has \n     invited Russia and China to join the coalition to defeat \n     terrorism. This is ironic, since both countries have been \n     active supporters of the regimes that sponsor terrorism. And \n     one wonders what they might demand in exchange. Might they \n     ask us to delay building a missile defense? Or to renegotiate \n     the ABM Treaty?\n       So far the Bush administration has not demonstrated the \n     urgency that the ballistic missile threat warrants. It is \n     also troublesome that the President's newly appointed \n     director of Homeland Security, Pennsylvania Governor Tom \n     Ridge, has consistently opposed missile defense--a fact \n     surely noted with approval in Moscow and Beijing. On the \n     other hand, President Bush has consistently supported missile \n     defense, both in the 2000 campaign and since taking office, \n     and he has the power to carry through with his promises.\n       Had the September 11 attack been visited by ballistic \n     missiles, resulting in the deaths of three to six million \n     Americans, a massive effort would have immediately been \n     launched to build and deploy a ballistic missile defense. \n     America, thankfully, has a window of opportunity--however \n     narrow--to do so now, before it is too late.\n       Let us begin in earnest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13697-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13697-S13698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARGARET MEAD'S 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask that the following \nstatement, and the excerpt from the Mead Centennial press release, be \nprinted in the Record in honor of Margaret Mead's 100th birthday:\n\n[[Page S13698]]\n\n  On December 16, Margaret Mead would have celebrated her 100th \nbirthday. As one of New York's Senators, I am proud that Margaret Mead \ncalled New York home for so many years. New York State has such a rich \nhistory of women who have made a difference at home and throughout the \nworld.\n  As my colleague Senator Chuck Hagel stated so well, Margaret Mead \n``was an American patriot who dedicated her life to understanding the \npeople and nations of our world. She respected the distinctiveness of \nvarious cultures . . . Margaret Mead took her responsibilities of \ncitizenship seriously by sharing her knowledge with those engaged in \npublic service.''\n  On the occasion of the Margaret Mead centennial, I hope that more of \ntoday's youth will be exposed to the lifework of this great woman, and \nwill be inspired to learn about cultures around the world. She devoted \nher life to studying other cultures, and to encouraging Americans to \ndevelop a desire to learn about other cultures.\n  The following excerpt from a Mead Centennial 2001 press release \ncaptures Margaret Mead's accomplishments, and their relevance to our \ncountry today:\n\n\n HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MARGARET MEAD: IN THE 21ST CENTURY HER IDEAS RING TRUE\n\n  ``How to describe Margaret Mead? Physically, she was short and pudgy, \nwalked with a light, firm step, wore a distinctive cape and carried a \ntall, forked walking stick. As an American icon, anthropologist, \nfuturologist, environmentalist, feminist, curmudgeon, and `grandmother \nto the world,' she stood for many different things in people's mind. \nAbove all she stood for the need for Americans to understand other \ncultures. Since September 11, it has become clear that this is an idea \nthat urgently needs to be reinforced.\n  As a young scientist, Mead traveled to Samoa, New Guinea, and Bali in \nthe 1920s and '30s to study more `primitive' societies, wanting to see \nwhat she, as an American and a westerner, could learn from cultures \nthat were so different from our own. Mead's theories about adolescence, \nsexuality, aggression, gender roles, and education opened up new ways \nof thinking about our own society. In later years, she studied more \ncontemporary cultures, but always with an eye toward learning about how \nbetter to understand ourselves and to interact in what was rapidly \nbecoming a multicultural world. Mead's ideas and thoughts are \ninextricably interwoven in our fabric today, many decades after her \nfirst studies of cultures, and nearly a quarter century after her \ndeath. While some still attract lively controversy, many of the \nconcepts we take for granted today in any discussion of cultural \ndifference, community, peace, gender, or human rights--were brought to \nthe forefront by Mead in the '30s, '40s, and '50s.\n  More than thirty books, dozens of films, and thousands of articles \nlater, her ideas continue to thrive and inspire. Her famous admonition, \n`Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can \nchange the world,' has become the motto of hundreds of community action \ngroups. For the Centennial, more than a dozen of her books have been \nreissued with new and timely introductions. Many organizations and \nindividuals across this country and around the world are taking time to \nremember Mead and reacquaint themselves with what she stood for, her \nwork, and its implications for the future. The Institute for \nIntercultural Studies (IIS), founded by Mead in 1944, continues under \nthe guidance of Mary Catherine Bateson, author, cultural anthropologist \nand Mead's only child. The Institute's mission, an increasingly \nimportant one, is to advance knowledge by creating and funding projects \nthat are likely to affect contemporary intercultural and international \nrelations. The IIS maintains a website, www.mead2001.org.\n  `If my mother were alive today, I know she would be on-line, using \nthe internet to communicate rapidly, to gather and discuss ideas, to \nbring people together,' says Bateson. `It is the continued interchange \naround her ideas that we hope to foster in commemorating her 100th \nbirthday.' Happy birthday, Margaret Mead--and let intercultural and \ninternational understanding reign in this new century.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13698-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13698-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/19/senate-section/article/S13698-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000--\n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 62\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit this report on the Nation's achievements in \naeronautics and space during Fiscal Year (FY) 2000, as required under \nsection 206 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, as \namended (42 U.S.C. 2476). Aeronautics and space activities involved 11 \ncontributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and \nthe results of their ongoing research and development affect the Nation \nin many ways.\n  A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place \nduring FY 2000. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n(NASA) successfully completed four Space shuttle flights. In terms of \nrobotic space flights, there were 24 U.S. expendable launch vehicle \nlaunches in FY 2000. Five of these launches were NASA-managed missions, \nnine were Department of Defense (DOD)--managed missions, and eight were \nFAA-licensed commercial launches. In addition, NASA flew on payload as \na secondary payload on one of the FAA licensed commercial launches. \nThis year, two new launch vehicles debuted: the Lockheed Martin Atlas \nIIIA and the Boeing Delta III, each serving as transition vehicles \nleading the way for the new generation of evolved expendable launch \nvehicles.\n  Scientists also made some dramatic new discoveries in various space-\nrelated fields such as space science, Earth science and remote sensing, \nand life and microgravity science. In aerospace, achievements included \nthe demonstration of technologies that will reduce the environmental \nimpact of aircraft operations, reinvigorate the general aviation \nindustry, improve the safety and efficiency of U.S. commercial airlines \nand air traffic control system, and reduce the future cost of access to \nspace.\n  The United States also entered into many new agreements for \ncooperation with its international partners around the world in many \nareas of space activity.\n  Thus, FY 2000 was a very successful one for U.S. aeronautics and \nspace programs. Efforts in their areas have contributed significantly \nto the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, international \ncooperation, a healthier environment, and a more competitive economy.\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. ALLEN:\n  S. 1848. A bill to provide mortgage payment assistance for employees \nwho are separated from employment; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Homestead \nPreservation Act.\n  It is a bill to provide displaced workers with access to low-interest \nloans to help cover monthly home mortgage payments while they are \nlooking for a new job. This is commonsense, compassionate legislation \ndesigned to help working families, who through no fault of their own, \nare adversely affected by international competition.\n  During the past months, all Americans have been deluged with grim \nnews\n\n[[Page S13702]]\n\nof recessions, plummeting consumer confidence and rising unemployment. \nSince October of last year, unemployment has jumped 1.8 percent, \nbringing the unemployment rate to 5.7 percent, the highest in over 6 \nyears. This is more than just a statistic. The 5.7 percent represents \n8.2 million people who are now without a job, a paycheck, and the means \nby which to provide their family with a sense of economic security, \nknowing that the bills will be paid, food is on the table, gifts will \nbe under the Christmas tree.\n  Virginia has not escaped the effects of the recession. While the \nunemployment is not as high as the national average, we have seen a 1.4 \npercent increase in unemployment from October 2000 to October 2001. \nThere were 20 mass layoffs in October, an increase of 8 from the year \nbefore. And there have been 2,713 new claims for unemployment benefits \nin October--almost double from October 2000.\n  While these are uneasy times for everyone, regions such as Southwest \nVirginia and Southside, with heavy concentrations in manufacturing--\nespecially the textile and apparel industries--have been especially \nhard hit. Nationwide, employment in apparel manufacturing lost more \nthan 10,000 jobs just last month. Factory employment has plummeted in \nthe past year and a half. One of every three layoffs in Virginia is \nfrom the manufacturing industry, although only one in six jobs \nthroughout the Commonwealth are in this sector. In Virginia, October \nwas the 15th consecutive month of factory job losses.\n  Virginia's Southside and Southwest regions are already suffering from \nthe economic effects of international competition, such as NAFTA. \nNationwide, an average of 37,500 Americans lose their jobs because of \nNAFTA-related competition each year. During the 1990s, Virginians saw \nthe loss of 15,400 apparel jobs--a decline of 54.3 percent--and 15,300 \ntextile jobs--a decline of 36 percent.\n  Fair and free trade is necessary if American businesses are to have \nthe opportunity to promote their goods and services and continue to \nexpand through growth abroad. NAFTA has created a net increase in \nemployment. As Governor of Virginia, I led several trade missions \nabroad to promote our products. We brought back agreements that \ninitially meant half a billion dollars in new investment and sales for \nVirginia, investments made possible only through fair and free trade.\n  But, while trade is helping our economy as a whole, there are many \ngood, hard working families, who have been adversely affected by \ninternational competition--especially in the textile and apparel \nindustries. Anytime a factory closes, it is a devastating blow to all \nof the families and businesses in the community and region.\n  While I was proud of the outstanding way the close-knit Southside and \nSouthwest communities in Virginia came together to help those who lost \ntheir jobs, when companies like Pluma and Tultex closed their doors, \nthey should not be forced to go through these times alone. After the \nTultex plant closing in Martinsville in early December of 1999, people \ndonated toys to the Salvation Army to make sure that Christmas came to \nthe homes of the thousands of laid off workers.\n  I am proposing that the Federal Government do its part to help people \nthrough these tough times. There are already thoughtful programs in \nplace, such as the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance program, \nthat helps workers get additional job skills training and employment \nassistance, and, provides extended unemployment benefits during job \ntraining. These programs are the result of the commonsense, logical \nconclusion that good, working people can lose their jobs because of \ntrade--not because they did anything wrong or because they don't want \nto work.\n  We ought to find a way to ease the stress and turmoil for people \nwhose lives are unexpectedly thrown into transition after years of \nsteady employment with a company that suddenly disappears. While these \nhard-working folks are finding appropriate employment, they should not \nfear losing their homes. For most people and families, their home is \nthe largest investment they make in life. Many have considerable equity \nbuild up.\n  Government agencies already have low-interest loan programs in place \nto help families who have met with unexpected economic disaster, such \nas a natural disaster like a hurricane, flood or tornado.\n  When a factory closes, it is an economic disaster to these families \nand their communities. The effects are just as far reaching and \ncertainly as economically devastating. Like a natural disaster, \nfamilies displaced by international competition are not responsible for \nthe events leading to the factory closings. The Federal Government \nought to make the same disaster loan assistance programs available to \nour displaced workers.\n  This is my rationale for introducing the Homestead Preservation Act. \nThis legislation will provide temporary home mortgage assistance to \ndisplaced workers, helping them make ends meet during their search for \na new job.\n  Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act authorizes the \nDepartment of Labor to administer a low-interest loan program--4 \npercent--for workers displaced due to international competition. The \nloan is for up to the amount of 12 monthly home mortgage payments. The \nprogram is authorized at $10 million per year, for 5 years. It \ndistributes the loan through an account, providing monthly allocations \nto cover the amount of the worker's home mortgage payment. The loans \ncould be paid off or repaid over a period of 5 years. No payments would \nbe required until 6 months after the borrower has returned to work \nfull-time. The loan is available only for the cost of a monthly home \nmortgage payment and covers only those workers displaced due to \ninternational competition and those who qualify for benefits under the \nNAFTA-TAAP and TAA benefits programs.\n  Like the NAFTA-TAAP and TAA benefits programs, the Homestead \nPreservation Act recognizes that some temporary assistance is needed as \nworkers take the time to become retrained and reeducated, expand upon \ntheir skills and search for new employment.\n  As Governor, there was nothing I enjoyed more than being able to \nrecruit and land investment from new or expanding enterprises in \nVirginia. By recruiting businesses, we brought new and better jobs for \nthe hard-working, caring people of Virginia. One example is Drake \nExtrusion from the United Kingdom, which chose Martinsville Industrial \nPark for its new carpet and bedding fiber manufacturing plant. It was \nannounced as a $12 million investment. It doubled in value at the \nofficial opening in 1996. It brought in additional small businesses. As \nof last year, Drake employed over 180 people.\n  Unfortunately, it can take time to bring in new companies and \nindustries to a region, just as it takes time to learn a new skill or \nearn a degree. Displaced families do not have time; they have monthly \nbills that must be paid, in full, no excuses. The Homestead \nPreservation Act provides the financial assistance necessary to bridge \nthe time it takes to find employment. Without this bridge, many working \nfamilies would not be able to take advantage of the opportunities our \nthere for them. They would be denied the necessary tools to help them \nsucceed in the changing economy.\n\n  The current recession has made it even more vital that the Federal \nGovernment do what is right by our workers in the textile and apparel \nindustries--in all industries suffering high rates of job losses due to \ninternational competition. Because of international competition, \ntextile and apparel workers are even more vulnerable to the current \neconomic situation making them ill-equipped to weather an economic \ndownturn. For example, in 1999, the average wage rates in Virginia for \na textile or apparel worker were 77 percent and 57 percent, \nrespectively, of the overall average wage rate for Virginians. This \nprovides for less money in the family's ``rainy day'' savings account. \nAnd right now, it is storming for these families. These jobs are not \ncoming back. Only about 70 percent of displaced factory workers find \nreemployment, well below the access-industry average.\n  Losses are expected to continue accumulating as the industries brace \nfor worldwide open trade, which is scheduled to begin in 2005. When \nthese workers are displaced, meager savings and temporary unemployment \nbenefits are\n\n[[Page S13703]]\n\nfrequently not enough to cover expenses that had previously fit within \nthe family budget. Without immediate help, these families, at the \nminimum, risk ruining their credit ratings and, in the worst-case \nscenario, could lose their home or car.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act would provide families vital temporary \nfinancial assistance, enabling them to keep them to keep their homes \nand to protect their credit ratings as they work toward strengthening \nand updating their skills and continue their search for a new job. \nHard-working Americans, facing such a harrowing situation, ought to \nhave a response to help them. People need transitional help now.\n  The Homestead Preservation Act provides the temporary financial tools \nnecessary for displaced workers to get back on their feet and succeed. \nIt is a caring, logical and responsible response.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise today to introduce the Homestead \nPreservation Act. This is a commonsense, compassionate place of \nlegislation that is designed to help working families who, through no \nfault of their own, lose their jobs as a result of international \ncompetition.\n  It is a bill to provide displaced workers with access to low-interest \nloans to help cover monthly home mortgage payments while they are out \nlooking for a job.\n  During the past few months, all Americans have been deluged with grim \nnews of recessions, plummeting consumer confidence, and rising \nunemployment\n  Clearly, these are uneasy times for everyone in all regions of the \ncountry, whether in the South, the Midwest, the Northeast, and out West \nas well, but particularly in the areas where there are heavy \nconcentrations of manufacturing. The textile and apparel industries \nhave been especially hard hit. That industry is generally in the South \nand, to some extent, in the Midwest.\n  Nationwide, employment in apparel manufacturing lost more than 10,000 \njobs just last month. That is in Virginia, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Arkansas, Missouri, and \nvarious other States.\n  Factory employment has plummeted in the past year and a half. In \nVirginia alone, about one out of every six jobs is in manufacturing. \nBut as far as the layoffs, one out of every three layoffs in Virginia \nis from the manufacturing industry.\n  I am a supporter of fair and free trade. I think trade is good for \nAmerican consumers. It is good for our retailers and our farmers. I \nthink it is necessary for our businesses and farmers to have \nopportunities to promote their goods, their products, their services \nabroad. That allows them to expand and grow.\n  I think NAFTA has created a net increase in employment. As Governor \nof Virginia, I led several trade missions abroad, whether to Canada, \nMexico, various countries in Western and Central Europe, as well as \nEast Asia. We brought back agreements that initially meant over a half \na billion dollars in new investment and sales for Virginia products. \nThese investments and sales in Virginia were only made possible by fair \nand free trade.\n  But while trade is helping our economy as a whole, there are many \ngood, hard-working people and families who have been adversely affected \nby international competition, particularly in the textile and apparel \nindustries.\n  Any time a factory closes, it is a devastating blow to all of the \nfamilies and, indeed, all of the businesses in the communities in that \nregion. You can see, with great pride, how communities come together--\nclose knit communities--and try to help out if a major manufacturer \nshuts down.\n  I remember back in December 2 years ago--in early December, 1999--\nwhen Tultex shut down. Thousands of jobs were lost. People donated toys \nto the Salvation Army, though, to make sure Christmas would come to \nevery family.\n  What I am proposing is that the Federal Government does its part to \nhelp people through these tough times, so that people and communities \nare not alone during these transitions.\n  There are already thoughtful programs in place. The NAFTA \nTransitional Adjustment Assistance Program helps workers get additional \njob skills in training and employment assistance, as well as provides \nextended unemployment benefits during job training.\n  These programs are the result of the good, commonsense, logical \nconclusion that working people can lose their jobs because of trade, \nnot because they did anything wrong or because they did not want to \nwork. They do want to work.\n  We ought to find a way to help ease the stress and turmoil for people \nwhose lives are unexpectedly thrown into transition after years of \nsteady employment with a company that suddenly disappears. Especially \nin textile areas, you see folks who have worked there for decades; some \nof their parents may have worked at that same mill or facility.\n  These are hard-working people. They are trying to find employment. \nBut while they are doing so, they should not have to worry about or \nfear losing their homes.\n  For most people, and most families, their home is the largest \ninvestment they will make in their lives. Many have considerable equity \nbuilt up in their homes that could be lost.\n  Government agencies already have low-interest loan programs in place \nto help families who have been hit with unexpected disasters--such as a \nnatural disaster, such as a hurricane or a tornado or a flood.\n  Whan a factory closes, it is truly an economic disaster to these \nfamilies and communities. The effects are just as far reaching and \ncertainly as economically devastating. Like a natural disaster, \nfamilies displaced by international competition are not responsible for \nthe events leading to those factory closings.\n  The Federal Government ought to make similar disaster loan assistance \nprograms available to our displaced workers. That is the rationale of \nmy introduction of the Homestead Preservation Act.\n  This legislation would provide temporary mortgage assistance to \ndisplaced workers, helping them make ends meet during the search for a \nnew job.\n  Specifically, the Homestead Preservation Act authorizes the \nDepartment of Labor to administer a low-interest loan program--4 \npercent--for workers displaced due to international competition.\n  The loan is for up to the amount of 12 monthly home mortgage \npayments. The program is authorized at $10 million per year for 5 \nyears. It distributes the loan through an account providing a monthly \nallocation to cover the amount of the worker's home mortgage payment. \nThe loans would be paid or repaid and paid off over 5 years, but no \npayments would be required until 6 months after the worker has gotten \nback on his or her feet in gainful employment. The loan would be \navailable only for the cost of the monthly home mortgage payment and \ncovers only those workers displaced due to international competition \nand who would qualify for the benefits under the NAFTA-TAAP and the \ntransitional adjustment assistance benefits programs.\n  Working within the parameters and the certification and \nqualifications of the NAFTA-TAAP and the TAA benefits programs, the \nHomestead Preservation Act recognizes some temporary assistance is \nneeded as workers take time to retrain and be reeducated and expand \nupon their skills and search for new employment.\n  This will provide, in effect, a bridge loan assistance to these \ndisplaced workers. If you look at it, the unemployment benefits are \nfine, but usually they are not enough to cover the expenses which \npreviously fit within a family budget.\n  Without immediate help, these families, at a minimum, risk ruining \ntheir credit ratings and, in the worst case scenario, could lose their \ncar or even their home. The Homestead Preservation Act would provide \nfamilies with vital temporary financial assistance, enabling them to \nkeep their homes, protect their credit ratings, and, as they work \ntoward strengthening and improving their skills, to continue to be able \nto search for a job without worrying about losing their homes. They are \nunder a harrowing situation. We ought to have a response to help them.\n  There are many people who need transitional help right away. As we \nmove forward to expand trade opportunities, let's also improve the \ntransitional adjustment assistance programs.\n\n[[Page S13704]]\n\nThe Homestead Preservation Act provides the temporary financial tools \nnecessary for displaced workers to get them back on their feet and to \nsucceed. In my view, it is a very caring, logical and responsible \nresponse.\n  I trust my colleagues will agree and support this reasonable, \nbalanced idea.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. His \nproposal sounds very interesting and very important. I look forward to \nlooking at the specifics of it. I appreciate his words.

The legislation will \nemphasize leak prevention and compliance with existing statutes. In \naddition, this bipartisan bill will assist communities in coping with \nthe contamination of groundwater and oil by methl tertiary butyl ether, \nMTBE.\n  In 1984, Congress enacted as Subtitle I of the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct a comprehensive program to address the problem of leaking \nunderground storage tanks. With the goal of protecting the Nation's \ngroundwater from leaking tanks, the 1984 law imposed minimum Federal \nrequirements for leak detection and prevention standards for USTs. In \n1988, owners and operators of existing underground storage tank systems \nwere given a ten-year window to upgrade, replace, or close tanks that \ndidn't meet minimum federal requirements for spill, overfill, and \ncorrosion protection. As the deadline passed on December 22, 1988, many \nunderground storage tanks failed to meet the federal standards.\n  To assess the situation, Senator Smith of New Hampshire and I \ncommissioned the U.S. General Accounting Office, GAO, to examine \ncompliance of USTs with Federal requirements. GAO concluded in May 2001 \nthat only 89 percent of tanks were meeting Federal equipment standards. \nIn addition, it also discovered that only 71 percent were being \noperated and maintained properly. GAO cited infrequent tank inspections \nand limited funding among the contributing factors.\n  Communities across the Nation have borne the brunt of our failure to \nprevent tank releases. Gasoline and fuel\n\n[[Page S13705]]\n\nadditives, such as MTBE, have contaminated groundwater and rendered it \nundrinkable. The Village of Pascoag, RI is just one community that has \nsuffered from MTBE contamination that can be traced to leaking \nunderground storage tanks. For months, residents of Pascoag have been \nunable to use the water supply for drinking, bathing, or cooking. \nHundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent to dilute the water \nwith a neighboring communities' supply, to install water filtration \nsystems, and to bring new wells on-line. Additional money will be spent \nto remediate the contamination and to take enforcement action against \nthe owners of the leaking tanks. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated \nincident. A similar story can be told in countless communities from New \nHampshire, to New York, to California.\n  To address these issues, the legislation that I introduce today, \ntogether with Senators Carper, Smith of New Hampshire, Jeffords, and \nInhofe, requires the inspection of all tanks every two years and \nincreases Federal emphasis on the training tank operators. It simply \ndoes not make sense to install modern, protective equipment if the \npeople who operate them do so improperly. Enforcement of existing \nrequirements, rather than creating new requirements, is an important \nelement of our bill. In addition, the legislation emphasizes compliance \nof tanks owned by Federal, State, and local governments, and provides \n$200 million for cleanup of sites contaminated by MTBE. Finally, the \nlegislation provides increased funding to carry out the program, which \nthe GAO has identified as critical to the success of the UST program.\n  Since its inception in 1984, the UST program has been largely \nsuccessful. More than one million outdated tanks have successfully been \nclosed or removed, and countless cleanups have been undertaken. We have \ncome a long way, but we must go further. Our legislation will build \nupon the successes of yesterday, so that we may enjoy the successes of \ntomorrow. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to move \nthis important bipartisan legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part C of title XVIII, of the Social \nSecurity Act to provide for continuous open enrollment and \ndisenrollment in Medicare+Choice plans and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, Kennedy, Feingold, Corzine, Reed, \nClinton, Kerry, and Kohl entitled the Medicare+Choice Consumer \nProtection Act is designed to ensure protections for Medicare+Choice \nbeneficiaries that are witnessing increased costs, decreased benefits, \nand fewer options to obtain affordable supplemental coverage for \nMedicare.\n  This legislation is a companion bill to H.R. 3267, legislation \nintroduced by Representative Pete Stark.\n  The Medicare+Choice program is an important option for many seniors \nand the disabled in this country, including 15 percent of seniors in \nthe State of New Mexico. This option must remain a viable one in the \nMedicare program, but due to the recent rounds of plan withdrawals, \nbenefit reductions, and cost increases that plans have undertaken \nwithin the program, there has been a growing level of insecurity among \nMedicare beneficiaries with respect to their health coverage.\n  Last year, I sponsored legislation, S. 2905, the Medicare+Choice \nProgram Improvement Act of 2000, to increase payments, including the \nminimum payment amount to Medicare+Choice plans. However, despite \npayment increases approved by the Congress last year, including some \nsubstantial increases in certain more rural areas of the country, we \nhave witnessed over 530,000 people recently lose their Medicare+Choice \ncoverage as a result of HMO pull-outs from the Medicare program, \nincluding some in areas that received these much higher payments.\n  Many others have also experienced increases in their costs through \nthe HMO or benefit reductions, including the elimination or substantial \nreduction of prescription drug coverage.\n  Therefore, while we must continue to explore mechanisms to ensure \nthat the Medicare+Choice program remains a viable one, it is clear that \neven if their push for higher payments is met that the plans may still \nchoose to pull-out of areas, decrease benefits, or increase costs to \nseniors. Despite ads being run by some Medicare+Choice plans that they \nwill provide ``health care for life,'' Medicare beneficiaries are \nseeing constant turmoil and change on a yearly basis. Some Medicare \nBeneficiaries have been dropped to have seen their benefits reduced or \ncosts increased by HMO's on yearly basis since the creation of the \nMedicare+Choice program in 1997.\n  In New Mexico, the result of last year's payment increases have \nresulted in a mixed outcome. Presbyterian's Medicare+Choice plan has \nreported that they are on track to achieve a profit margin of 3 to 4 \npercent on its M+C product in 2001 compared to a loss of around 15 \npercent in the prior year. In contrast, St. Joseph's M+C plan received \nthe substantial increase in its Medicare payment, and yet, eliminated \nprescription drug coverage to seniors through its HMO without notice to \nsome seniors this past March and still reports the system is up for \nsale and may completely change this coming year.\n\n  Beneficiaries are often left confused and uncertain. As 96 year-old \nBeulah Torrez of Espanola, New Mexico, said after the last round of \nMedicare+Choice plan changes, ``I just finally gave up. I couldn't \nafford anything. I couldn't afford the HMOs.''\n  As we continue to seek ways to improve Medicare+Choice coverage, we \nshould take immediate action to extend important consumer protections \nto Medicare beneficiaries who find themselves in a plan that no longer \nmeets their needs. To achieve these goals, the bill we are introducing \ntoday would.\n  (1) Eliminate the Medicare+Choice lock-in scheduled to go into effect \nin January 2002.\n  (2) Extend the existing Medigap protections that apply to people \nwhose Medicare+Choice plan withdraws from the program to anyone whose \nMedicare+Choice plan changes benefits or whose doctor or hospital \nleaves the plan.\n  (3) Prevent Medicare+Choice plans from charging higher cost-sharing \nfor a service than Medicare charges in the fee-for-service program.\n  Eliminating the lock-in would ensure that seniors and people with \ndisabilities continue to be allowed to leave a health plan that is not \nmeeting their needs. When St. Joseph's health plan eliminated \nprescription drug coverage from its Medicare plan earlier this year, \nMedicare beneficiaries were left without drug coverage but were at \nleast able to change their health plan at the end of the month. This \nflexibility will end in January 2002 unless this legislation is passed. \nIt is important that Medicare beneficiaries, often our nation's most \nvulnerable citizens, know that if they test an HMO and do not like its \nsystem, arrangements and rules that they will be able to leave and \nchoose a Medicare option that better suits their specific needs. Both \nadvocates and the managed care industry support this provision.\n  In addition, if a Medicare+Choice plan withdraws from a community or \nMedicare entirely, you can under current law move into a select \ncategory of Medigap plans, (A, B, C and F, without any individual \nhealth underwriting. this provision ensures that Medicare beneficiaries \nhave affordable supplemental Medicare options available to them when, \nthrough no fault of their own, their Medicare+Choice plan withdrawals.\n\n[[Page S13708]]\n\n  However, these protections for Medicare beneficiaries currently do \nnot apply with Medicare+Choice plans that make significant changes, \nsuch as eliminating benefits, increasing cost sharing, or changing \navailable providers, within the HMO but stop short of completely \nwithdrawing from the Medicare program. In the St. Joseph's case I \nmentioned above, seniors were unable to receive important Medigap or \nsupplemental Medicare coverage since the plan did not completely \nwithdraw from the service area.\n\n  For Medicare beneficiaries whose needs no longer are met by the HMO \ndue to such changes, a Medigap supplemental policy and a return to \nMedicare fee-for-service may often make better sense. Therefore, it is \ncritical to extend the current Medigap protections for when a plan \nterminates Medicare participation to beneficiaries in plans that have \nmade important changes to the benefits, cost sharing, or provider \noptions.\n  And finally, the third provision of the bill would prevent \nMedicare+Choice plans from charging higher cost-sharing for individual \nservices than occurs in the Medicare fee-for-service program. According \nto testimony before the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee by \nThomas Scully, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, on December 4, 2001,\n\n       . . . this year we have found that some plans proposed \n     charging beneficiaries what we believed were unreasonably \n     high copays for particular services .  .  . Thus, we have a \n     new challenge balancing the need for plans to make decisions \n     about their benefit packages and cost sharing amounts with \n     the important requirement that plan designs do not discourage \n     enrollment. The concern is always that high cost sharing \n     could discourage beneficiaries, who have greater health care \n     needs, from enrolling in or remaining a member of these \n     particular plans.\n\n  In the case of UnitedHealth Group's Medicare Complete option in \nWisconsin, that plan will begin charging a deductible of $295 a day for \na hospital stay up to a cap of $4,800 compared to a similar stay under \nfee-for-service Medicare which has a deductible of $812. While CMS did \nrequire the plan to reduce their proposed deductible from $350 to $295 \nper day, overall out-of-pocket costs can far exceed those that would \noccur in fee-for-service for many beneficiaries.\n  As Stephanie Sue Stein, Director of the Milwaukee County Department \non Aging, said at the same House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee \nhearing on December 4, 2001,\n\n       Beneficiaries will still be expected to pay up to $4,800 \n     out-of-pocket in addition to the $55 monthly premium for \n     United's coverage and the $54 monthly premium for Medicare \n     Part B. The excessive cost-sharing proposed by United raises \n     questions about the value of this so-called insurance. It is \n     now clear that many of the 16,000 seniors who have previously \n     relied on UnitedHealthcare to provide access to affordable \n     health care can no longer do so. It looks to us as though the \n     benefit changes for 2002 are designed to discourage \n     enrollment to beneficiaries who have health needs.\n\n  The question arises why we would allow Medicare+Choice plans to \neffectively diminish the value of Medicare benefits in this manner. \nWhile the Secretary has the authority under current law to prohibit or \nreduce some of the new cost-sharing arrangements that plans are \npreparing to impose, the change proposed by this legislation makes it \nclear that Medicare+Choice plans cannot charge patients more for a \nservice than the patient would face under the Medicare fee-for-service \nplan.\n  In fact, the ability of Medicare+Choice plans to charge higher cost-\nsharing for benefits or services than in fee-for-service results in \nfurther risk avoidance, or what is referred to as ``cherry picking,'' \nas plans seek to avoid or deny services to the chronically or severely \nill. This can have an adverse consequence for the health of people with \ndisabilities, limit their choices, and result in higher costs for the \nMedicare program. For all of these reasons, we should enact this \nprovision in short order.\n\n  While we are undertaking efforts to ensure that Medicare-Choice \nremains a viable option for Medicare beneficiaries, we must also ensure \nadditional protections for beneficiaries.\n  As Ms. Stein said in her testimony,\n\n       These plans now call themselves new things, complete and \n     secure and healthy, but they are not complete or secure or \n     healthy. They are radically different. These Medicare+Choice \n     policies are not the same ones people bought when they took \n     advantage of what they perceived to be the value-added \n     benefits sold to them as Medicare+Choice. In fact, they are \n     left with Medicare minus protection, Medicare minus the \n     ability to buy a Medigap policy, Medicare minus the ability \n     to choose different insurance.\n\n  In fact, according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund in April \n2001, ``31 percent of Medicare+Choice enrollees are in contracts where \nthe basic plan has a copayment requirement for hospital admissions, \ncompared with just 13 percent in 2000. Outpatient hospital copayments \nare being required of 45 percent of Medicare+Choice enrollees in 2001, \ncompared with only 29 percent in 2000.'' This will only increase \nfurther in 2002.\n  Therefore, to improve fundamental financial protections and health \ncare options for our nation's Medicare seniors and disabled enrollees, \nI urge the swift passage of this legislation.\n  The following organizations have expressed their support for this \nlegislation: AFSCME Retiree Program, Alliance for Retired Americans, \nAmerican Association of Homes and Service for the Aging, American \nAssociation for International Aging, American Federation of Teachers \nProgram on Retirement and Retirees, American Society of Consultant \nPharmacists, Association for Gerontology and Human Development in \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities, B'nai B'rith Center for \nSenior Housing and Services, California Health Advocates, Center for \nMedicare Advocacy, Congress of California Seniors, Eldercare America, \nFamilies USA, International Union--UAW, National Academy of Elder Law \nAttorneys, National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, National \nAssociation of Professional Geriatric Care Managers, National \nAssociation of Retired and Senior Volunteer Program Directors, National \nAssociation of Retired Federal Employees, National Association of \nSenior Companion Program Directors, National Association of State Units \non Aging, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \nNational Council on the Aging, National Renal Administrators \nAssociation, National Senior Citizens Law Center, and OWL--Voice for \nMidlife and Older Women.\n  I request unanimous consent that a fact sheet and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Kennedy (D-MA), Russ \n     Feingold (D-WI), Jon Corzine (D-NJ), Jack Reed (D-RI), \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), John Kerry (D-MA) and Herb \n     Kohl (D-WI) are preparing to introduce the ``Medicare+Choice \n     Consumer Protection Act of 2001.'' This legislation is a \n     companion bill to H.R. 3267, which was introduced by \n     Representative Pete Stark (D-CA).\n       This legislation would improve consumer protections to \n     Medicare beneficiaries seeking to enroll in Medicare+Choice \n     plans by:\n       Eliminating the Medicare+Choice lock-in schedule to go into \n     effect in January 2002;\n       Extending the existing Medigap protections that apply to \n     people whose Medicare+Choice plan withdraws from the program \n     to anyone whose Medicare+Choice changes benefits or whose \n     doctor or hospital leaves the plan; and\n       Preventing Medicare+Choice plans from charging higher cost-\n     sharing for a service than Medicare charges in the fee-for-\n     service program.\n\n\n                          need for legislation\n\n       Medicare+Choice Forthcoming Lock-In: Currently, Medicare \n     beneficiaries that are dissatisfied with their health plan \n     are allowed to enroll or disenroll from their health plans at \n     any time. As of January 2002, Medicare beneficiaries electing \n     the Medicare+Choice option will be required to ``lock in'' \n     with that plan for much longer periods. In fact, for 2002, \n     Medicare+Choice enrollees will only be allowed to switch \n     plans once during the first six months after enrollment. In \n     2003, the beneficiaries will only be able to switch once \n     during the first three months after enrollment.\n       The legislation eliminates the upcoming lock-in to ensure \n     that Medicare beneficiaries continue to be allowed to leave a \n     health plan that is not meeting their needs. Medicare \n     beneficiaries, often our nation's most vulnerable citizens, \n     need to know that if they test an HMO and do not like the \n     system, arrangements, and rules that they will be able to \n     leave to choose a Medicare option that better suits their \n     specific needs. Both advocates and the managed care industry \n     support this provision.\n       Medigap Protections When Medicare+Choice Plans Change \n     Benefits, Cost Sharing, or Provider Options: In addition, if \n     a Medicare+Choice plan withdrawals from a community or \n     Medicare entirely, beneficiaries can under current law move \n     into a select category of Medigap plans (A, B, C and F) \n     without any individual health underwriting. This provision \n     ensures that Medicare beneficiaries have affordable \n     supplemental Medicare options available to them when, through \n     no fault of their own, their Medicare+Choice plan \n     withdrawals.\n       However, these protections for Medicare beneficiaries \n     currently do not apply with Medicare+Choice plans that make \n     significant changes, such as eliminating benefits, increasing \n     cost sharing, or changing available providers, within the HMO \n     but stop short of completely withdrawing from the Medicare \n     program. For example, some plans now cover only generic \n     prescriptions, in effect eliminating drug coverage for \n     beneficiaries whose prescriptions have no generic equivalent. \n     For those Medicare beneficiaries whose needs are no longer \n     met by the Medicare+Choice plan due to these changes, the \n     legislation extends the current Medigap protections for \n     beneficiaries when a plan terminates Medicare \n     participation to those in plans that have made important \n     changes to their benefits, cost sharing, or provider \n     options.\n       Preventing Higher Cost Sharing in Medicare+Choice Than in \n     Fee-For-Service: Under current law, cost sharing per enrollee \n     (including premiums) for covered services cannot be more than \n     the actuarial value of the deductibles, coinsurance, and \n     copayments under traditional Medicare fee-for-service. \n     However, Medicare+Choice plans are increasingly charging \n     higher cost-sharing for individual services within the health \n     plan than is allowed in fee-for-service. Higher cost-sharing, \n     for example, is being required by some Medicare+Choice plans \n     for dialysis, hospitalization, and other services than in \n     traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n       In addition to creating an adverse consequence for the \n     health of Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities who have \n     certain illnesses, charging beneficiaries higher costs for \n     certain services results in what is referred to as ``cherry \n     picking,'' as some plans seek to avoid or deny services to \n     the chronically or severely ill. Again, this can have adverse \n     health effects for certain beneficiaries, limit their \n     choices, and resulting in higher costs for the Medicare \n     payment through ``risk selection.'' Consequently, this \n     legislation would close this loophole and prohibit \n     Medicare+Choice plans from imposing higher cost sharing for \n     certain services than is allowed in Medicare fee-for-service.\n\n\n                        Supporting Organizations\n\n       AFSCME Retiree Program.\n       Alliance for Retired Americans.\n       American Association of Homes and Service for the Aging.\n       American Association for International Aging.\n       American Federation of Teachers Program on Retirement and \n     Retirees.\n       American Society of Consultant Pharmacists.\n       Association for Gerontology and Human Development in \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n       B'nai B'rith Center for Senior Housing and Services.\n       California Health Advocates.\n       Center for Medicare Advocacy.\n       Congress of California Seniors.\n       Eldercare America.\n       Families USA.\n       International Union, UAW.\n       National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.\n       National Association of Area Agencies on Aging.\n       National Association of Professional Geriatric Care \n     Managers.\n       National Association of Retired and Senior Volunteer \n     Program Directors.\n       National Association of Retired Federal Employees.\n       National Association of Senior Companion Program Directors.\n       National Association of State Units on Aging.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       National Council on the Aging.\n       National Renal Administrators Association.\n       National Senior Citizens Law Center.\n       OWL, Voice for Midlife and Older Women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 1852.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will recognize all Native American Code Talkers who served as Code \nTalkers during World Wars I and II. Earlier this year, the Navajo Code \nTalkers were\n\n[[Page S13710]]\n\nrecognized by Congress and the President, and were presented with their \nCongressional Gold Medals. I was proud be a cosponsor of legislation \nintroduced by Senator Jeff Bingaman granting the medals and \nparticipating in the ceremony recognizing their great accomplishments.\n  Today, I am introducing similar legislation recognizing the over 17 \nother tribes who served our Nation and democracy across the world. \nThese brave men utilized their language to assist the allied forces, \nand subsequently saved the lives of thousands of men and women. Years \nago, the United States government policy towards Native people \nattempted to force the assimilation of millions of Native Americans and \nAlaskan Natives.\n  The United States government attempted to strip the culture and \nlanguage from the native peoples of this great land. We have learned \nthe lessons of the past, and I stand here today honoring these \ncourageous soldiers for preserving part of the very core of their \nculture. Their language.\n  It is tragic that we have waited so many decades for the recognition \nof these brave soldiers.\n  We cannot hope to make up for some of the wrongs that befell the \nNative peoples in the United States, or across North and South America. \nBut, we can continue to ensure that honor is continually bestowed upon \nthose men and women who fought for and defended our Nation, and the \npreservation of democracy on foreign lands.\n  Native Americans remain the most decorated ethnic group in our \nmilitary forces. I am honored that we are one step closer to honoring \nthose who deserve recognition that is long overdue. This truly marks a \nproud moment in our Nation's history.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring those Native Americans \nwho served as code talkers in World Wars I and II. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1854\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote \nemployer and employee participation in telework arrangements, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Burns, \nSenator Corzine, and Senator Baucus, I wish to introduce legislation of \ncritical importance to our Nation's workforce and economy.\n   The rapid spread of new telecommunications technologies has \ngenerated opportunities for firms across the country to improve upon \nthe traditional work environment. Today, millions of American workers \nparticipate in ``telework'' arrangements, otherwise known as \ntelecommuting, which allow them to work outside of their normal work \nlocation. Telework arrangements carry several advantages: the ability \nto spend more time with the children, less time wasted in traffic, \nenhanced productivity, and the environmental benefits of reduced carbon \ndioxide emissions. While teleworking grew substantially during the \n1990s, the number of teleworkers has reached a plateau, with little \nincrease in the last year. The social, economic, and environmental \ngains of teleworking are indisputable. Our legislation combines tax \nincentives and an employer awareness campaign to stimulate further \ngrowth in telework arrangements.\n   The term ``telework'' means to perform normal and regular work \nfunctions at locations other than the traditional workplace of the \nemployer, thereby eliminating or substantially reducing the physical \ncommute to and from the workplace. Given the opportunity, workers \nchoose overwhelmingly to participate in telework arrangements. \nEmployees who telework report an enhanced quality of life. 71 percent \nof teleworkers report being more satisfied with their job than before \nthey were permitted to telework. Working from home allows parents more \ntime with their children and reduces child care expenses. Teleworkers \nalso stay in their communities, providing enhanced security and \npresence.\n   If teleworking is implemented broadly in a community, the need for \nconstruction of additional automobile infrastructure, which is often \ndriven by peak period commuting demand, may be reduced. Even workers \nwho do not telework benefit since traffic congestion is lessened for \nthem as well.\n  There are also economic benefits. Data indicate that teleworking \nenhances productivity, both because teleworkers report being more \nproductive per unit time, and because the teleworker has available the \npreviously nonproductive commute time, an average of 62 minutes per day \nspent on an average 44 mile round-trip commute. Because teleworkers are \nable to mix work and personal needs, the number of occasions when they \nneed to be absent from work altogether diminishes. One study suggests \nthat the productivity improvement of home-based teleworkers averages 15 \npercent. Firms also benefit from eliminating unnecessary office space \nand reducing associated overhead costs. For example, one large national \nemployer reports that in 2000, their telework program resulted in $100 \nmillion in increased productivity, $18 million in reduced turnover, and \n$25 million in reduced real estate costs. Because of the enhanced \nquality of life and personal freedom that teleworking fosters, firms \nare better able to retain valued employees.\n   Telework arrangements are critical to keeping our economy and \nworkforce\n\n[[Page S13711]]\n\non the leading edge of technological developments. Teleworking \ncontributes to the residential deployment of broadband technology, \nwhich has otherwise stagnated. Teleworkers have a disproportionate need \nfor high-speed Internet access. Encouraging telework is a means of \ninducing greater demand for broadband technology.\n   Allowing employees to work from home saves energy and reduces carbon \ndioxide emissions associated with commuting. It also reduces vehicular \ncontributions to local and regional tropospheric pollution both \ndirectly and, by reducing congestion in general, indirectly. To the \nextent telework reduces demands for additional infrastructure, it also \nleads to less material use in construction and less land-use impact.\n   The Teleworking Advancement Act creates two tax-based incentives to \npromote the continued spread of employer-sponsored telework \narrangements and a pilot program to raise awareness about telecommuting \namong small business employers.\n   The employer telework tax credit would allow employers to claim a \ncredit of up to $500 for each employee who participates in an employer-\nsponsored telework arrangement during the taxable year. For employees \nwho telework on a partial basis, the credit would be prorated. \nEmployees of small businesses, those with 100 or fewer employees, and \ndisabled employees, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nwould be eligible for a maximum credit of $1,000. An employer-sponsored \ntelework arrangement is defined as an arrangement established by an \nemployer that enables employees of the employer to telework for a \nminimum of 25 days per year. The arrangement must be supported by a \nwritten agreement between the employer and each teleworking employee \nthat describes the terms of the arrangement.\n  The telework equipment tax credit would allow individuals or \nbusinesses to claim a credit equal to 10 percent of qualified telework \nexpenses paid, pursuant to an employer-sponsored telework arrangement. \nEither the employer or the employee, depending on who incurred the \nexpense, would be eligible for the credit. The maximum credit would be \n$500. For employees of small businesses (those with 100 or fewer \nemployees) and disabled employees, as defined by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the credit would be 20 percent of eligible expenses, \nwith a maximum credit of $1,000. Qualified telework expenses includes \nexpenses paid or incurred for computers, software, modems, \ntelecommunications equipment, and access to Internet or broadband \ntechnologies, including applicable taxes and other expenses for the \ndelivery, installation, or maintenance of such equipment.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes $5 million for the Administrator \nof the Small Business Administration to conduct a pilot program to \nraise awareness about telecommuting among small business employers and \nto encourage employers to offer telecommuting options to employees. \nActivities would include producing educational materials, conducting \noutreach, and acquiring telecommuting technologies and equipment to be \nused for demonstration purposes. Special efforts would be made to \nconduct outreach to businesses owned by or employing individuals with \ndisabilities.\n   The Teleworking Advancement Act will induce more employers to offer \nteleworking opportunities to their employees, creating broad-based \nbenefits for the American workforce and helping ensure that our economy \nremains at the forefront of 21st century workplace practices. Through a \ncombination of tax incentives and an employer awareness campaign, our \nlegislation will stimulate the spread of flexible, innovative, and \nproductivity-enhancing labor arrangements. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of the legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1856\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ESTABLISHMENT OF BASE ACRES AND PAYMENT ACRES FOR A \n                   FARM.\n\n       (a) Election by Producers of Base Acre Calculation \n     Method.--For the purpose of making fixed decoupled payments \n     and counter-cyclical payments with respect to a farm, the \n     Secretary shall give producers on the farm an opportunity to \n     elect one of the following as the method by which the base \n     acres of all covered commodities on the farm are to be \n     determined:\n       (1) The four-year average of acreage actually planted on \n     the farm to a covered commodity for harvest, grazing, haying, \n     silage, or other similar purposes during crop years 1998, \n     1999, 2000, and 2001 and any acreage on the farm that the \n     producers were prevented from planting during such crop years \n     to the covered commodity because of drought, flood, or other \n     natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control of \n     the producer, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (2) The sum of contract acreage (as defined in section 102 \n     of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \n     (7 U.S.C. 7202)) used by the Secretary to calculate the \n     fiscal year 2002 payment that, subject to section 109, would \n     be made under section 114 of such Act (7 U.S.C. 7214) for the \n     covered commodity on the farm and the four-year average \n     determined under paragraph (1) for soybeans and each other \n     oilseed produced on the farm.\n       (b) Single Election; Time for Election.--The opportunity to \n     make the election described in subsection (a) shall be \n     available to producers on a farm only once. The producers \n     shall notify the Secretary of the election made by the \n     producers under such subsection not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Effect of Failure To Make Election.--If the producers \n     on a farm fail to make the election under subsection (a), or \n     fail to timely notify the Secretary of the selected option as \n     required by subsection (b), the producers shall be deemed to \n     have made the election described in subsection (a)(2) to \n     determine base acres for all covered commodities on the farm.\n       (d) Application of Election to All Covered Commodities.--\n     The election made under subsection (a) or deemed to be made \n     under subsection (c) with respect to a farm shall apply to \n     all of the covered commodities on the farm.

FARMERS FOR AFRICA AND CARIBBEAN BASIN PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Many African farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin \n     countries use antiquated techniques to produce their crops, \n     which result in poor crop quality and low crop yields.\n       (2) Many of these farmers are losing business to farmers in \n     European and Asian countries who use advanced planting and \n     production techniques and are supplying agricultural produce \n     to restaurants, resorts, tourists, grocery stores, and other \n     consumers in Africa and Caribbean Basin countries.\n       (3) A need exists for the training of African farmers and \n     farmers in Caribbean Basin countries and other developing \n     countries in farming techniques that are appropriate for the \n     majority of eligible farmers in African or Caribbean \n     countries, including standard growing practices, insecticide \n     and sanitation procedures, and other farming methods that \n     will produce increased yields of more nutritious and \n     healthful crops.\n       (4) African-American and other American farmers, as well as \n     banking and insurance professionals, are a ready source of \n     agribusiness expertise that would be invaluable for African \n     farmers and farmers in Caribbean Basin countries.\n       (5) A United States commitment is appropriate to support \n     the development of a comprehensive agricultural skills \n     training program for these farmers that focuses on--\n       (A) improving knowledge of insecticide and sanitation \n     procedures to prevent crop destruction;\n       (B) teaching modern farming techniques, including the \n     identification and development of standard growing practices \n     and the establishment of systems for recordkeeping, that \n     would facilitate a continual analysis of crop production;\n       (C) the use and maintenance of farming equipment that is \n     appropriate for the majority of eligible farmers in African \n     or Caribbean Basin countries;\n       (D) expansion of small farming operations into agribusiness \n     enterprises through the development and use of village \n     banking systems and the use of agricultural risk insurance \n     pilot products, resulting in increased access to credit for \n     these farmers; and\n       (E) marketing crop yields to prospective purchasers \n     (businesses and individuals) for local needs and export.\n       (6) The participation of African-American and other \n     American farmers and American agricultural farming \n     specialists in such a training program promises the added \n     benefit of improving access to African and Caribbean Basin \n     markets for American farmers and United States farm equipment \n     and products and business linkages for United States \n     insurance providers offering technical assistance on, among \n     other things, agricultural risk insurance products.\n       (7) Existing programs that promote the exchange of \n     agricultural knowledge and expertise through the exchange of \n     American and foreign farmers have been effective in promoting \n     improved agricultural techniques and food security, and, \n     thus, the extension of additional resources to such farmer-\n     to- farmer exchanges is warranted.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Agricultural farming specialist.--The term \n     ``agricultural farming specialist'' means an individual \n     trained to transfer information and technical support \n     relating to agribusiness, food security, the mitigation and \n     alleviation of hunger, the mitigation of agricultural and \n     farm risk, maximization of crop yields, agricultural trade, \n     and other\n\n[[Page S13739]]\n\n     needs specific to a geographical location as determined by \n     the President.\n       (2) Caribbean basin country.--The term ``Caribbean Basin \n     country'' means a country eligible for designation as a \n     beneficiary country under section 212 of the Caribbean Basin \n     Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2702).\n       (3) Eligible farmer.--The term ``eligible farmer'' means an \n     individual owning or working on farm land (as defined by a \n     particular country's laws relating to property) in the sub-\n     Saharan region of the continent of Africa, in a Caribbean \n     Basin country, or in any other developing country in which \n     the President determines there is a need for farming \n     expertise or for information or technical support described \n     in paragraph (1).\n       (4) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Farmers for \n     Africa and Caribbean Basin Program established under this \n     section.\n       (c) Establishment of Program.--The President shall \n     establish a grant program, to be known as the ``Farmers for \n     Africa and Caribbean Basin Program'', to assist eligible \n     organizations in carrying out bilateral exchange programs \n     whereby African-American and other American farmers and \n     American agricultural farming specialists share technical \n     knowledge with eligible farmers regarding--\n       (1) maximization of crop yields;\n       (2) use of agricultural risk insurance as financial tools \n     and a means of risk management (as allowed by Annex II of the \n     World Trade Organization rules);\n       (3) expansion of trade in agricultural products;\n       (4) enhancement of local food security;\n       (5) the mitigation and alleviation of hunger;\n       (6) marketing agricultural products in local, regional, and \n     international markets;

Eligible farmers will be \n     trained to be specialists in their home communities and will \n     be encouraged not to retain enhanced farming technology for \n     their own personal enrichment.\n       (3) Through partnerships with American businesses, the \n     Program will utilize the commercial industrial capability of \n     businesses dealing in agriculture to train eligible farmers \n     on farming equipment that is appropriate for the majority of \n     eligible farmers in African or Caribbean Basin countries and \n     to introduce eligible farmers to the use of insurance as a \n     risk management tool.\n       (f) Selection of Participants.--(1) The selection of \n     eligible farmers, as well as African-American and other \n     American farmers and agricultural farming specialists, to \n     participate in the Program shall be made by grant recipients \n     using an application process approved by the President.\n       (2) Participating farmers must have sufficient farm or \n     agribusiness experience and have obtained certain targets \n     regarding the productivity of their farm or agribusiness.\n       (g) Grant Period.--The President may make grants under the \n     Program during a period of 5 years beginning on October 1 of \n     the first fiscal year for which funds are made available to \n     carry out the Program.\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2002 through 2011.\n\n     SEC. 312.

ESTABLISHMENT OF FOREST LAND ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There is a growing dependence on private nonindustrial \n     forest lands to supply the necessary market commodities and \n     nonmarket values, such as habitat for fish and wildlife, \n     aesthetics, outdoor recreation opportunities, and other \n     forest resources, required by a growing population.\n       (2) There is a strong demand for expanded assistance \n     programs for owners of nonindustrial private forest land \n     since the majority of the wood supply of the United States \n     comes from nonindustrial private forest land.\n       (3) The soil, carbon stores, water and air quality of the \n     United States can be maintained and improved through good \n     stewardship of nonindustrial private forest lands.\n       (4) The products and services resulting from stewardship of \n     nonindustrial private forest lands provide income and \n     employment that contribute to the economic health and \n     diversity of rural communities.\n       (5) Wildfires threaten human lives, property, forests, and \n     other resources, and Federal and State cooperation in forest \n     fire prevention and control has proven effective and \n     valuable, in that properly managed forest stands are less \n     susceptible to catastrophic fire, as dramatized by the \n     catastrophic fire seasons of 1998 and 2000.\n       (6) Owners of private nonindustrial forest lands are being \n     faced with increased pressure to convert their forestland to \n     development and other uses.\n       (7) Complex, long-rotation forest investments, including \n     sustainable hardwood management, are often the most difficult \n     commitment for small, nonindustrial private forest landowners \n     and, thus, should receive equal consideration under cost-\n     share programs.\n       (8) The investment of one Federal dollar in State and \n     private forestry programs is estimated to leverage $9 on \n     average from State, local, and private sources.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     strengthen the commitment of the Department of Agriculture to \n     sustainable forestry and to establish a coordinated and \n     cooperative Federal, State, and local sustainable forest \n     program for the establishment, management, maintenance, \n     enhancement, and restoration of forests on nonindustrial \n     private forest lands in the United States.\n       (c) Forest Land Enhancement Program.--The Cooperative \n     Forestry Assistance Act of 1978 is amended by inserting after \n     section 3 (16 U.S.C. 2102) the following new section 4:\n\n     ``SEC. 4.
