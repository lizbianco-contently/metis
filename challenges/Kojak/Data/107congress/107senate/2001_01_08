We ask that You would bless \nthese Senators as Your servants. They have come with their hearts and \nminds filled with great agendas, but even these, our leaders, are never \nmore than mortals on a journey from dust to dust. So it is to you that \nwe look for sacred visions that are greater than party visions and \ncertainly greater than the visions any one of us could carry into this \nChamber. By Your Holy Spirit, accommodate Your will to our political \nprocess, that it may be used to lead this Nation to Your own future \nfilled with hope. And when the day is done and this Chamber is again \nempty, may all who have come here to serve the Republic know that their \nwork has not been in vain. Encourage them in the certain conviction \nthat they will one day hear from You: Well, done, good and faithful \nservants.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a colloquy \nbetween Senators Daschle and Lott regarding S. Res. 8, the organizing \nresolution passed by the Senate last Friday, be printed in today's \nRecord, and that the permanent Record be corrected to provide for its \ninclusion with the resolution when it passed the Senate last Friday.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The material ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows:\n\n\n                          SENATE ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The resolution just agreed to represents an honorable \ncompromise between the two parties on how best to organize the Senate \nin the 107th Congress. It was agreed to only after extensive \nnegotiations between the two leaders, and after thorough consultation \nwith all Senators. Although there were difficult issues presented, and \nthe two sides approached those issues from very different points of \nview, in the end we were able to reach an agreement that, we hope, will \nallow the Senate to take up and act on the Nation's business in a \nbipartisan manner. In the meantime, we both agree that this situation \nis new ground and some things may have been overlooked in the crafting \nof this resolution. I would therefore acknowledge that there may be an \nadditional need to revisit this issue at a later date.\n  Mr. LOTT. I concur with the assessment of the majority leader, \nSenator Daschle. The unique circumstances presented by this historic \n50-50 Senate created significant challenges in organizing the Senate, \nand those circumstances required both sides to compromise. Having both \nmet with our respective conferences, we both have discovered the \npotential need in the future to revisit some of the items contained in \nthis agreement. I think it is fair to say that we will deal with the \nnew issues in good faith as they arise. After a great deal of effort, \nSenator Daschle and I have found a way to, in essence, meet half way. \nThat is what this resolution does.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will briefly describe the provisions of the \nresolution.\n  First, it provides that the membership of Senate committees will be \nequally divided between the two parties, and that, consistent with a \nseparate resolution passed on January 3, 2001, all committees will be \nchaired by\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nRepublican Senators beginning at noon on January 20.\n  Second, the resolution provides that committee budgets and office \nspace will be divided equally, subject to the customary set-asides for \nadministrative expenses and so-called non-designated staff. It is our \nexpectation that the details of those arrangements will be negotiated \nand agreed to by the respective chairman and ranking members of the \ncommittee, in consultation with other members of each committee. It \nwill also be left to the committees, as is customary at the beginning \nof each new Congress, to agree to committee rules of procedure.\n  Further, the resolution provides that committee administrative \nexpenses may be increased where necessary, but that the total \nadministrative expense allocation for all committees shall not exceed \nhistoric levels. I would add that my understanding of this provision is \nthat it will result in little or no net increase in the total amounts \nspent by committees on administrative expenses.\n  Third, it provides, in the case of a tie vote in committee on a bill \nor nomination, that either leader may move to discharge the committee, \nand that after 4 hours of debate, equally divided, the Senate proceed \nto vote on the motion to discharge. If the motion is agreed to, the \nbill or nomination would be placed on the calendar. Similarly, in the \ncase of a tie vote in a subcommittee on a legislative item or \nnomination, the resolution authorizes the committee chairman to \ndischarge the subcommittee and place the legislative item or nomination \non the full committee agenda.\n  Fourth, the resolution provides that no cloture motion shall be filed \nby either party except to bring to a close debate, and that in no case \nshall cloture be filed before the expiration of 12 hours of debate.\n  Fifth, it stipulates that it shall continue to be considered the \nprerogative of the majority leader to make motions to proceed--although \nthe resolution does not affect the existing right of every Senator to \nmake a motion to proceed if he or she chooses to do so.\n  Sixth, it provides that in scheduling and debating all legislative \nand executive business in the Senate, both leaders shall seek to attain \nan equal balance of the interests of the two parties.\n  Finally, it provides that should either party attain a majority of \nthe whole number of Senators during the 107th Congress, a new \norganizing resolution would be required. I would add that it is the \nexpectation of the two leaders that if the ratio in the full Senate \nchanges to 51-49, then a resolution instituting one-seat margins in all \ncommittees would be necessary.\n  That summarizes the basic provisions of the resolution. Does the \ndistinguished Republican leader wish to comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. The majority leader has described the resolution \naccurately. I would add only that it is my hope and expectation that \ntie votes in committee will be the exception and not the norm in this \nCongress, and that the discharge provisions of the resolution will \nrarely if ever have to be used. Given the unique nature of this 50-50 \nSenate, and the closely-divided nature of the country, it is my hope \nthat committee chairmen and ranking members will strive to achieve \nstrong, bipartisan majorities for all legislation and nominations \nconsidered in their committees, and that all Senators will work \ntogether in that spirit. Senator Daschle and I agree that this \nrepresents the wisest approach and will give us the best chance of \nsuccess in addressing the needs of the American people.\n  With respect to the ratios of members on conferences, we both \nunderstand that under previous Senate practices, those ratios are \nsuggested by the majority party and if not acceptable by the minority \nparty, their right to amend and debate is in order. We both agree that \nthe intention of this resolution is not to alter that practice and this \nresolution does not serve to set into motion any action that would \nalter that practice in any way. The two leaders agree to work together \nto ensure that conferees are appointed in a fair and bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In addition to the provisions just discussed, the \ndistinguished Republican leader and I have reached understandings on \nseveral related matters, which I believe he would like to describe.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator is correct; we have reached understandings on \nthe following related issues.\n  First, I have discussed with the majority leader concerns that have \nbeen raised about the floor procedure known as ``filling the amendment \ntree.'' Senator Daschle and I appreciate and understand those concerns, \nand we wish to assure Senators that it is our intention that the Senate \nhave full and vigorous debates in this 107th Congress, and that the \nright of all Senators to have their amendments considered will be \nhonored. We have therefore jointly agreed that neither leader, nor \ntheir designees in the absence of the leader, will offer consecutive \namendments to fill the amendment tree so as to deprive either side of \nthe right to offer an amendment. We both agree that nothing in this \nresolution or colloquy limits the majority leader's right to amend a \nnonrelevant amendment nor does it limit the sponsor of that nonrelevant \namendment from responding with a further amendment after the majority \nleader's amendment or amendments are disposed of.\n  Second, we have agreed that the two parties will have equal access to \ncommon space in the Capitol complex for purposes of holding meetings, \npress conferences, and other events.\n  Finally, we have agreed that henceforth the duties of presiding \nofficer of the Senate, now under the control of the majority party, \nwill be shared in part by the minority party.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Republican \nleader. I also want to assure him that during the 17 days in which \nDemocrats will hold the majority, we intend to operate in the most \nbipartisan manner possible. As I have said before, in a 50-50 Senate, \nbipartisanship is not just an option, it's a requirement. This \nresolution enables the Senate to get to work immediately on the \nNation's business--including nomination hearings, some of which have \nalready begun. I thank my friend the Republican leader, and all Members \nof the Senate, for their cooperation and good faith in allowing us to \nreach agreement on this important measure. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/08/senate-section/article/S54-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S54-S55]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on January 8, 2001, by the President \nof the United States: Protocol to Amend the 1949 Convention on the \nEstablishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (Treaty \nDocument 107-2).\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol to Amend the 1949 \nConvention on the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna \nCommission, done at Guayaquil, June 11, 1999, and signed by the United \nStates, subject to ratification, in Guayaquil, Ecuador, on the same \ndate. In addition, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Protocol. The \nProtocol will not require implementing legislation.\n  The Protocol amends the Convention for the Establishment of an Inter-\nAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission, done at Washington May 31, 1949, and \nentered into force March 3, 1950 (the ``Convention''), to allow the \nEuropean Union to become a member of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna \nCommission (IATTC) created under the Convention. Presently, the \nConvention is only open to governments of states. The Protocol will, \nupon entry into force, allow regional economic integration \norganizations like the European Union to become a party to the \nConvention and a full member of the\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nIATTC provided all parties to the Convention give their consent to such \nadherence. The Protocol also provides that the Member States of any \nregional economic integration organization that is allowed to adhere to \nthe Protocol are barred from joining or continuing as a party to the \nConvention except with respect to the Member States' territories that \nare outside the territorial scope of the treaty establishing the \nregional economic integration organization.\n  Allowing the European Union to accede to the Convention is important \nto the United States because it would mean that the vessels operating \nunder the jurisdiction of the European Union and its Member States \nwould be bound by the conservation and management measures adopted by \nthe IATTC for the fishery resources of the eastern Pacific Ocean.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n                                      The White House, January 8, 2001.\n\n  Mr. REID.
