All through this day we will live the \npsalmist's admonition for successful living: ``Commit your way to the \nLord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass.''--Psalm 37:5. \nWe claim the meaning of the word ``commit'' in Hebrew as ``to roll \nover.'' We roll over our burdens from our shoulders onto Your mighty \nshoulders.\n  We begin this day very conscious of the burdens we have tried to \ncarry ourselves: personal needs, physical problems, concerns for people \nwe love, friends about whom we worry, plus all the responsibilities of \nwork, and our unfinished projects and proposals. We take all of these \nand roll them over onto You. We trust You to give us strength to work \ntoday free of fretting frustration. We accept Your invitation through \nPeter: ``Let God have all your worries and cares, for He is always \nthinking about you and watching everything that concerns you.''--1 \nPeter 5:7, Living Bible.\n  Thank You, that You have lightened our load of what we could not \ncarry alone and strengthened our backs for what You call us to carry \nwith Your help.

Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof H.R. 2356, the Campaign Finance Reform Act. Cloture was filed \nyesterday. Therefore, Senators have until 12:30 today to file first-\ndegree amendments. Unless agreement is reached on final passage of \ncampaign finance, the Senate will vote on cloture tomorrow morning.\n  While negotiations continue on campaign finance, we expect to resume \nconsideration of the energy reform bill. I see Senator Feingold. We \nwill be happy if there are statements he or others wish to make on that \nlegislation. But as I have indicated, unless there is some movement in \nthe way of some amendments, we will try to get back to the energy \nreform bill.\n  Senator Feinstein is here to move forward on the matter on which she \nand Senator Gramm have been working for about a week now.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know there have been a lot of negotiations back and forth \non getting agreement on how to proceed on campaign finance reform. I \nwas under the impression that perhaps an agreement was close.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. LOTT. Do you have information on that, and when do you expect we \nwould try to enter into an agreement? Because obviously that affects \nthe schedule of how we proceed on other issues, the energy bill in \nparticular.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Daschle has authorized me to say that whenever \nthere is agreement, he will move forward on it immediately. The fact \nis, there just has not been one yet, to my knowledge.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I could speak just for a moment--and \nI thank the minority leader--just to make it clear, the cloture motion \nhas been filed. It will ripen tomorrow. Regardless of the other \ndiscussions and negotiations, our understanding is that will go \nforward. There are, however, negotiations going on with regard to some \ntechnical aspects, and we hope that can be worked out.\n  I want to be clear because sometimes it seems as if, in these \nconversations, people think the two are linked and nothing will move \nforward. The campaign finance bill is going forward and it will be \nvoted on tomorrow, as a cloture vote, unless there is some agreement. \nBut, yes, as the minority leader has suggested, there are some \nconversations and discussions going on that we hope will be fruitful.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Wisconsin, that is what I did say \nearlier. We have the votes scheduled tomorrow, and I ask Senators to \nfile amendments, if they have them, by 12:30 today. It is my \nunderstanding, I say to both the Republican leader and\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\nthe Senator from Wisconsin, that any agreement that is being talked \nabout will call for a vote tomorrow anyway. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I think we can look forward to a cloture vote tomorrow on \nthis bill, regardless of what happens.\n  I hope there will be some progress on the energy bill. In addition to \nthe work of Senator Feinstein, we also have the alternative fuels \nproblem we wish to have resolved. I hope Senator Kyl will come over as \nsoon as possible today to offer his amendment. That would pretty much \ndo for the alternative fuels problems we have with this legislation.\n  So it is contemplated there will be rollcall votes in relation to the \nenergy bill throughout the day.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. today for our weekly \nparty conferences. I appreciate everyone's courtesy, waiting while I \nmade this brief announcement. I do hope, though, that everyone \nunderstands we are going to try to move forward on the legislation we \nhave before us, campaign finance reform, and it is my understanding we \ncan only get to the energy bill today after having moved off campaign \nfinance reform. Is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2018-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2018]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senators \nFitzgerald, Cantwell, Corzine, Wyden, Leahy, Boxer, and Durbin in \nmodifying our amendment on energy derivatives.\n  As you know, we discussed this issue on the floor before, and the \nsenior Senator from Texas had some concerns. So we spent a good deal of \ntime talking with him and his staff. We have also kept in touch with \nour cosponsors. We have agreed on some modifications. There are some \nmodifications that the Senator from Texas sought that the cosponsors \nand I could not agree to. So this modification represents where we \nagree and not where we disagree.\n  I begin by explaining two terms in the amendment. The first term is \n``a derivative.'' A derivative is a financial instrument traded on or \noff an exchange, the price of which is directly dependent upon an \nunderlying commodity, such as natural gas or electricity. An ``over-\nthe-counter'' or ``swap'' contract is an agreement whereby a floating \nprice is exchanged for a fixed price over a specified period. It \ninvolves no transfer of physical energy, and both parties settle their \ncontractual obligations in cash.\n  Although energy derivatives make up only 4 percent of all derivative \ntransactions, energy swaps make up 80 percent of all energy \nderivatives. So these are important terms.\n  What our amendment does is subject electronic exchanges, such as \nEnron Online, Dynegydirect, and IntercontinentalExchange--these \nexchanges trade energy derivatives--to the similar oversight reporting \nand capital requirements as other exchanges, such as the Chicago \nMercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago \nBoard of Trade. However, since the vast majority of energy derivative \ntransactions are over the\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\ncounter, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has insufficient \nauthority, at present, to investigate and prevent fraud and price \nmanipulation, and parties making these trades are not required to keep \nrecords of their trades. In other words, there is no transparency. \nThere is no record and there is no oversight of these particular \ntrades.\n  So our amendment simply requires these parties to keep records of \ntheir transactions, which is what most companies do in any event.\n  If it turns out there is a fraud allegation, the CFTC will have a \nrecord to review. This is the same fraud and manipulation authority the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission has for every other commodity and \nit is the same authority they had until Congress passed the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act in 2000. That act exempted energy and metals \ntrading from regulatory oversight, and excluded it completely if the \ntrade was done electronically. Before this act, it was all included. \nFollowing the act, it was excluded. That was around June of 2000.\n  The problem and why we need this legislation: Presently, energy \ntransactions--those about which I am not speaking, but the other energy \ntransactions--are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nwhen there is actually a delivery of the energy commodity.\n  What do I mean? If I buy natural gas from you, and you deliver that \nnatural gas to me, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the \nauthority to ensure that this transaction is both transparent and \nreasonably priced. In other words, FERC has regulatory authority when \nthe energy is actually delivered. However, energy transactions have \nbecome increasingly complex over the past decade. So, today, energy \ntransactions do not always result in a direct delivery, and thus a \ngiant loophole has opened where there is no transparency, no records, \nand no oversight. And that is not when I sell it to you to deliver it \nbut when I sell it to you and you sell it to somebody else, who sells \nit to somebody else, who sells it to somebody else, and then it is \ndelivered. Those interim trades are in no way, shape, or form \ntransparent. They are done in secret. There is no oversight and there \nis no record.\n\n  So I can purchase from you a derivatives contract, which is a promise \nthat you will deliver natural gas to me at some point in the future. I \nmay never need to physically own that gas, so I can at a small profit \nsell that gas to someone, who can then turn around and sell it yet to \nsomeone else, and so on and so forth, as I have just pointed out. The \npromise of a gas delivery can literally change hands dozens of times \nbefore the commodity is ever delivered. Even then, it may never get \ndelivered if the spot market price is lower than the future price that \ncomes due on that day. That is what I meant about saying it is very \ncomplicated.\n  In fact, about 90 percent of the energy trades represent purely \nfinancial transactions, not regulated by either the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, or the CFTC. So as long as there is no delivery, \nthere is no price transparency. We do not know the price or the terms \nfor 90 percent of the energy transactions. Let me repeat that. Today, \nno one knows the price or the terms for 90 percent of the energy \ntransactions.\n  Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only applies to \nenergy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat or pork bellies or \nany other tangible commodity. As I said, there is a very big loophole \nhere. What we seek to do is simply close that loophole.\n  How did this happen? The answer is, the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act, signed into law in 2000, exempted energy and \nminerals trading from regulatory oversight and also exempted electronic \ntrading platforms from oversight. That is the online trading that \noccurs. In a sense, what the legislation did was set up two different \nsystems: treating electronic trading platforms differently from other \nplatforms, and treating energy commodities different from other \ncommodities.\n  Up until 2000, energy derivative transactions were regulated in a \nsimilar fashion to other transactions, and all energy transactions were \nsubject to antifraud and antimanipulation oversight. Electronic trading \nplatforms were treated like all other platforms. These were the \nstandards that were in place until June of 2000. Up until that time, if \na gas or electricity commodity was delivered, FERC had oversight, and \nthere was transparency; if there was not delivery, the CFTC had the \nauthority. So the loophole arose just 2 years ago.\n  At the time of the 2000 legislation, no one knew how the exemptions \nwould affect the energy market. It was a new market. They wanted to see \ngrowth. So they kind of unleashed it and said: All this can go on \nwithout the light of day.\n\n  We have a much better idea today because of what we have learned \nsince then. It didn't take long for Enron Online and others in the \nenergy sector to take advantage of this new freedom--and, to an extent, \nsecrecy--by trading energy derivatives absent any regulatory oversight \nor transparency. Thus, after the 2000 legislation was enacted, Enron \nOnline began to trade energy derivatives bilaterally, over the counter, \nin a one-to-one transaction, without being subject to any regulatory \noversight whatsoever.\n  It should not surprise anyone that, without transparency, prices went \nright up. Was Enron and its energy derivatives trading arm, Enron \nOnline, the sole reason California and the West had an energy crisis 18 \nmonths ago? Of course not. Was it a contributing factor to the crisis? \nI believe it was.\n  Unfortunately, because of the energy exemptions in the 2000 \nCommodities Futures Modernization Act, which took away the CFTC's \nauthority to investigate, we may never know for sure since there are no \nrecords.\n  For me, this issue comes down to some fundamental questions. Why \nshouldn't there be transparency in the energy market? Why should the \nCFTC not have antifraud, antimanipulation authority when there is fraud \nand manipulation in the market? And why shouldn't California's energy \nratepayers and customers and consumers and ratepayers in other States \nenjoy the same CFTC protections as ranchers and farmers do today?\n  The modification of our amendment results from the discussions my \ncosponsors and I had with Senator Phil Gramm, who approached us to \nexpress his concern that our bill could inadvertently impact financial \nderivatives. We made several changes to accommodate Senator Gramm's \nconcerns, and we were hopeful we could reach agreement with him. \nHowever, there are four additional points where we did not reach \nagreement: exempting energy swaps from CFTC antifraud and \nantimanipulation authority; deleting all public price-transparency \nrequirements; exempting all electronic exchanges from requirements that \nthey maintain sufficient capital to carry out their operations, based \non risk; and finally, eliminating metal derivatives from oversight.\n  As I said before, energy swaps--this is a point of contention between \nus--comprise as much as 80 percent of energy derivatives transactions \nso this change would have taken the teeth out of our amendment. We \nconsulted with our cosponsors. They did not want to agree to it. I \nbelieve Senator Fitzgerald is coming to the Chamber to speak to this.\n  Additionally, our amendment states that electronic trading forums \nshould hold capital commensurate with the risk, which seems a \nreasonable expectation to me. The public can already access information \nfrom nonelectronic exchanges simply by picking up the business section \nof a daily newspaper. I don't understand the rationale for wanting to \nlimit the public's access to data on electronic exchanges.\n  There is ample evidence that fraud and manipulation can occur and \nhave already occurred in the metal sector.\n  This was borne out by several scandals over the past decade, \nincluding the 1996 Sumitomo case. In Sumitomo, it was found that U.S. \nconsumers were overcharged $2.5 billion because of a Japanese company's \nmanipulation of the copper markets. These were changes that we simply \ncould not agree to.\n  Why do my cosponsors and I feel so strongly about the need to pass \nthis amendment? First, the debate is nothing new. In November of 1999, \nthe Federal Reserve, the Department of Treasury, the SEC, and the CFTC \nissued a report on derivatives titled ``Over the Counter Derivative \nMarkets and the Commodity Exchange Act, A Report of\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nthe President's Working Group on Financial Markets.'' This report was \nsigned by the Federal Reserve Chairman, the then-Secretary of Treasury, \nthe then-SEC Chairman, and the then-CFTC Chairman.\n  What the report found was the case had not been made that energy or \nother tangible commodities should be exempted from CFTC oversight. In \nfact, the report found that because of the immaturity of the energy \nmarket, the lack of liquidity in the market and finite supplies in \nenergy markets, energy markets were more susceptible to manipulation \nthan the deep and liquid financial markets.\n  Recent history has certainly borne that to be correct. These \ncommodities are more subject to manipulation.\n  On June 21, 2000, shortly after the President's working group issued \nits report, the Banking Committee and Agriculture Committee held a \nhearing on the report and Senator Lugar's Commodity Futures \nModernization Act. Let me read from the committee report:\n\n       The Commission has reservations about the bill's exclusions \n     of OTC derivatives from the Commodities Exchange Act. On this \n     point the bill diverges from the recommendations of the \n     President's Working Group, which limited the proposed \n     exclusions to financial derivatives. The Commission believes \n     the distinction drawn by the Working Group between financial \n     (nontangible) and non-financial transactions was a sound one \n     and respectfully urges the Committees to give weight to that \n     distinction.\n\n  Eight days later, Chairman Lugar marked up his CFMA bill in \nconference. This is what he had to say:\n\n       The Chairman's Mark also addresses concerns regarding this \n     bill's exclusion of institutional energy transactions from \n     the act. Our bill no longer excludes those transactions from \n     the act. With the resolution of this provision, the CFTC has \n     indicated it will fully support our legislation.\n\n  Much to his credit, Chairman Lugar eliminated the exemption for \nenergy transactions to accommodate the CFTC and the President's working \ngroups. But--and this is a big ``but''--Enron and others lobbied in the \nHouse and, as it turned out, this was never reflected in the final \nprovision that passed Congress as part of a much bigger bill at the end \nof the 106th Congress. There is already a legislative history.\n  More recently, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held \na hearing on January 29 on energy derivative trading, where CFTC \nChairman Jim Newsome and FERC Chairman Pat Wood both testified and \nexplained the regulatory burdens that prevent them from fully \ninvestigating Enron Online.\n  Let me be candid; I am truly amazed at the opposition to this \namendment. Why should anyone be able to set up an online trading \nplatform without any reporting, disclosure, or capital requirements and \nwithout any regulatory oversight whatsoever? Why should companies that \nare engaging in an over-the-counter transaction not have to keep a \nrecord of this transaction? Everyone else does. And why, if there is \nfraud or market manipulation, should there not be a regulatory agency \nthat can investigate and cite wrongdoing?\n  What I cannot understand is how this amendment is somehow \nantibusiness. On the contrary, the amendment is all about making \nmarkets work.\n  I call your attention to the recently released report by the \nCambridge Energy Research Associates Study and Accenture titled \n``Energy Restructuring at a Crossroads, Creating Workable Competitive \nPower Markets.''\n  The report cites 12 recommendations for making energy markets \nfunction effectively, including having the CFTC expand its oversight to \ninclude energy derivative trading, as it did before 2000.\n  The report recognizes that transparency, disclosure, and reporting \nrequirements instill confidence in markets and provide assurances for \ninvestors that there will not be fraud and manipulation.\n  This is also why the amendment is supported by the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, Cambridge Energy Research \nAssociates, Mid-America Energy Holding Company, PG, and Southern \nCalifornia Edison. They have to pay the higher prices for energy if it \nis traded back and forth. They want to know if these trades increase \nprices for the purposes of manipulation. Calpine, the American Public \nGas Association, the American Public Power Association, the Texas \nIndependent Producers and Royalty Association, the California Municipal \nUtilities Association, the Consumers Union, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, the Derivatives Institute, U.S. PIRG, the Transmission Access \nPolicy Study Group, and all four FERC Commissioners.\n  I would like to read into the Record the letter from the Chairman of \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Mr. Pat Wood, III, dated \nMarch 7:\n\n       Thank you for calling to my attention your proposed \n     amendment to clarify federal oversight of financial \n     transactions involving energy commodities. Your amendment \n     would clarify that these transactions are within the \n     jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \n     thus revoking current exemption for such transactions under \n     the Commodity Exchange Act and extending the Act to apply \n     comprehensively to financial transactions based on energy \n     commodities.\n       From our first meeting last Spring, you know how strongly I \n     feel about customers having access to the broadest range of \n     useful market information. Information on financial as well \n     as physical transactions is a key part of market \n     transparency. Billions of dollars are now at stake in these \n     markets. The consequences of a major participant's collapse \n     are illustrated by the Enron bankruptcy. Federal oversight of \n     such trading is appropriate. Your amendment can ensure \n     greater transparency in these markets, and this transparency \n     can help provide an early warning signal to those charged \n     with protecting the public interest.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print other letters in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Edison International,\n\n                                                    March 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for asking Edison \n     International for our views on your amendment to S. 517, the \n     Senate Energy Policy Act of 2002. As you know, Edison shares \n     your concern over possible manipulation of the California \n     electricity market by some market participants, which helped \n     contribute to the serious problems the state faced from out \n     of control energy prices. Your amendment would provide for \n     transparency in the electric derivatives trading market, an \n     industry that is currently exempted from regulation under the \n     Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA).\n       I support your amendment, with a suggestion for your \n     consideration to further refine it. Our company and others \n     use energy derivatives trading to protect and hedge their \n     actual physical assets, as opposed to companies that conduct \n     trading with no or few physical assets. There should be \n     guidance in the final language which recognizes the \n     difference between these two types of businesses, \n     particularly regarding any further capital requirements. \n     Otherwise companies that trade in order to hedge physical \n     assets may be required to pay twice--once in order to obtain \n     capital for the assets and a second time in order to meet any \n     capital requirements to back their trades.\n       Thanks again for all your efforts on behalf of California \n     consumers and businesses.\n            Sincerely,\n\n                                               John F.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing today in reference \n     to the amendment you will be offering to the Senate Energy \n     bill, containing the substance of legislation you and several \n     of your colleagues introduced earlier to provide regulatory \n     oversight over energy trading markets, as amended.\n       At the outset, we applaud your efforts to ensure public and \n     consumer confidence in the operation and orderly functioning \n     of the energy marketplace. As you know, the industry relies \n     heavily on these markets and products to manage risk for the \n     benefit of consumers of electricity. We thus appreciate your \n     willingness to work with us and other market participants to \n     address areas of interest and concern as the provisions of \n     your amendment have been debated and refined. As presently \n     drafted, we view your amendment as providing an increased \n     level of oversight, while ensuring the continued ability of \n     market participants to utilize these instruments as part of \n     overall risk management strategies. We therefore support your \n     amendment.\n       Thank you for your hard work in this area, and we look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and others on matters \n     of national energy policy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Steven L. Kline,\n       Vice President, Federal Governmental & Regulatory \n     Relations.\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                              Midamerican Energy Holdings Co.,\n\n                                         Omaha, NE, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in support of your \n     effort to ensure that there is transparency and appropriate \n     federal oversight of energy futures trading markets.\n       As I testified before the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee last month, I have long been concerned \n     that the type of exchange run by Enron before its collapse \n     offered opportunities for manipulation. Enron was the largest \n     buyer, the largest seller and the operator of an unregulated \n     exchange. In view of the revelations of the last several \n     months regarding Enron, the unregulated nature of these \n     markets has raised serious concerns regarding the ability of \n     the federal government to ensure that energy trading and \n     futures markets are operating in the interest of the public \n     and market participants.\n       As the Senate addresses this issue, it is important to \n     remember that electric and gas markets as a whole responded \n     to the Enron collapse without disruption, so legislation \n     should not compromise the liquidity of these markets. I \n     applaud your determination to keep your amendment focused on \n     oversight and transparency and am encouraged that you, along \n     with Senators Cantwell and Wyden, have pledged to work with \n     market participants to continue to perfect this proposal as \n     debate on the comprehensive energy bill continues.\n       Ensuring public confidence in the integrity of energy \n     futures markets is a critical component of establishing a \n     modernized regulatory framework for the electric and natural \n     gas industries. I am pleased to support your effort and \n     commend you on your work on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David L.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Public \n     Power Association (APPA), an association representing the \n     interests of more than 2000 publicly owned electric utility \n     systems across the country, I would like to express support \n     for your amendment regarding the regulatory treatment of \n     energy derivative transactions which is expected to be \n     offered during consideration of S. 517, the Energy Policy Act \n     of 2002.\n       As we understand it, your amendment repeals exemptions and \n     exclusions from regulation, originally granted by the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission, for bilateral \n     derivatives and multi-lateral electronic energy commodity \n     markets. Further, your amendment helps ensure that entities \n     involved in running on-line trading forums maintain open \n     books and records for investigation and enforcement purposes. \n     Ensuring sufficient regulatory oversight and market \n     transparency are critical steps towards helping prevent \n     market abuses and protecting consumers.\n       As you are aware, on December 3rd Enron filed for Chapter \n     11 bankruptcy protection. At the same time, forward markets \n     on the West Coast fell by 30% despite the fact that no other \n     changes in operations, hydroelectric supply, or fossil fuel \n     prices took place at the time. This has led some to believe \n     that Enron may have been using its market dominance to \n     ``set'' forward prices. Your amendment will help avoid such \n     potential abuses in the future.\n       APPA commends you for taking a leadership role on this \n     critical issue. We look forward to working with you on this \n     and other amendments aimed at providing effective and \n     sustainable competition while protecting consumers from \n     market abuses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alan H. Richardson,\n     CEO & Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Calpine Corp.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to let you know of \n     Calpine's support for additional oversight of certain energy \n     derivative markets, as intended by your proposed amendment to \n     S. 517. While we have not seen any evidence that energy \n     trading was the cause of either the California energy crisis \n     or Enron's demise, we do believe there is a crisis of \n     confidence in the energy markets and that your amendment will \n     assist in restoring much needed public confidence in the \n     energy sector.\n       We support the amendment's strengthening of the CFTC's \n     anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority and its provision \n     for increased cooperation and liaison between the CFTC and \n     the FERC. We are also pleased that your amendment addresses \n     concerns about the oversight and transparency of the \n     electronic trading platforms. It is important that such \n     facilities, which play a significant price discovery role in \n     the energy trading markets, be subject to appropriate \n     reporting and oversight by the CFTC.\n       However, I also understand that typical over the counter \n     bilateral trading operations, such as those that operate from \n     a trading desk where various potential counterparties are \n     separately contacted by phone or email, are not intended to \n     be treated as electronic trading facilities under your \n     amendment. This is an important distinction and one that I \n     understand you intend to further clarify in report language.\n       Calpine would like to thank you for your efforts to \n     advocate reasonable measures to ensure the integrity of the \n     important energy trading markets and we stand ready to \n     provide you with any information or assistance that you may \n     need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jeanne Connelly,\n     Vice President--Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Austin, TX, March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We understand that later today, you \n     will introduce an important measure designed to bring greater \n     transparency to natural gas markets. We believe that improved \n     transparency will reduce price-markups charged in \n     transactions that take place after natural gas leaves the \n     wellhead and before it reaches the burner tip. Thus your \n     measure will benefit both consumers and producers. We support \n     the modified version of S. 1951 that you intend to offer as \n     an amendment to the Senate Energy Bill.\n       We understand that the amendment:\n       (1) will not grant any price control authority under the \n     Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act;\n       (2) will continue to allow energy commodities (actually all \n     commodities other than agricultural commodities) to be traded \n     on electronic trading facilities that currently qualify as \n     exempt commercial markets, provided that the trading \n     facilities register, meet net capital requirements, file \n     reports, and maintain books and records;\n       (3) will require participants in such markets to maintain \n     books and records; and\n       (4) will apply these requirements to electronic trading \n     facilities which permit execution with multiple parties and \n     non-binding bids and offers, and will require books and \n     records to be kept by participants in facilities that permit \n     bilateral negotiations.\n       TIPRO believes that this measure will tend to improve price \n     transparency in natural gas markets, leading to a more \n     efficient and stable marketplace. The relatively modest \n     requirements outlined above should not unduly reduce \n     liquidity for gas traders. Accordingly, TIPRO endorses your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gregory Moredock,\n     National Energy Policy Committee Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Public Gas Association,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, March 5, 2002.\n     Re: S. 517\n\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Public Gas Association \n     (APGA) is very pleased that you have taken the lead to amend \n     the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). You revisions to S. 517, \n     which amends the CEA, brings the trading of energy products, \n     including natural gas spot and forward prices, under the \n     appropriate jurisdiction of Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC). As a result, your amendment will reduce \n     the various risks imposed on consumers by a partially \n     unregulated energy trading market.\n       As you know, Enron operated in what was essentially an \n     unregulated environment. While there will be much more to \n     come in the wake of Enron, one thing is perfectly clear \n     today--our federal government has an obligation to make sure \n     that no important trading activities fall between the cracks \n     leaving some energy markets without a federal agency with \n     oversight authority. Your amendment remedies this glaring \n     deficiency.\n       APGA is fully committed to support your effort to reverse \n     the action Congress took just 15 months ago in the \n     Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA). The CFMA \n     amended the CEA by allowing some energy contracts to be \n     traded with no government oversight. We firmly believe that \n     the CFTC must have at its disposal the necessary jurisdiction \n     and authority to protect the operational integrity of energy \n     markets so that (1) transactions are executed fairly, (2) \n     proper disclosures are made to customers, and (3) fraudulent \n     and manipulative practices are not tolerated.\n       In December of 2000, when the CFMA was under consideration \n     in the Senate, APGA submitted a Statement for the Record to \n     the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \n     during a hearing on the ``Status of Natural Gas Markets.'' In \n     the statement, we expressed a concern that the proposed \n     legislation would codify an exemption for energy commodity \n     transactions that would shield those energy transactions from \n     the oversight and review of the CFTC. Enron took advantage of \n     this gap in regulatory oversight. Your amendment will close \n     that gap. Consumers across the country will benefit from your \n     efforts because they are less likely to be victimized by \n     activities that occur in a market where the CFTC exercises \n     oversight.\n       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities \n     that we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate \n     leadership on this very important issue. While there may be \n     some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to \n     see whether the opposition is looking out for the best \n     interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work \n     with you in any way we\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\n     can to pass this much-needed amendment. Please let me know \n     how I can assist you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Cave,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            U.S. Commodity Futures\n\n\n                                           Trading Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for calling to ask that I \n     provide you with my views of your proposed amendment to the \n     energy bill pending before the Senate. The amendment would \n     bring transparency to markets and provide Congress and the \n     public with the assurance that no exchange offering energy \n     commodity derivatives transactions would go completely \n     unregulated. Moreover, it would restore to the federal \n     government those basic tools necessary to detect and deter \n     fraud and manipulation. Therefore, I strongly support the \n     amendment.\n       In my previous correspondence with you, I indicated that \n     under the current law none of our federal regulators could \n     give you any definitive assurance that there was no \n     manipulative or fraudulent activity in energy markets in the \n     wake of the Enron collapse. This is due, in part, to the lack \n     of transparency demanded of energy markets and more \n     significantly to the fact that certain exchange markets such \n     as EnronOnline are completely unregulated.\n       Consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries of properly \n     functioning derivatives markets, whether those markets are \n     private--like EnronOnline--or public--like the New York \n     Mercantile Exchange. By the same token, consumers are the \n     ultimate victims when markets are manipulated, or otherwise \n     affected by unlawful behavior.\n       I am a firm believer in the efficiencies that derivatives \n     markets bring to bear on cash commodity markets and the \n     consequent benefits to market users and to consumers. \n     However, such derivatives markets should, in the public \n     interest, adhere to certain, minimal regulatory obligations. \n     Your amendment is a prudent response to the issues \n     highlighted by the Enron episode.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas J. Erickson,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  To summarize, if the western energy markets over the past 2 years \nhave shown us anything, it is that the light of day and records must be \navailable on all transactions. If the western energy markets and \nCalifornia have shown us anything, it is that there must be Federal \noversight. And if what has happened in the last 2 years tells us \nanything, it is that the trading of these particular commodities should \nnot be in secret.\n  Mr. President, this amendment aims to clear up those three points. It \ndoes so. I recognize there is opposition. I recognize the banks oppose \nit. Why do the banks oppose it? Because they have set up an online \ntrading exchange, the IntercontinentalExchange, to do just what Enron \nOnline did. Dynegy opposes it. Williams opposes it because they are \ndoing the same thing now.\n  There is this burgeoning market of trading up the price of energy in \nsecret. It is wrong. The light of day must be shed on it, and it should \nbe treated as are all other aspects of trades. My cosponsors and I feel \nvery strongly about this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how can a case be more overwhelming than \nthe case of the Senator from California? Who could possibly be in favor \nof a situation where transactions could be undertaken and no records \nkept? Who could possibly be in favor of granting a license for fraud \nand manipulation? The answer is no one.\n  The problem is that each of these points that is outlined has no \nfactual basis in the law. The plain truth is that there is extensive \nrecordkeeping currently required under law. That recordkeeping was \nstrengthened in the 2000 extension of the authorization of the \nCommodity Exchange Act. I will read from the legislation as we get to \nit.\n  The 2000 Act provided specific antifraud authority for the CFTC in \nexactly the areas for which the Senator from California calls. It \nprovided authority to intervene in the case of price manipulation. In \nfact, everything that the proponents of this amendment claim they are \nfor is part of current law as amended by the 2000 Act.\n  I have offered and we have negotiated--and I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for the negotiations--to try to work out an agreement so \nthat we can have an amendment go forward with broad support. We have \nfailed to succeed in that effort, and I will outline in a moment why we \nhave failed to do that.\n  Before I do, let me start at the beginning. This amendment has as \nstrong a coalition of opponents as any amendment that has been offered, \nand not one of them opposes what the proponents of the amendment say \nthey want to do. Not one of them opposes required recordkeeping. Not \none of them opposes the granting of antifraud authority. Not one of \nthem opposes granting the ability to intervene in the case of price \nmanipulation. Every opponent of this amendment favors what the \nproponents of the amendment say that it does, but they oppose what the \namendment in fact does.\n\n  I will read from the list of the opponents: Alan Greenspan, \ntestifying twice before committees of Congress--the Financial Services \nCommittee in the House and the Banking Committee in the Senate. In as \nstrong words as Alan Greenspan ever utters and in as clear a form as he \ncould possibly pronounce it, he opposes this amendment, not because he \nopposes the intent of the Senator from California, but because he \nopposes what the amendment, if adopted, would do--the unintended \nconsequences--which is what this debate is about.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is adamantly opposed to this amendment \nand has joined Chairman Greenspan in talking about the potential \nimpacts on the American economy of a decision we would make in this \nproposal that has nothing to do with energy futures but everything to \ndo with a swap industry which is now $75 trillion in annual volume and \nwhich has become part of virtually every business in America where that \nbusiness tries to insure itself against risk.\n  These swaps are tailored transactions between two economic entities \nthat are able, through their transaction, to provide greater certainty \nin providing jobs, growth, and opportunity for the American economy. In \nfact, Chairman Greenspan has said that the growth in the derivatives \nmarkets may very well be a major factor in the resilience of the \nAmerican economy today and why we, in fact, did not have a recession.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the letter which the Secretary of the \nTreasury and the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System sent to the two leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter to which I just referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: We are writing to express our serious \n     concerns with an amendment to be offered by Senator Feinstein \n     and others to S. 517, the national energy policy bill. We are \n     committed to ensuring the integrity of the nation's energy \n     markets. However, we question whether it is necessary to \n     reopen the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) \n     to achieve that objective. Amending the CFMA as proposed by \n     Senator Feinstein could re-introduce legal uncertainties into \n     off-exchange derivatives markets and other markets--\n     uncertainties that were thought to have been settled as a \n     result of the CFMA's enactment.\n       Accordingly, we urge Congress to defer action on Senator \n     Feinstein's proposal until the appropriate committees of \n     jurisdiction have a change to hold hearings on the amendment \n     and carefully vet the language through the normal committee \n     processes.\n       The CFMA expressly maintained the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission's (CFTC) anti-fraud and anti-manipulation \n     authority with respect to off-exchange energy derivatives \n     markets covered by the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Thus, it \n     appears that the CFTC may have sufficient current authority \n     to address instances of fraud or price manipulation in energy \n     derivatives markets. Congress should carefully evaluate the \n     adequacy of the CFTC's current authority before it attempts \n     to re-open the CFMA.\n       The CFMA was the culmination of a long, difficult process, \n     which provided much needed clarification regarding the scope \n     of the CEA for all off-exchange derivatives instruments, not \n     just energy products. Any effort to undo the delicate \n     compromises achieved in that legislation should be undertaken \n     only after careful reflection. Otherwise, such legislation \n     could jeopardize the contribution that off-exchange \n     derivatives have made to the dispersion of risk in the \n     economy. These instruments may well have contributed \n     significantly to the economy's impressive resilience to \n     financial and economic shocks and imbalances.\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\n       Similar letters have been sent to Senators Harkin, Lugar, \n     Sarbanes, Gramm, and Daschle.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul H. O'Neill,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. This amendment is also opposed by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, which has the principal responsibility in the \nAmerican economy for antifraud and antimanipulation enforcement with \nregard to securities transactions. If their whole purpose in existing, \nif their major mandate, is to deal with exactly the problems which the \namendment proposes to deal with, why is the SEC adamantly opposed to \nthis amendment? Because of unintended consequences, because the \namendment, in fact, does not achieve its stated goals, but it does \nother things that are potentially very harmful to the economy.\n  The Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the very \nCommission that would be empowered by this amendment, has come out in \nvery strong opposition to the amendment. This amendment is opposed by \nthe International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the American \nBankers Association, the ABA Securities Association, the Financial \nServices Roundtable, the Futures Industry Association, the Securities \nIndustry Association, and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.\n  Why would the Chamber of Commerce of the United States be opposed to \nthis amendment? Are they in favor of fraud, manipulation, and the \nabsence of recordkeeping? No. They are concerned that the amendment \nwill have a harmful effect outside the futures area as it relates to \nnatural gas and electricity, and, in the process, will do harm to the \nentire economy.\n  This amendment is strongly opposed by the National Mining \nAssociation. I can understand bringing Enron into the debate as it \nrelates to natural gas and electricity, but why we should bring in \nmining I do not understand. There will at some point in this debate be \nan amendment which is part of our disagreement, to focus the provisions \nof this amendment on natural gas and electricity. If that is the \nconcern, then why not focus the attention on that concern rather than \ngetting into areas such as metals? I have seen no evidence--in fact, I \nwill point out that Chairman Greenspan has seen no evidence--that \nderivatives trading by Enron, or by anybody else, had anything to do \nwith the energy spike in prices in California.\n  Going back to the beginning, first of all, this is a debate I was \npulled into when the 2000 bill was written. The provision relating to \nenergy was written in the House, and the version of those provisions \nthat finally passed in the House and came to the Senate was never \nchanged again. My concern about the bill at the time, that held the \nbill up for 3 months and almost killed the bill at the end of 2000 in \nthe final session of that Congress, the lameduck session of that \nCongress, had to do with exactly the issue which is before us, and that \nis unintended consequences.\n  Nobody in the Senate knows what a derivative is, and I speak for \nmyself in saying that deep down I have a conception of what a \nderivative is. I might pass a freshman course in finance in college in \ngiving a definition of derivative, but these are very complicated, \ntailored instruments, each instrument being unique, which is why it \nhas, from the very beginning of its trading, been deregulated.\n  One of the arguments that has been made over again, as the debate on \nthis amendment has started, is that somehow the 2000 legislation \nexempted these derivatives and swaps from regulation. That is totally \nfalse, totally inaccurate. They have never been regulated. In fact, \nCongress acted in passing the Futures Trading Practice Act in 1992 to \ngive the CFTC specific power to exempt these derivatives and swaps as \nbeing inappropriate for regulation under the CFTC, which has the job of \nregulating futures, not tailored swaps between sophisticated customers. \nThe Congress passed the Futures Trading Practice Act in 1992 that \ndirected the CFTC to grant these exemptions. Those exemptions were \ngranted. The exemption for energy was granted under the Clinton \nadministration with a Democrat Chairman of the CFTC. That issue has \nnever been controversial before. Nor have these swaps and derivatives \never come under Federal regulation in terms of an ongoing regulatory \nprocess.\n\n  In fact, the 2000 Act, far from exempting something which had never \nbeen subject to regulation, added to the strength of the CFTC exactly \nthe powers that the proponents of this amendment would like us to \nbelieve their amendment does, and they believe their amendment does. \nThere is no bad faith on this amendment. It is simply trying to \nunderstand very complicated issues when no Member of the Senate knows \nwhat a derivative is. It is very difficult to understand what swaps \nare, impossible to comprehend a $75 trillion industry. Unless one is \ndirectly involved in mining, banking, or securities, it is very \ndifficult for me to comprehend what this whole market is about.\n  All I know is, it has grown to $75 trillion. It is the envy of the \nworld, and Alan Greenspan, who is not the embodiment of God's voice on \nEarth, when it comes to financial matters in the U.S. economy, speaks \nwith more knowledge and more authority than anybody else when he says \nthat disturbing these markets could have a detrimental impact on the \neconomy and that the resilience of the economy in the face of the \nrecession might very well have been due to the growth of this \nderivatives market. I say at least let's put a little sign up that \nsays: Danger, high voltage. Do not be fooling around in here if you do \nnot know what you are doing.\n  Let's talk about these issues. As we have listened to these speeches \nand been moved by them--I have been moved by them to support the intent \nof the amendment--we are really not far apart, and I will outline where \nwe differ.\n  First of all, let me quote from the 2000 Act that the Congress \nadopted in the waning days of the session in the year 2000. I will go \nto page 43 of the Senate companion bill, S. 3283. This is in paragraph \n(4) of section 2(h) of the Commodity Exchange Act. Paragraph (4)(B) \ngives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission the power to intervene \nand enforce any action where fraud is present.\n  In listening to the proponents of this amendment, one would believe \nthere is no power whereby the CFTC can intervene in cases of fraud. Not \nonly does that power exist, but it was strengthened in the 2000 \nlegislation, a provision written in the energy section of the bill in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In paragraph (4)(C), we have the provision relating to price \nmanipulation, and the Commission is given the power to intervene in \ncases where price manipulation occurs.\n  As we have listened to this debate, we have heard the question, well, \nhow can you do anything if these markets are conducted with no records?\n  I will read the language of the bill in paragraph (4)(D):\n\n       . . . such rules and regulations as the Commission may \n     prescribe if necessary to ensure timely dissemination by the \n     electronic trading facility of price, trading volume, and \n     other trading data to the extent appropriate, if the \n     Commission determines that the electronic trading facility \n     performs a significant price discovery function for \n     transactions . . .\n  It then goes on and specifically outlines the power of the \nCommission. Now, let me make it clear that I am in favor of, and will \nsupport, strengthening these provisions. I am in favor of giving the \nCFTC the power to require that records be kept, to require that they be \nkept to the level so that you can reconstruct the transaction, to \nrequire that the data under the Commodity Exchange Act be kept for 5 \nyears so that you can reconstruct individual transactions. I am willing \nto support--and so are all the opponents of this bill, as far as I am \naware--strengthening antiprice manipulation and strengthening the anti-\nfraud provisions.\n  The point I want to make is these provisions are already law, and \nthey are in the 2000 Act. To the extent they can be strengthened \nwithout affecting other markets that are in no way related to \nelectricity and natural gas so that we can deal with what the \nproponents of this amendment intend to achieve, I am in favor of it. \nThe problem is the amendment, as now written, does many things that go \nbeyond this.\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\nIf we can focus it on electricity and natural gas, if we can limit it \nto these provisions, we would have an agreement, and I assume we would \nget a unanimous vote.\n  But here are some problems, and let me outline them. First of all, \neverybody needs to understand that we have a wholesale market for swaps \nand derivatives, tailor-made products. These are products that are not \nsold on exchanges. Let me make it clear. I have been chairman of the \nBanking Committee. I have worked with the exchanges in Chicago and New \nYork. As we say in our business, I have many friends who are associated \nwith the exchanges in Chicago and New York. But when they go to bed \nevery night and they say their prayers, they say: God, please kill the \n$75 trillion swaps industry and make those people buy these derivatives \nand swaps on my market and pay me a commission and buy them in \nthousand-unit lots. If you love me, God, please do this for me. Now, it \nmay hurt the American economy, but it would be so good for me.\n  Now, there is an element of that going on here. There was an element \nof it going on in the 2000 Act. There has been an element of it going \non forever. People try to promote their own interests, we understand \nthat. There is no issue where all the special interests are on one \nside. There seems to be a conception that we try to perpetrate that \nthere is good and there is evil and there are special interests and \npublic interests and they are competing against each other. The plain \ntruth is normally there are special interests all over the ballpark. \nAnd that is not all bad. I will note that I have always felt if you are \ngoing to catch hell no matter what you do, even lawmakers will do the \nright thing.\n  There has been an ongoing effort, since the emergence of derivatives \nand swaps, to force them on to the futures exchanges. I could give you \na long and, in this case, happy history. It will suffice to simply say \nthis: First of all, these swaps have never been sold on market \nexchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of \nTrade, the New York Mercantile Exchange. They sell standardized \nproducts at both the wholesale and retail level. When we are talking \nabout swaps, we don't have a retail swap industry in America. When the \n2000 bill was written--and I was involved in those sections of that \nlegislation that had to do with banking products--we simply allowed the \nswaps business as it related to wholesale users, namely banks, \nsecurities companies, manufacturers, et cetera, to function on an over-\nthe-counter basis. We agreed that the case would be different should \na retail market ever occur in these products--that is, a situation \nwhere individuals would buy them; your aunt might buy one. I can't \nimagine, and I would not advise that, I would not do it--but we agreed \nin the 2000 bill, in the bank products section of the bill that if a \nretail market ever came into existence, at that point a decision would \nbe made as to who would regulate it and how.\n\n  Now, these products have never been under regulation, are not sold on \nexchanges; they are individually negotiated instruments, highly \nsophisticated and, obviously, they yield great value because people buy \nand sell them--$75 trillion worth. Alan Greenspan, as I said, said \nthese have now become a mainstay and a stabilizing influence in the \nAmerican economy.\n  Here are the problems that I see with the amendment as it is written. \nI will elaborate some on each of them. First of all, it permits the \nCFTC to regulate contracts regardless of whether they are futures \ncontracts. The CFTC has jurisdiction over futures. It does not have, \nnever has had, and I hope never will have jurisdiction over non-futures \nderivatives or swaps at the wholesale level. As the amendment is now \nwritten, it would impose CFTC regulations on companies operating \nelectronic bulletin boards, where bids and offers are posted for \nvarious commodities--facilities such as Blackbird, as one example--even \nif futures contracts are not traded on those bulletin boards. My view \nis, if our objective is to provide more information--and I am for more \ninformation--why should we be taking action to kill off bulletin boards \nthat are simply providing purchase and sale prices to customers?\n  Another point, this amendment--and I don't quite understand why it \ndoes it--would make the use of advanced technology a trigger for CFTC \nregulation, so that if a bank or an insurance company, or an investment \ncompany sets up an electronic computer system whereby people can come \ntogether, negotiate, purchase, and sell a swap or a derivative, if they \nuse the computer to do it, they could come under regulation. If they do \nthe same transaction over the phone, they don't come under CFTC \nregulation.\n  This amendment brings under the Commodity Exchange Act and under the \njurisdiction of the CFTC instruments that are not futures. The CFTC is \nan agency that is trained and has expertise in futures; that is, say \nthat I am contracting to deliver natural gas at the hub in Louisiana on \na certain date, and so I sell a future for that delivery, and someone \nbuys it. That is the kind of transaction that the CFTC is chartered to \nregulate. It is not chartered, nor has it ever been chartered, nor has \nit ever regulated, these tailored swaps and derivatives.\n  Let me quote Alan Greenspan because he has gone out of his way to \nmake statements on this, and he has been asked questions about this. \nSince this has been raised in relation to energy and to California, in \nparticular, let me just, if I can, go through some of the things Alan \nGreenspan has said without wasting everybody's time in reading huge \nvolumes of statements. Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board \non March 7, 2000, stated before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee that with respect to the existence of a nexus between \nenergy derivatives and Enron's demise: ``I haven't seen any.''\n  Alan Greenspan said, when questioned before the Banking Committee, \nthat he saw no relationship between derivatives and the demise of \nEnron. In fact, the derivatives part of Enron has subsequently been \nsold to another company that is in the process of reinvigorating it, \ncreating 800 jobs, and paying off some of the debt of Enron, including \ndebt to employees. This is a part of Enron that is alive and well, \nthough not under the control of Enron, which as we know is in \nbankruptcy.\n\n  Chairman Greenspan stated before the House Banking Committee on the \nsame issue:\n\n       What I sense happened is that they ran [why Enron failed] \n     into losses which they basically endeavored to obscure. It \n     had nothing to do with derivatives.\n\n  I could go through the quotes in greater detail, but when asked, Did \nderivatives have anything to do with the price hike in California? \nChairman Greenspan said no. When asked if they had anything to do with \nthe failure of Enron, he said it had nothing to do with derivatives.\n  He also stated before the Senate Banking Committee on March 7:\n\n       We've got to allow for that system to work because if we \n     step in as government regulators we will remove a \n     considerable amount of caution.\n\n  In other words, not only did he say he was concerned about us getting \ninto other areas, but he was concerned, if we had more Government \nregulation of these sophisticated instruments, people would come to \nrely on the Government and actually might be less cautious in financial \nmatters.\n  I quote the following:\n\n       I think that act [the 2000 commodity exchange \n     reauthorization] in retrospect was a very sound program, \n     passed by the Congress, and I don't see any particular need \n     to revisit any of the issues that were discussed at length at \n     this time.\n\n  Let me read what he said in particular in response to a question by \nSenator Miller of Georgia who asked the following question, and I am \nreading from the raw transcript. In response to Senator Miller of \nGeorgia who asked whether there is a nexus between energy derivatives, \nincluding their regulation and the California energy crisis, here is \nwhat Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       We don't need to revert to derivatives to get a judgment as \n     to why prices did what they did. My recollection is that 2 \n     years ago or so the sort of capacity buffer that the \n     California electric power system has was the typical 15 \n     percent for its summer back loads, which is what generally a \n     regulated industry has because you respectively guarantee a \n     rate of return on capability which is not being used, but \n     that 15 percent kept prices down. As the years went on, the \n     demand went up in California and no new capacity came on \n     stream. That 15 percent gradually\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\n     dissolved because there's no way to have inventory of \n     electricity--there are battery systems--but they are just \n     inadequate. You get into a situation where the demand load, \n     if it is running up against a limited capacity and the demand \n     tends to be price inelastic, you can get some huge price \n     spikes. So you don't need derivatives to explain what \n     happened to price.\n\n  Now, let me try to sum up because I have covered a lot of areas.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. With all due respect to the Senators in the Chamber who \nperhaps understand this issue, I have serious doubts how many Senators \nreally understand what we are talking about here. I was trying to \nunderstand what the Senator was saying, and it sounds pretty \ncomplicated to me. I hope we won't do a test here to ask Senators to \ndefine what a derivative is. In fact, we have been checking Webster's, \ntrying to make sure we understand the definition of derivative. After \nhaving read the definition, I don't think it clears up anything.\n  Who has jurisdiction of this? Is it the Agriculture Committee or is \nit the Banking Committee?\n  Mr. GRAMM. They both have jurisdiction. The Agriculture Committee has \njurisdiction as it relates to fundamental commodities. The Banking \nCommittee has jurisdiction as it relates to financial products. You \nhave a problem in that the amendment applies not just to futures but to \nother derivatives and to swaps, which are under the jurisdiction of the \nBanking Committee.\n  The problem is, the last time we dealt with this area, we spent 4 \nmonths dealing with it in committee. We dealt with it extensively in \ndebate and conference and ended up, in total, taking about 7 months to \ndeal with it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has this amendment been considered or had hearings in \nBanking, or in Agriculture, as to its implications and what the impact \nwould be?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No.\n  Mr. LOTT. Isn't this clearly an extremely complicated area with which \nwe are dealing?\n  Mr. GRAMM. There are two approaches, it seems to me, that make sense. \nOne is to call on the major agencies--the Fed, the SEC, and the CFTC--\nto take a look at the amendment on a truncated basis, say 45 days, and \ngive a comprehensive report and definition. That would be one approach.\n  The other approach would be to try to work out the concerns that the \nSEC and the Federal Reserve have raised. Those concerns are trying to \nnarrow this down to electricity and natural gas, which is the real \nconcern.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I was under the impression there \nhad been serious and extended negotiations between yourself and Senator \nFeinstein and perhaps others in trying to work out a compromise.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There were serious negotiations. I think Senator Feinstein \nmade a good effort on her part. Senator Fitzgerald was involved. When \nit got right down to it, an agreement could not be reached on the \nnarrowing of this to include futures but not swaps and or other \nderivatives, to focus it just on electricity and natural gas, which is \nwhere the concern is.\n  The reason Chairman Greenspan has chosen to speak out on this on \nthree different occasions, the reason he has talked to Members, and \nwhen they called him, called them back, is that he is very concerned \nabout unintended consequences. The problem is it is hard to debate \nunintended consequences.\n  Mr. LOTT. One final point and I will let the Senator give his \nsummation. This is a very complicated area that could have unintended \nconsequences, no question. We should not be trying to write legislation \nin this area in the Senate without very careful thought and \nconsideration by committees. I think it is a very serious mistake to be \nconsidering this amendment in this way.\n  Just so Senators will understand, Webster's defines ``derivative'' \nas:\n\n       The limit of the ratio of the change in a function to the \n     corresponding change in its independent variable as the \n     latter change approaches zero.\n\n  I am sure you got that. That makes my point. We don't know what we \nare doing here, and we should not be acting in this area.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the minority leader was asking about the \ndefinition of a derivative. I ask the Senator from Texas, could he not \nfind the definition of a derivative by talking to people who used to \nrun Long Term Capital Management? As the Senator from Texas will \nrecall, it lost a fortune sufficient so that it almost took down the \nAmerican economy.\n  The Fed had to have a Sunday night rescue package to try to prevent \nLTCM from collapsing. I would expect an awfully good definition of \nderivatives. They are risks that are now falling through the cracks of \nregulators, which come from an understanding of Long Term Capital \nManagement.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I would respond that, if we had \na hearing, I do not think they would be the people we would call on to \ngive us advice. I was thinking of the Chairman of the SEC, perhaps \nformer Chairmen, the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System.\n  I might say about Long Term Capital, that they went broke by making \nbad decisions. They didn't go broke because of the existence of \nfinancial instruments. They went broke because they made bad choices in \nthe use of those instruments. You cannot blame the instrument. It is \nlike blaming thermometers--saying I hate thermometers because every \ntime they register above 100 degrees it is hot. It is not the \nthermometer's fault. So it is clear that we have had people go broke. I \nguess my feeling is that we simply need to know more about this.\n  As I have said from the beginning, if we can make some simple changes \nin this I could be for it, and I believe everybody who I quoted here \ntoday would be for it. Let me just tell you what the amendments would \nbe.\n  First of all, the focus of this amendment is supposed to be on \nnatural gas and electricity. The problem is, when you get into energy \nin general, and also into metals, you cast a very wide net. And while \nthe plain truth is--and I believe it--that there is no evidence to \nsubstantiate any claim that the price spike in California had anything \nto do with the existence of derivatives on natural gas and on \nelectricity, under the circumstances and especially given the precedent \nset in the 2000 law, I am in favor of, and I believe everyone who \nopposes the amendment is in favor of, strengthening the provisions of \nlaw related to antimanipulation, anti-fraud, and recordkeeping. That \nmuch we agree to. That part of the amendment is agreed to.\n  But I believe, and all these other groups from the bankers to the \nFederal Reserve Board, to the SEC, to the CFTC believe, that one of the \nways you could improve this--they are all still very nervous about this \namendment, even if we made all these changes--but if you could narrow \nit just to electricity and natural gas they would see that as an \nimprovement.\n  The amendment is about the CFTC, and it ought to be about futures, \nnot about swaps. That is getting into another agenda, and that agenda \nis basically expanding markets on exchanges. And we should not be \ngetting involved in deciding where a product is bought and sold and who \nought to be buying and selling and who should benefit economically and \nwho should not.\n  This whole question of capital is a very important issue. At the risk \nof just overstating the case and oversimplifying, this is the problem. \nMany of these mechanisms, whereby trades are sold--or undertaken--just \nbring buyers and sellers together. They never take ownership of the \nderivative or the swap. So to make them put up capital based on the \ntransactions, if they don't ever take ownership, how does it make any \nsense to make them put up some part of $75 trillion when none of \ntheir own money is at risk?\n\n  So that requirement, if you are not very careful, ends up killing off \nthe market for no purpose. If you are not taking ownership, if all you \nare doing is bringing a bank and an insurance company together, why \nshould you have to put up capital based on the transaction?\n  Then you have the toughest of the issues, and I admit this is a hard \none. If you look at it one way, it seems like how can anybody be \nagainst it. If you look at it another way, it makes little sense. This \nis the point.\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n  What we have agreed to in this amendment, sitting down--and again I \nthank the Senator from California for being willing to sit down and try \nto work it out--what we have agreed to is extensive recordkeeping, \nunder the Commodity Exchange Act. Any of these platforms that bring \ntogether buyers and sellers of these instruments would have to keep \nrecords for 5 years--which is the same thing that any futures dealer \nhas to do. They would have to keep them at a level where the individual \ntransaction could be reconstructed. They would have to make it \navailable to the CFTC when the CFTC is looking at a potential for fraud \nand a potential for price manipulation. And they have to provide it in \nwhatever form the CFTC wants: price, trading volume, other trading data \nto the extent appropriate, which the Commission determines as being \nappropriate.\n  The question is, Should they have to make it public? This is the \nquestion. When you are talking about the prices that you and I see \nevery day when we go to Wal-Mart or when we go to buy a pair of tennis \nshoes, we are used to dealing in the world we deal in as consumers \nwhere people not only want to make prices public, but they pay money to \npublish them in the newspaper. But Wal-Mart does not make public what \nit pays for the things it buys. Wholesale transactions in America are \nproprietary information.\n  So that is part of the reason you have this tremendous opposition \nfrom the entire financial structure of the country. Everyone has agreed \nto the CFTC having the data in whatever form they want, and the ability \nto intervene. But when you are dealing with wholesale proprietary \ninformation as to how people are brought together in these \ntransactions, where if I am a trading floor, or if I am one of these \npeople who is a middle man, bringing buyers and sellers together, and I \nhave a way of doing it, I don't want to share my trade secrets with \nsomebody else.\n  So we are not talking about retail prices. The CFTC has total access \nif there is fraud, price manipulation--they can intervene. But in terms \nof these wholesale transactions requiring that these prices be made \npublic, and that these transactions would be made public, it would be \nlike requiring a shoe store to make public what it paid Nike for tennis \nshoes.\n  That is something we do not do in any industry in America of which I \nam aware. Granted, if you are choosing which side to be on in the \ndebating club in high school, you want to be on the side of disclosure \nof wholesale prices. But if you are trying to have efficiency in the \nrunning of the greatest economy in the history of the world, you want \nretail prices to be public, you want the Government to have access to \ndata so, if somebody is engaged in an illegal, fraudulent, or \nmanipulative activity, you can intervene, but to make people make \npublic wholesale prices is something we do not do because that is \nproprietary information. How people put their business together, what \nkind of deals they make with Nike--that is private information.\n  So I urge my colleagues, again: Can we focus this down on electricity \nand natural gas to be sure we do not have these unintended \nconsequences?\n  Second, can we focus it just on futures?\n  Third, can we at least require that capital requirements are not \nbased on the transactions that come through your purview but on any \nrisk you take or ownership you take? Can you imagine if you had some \njob collecting money and consummating transactions for somebody, and \nyou had to put up capital based not on what you invested or the risk \nyou have, but of your gross and net volume? No company in America that \nhas a huge volume could possibly deal with the problem. When you are \ndealing with a $75 trillion industry, it becomes even more important.\n  And, finally, any information that Government needs to prevent \nwrongdoing in wholesale transactions--if there is something we have not \nagreed to that would make people feel more confident, I am willing to \nsit down to try to see if we can work it out. But proprietary \ninformation on a wholesale level is something that we do not do in \nother places.\n  So I urge my colleagues, if we can, there are two ways of working \nthis out, it seems to me: One, to do an amendment to send the matter to \nthese three agencies for evaluation on an expedited basis. Let them \nreport back. Let the committees of jurisdiction hold a hearing so we \ncan hear from people who know something about this area, rather than \nsimply talking among ourselves. That is one approach.\n  Another approach is to go back one more time and see if we can deal \nwith these concerns. When the people who have been entrusted by us to \nmake these markets work, and work fairly, and work efficiently--such as \nChairman Greenspan--when they and their staff have raised an issue, it \nseems to me we have an obligation to try to see if we understand it and \nto see if we can fix the concern.\n  So my guess is we are probably agreed on 90 percent of the things \nthat are in this amendment. But the 10 percent we differ on is very \nimportant.\n  Finally--and I will conclude because I see the leader, with the right \nof prior recognition, in the Chamber--let me say if we could work \nsomething out, I think we would serve the public's interest. I think \nhaving a series of votes, where we really do not understand what we are \ndoing, is not in the public's interest. You feel uncomfortable as a \nSenator saying that, but these are complicated issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a further definition of ``derivative'': ``A \nfinancial instrument whose characteristics and value depend upon the \ncharacteristics and value of an underlying instrument or asset, \ntypically a commodity, bond, equity, or currency. Examples are futures \nand options.''\n  I am sure that further clarifies the earlier definition that was \nread.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3033 To Amendment No. 2989\n\n  Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3033 to amendment No. 2989.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . FAIR TREATMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL JUDICIAL NOMINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Senate Judiciary Committee's pace in acting on \n     judicial nominees thus far in this Congress has caused the \n     number of judges confirmed by the Senate to fall below the \n     number of judges who have retired during the same period, \n     such that the 67 judicial vacancies that existed when \n     Congress adjourned under President Clinton's last term in \n     office in 2000 have now grown to 96 judicial vacancies, which \n     represents an increase from 7.9 percent to 11 percent in the \n     total number of Federal judgeships that are currently vacant;\n       (2) thirty one of the 96 current judicial vacancies are on \n     the United States Courts of Appeals, representing a 17.3 \n     percent vacancy rate for such seats;\n       (3) seventeen of the 31 vacancies on the Courts of Appeals \n     have been declared ``judicial emergencies'' by the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts;\n       (4) during the first 2 years of President Reagan's first \n     term, 19 of the 20 circuit court nominations that he \n     submitted to the Senate were confirmed; and during the first \n     2 years of President George H. W. Bush's term, 22 of the 23 \n     circuit court nominations that he submitted to the Senate \n     were confirmed; and during the first 2 years of President \n     Clinton's first term, 19 to the 22 circuit court nominations \n     that he submitted to the Senate were confirmed; and\n       (5) only 7 of President George W. Bush's 29 circuit court \n     nominees have been confirmed to date, representing just 24 \n     percent of such nominations submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that, in the interests of the administration of justice, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee shall hold hearings on the \n     nominees submitted by the President on May 9, 2001, by May 9, \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have made the point here--and Senator \nGramm was making the point very strongly--that this first-degree \namendment clearly needs additional work, additional consideration. The \ncommittees of jurisdiction should have an opportunity to work on it. I \nhad hoped that some accommodation could be worked out. I am still \nhopeful of that. But I do not think we are ready to go forward at this \ntime.\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\n  Having said that, I also think it is very important the Senate take a \nposition with regard to judicial nominations. This second-degree \namendment is the resolution that was offered last week. There has been \nno indication of how we would proceed on that. All it would say is the \nfirst nine circuit judge nominations that were offered last May--May of \n2001--would have a hearing--just a hearing--by May 9, 2002.\n  This issue is very important to our country, and it needs to be \nconsidered in the order in which it was pending before we came back to \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2989, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nSenator Feinstein's amendment. I want to address and rebut a number of \nthings my good friend from Texas said.\n  I have as much respect for Senator Gramm as I do for anybody in this \nbody. It is going to be a great shame that he is retiring this year \nbecause I will miss him dearly. I think this is, perhaps, the first \ntime in my 3 years in the Senate that I have ever risen in opposition \nto Senator Gramm, but I do disagree with him. I do not think this is a \ncomplicated issue.\n  I think it is a relatively simple issue. I think what it comes down \nto is that 2 years ago, when we passed the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act, we patterned our bill after the recommendations of \nthe Presidential Working Group, which included the Chairman of the \nCFTC, the Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard. And they had recommended that we create three categories of \nregulation.\n  One was a designated contract market which would be our Board of \nTrade and Mercantile Exchange in Chicago or the NYMEX in New York. \nThere would be heavy regulation on those designated contract markets.\n  The other recommended level of regulation was the so-called DTEF, the \nderivatives transaction execution facilities. Those would be online \nbilateral trading facilities that could be trading derivatives online. \nThey would be regulated but with lighter regulation than the full-blown \nregulation of designated contract markets.\n  And, finally, we created an exclusion for financial OTC derivatives. \nThe opponents of this amendment have created the false impression that \nsomehow the amendment by Senator Feinstein and myself intrudes upon the \nnow essentially excluded financial derivatives industry. There is no \nregulation by the CFTC to speak of for all the financial derivatives \nthat are out there, mainly between banks. Our amendment would not \nimpose any regulation on the banks in that regard or on others who \nengage in purely financial derivative transactions. This has nothing to \ndo with that.\n\n  Instead, we are simply closing off an exemption that applied to just \na handful of online trading companies that happen to be trading energy \nand metals. At the last minute, over in the House, they were exempted, \nnot just from one or two levels but from all levels of regulation. And \nthis exemption applied to literally just a handful of companies. It was \na special carveout that is upheld by absolutely no public policy \nrationale.\n  The companies that benefited from this exemption included, of course, \nEnron Online. There is a company called ICE, the \nIntercontinentalExchange; they benefited from this exemption.\n  The reason banks are interested in this issue is not because they are \nworried we are imposing some kind of legal uncertainty on financial \nderivatives but, instead, because a couple of banks have a big \nownership interest in this totally exempt energy online trading \nfacility, ICE.\n  And, finally, there is another company called TradeSpark that is \nowned by a couple of energy companies.\n  So you have three companies that essentially got a special carveout \nfrom the whole scheme of regulation that originated with the \nPresident's Working Group.\n  The President's Working Group, in essence, said financial \nderivatives, interest rate swaps, for example, between banks would be \nexempt from regulation by the CFTC.\n  I take issue with Senator Gramm when he says no Member of the Senate \nknows what a derivative is. I do. I grew up in a banking family. I was \non the board of many banks. I was a general counsel of a publicly \ntraded bank holding company. We used to enter into interest rate swaps. \nWhen our banks wanted to do a lot of fixed rate mortgages, we wanted \ninterest rate protection. We would go protect ourselves against an \nincrease in interest rates by entering a swap with another bank.\n  There should be no fear, whatsoever, out there that that market would \nbe disturbed by our amendment because it has absolutely nothing to do \nwith it. We would not impose any requirements on banks entering into \ninterest rate swaps, for example. Instead, the intent of our amendment \nis to close off an exemption, a special carveout for online energy \ntrading companies that makes no sense.\n  The President's Working Group distinguished between financial \ncommodities of an infinite supply, such as interest rate swaps, and \nsaid those should be excluded. And they are excluded. We maintain that \nexclusion.\n\n  But they said: Finite commodities such as agricultural commodities--\ncorn, soybeans, pork bellies--or metals--gold, silver--finite physical \ncommodities such as that in which there is a finite supply and in \nwhich, theoretically at least, the market could be cornered, there \nshould be some regulation for those markets.\n  The President's working group further said that there should be full-\nbore regulation if the trading is in an open outcry pit such as we have \nat the Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange in Chicago. There is \nfull-blown regulation. But there is a lighter degree of regulation, \nsome regulatory oversight, for online exchanges that trade those \nphysical, finite-quantity commodities.\n  It is that level of regulation that we are seeking to impose on these \nnow exempt online energy transaction facilities.\n  Senator Gramm cited section 4(g) of the Commodities Act. He said we \nalready have recordkeeping requirements in the CFMA; we already have \nthe ability for the CFTC to go after fraud if they find it.\n  I looked at section 4(g). Guess what. Section 4(g) does say that the \nCommission shall adopt rules requiring that a contemporaneous written \nrecord be made, as practical, of all orders for execution on the floor \nor subjected to the rules of each contract market--a contract market is \na board of trade like the Chicago Board of Trade--or a derivatives \ntransaction execution facility. Those are the online transaction \nfacilities we are talking about that are regulated.\n  The fact is, earlier in this act we created a special category for \nthese online energy and metal firms such as ICE which is in turn owned \nby Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. They have a rifleshot exemption in \nthis code, and this section 4(g) that Senator Gramm talked about does \nnot apply to them because they are exempt from the definition of \nderivatives transaction execution facility. That is back earlier in the \nact.\n  What we need to do is close this loophole. What public policy \nrationale upholds the picking out of a couple of online firms and \nsaying: You are going to be exempt from the requirements of the act? It \ndoesn't make any sense.\n  Now, we did have good-faith negotiations with Senator Gramm. He has \nproposed regulating natural gas and electricity contracts that are \ntraded online but exempting metals and oil contracts. Why does that \nmake any sense? Shouldn't everybody be playing on a level regulatory \nplaying field? Why should some business have a regulatory advantage? \nThat isn't what America is all about. We want all businesses to be \nplaying on the same level playing field. If some succeed because they \nwork harder, have better products, and they are smarter, that is great. \nBut when they succeed or make a lot of money because the Government has \nsponsored some special advantage based on their power and their \nadeptness at playing the political game in Washington, that is not \nright. That is not what America is all about, giving a special carve-\nout to a few companies. It doesn't make sense.\n  Now, I happen to agree with Senator Gramm on one point. I have seen \nno evidence that the trading by online energy trading firms had \nanything to do\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nwith the spike in oil or electricity prices on the west coast. I \ncertainly doubt that is the case.\n  But that is not why I am here supporting this amendment. Instead, I \nam supporting this amendment because I think price discovery is very \nimportant to consumers.\n\n  Senator Gramm was saying we never require retailers to disclose the \nwholesale prices they pay. That is true. But this is not really \nanalogous to going to buy something at Wal-Mart. This is more analogous \nto buying a stock from a broker. You call up your broker, and you ask \nthem to buy 100 shares of IBM stock. They can look up on the New York \nStock Exchange and get one of the latest quotes, and they can tell you. \nLet's just say it is $100 a share. You go buy the 100 shares for $100 a \nshare, and then your broker gets a commission.\n  The problem with this kind of trading is that the customer can't see \nthe prices. In the case of your going to your broker and buying 100 \nshares of IBM, you can find out what the price was on the New York \nStock Exchange. It is different with an online energy trading firm. You \nmay call them up and say you want a contract for, let's say, natural \ngas or something, and you will pay $265 for the contract.\n  Well, what if the person from the online energy company looks up and \nhe finds he can buy it at $263? But then he resells it to you at $265. \nYou never would know the difference, would you, because you would never \nknow the wholesale price at which he got it.\n  I am sure no one at Enron Online would ever cheat their customer in \nthe way I just described. I am sure that would never happen, or that \nthis would ever happen in ICE or TradeSpark--that they would use their \nsuperior knowledge of the wholesale market and the lack of knowledge of \ntheir customer to make a few extra points. I am sure that would never \nhappen.\n  But let's just say that this could happen, that there could be some \ndishonest people in those companies. And in addition to wanting to make \na commission for selling that contract at $265, they might want to take \na little bit of markup, a little bit of kickback. It probably happens \nin the political business when we all buy our direct mail. You are \nalways wondering how much your direct mail firm is actually paying for \ntheir printing and mailing. You know they are marking it up, and you \ntry to guard against it.\n  But that very same thing could happen when you are trading with one \nof these online customers. That is why I do believe it is important for \nthe CFTC to have the ability to require these companies to report their \nvolumes and to report their prices. That is protection for the \nconsumer.\n  Oddly, I think ICE, Enron Online, and TradeSpark would have more \ncustomers if they were regulated by the CFTC than they now have. I will \ntell you this: I would never go trade with them because I would have no \nidea at what wholesale prices they were buying. I wouldn't use them. I \nwould go to a regulated board of trade where I could be sure there were \nsome safeguards for me. I wouldn't trade with somebody such as that, an \nonline energy company. And I believe their businesses are smaller than \nthey otherwise would be if there were some protections for consumers.\n  It is much like our stock markets. Our capital markets have exploded \nin the last 50 or 60 years. We have the best capital formation markets \nin the world. I do believe that our securities laws have helped foster \nthat strong capital market. If you go back to the 1920s and before, \nwhen there was really no regulation, or go back before the Federal \nTrade Commission, when there was absolutely no regulation of our stock \nmarkets, the little guys didn't get involved in that at all because \nthey figured it was an insider game and that the deck was stacked \nagainst them. They were right; the deck was stacked against them.\n  Since we have put in protections for the consumer, we have banned \ninsider trading and made a lot of manipulative practices illegal, more \nand more Americans have felt comfortable investing in the stock market \nto the point that we now have over 50 percent of Americans investing \ntheir own stocks directly or indirectly. If there were this light level \nof regulation that Senator Feinstein and I are suggesting with our \namendment, that would be good for these companies that want to uphold \nthis special privilege that exempts them from all regulatory oversight.\n  Now, I also note that there is a Senator who probably knows as much \nas any of the derivatives experts in this country about derivative \ntransactions, and that is Senator John Corzine of New Jersey. Senator \nCorzine was chairman of Goldman Sachs, which is an owner of \nIntercontinentalExchange. He has joined us as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  I think this is an outstanding amendment. I think it is very simple. \nWe are closing off a special deal that just applies to a few firms. \nThere is no public policy rationale that supports the special deal \nthese firms have. We are making the treatment of all firms the same \nunder the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. It makes perfect sense. \nWe are doing so in a way that was originally recommended by the \nPresident's Working Group.\n  I appreciate the hard work of my colleague from California and also \nmy colleague from Texas. We have had a lot of negotiations. I think one \nthing we have done is conclusively demolish any argument that this \nrepresents any threat at all to financial derivatives. They are not \naffected in any way.\n  Senator Gramm initially said this was his primary concern. We worked \non it, and we have modified the amendment to make it crystal clear that \nwe have no intent of affecting the financial derivatives markets. Those \nare excluded and will continue to be excluded. We are simply trying to \nclose off a special loophole that applies to a handful of companies. I \nthink it is very good public policy. Let's close this exemption that \nwas stuck in by the House at the last minute when they passed the CFMA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, might I ask if the Senator will give me \nabout 3 minutes to respond to these points before they get cold in \neverybody's mind? Would that work for her?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. How long?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think I can do it in 3 minutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will wait.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nSenator for giving me 3 minutes. She did not have to do that.\n  Let me be brief. First of all, if you go back and read the Commodity \nExchange Act, as amended, you will find that what I said, in fact, was \ncorrect. There are exempt commodities, which have always been exempt, \nhave never been regulated, but they are exempt, except as provided in \nthese paragraphs.\n  Then we go through a reference to anti-fraud, anti-price \nmanipulation, and recordkeeping. So they are exempt from the normal \nprocess because these are huge wholesale markets among sophisticated \ndealers that have never come under regulation. But they are not exempt \nfrom anti-fraud, anti-price manipulation, and from recordkeeping. I \nwanted to be sure that we all knew that was true.\n  The Senator says the working group favored his amendment. There is \nonly one problem with that. Every member of the working group has \nwritten a letter opposing the amendment. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Securities and Exchange \nCommission Chairman are the members of the working group. The Senator \ntakes a sentence from their report that he says bolsters his \nargument. But every member of the working group who wrote the report, \nand who is charged with it today, opposes the amendment. I have seen no \nevidence that anybody who held these positions during the Clinton \nadministration supports the amendment either.\n\n  Special carve-out? There is no special carve-out. We are getting back \nto a myth. Let me remind my colleagues that, as I look at the 2000 bill \nas it was passed, Senator Fitzgerald was an original cosponsor of the \nbill. What this legislation did was simply clarify to a legal certainty \nsomething the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Federal \nReserve Board wanted to do, and that was that these sophisticated \nwholesale products that had never been regulated by anybody\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\nin the history of this country--and since we invented them, and nowhere \nelse were they started, that I am aware of--that they were exempt from \nnormal regulation, but they were subject to anti-fraud, anti-price \nmanipulation, and recordkeeping.\n  In terms of buying a stock, that is where all this confusion comes \nfrom. The example is a good one, but it has nothing to do with the \npoint. We are not talking about the same product. Every swap is not a \nfuture, it is a specific, custom contract. They are not homogeneous. If \nthey are, then they are not exempt. These are individually negotiated \ncontracts. They are not bought by individual, retail investors, such as \nour colleague from Illinois. They are bought by banks and mining \ncompanies and those businesses trying to protect themselves against \nrisk.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to approve \nthis amendment that we have been debating, which would subject energy \nderivatives trading to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny as many \nother commodities. Senator Feinstein and others have worked hard to \nbring about a fair resolution to this issue, and to the chaos brought \nupon many Western States in the electricity crisis as it unfolded.\n  What I think is important to understand is exactly what this \namendment does. First and foremost, my colleagues must recognize that \nthis legislation is designed to close a specific loophole--the Enron \nloophole--that allowed Enron and other online traders to sell energy \nfutures behind closed doors, without any form of safeguards for \nconsumers or investors whatsoever.\n  At its core, our amendment would allow the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to treat energy futures similar to other regulated commodity \nfutures. It does not give the CFTC any new powers that it does not \nalready have over many other futures markets. This legislation deals \nspecifically with energy futures, without tampering with regulation of \nfinancial derivatives as much of the floor debate would lead you to \nbelieve.\n  Some have claimed that by subjecting energy derivatives to the same \nlevel of regulatory scrutiny as other commodities, we would be imposing \nsome sort of unacceptable level of ``uncertainty'' on these markets. I \nfind that argument fundamentally flawed. How, then, does one explain \nthe prominence and global importance of other American markets, such as \nNYMEX, already under the CFTC jurisdiction? They don't seem to be \nstruggling because of oversight and scrutiny by the CFTC.\n\n  In fact, I believe that by subjecting trading platforms, such as \nEnron Online, to the same transparency and antifraud rules as other \ntypes of exchanges, we will actually be increasing the confidence of \nmarket participants. They can know with certainty that prices for \nenergy derivatives are not the result of manipulation. And believe me, \nin my State, consumers have a lot of doubt about why they are paying a \n50-percent rate increase in energy prices. Under this amendment, \nconsumers can rest assured that they will not become the casualties of \ngaming in these markets. That is very important.\n  To quote the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest trader \nof energy futures:\n\n       With numerous reports of reduced confidence in market \n     integrity in the wake of the Enron bankruptcy, never has it \n     been more important to restore faith in that great American \n     resource, our competitive markets.\n\n  Some have suggested that there has not yet been conclusive evidence \nthat Enron manipulated derivative markets and, they argue, that alone \nis reason enough not to proceed.\n  Mr. President, there never will be conclusive evidence of such market \nmanipulation, if Enron Online and businesses like it are allowed to \ncontinue operating in secret. I ask the opponents of this amendment to \nthink about the ramifications of this situation on the ongoing \ninvestigation into price manipulation in my home state. As I said, in \nmy State, consumers have seen rates increase up to 50 percent in long-\nterm contracts that they are going to have to live with for many years. \nIn fact, Enron is still buying power at cheap prices, marking it up, \nand selling it to utilities at higher prices because of these long-term \ncontracts. Yet, FERC's investigation into these price hikes has been \nseverely hampered by the lack of information surrounding swaps \ntransactions done in secret.\n  The task of investigating Enron's collapse and Enron Online's impact \non energy markets has been made infinitely more complex by virtue of \nthe fact that no one was required to maintain books or records that \nwould have shown this clear pattern of irregular trading. Instead, we \nare saddled with this post hoc investigation that may well last years.\n  Some colleagues talked a lot about the President's Working Group \nrecommendations, and some have suggested we delay this legislation. \nWhat is interesting is that many of the names thrown about this \nmorning, Alan Greenspan, then-Secretary of Treasury Larry Summers, SEC \nChairman Arthur Levitt, and CFTC Chairman Bill Ranier, were signatories \nto the President's Working Group report given to Congress before \npassage of the Commodity Futures Modification Act of 2000. While it is \ntrue that the report supported exemptions for over-the-counter \nderivatives, the report included significant cautionary notes.\n  The President's Working Group basically issued a warning saying: \ncommodities with finite supplies are more easily subject to price \nmanipulation.\n  Obviously, those of us from the West know how finite the energy \nsupplies can be, as California, Washington, and other States \nexperienced the unbelievable skyrocketing of prices.\n  What we, the cosponsors of this amendment, are talking about here is \nhow to implement the Working Group's recommendations on antifraud \nprovisions. We are saying transaction information should be collected \nand kept. Then, if there is a suspicion of fraud, investigators will \nhave something tangible to examine.\n  The Working Group unanimously recommended that there should be an \nexclusion for bilateral transactions between sophisticated \ncounterparties, but it made specific note: Other than transactions that \ninvolve nonfinancial commodities with finite supplies.\n  The Working Group recommended an exclusion from the Commodity \nExchange Act for derivatives traded on electronic trading systems \nprovided systems limit participation to sophisticated counterparties \ntrading for their own accounts and are not used to trade contracts that \ninvolve nonfinancial commodities--again culling out nonfinancial \ncommodities with finite supplies.\n  The Working Group noted the danger of exempting these transactions, \nincluding energy derivatives, from regulatory scrutiny, and they did \nthis in November of 1999. These are precisely the transactions that our \namendment would put under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.\n  Unfortunately, these cautionary notes were not heeded by Congress and \nwere instead translated into a statutory exemption for bilateral energy \nderivatives and electronic exchanges in the context of the Commodity \nFutures Modernization Act of 2000. I can tell you, my State has \nsuffered greatly because of this exemption and has not been able to \nfind out whether price manipulation has actually occurred.\n  I also suggest that my colleagues take note of the Working Group's \nrecommendation that the regulatory regime should be reevaluated from \ntime to time. In the aftermath of Enron's collapse, a reevaluation is \ncertainly warranted.\n  Again, to quote from the President's Working Group:\n\n       Although this report recommends the enactment of \n     legislation to clearly exclude most over-the-counter \n     financial derivatives transactions from the Commodities \n     Exchange Act, this does not mean that transactions may not, \n     in some instances, be subject to a different regulatory \n     regime or that a need for regulation of currently unregulated \n     activities may not arise in the future.\n\n  Specifically, the Working Group recommends the enactment of a limited \nregulatory regime aimed at enhancing market transparency and efficiency \nmay become necessary. That is what we are doing.\n  We are saying that these things may have come about because of the \nEnron collapse. We have seen, while Congress may have acted in 2000 \nthinking this\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nexemption was the right thing to do, this exemption cost consumers--if \nnot the high rates they are paying directly--it has at least cost them \nconfidence in the system.\n  We must restore that confidence by opening up the energy derivatives \nmarket to transparency and oversight. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis very important amendment and to tell the American public that \nCongress is acting to protect them from the kinds of loopholes that \nEnron was able to walk through and cost consumers higher energy prices \nin this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I \ndo not know anyone who has been more concerned about what has been \nhappening with electricity markets than Senator Cantwell. She has \nreally tried to help her constituents and the consumers in this area. I \nam very pleased she has been in the leadership of this amendment.\n  I particularly thank the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Fitzgerald, for \nstraightening out the record from the perspective of somebody \nintimately involved in the banking industry.\n  Let me tell you how all of this boils down for me. It is this: Should \nsome parts of this trading community essentially be exempt from any \nform of transparency, from recordkeeping or from oversight? That is the \nbottom line. We are not trying to do anything that is horrendous. All \nwe are saying is they should have oversight, they should keep records, \nand there should be information for the public that the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission would find to be nonproprietary. This is, in \nessence, all we are trying to do.\n  I have a hard time understanding how one has to have a large degree \nof sophistication in the industry to want to shed the light of day on \nsome of these trades.\n  Maybe California was impacted by these trades and maybe California \nwas not impacted by these trades, but I can tell you this: The price of \nelectricity in California in 1999 was $7 billion. The price the next \nyear was $27 billion. It went up fourfold. Something happened other \nthan the fact there was a huge demand and no supply. There was trading.\n  We saw it with natural gas coming in to California. Natural gas \nprompts the price of electricity, and when it is $59 a decatherm in \nsouthern California and $8 a decatherm in New Mexico, when the cost of \ntransportation from New Mexico to that place in California is only $1, \none has to look at what has happened to boost that price way up.\n  So all we are saying is to put it back the way it was before. Give \nthe CFTC jurisdiction.\n  It is being made light of that the CFTC does not support this action. \nThe CFTC has three members. One of the members supports what we are \ntrying to do, and his name is Thomas Erickson.\n  I will quickly read what he says.\n\n       This amendment would bring transparency to markets and \n     provide Congress and the public with the assurance that no \n     exchange offering energy commodity derivatives transactions \n     would go completely unregulated. Moreover, it would restore \n     to the Federal Government those basic tools necessary to \n     detect and defer fraud and manipulation. Therefore, I \n     strongly support the amendment.\n\n  That is one member of the regulatory body out of three members to \nwhom we are trying to give this responsibility. So there is nothing \nnefarious about the amendment.\n  As I pointed out, all members of the FERC support the amendment, as \nwell as the Chairman of the FERC, whose letter I read into the Record. \nThey know something about these matters. They know what derivatives \nare. They know the transparency and recordkeeping and oversight.\n  Whether there was a carve-out for two or three companies or not, I am \nnot going to comment because I do not know. I do know there is this one \nnarrow exemption whereby all of these online trades go on not in the \nlight of day but in the dark of night, so to speak. Nobody knows what \nthey are. There are no records kept of them. Therefore, whether the \nCFTC thinks it has some jurisdiction or not does not really make a \ndifference because they cannot go back and look at records of trades, \ncompare them wholesale versus retail prices, and know whether there was \nany price manipulation or not. So sure, investigate. If there are no \nrecords, there is no evidence. Therefore, there is not much that is \ngoing to come from the investigation.\n  So all we are trying to say is because this has become a huge, \nburgeoning online business, subject it to all of the same regulations \nand oversight that every other part of the trading community has. It \ndoes not take a Philadelphia lawyer to understand that. I do think it \nbenefits consumers, I do think it benefits responsible trading, and I \ndo think it benefits a level playing field for everyone who is trading \nin these markets. I think it provides that level of consumer \nprotection. Some people, say, oh, there is a reason why the NYMEX and \nthe Chicago Board of Trade want it. They want to force everybody on \ntheir exchanges. No, not true. If it is easier to trade online, you can \ntrade online, no problem with it, but there should be a record kept of \nthe trades. There should be transparency, and information that the CFTC \ndeems is not proprietary but should be in the public domain can, in \nfact, be in the public domain, and that, finally, there is some \nregulatory body that when there is an allegation of fraud would step \nin.\n  For example, I would like the CFTC to take a look at the California \nsituation, evaluate the record and tell us, was there price \nmanipulation? Was online trading of natural gas manipulated to \nartificially raise prices? They might try to do it now, but they would \nhave no records on which to base any investigation. Therefore, that is \nwhat this amendment is all about.\n  Sure, I know there are people who do not like it. There are people \nwho have tried to obfuscate about it, but is the consumer going to be \nbetter off because the light of day is shed on these trades in a market \nthat is billions and billions of dollars? I think so. I cannot \nunderstand how anybody feels disadvantaged because there is \ntransparency, there is oversight, or there is recordkeeping that is \nrequired in every single level of trading on any market that exists in \nAmerica today.\n\n  So if anyone takes the time to read these letters, I think they will \nfind we are doing nothing nefarious. We are simply trying to bring the \nlight of day to provide a record and to provide some regulatory \noversight to a huge, burgeoning market.\n  When I talked to Mr. Greenspan, and I did on two occasions, what he \nwas concerned with was financial certainty. What I would say to him is \nthis brings financial certainty. This lets everybody who trades online \nknow there is some regulation. Just as you have regulation with FERC, \nif you deliver natural gas directly to an entity, if you are trading \ngas in between the delivery, there also is certainty--a certainty that \none must keep a record, a certainty that the record can become public, \nand a certainty that there is some Federal oversight as there is \neverywhere else.\n  I see no reason at all why there should be this widespread exemption, \nparticularly at a time when we have seen these prices escalate beyond \nanyone's expectation. Nobody could think that someone could be selling \nelectricity at $30 a megawatt and overnight have that price go to $300 \nand then $3,000 without the opportunity for the light of day to be shed \non it, and also have some records and some oversight.\n  It is a very simple thing we are doing. It existed before the year \n2000. All we are saying is give the CFTC this oversight. It is \nsupported by FERC. It is supported by the New York Merchantile \nExchange. It is supported by the Chicago Exchange. It is supported by \npeople who deal in electricity and natural gas, the municipal systems. \nIt may not be supported by the banks that want to run an exchange in \nthis secret way. It may not be supported by some who would like to see \nthis anonymity continue. But if my colleagues believe that light of day \nis important, then please vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in \nopposition to this amendment. We have heard a lot of debate today about \na\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nvery complicated topic that has been discussed, that understanding \nderivatives is very difficult to do. Since this debate started and I \nbegan working on this issue, even in years previous as we tried to \naddress the issue, I still have to go back again and again to the \nexperts who help us to understand the issue.\n  The first point I want to make is: We spent the better part of a \nyear, a couple of years ago, working on this entire issue of how \ntransactions called derivatives are regulated as they deal with \ncommodities. We had a Presidential Working Group with which then-\nPresident Clinton worked, and we relied on the advice of that working \ngroup in setting up the model we put forward to help us address how we \nin the United States should regulate and manage transactions in \ncommodities known as derivatives.\n  I am going to try in a few minutes to give a little bit of structure \nto how we did that, but the first point is we spent a tremendous amount \nof time with congressional committees working on it over a long period \nof time, and with a Presidential panel working on it, and an advisory \ngroup, and we came together with an approach that we then brought forth \nas legislation which became law and which President Clinton signed into \nlaw, and which we have now been working under for a few short years.\n  This amendment will change that approach. Before I get into what we \nare talking about and try to put a little order to what the whole \ndebate is about in terms of the structure of the law, let me state the \nconclusion that Alan Greenspan gave in answer to me in a Banking \nCommittee hearing a few weeks ago when I said to the Chairman: Chairman \nGreenspan, is this amendment going to be good for America?\n  His answer to me--and I will read his words in a few minutes if I \nneed to, but his answer, in essence, was he believed the way we had set \nit up was working, that it provided a resiliency to our markets in the \nUnited States and that resiliency was, in his opinion, probably one of \nthe big factors in our ability to have the strength in our economy to \nrebound as fast as we did when the recessionary trends hit us.\n  In other words, the recessionary trends we are hopefully now starting \nto see ourselves grow out of were lessened, and the time we had to \nspend in that financial trough was reduced because we had the \nresiliency in our derivatives transactions that we put into place as a \nresult of this very thorough study we went through just a few years \nago.\n  This amendment seeks to change that. The arguments are in that act we \npassed a few years ago. There was a rifleshot created, a specific \nexemption for a few commodities that was not fair, and all commodities \nshould be treated equally. The reality is the reverse. We created basic \ncategories in the law we passed. This amendment is a rifleshot \namendment to pick out just a couple commodity groups and say these \ncommodity groups should have been treated differently.\n  How did the law we passed last time work? The question, again, is how \nare we going to regulate derivatives and commodities that are going to \nbe marketed through derivatives transactions. First, there was an \nentire category we said we were going to exclude, we would not \nregulate. Those are called financial derivatives. This includes \nTreasury bonds, foreign exchange, interest rates, things that happen in \nthe financial industry.\n  The Senator from Illinois discussed how banks and others deal in \nthese transactions. They are totally excluded.\n  Another category of commodities included, because historically they \nhave been included and traded on exchanges and derivatives \ntransactions, was the agricultural commodities. They were included with \nfull regulation, full coverage. They are now traded on these boards.\n  All other commodities were exempted. I use the word ``exempt'' as \nopposed to ``exclude'' because it is different than how we treat \nfinancial transactions. Financial derivatives were excluded; no \nregulation. Agricultural commodities were included; complete \nregulation. All other commodities were exempted, meaning they were not \ngoing to be regulated and forced on to the exchanges and forced to be \ntraded in the ways that the agricultural commodities were, but they \nwere still subject to very important regulatory controls. The Senator \nfrom Texas has already gone over those. Those were protections against \nfraud. They would be subject to the antifraud protections, the anti-\nprice manipulation protections, and the recordkeeping protections. All \nother commodities, other than agricultural and financial transactions, \nare still subject to those types of fraud, price manipulation, and \nrecordkeeping requirements under the act.\n  What has happened with this amendment? From that category called \n``all other commodities,'' the amendment seeks to pick out just two \ncommodity groups: Energy and minerals. That is the rifleshot, saying we \ndo not like the categorization we did a few years ago; we need to take \nenergy and minerals and move them to another category. The arguments \ngiven in favor of it are because we need more recordkeeping control and \nprotection. That is included under the act.\n  The other argument is that we should not treat one group different \nfrom any other group. Frankly, as I indicated, we already have \nexemptions and exclusions and coverage in different categories. I ask \nthis question: If the argument is that regulation is good and therefore \nwe should not have any commodity derivatives transaction that is not \nregulated, why not, instead of having a rifleshot amendment that \nregulates only energy and mineral transactions, bring all the financial \ntransactions in as well?\n  If people are at risk in America today because we are not regulating \nderivatives transactions, why shouldn't we have regulated derivatives \ntransactions and Treasury bonds? People's retirement depends on their \ninvestment in Treasury bonds. Financial transactions, like foreign \nexchange and interest rates, are every bit as important to the investor \nin America as are energy or mineral transactions--and, in fact, \nprobably more so if you look at the financial transactions and all of \nthe other types of commodities not included when we did the act before.\n  If we do that, we take the resiliency out of the markets and make it \nharder for this Nation's financial system to work effectively. If you \naccept the argument that everybody should be under the same rules and \nnobody should be rifleshot out, we should cover everybody and have no \nexclusion for financial transactions and no exclusion for any \ncommodities. Instead, that is not what the working group recommended.\n  I make another point. It has been argued somewhat subtly, but I think \nthe point has been clearly argued, investors are at risk because they \ndo not have information about these derivatives transactions. These \ntransactions are not investor transactions. This is not a situation \nwhere an investor is looking at a transaction and saying: I think I \nwill invest in that derivative or I will see if I can buy into this \nderivative transaction.\n  What is going on is the transfer of risk from those who hold a higher \nrisk situation but do not want to maintain that risk or are not in a \nfinancial position to maintain that risk to someone in a better \nposition to maintain risk. We talk about what derivatives transactions \ndo. They transfer risk from one who cannot manage it as well to one who \ncan manage it better. It helps our economy be resilient.\n  These are transactions between extremely sophisticated managers--\nwhether they be people who are transacting in energy commodities or in \nminerals commodities. There is not a situation where an investor is \nbeing shown a document and being asked to invest in a particular \ninstrument. This is not like a stock market sale or transaction. This \nis a negotiated contract between sophisticated buyers and sellers who \nare working in the marketplace to try to reduce risk, which brings \nstrength and stability to the economy and, as Greenspan said, helped in \nthis last recession to bring us back more rapidly.\n  What we are being asked to do is to shackle it and make it so that \nthese transactions cannot occur except over the board. These \ntransactions have to be regulated like the agricultural transactions.\n  There has been a lot of talk about who supports and who opposes this\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\namendment. There is already in the Record a letter from our Secretary \nof the Department of Treasury and from the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Paul H. O'Neill and Alan \nGreenspan, who strongly say we should maintain the current system. I \nread from the very last part of their letter:\n\n       [Such legislation] could jeopardize the contribution that \n     off exchange derivatives have made to the dispersion of risk \n     in the economy. These instruments may well have contributed \n     significantly to the economy's impressive resilience to \n     financial and economic shocks and imbalances.\n\n  So you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve saying: Do not shackle our economy this way.\n  We also have the Commodity Futures Trading Commission itself, the \nChairman, representing the majority point of view, stating that there \nis no shown reason for us to change the structure we achieved after \nsuch careful debate previously.\n  We also have the Securities and Exchange Commission saying there is \nno need for this change and we should walk carefully.\n  We are talking about the Government regulators--the Department of \nTreasury, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the CFTC--saying there is no \nneed for this.\n  What is the private sector saying? Those opposed to this amendment \nare those who deal in these transactions: The International Swaps and \nDerivatives Association, the American Bankers Association, the ABA \nSecurities Association, the Bond Market Association, the Financial \nServices Roundtable, the Futures Industry Association, the Securities \nIndustry Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the point being \nthat those in our economy who deal with derivatives are saying to us: \nWe don't want to have a rifleshot amendment that takes energy and \nmining transactions and moves them over.\n  Again, I want to go back and summarize a little bit. We have a \nsituation here in which we had a Presidential working group that said \nwe should set it up the way we did. We set it up the way we did. It \nworked. Those who deal with our financial markets in America have said \nit brings us and brought us the resilience we needed this last time \nwhen our economy had the shocks and turmoil we have faced in the last \nfew years. It has been working.\n  There was also testimony in the hearings we held before the Banking \nCommittee and elsewhere, where those who have tried to tie the failure \nto regulate derivatives transactions to some kind of problem in the \nenergy markets in California, or to the Enron collapse, have been able \nto show no real evidence of that. If there were evidence of that, then \nI think that is something that would be a valid debate for us to have \nin the Senate.\n  Instead, I have sat here now for hours this morning, listening to the \ndebate, and it has come down to basically two points, as I understand \nthe reasons that have been put forth for this amendment.\n  They are that we need to have more information available for \ninvestors and those in the industry who might want to look at these \ntransactions to see if there was fraud or whatever. And the response to \nthat argument again is that they are already subject to the Act's anti-\nfraud provisions, their anti-price discrimination provisions, and their \nrecordkeeping provisions, and that these are not investor transactions.\n  Then there are those who say it is just a good thing for us to have \neverybody under the same rules and nobody should get any exemptions. If \nthat is the case, we should amend the amendment to bring in all \ncommodities, including those that are excluded, such as the financial \ntransactions, and those that are exempted, such as the commodities that \nare not agricultural.\n  Again, I am not recommending that. I am simply saying the argument \nthat everybody should be under the same rules does not carry with \nregard to these kinds of transactions. If it did, then the amendment \nshould be much broader than it is.\n  The bottom line here is this: If there is some basis for us to \nconsider changing the law, which we worked so hard to put together a \nfew years ago, then that process of determining the change that needs \nto be made and evaluating the facts and the arguments behind why such a \nchange should be made should first go through the regular process of \nlegislating here in this Congress; namely, the committees with \njurisdiction should take jurisdiction over these issues and establish \nthe analysis. We should hold hearings.\n  If there is an argument that somehow the Enron situation is connected \nto how we regulate derivatives transactions, then we should hold \nhearings. Those hearings should probably be in the Agriculture \nCommittee, which is where the jurisdiction of this amendment lies. But \nsomewhere we should have hearings to find out whether such a connection \nis real and, if so, what the connection is and why it occurred. That \nwill guide us, then, in terms of figuring out how we might create a \nbetter regulatory mechanism.\n  The same is true if there are those who contend that somehow the \nCalifornia energy collapse and the circumstances that occurred there \nwere caused by failure to properly regulate energy derivatives. Again, \nno connection has been made in the minds of those who work in the \nmarketplace. But if there is an argument that such a connection is \nthere and that it justifies a change in the law, then shouldn't we have \na study of it? Shouldn't we evaluate it? Shouldn't we have a hearing--\nat least one? Shouldn't we let the committees of jurisdiction dig into \nthis and go through the process we did before? Maybe we need another \nPresidential advisory board.\n\n  If the results of the last system are not adequate, we could add to \nthem and supplement them. But we should study the issue and try to find \nout what facts justify such an argument and, if there is any validity \nto it, what caused it, so we can then understand how to regulate it \nbetter.\n  The bottom line is that we have had none of this. We have had no \nhearings. We have had no committee evaluation. We have had nothing, \nother than a several-hour debate in this Chamber. We had a couple hours \nof debate a week or so ago and now a couple of hours more today. But we \nhave not had the opportunity to get to the bottom of all of these \narguments, whether they be factual allegations or arguments about the \nproper mode of regulation.\n  I suggest what we need to do is to refer this amendment to the \nappropriate committees of jurisdiction and let them conduct the \nstudies, conduct the evaluations. In fact, what might even be a better \nsolution is to refer this issue to the appropriate regulators.\n  At some point in time I may submit an amendment to do just that, to \nlet the CFTC and the other appropriate regulators have a period of \ntime--the Senator from Texas suggested maybe a short period such as 45 \ndays--to dig into this matter and give a report to Congress about what \nthey have found out about all the alleged contacts between wrongs in \nour society that might be related to something here dealing with \nderivatives.\n  Again, if they find anything in that context, then the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction can have hearings and review these issues, \ndetermine if there is any merit whatsoever in proceeding forward with \nchanging our regulatory scheme, and then in a very effectively fine-\ntuned way figure out how we should change the law.\n  To me it seems very clear; if we do not have the kind of threat that \nsome suggest we have, and if we do have the potential strength in our \neconomy that is provided by having this flexible system of commodities \ntransactions regulations, it would be very dangerous for us to move \ninto a new regulatory system without understanding where we are \nheading.\n  This is one of those circumstances in which it is far too important \nfor our economy for us to take a risk of unintended consequences.\n  One of the most significant things we will face with regard to this \namendment, in my opinion, is the list of unintended consequences that \ncould occur.\n  The Senator from Texas indicated earlier it is really hard to debate \nunintended consequences because we really don't know what they are, \nbecause they are unintended, uninformed--something of which we are \nunaware. It is something about which, if we held hearings and went \nthrough the regular legislative process on this issue, we would \nidentify. Then whatever consequences flowed from what we were\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\ndoing would be understood and supposedly intended by those who \nsupported it.\n  Instead, we are being asked here on very short notice, without the \nkind of debate we need, to regulate in a way that is not necessary one \nsection of our economy--the energy and the minerals transactions \nrelated to derivatives.\n  Again, if the argument is going to be made that we need to protect \ninvestors in America, it is hard to see that because these are not \ninvestor transactions; they are transactions between highly \nsophisticated individuals. If it is true that derivatives are somehow a \nthreat to the investor community and the safety of the investments of \nthe American public is at risk because of something wrong with the way \nwe manage derivatives, then why don't we cover all commodities? As I \nsaid earlier, it seems to me the question of how we regulate Treasury \nbonds or foreign exchange or interest rates or other financial \ntransactions is every bit as important to the American investor as is \nthe question of how we regulate minerals or how we regulate energy \ntransactions.\n  I know in today's climate, with the Enron collapse and with the \nenergy troubles we faced a few years ago in California, there are those \nwho want to look at every aspect of financial and other transactions \nrelating to energy and see if there is some way we can improve it. But \nI suggest it does not necessarily mean that more regulation and more \ngovernment bureaucracy is the best way to solve these problems, \nparticularly when you have the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve telling us we have to have the kind of \nresiliency in our economy that derivatives provide to us.\n  In conclusion, I believe the bottom line is that each side can point \nto those who support their positions and those who oppose them. Each \nside can come up with arguments about why what we are doing now is or \nis not working. But no side can say we have the background information \nnecessary to make this decision, because we have not had the kind of \nhearings and congressional evaluation of this issue we should have had.\n  Because of that, I stand firmly opposed to the amendment. I believe \nultimately the American people will be much better served if we do our \njobs in the Senate the way our procedures are set up to do them. The \nprocedures and the policies of the Senate have been established to make \nvery clear that we can have the time to evaluate issues such as this \nand do the study necessary to have good, solid support.\n  I also believe, as has been indicated by those who debate here, if we \nwent through that process I have suggested--having a study and then \nfurther congressional evaluation and then maybe propose legislation--we \nwould probably have much more support for whatever came forth, if \nanything. We would build the collaboration, we would build the \nconsensus, and we would come forward, because the one thing that there \nhas been agreement on today is that nobody wants to have the problems \nwe saw occur in California.\n  Nobody wants to see any kind of fraud or abuse from financial \ntransactions or derivatives transactions. Everybody is willing to make \nsure that antifraud provisions and price protection provisions and the \nrecordkeeping provisions are adequately available for derivatives \ntransactions as necessary, so that we do not cause or increase any risk \nof problems in the economy.\n  If we will follow the procedures and the processes of the Senate, let \nthis matter be handled by the committee of jurisdiction, which I \nbelieve is probably the Agriculture Committee, and then let other \nrelated committees handle their parts of it, with studies in support \nfrom the private sector and from our regulating agencies, I believe we \ncan get the information necessary for us to do a good job, build \nconsensus, and come forward with a solution that can be broadly \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  I thank the Chair very much for this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2034-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise again, as I did a week ago when we \ndebated derivatives, in opposition to the derivatives amendment. It \noffers no solutions to problems that caused either Enron or the \nCalifornia energy crisis. In fact, the amendment we have is a solution \nlooking for a problem.\n  I am glad we have had a little time to study the amendment further \nbecause we have asked a number of regulators what their position is \nregarding the additional regulation of this relatively new form of \nbusiness. We have heard from two regulators who have jurisdiction over \nthe trading markets. They both have come back with the same response: \nThis is not needed at this time.\n  CFTC Chairman Newsome has said:\n\n       This amendment would rescind significant advances brought \n     about by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.\n\n  In response to a letter I sent to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, Chairman Pitt responded:\n\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission believes this \n     legislative change is premature at this time.\n\n  This amendment will disrupt a market that is working efficiently and \nproviding important tools for energy companies. For instance, this \namendment would require new capital requirements on electronic trading \nexchanges, even if they simply match buyers and sellers. These \nexchanges bear no risk associated with trading but this legislation \ncould provide additional new taxes.\n  This amendment also provides new regulation on metals. I don't know \nof anyone who can point to how metals had anything to do with Enron or \nthe California energy crisis. The regulatory model for metals has \noffered no problems. In fact, if you take a look at the derivatives \nmarket, there isn't a problem with any of the markets. I will speak \nabout that in a moment.\n  Yet the supporters of this amendment believe we should quickly enact \nsome new form of regulation to oversee the metals market. Enron was not \ncaused by the trading of energy derivatives. As I said last week, Enron \nwas not an energy trading problem. Enron was not an accounting problem. \nEnron was a fraud problem.\n  In fact, when the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, \nwas asked at a Senate Banking Committee hearing whether a nexus existed \nbetween energy derivatives trading and the collapse of Enron, he \nresponded that ``he hadn't seen anything'' that would indicate that.\n  Why are we rushing to regulate an emerging business when the collapse \nof Enron was likely caused by potentially illegal acts by executives \nand, furthermore, that the collapse of Enron did not cause a blip on \nthe scope of derivatives trading?\n  I know this is something everybody uses on a daily basis. In the \nexample I gave a week ago, I cited some examples of things that might \nhelp to understand derivatives trading. I will not go into that again. \nI am kidding about this being something that everybody works with on a \ndaily basis. In fact, we have been taking some classes in my office on \nhow to spell ``derivatives.'' It isn't a common, ordinary thing, but it \nis a new market that we have looked at extensively, held hearings on, \nand have done work on in the past through the regular channels. Again, \nthere was not a blip in that system when Enron went down.\n  We recently passed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act. Most of \nus in the Senate worked on this legislation extensively.\n  This legislation examined the regulation of energy derivatives. This \nlegislation was debated at public hearings. It was negotiated. It was \ndrafted over a significant period of time with full participation and \ninput from members of the Clinton administration and the committees of \njurisdiction. What\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nemerged was the proper amount of regulatory oversight for the trading \nof energy derivatives.\n  I also wish to comment on a letter sent to Senator Lott by Secretary \nof the Treasury O'Neill and Chairman Greenspan. In it they write:\n\n       We urge Congress to defer action on Senator Feinstein's \n     proposal until the appropriate committees of jurisdiction \n     have a chance to hold hearings on the amendment and carefully \n     vet the language through the normal committee processes.\n\n  We know from history that hearings can make a difference on a bill, \nthat working it through the committee process allows a lot more \nflexibility in actually working an issue and bringing it to light on \nthe Senate floor, without some of the difficulties we have had on this \nparticular amendment, which has been in the negotiation stage for about \na week and a half. But the floor operation does not allow the kind of \nflexibility that could correct problems and lead to good legislation.\n  Madam President, this is all we are asking. I haven't heard anyone \nsay we should not examine the issue. However, we should address it \nthrough the normal legislative process so we could learn exactly the \nramifications of the amendment. I don't believe anybody has come to the \nfloor and given us a thorough accounting of what would happen to the \nenergy trading markets, the swap markets, or the metal markets if this \nlaw were enacted tomorrow.\n  We all want to solve the problems posed to us by Enron and the \nCalifornia energy crisis. But this amendment will not solve those \nproblems. This amendment may add to those problems. Once again, I ask \nMembers to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at approximately 3 o'clock today, Senator \nKyl is going to come to offer his amendment dealing with renewables. I \nspoke with Senator Kyl. He says the debate on that should take some \ntime. He did not say how much time. It may take a matter of hours. What \nwe would do at that time is move off the Feinstein amendment. I have \nspoken with her.\n  With respect to the matter relating to the second-degree amendment \nSenator Lott offered dealing with judges, there will be an arrangement \nmade that we could vote on his amendment and perhaps side by side \ntomorrow.\n  I hope anyone wishing to speak on derivatives will come and do that \nas soon as possible. I understand Senator Boxer wishes to do that at \nthis time. We will get into what I think is a very important debate \ndealing with Senator Kyl's amendment on renewables at approximately 3 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Lott second-degree amendment to the \nFeinstein derivatives amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise to speak in behalf of the \nFeinstein derivatives amendment which I think is a very important \namendment for us to adopt.\n  Senator Feinstein's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, narrows a \ngap in the oversight of the energy market. It is very simple. It would \nrequire the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate the energy \nderivatives market.\n  We all know that derivatives are very complicated, and I know Senator \nFeinstein has spent a good deal of time educating the Senate on \nderivatives. The point is very clear. It used to be that the energy \nderivatives market was regulated by the CFTC. It is the way it used to \nbe, and it is the way it should be.\n  The CFTC should have the ability to obtain information critical to \nmarket oversight and to make market information public if the CFTC \ndetermines that it is, in fact, in the public interest to do so.\n  Senator Feinstein has gained the support of the New York Mercantile \nExchange and various consumer organizations. I have to say, as someone \nwho has long fought for the rights of consumers, this amendment is \ncrucial for consumers. We know in California what can happen when \nenergy markets go secret and you do not know what is happening, except \none day you wake up and find you cannot afford to heat or air-condition \nyour house, and if you are a business, you can no longer afford to pay \nthe energy bill.\n  I have to say from my heart that if the Senate walks away from this \namendment, then it is giving a message to the country that we do not \ncare much about this whole Enron scandal. Enron worked very hard to \nchange regulations and laws to remove all government oversight. In my \nhome State, they actually were under no oversight at all. One of the \nplaces there was oversight was the derivatives market under the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and that was changed. Therefore, \nthere was no oversight, and there was no way to ensure that the market \nwas transparent--in other words, you could see the various transactions \nthat led to the final energy bill--and it allowed, after they got out \nof the CFTC, for this online trading to go on in secret.\n\n  Clearly, in my opinion, Enron manipulated the electricity market for \none reason, and one can explain it in one word: secrecy. They operated \nin secrecy. There was only one agency to mind the store, the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission.\n  This administration was wined and dined by Enron, and they did \nnothing to help California--zero, nothing--for almost a whole year. We \nsaw the biggest transfer of wealth from ordinary working people to \nthese energy companies. Enron had a methodical plan to free itself of \nany and all Government oversight so they could cooperate in secret and \ntrade up the price of energy in secret through financial arrangements, \nincluding derivatives.\n  Senator Feinstein has a very good amendment that will restore \ntransparency to these sales. That is why I am very proud to support it, \nand that is why I say to you that it will be the first test vote on \nwhether we learned anything from this Enron scandal, and more than \nthat, are we willing to do something about the problems that led to the \nwhole crisis in California.\n  In 1992, Enron worked to remove energy derivative contracts from \nGovernment regulations. This resulted in Enron being able to hide \ninformation about individual trades from Government oversight. That is \nwhy Senator Feinstein has written this amendment. Let's go back, she \nsays, to the days when there was oversight over these online trades.\n  Once the contracts were outside Government oversight, Enron lobbied \nCongress to remove the trading itself from Government regulation, and \nin 2000, Enron was successful and was allowed to create an unregulated \nsubsidiary that could buy and sell electricity, natural gas, and other \nenergy commodities in huge volumes without any Government oversight.\n  As I said, we know what happened. The prices soared in my home State. \nMy State suffered a devastating economic crisis. I have a chart that \nshows the demand went up in that 1 year that Enron got out of any \noversight 4 percent; energy prices in toto went up 266 percent.\n  I will never forget meeting with Vice President Cheney after trying \ndesperately to get a meeting with him--this goes for me, Senator \nFeinstein, and other Members of the California congressional \ndelegation. Do you know what he said to us? We told him to look at the \nprices: How can we sustain this? All of California spent $7.4 billion \non energy in 1999, and then in 2000 when Enron got out of oversight, it \nshot up to $27 billion? How can we sustain it? He looked at us and said \nwith a straight face: You are using too much energy.\n  I say again to the Vice President and anyone who happens to be \nwatching, California on a per capita basis is the most energy efficient \nState in the Union. We use less energy than any other State.\n  We are a model in that regard. We have 34 million people plus, but on \nan individual basis we use less.\n  Our energy went up by only 4 percent and our prices went up by 266 \npercent,\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nand one of the reasons for this is Enron was allowed to trade online in \nsecret. They sold the same energy over and over, sometimes, they say, \nas many as 14 and 15 times before it got to the consumer.\n  No oversight. People can make the argument that deregulation \neverywhere is a wonderful thing, and I am willing to listen to it, but \nI have to say, when it comes to a commodity that people need to live, \nthey need it to heat their homes; they need it in hospitals to make \nsure an operation will not be terminated in the middle of it because of \nthe loss of energy.\n  The Chair was talking about how many proud farmers are in her State. \nI say to the Chair, in my State I went to a meeting in the central \nvalley--and the Chair has been there, I know--where they have all kinds \nof farming. One of the big industries is the poultry industry. They \nwere so fearful that the refrigeration would go out and this poultry \nwould spoil, some of it would make people sick, or they would have to \nthrow it out.\n  The bottom line is, energy is not a luxury, it is a requirement. So \nwhen we go ahead and take the whole energy area outside of any type of \nreasonable regulation, we are setting up a horror story for people. I \ncan truly say, we went through that and I want to spare that from \nhappening in the State of the Chair--the Senator from New York has \nalready gone through enough trauma for any Senator--and I want to stop \nit from happening anywhere in this great country of ours. The first \ntest case is the Feinstein amendment to restore some type of oversight \nto this online trading.\n  There is a gentleman from San Marcos, CA, who wrote to President \nBush. He sent me a copy. This was during the electricity crisis. He \nsaid:\n\n       I am a father and a husband in a single income family. My \n     wife and I very carefully planned our family economics in \n     order to give our daughter the benefits of having a full-time \n     parent at home. We are currently spending money on \n     electricity bills that should be going into family \n     investments for college or retirement planning.\n\n  This gentleman was so right. What happened was no regulation, the \nability for Enron and others to completely manipulate the market. \nSenator Feinstein's amendment, which has been second-degreed by a whole \ndifferent subject about judges--and I am all for voting on that, but it \nshould not have been done to this. We need a clean vote on her \namendment to restore some sense of transparency and honesty to the \nelectricity business.\n  This is another story I read about in the San Diego Union-Tribune \nwhen we were having our troubles. There is a pizza store called Big Top \nPizza where the electricity bill went from $200 to $646--a 223-percent \nincrease. It kind of mirrors what happened to my State. That happened \nin 1 month. Imagine as a business person seeing that kind of increase. \nI also read about a florist where their electricity bill went up 135 \npercent.\n  When we talk about these things, they may not sound as though they \nare so related to the amendment. The amendment talks about making sure \nwe have an electricity business we can monitor to make sure it is fair \nand just and we do not have unjust and unreasonable prices. If we \ncannot see through this system--which is currently the case because no \none is monitoring it--this is going to happen again. It is going to \nhappen to other good people in other States.\n  In closing, I cannot say enough about how much I thank Senator \nFeinstein for coming to the Senate with this amendment. What she is \ndoing is looking at our experience in California and saying, how can we \ndo something quite simple, which we always did before, which is to make \nsure we do not have people facing this type of escalation in costs, \nmanipulation of prices, all done in secret, nobody looking over their \nshoulder, and who pays the price? The good American people and the good \nconsumers of this country.\n  I hope we will have an outstanding vote in favor of the Feinstein \namendment, and I hope we can begin then to attack the basic causes of \nwhat happened in my State--an unregulated industry, out of control, \ninsider trading going on by the people at the top without one care in \nthe world for the shareholders, for the consumers, and for the people.\n  Jeffrey Skilling, the CEO of Enron, made a ``joke'' about California \nwhich was: California and the Titanic are very much alike. The one \ndifference is at least the Titanic went down with its lights on. That \nwas supposed to be a humorous joke.\n  The bottom line is Enron turned out to be the Titanic, and if we do \nnot learn lessons and if we do not move now to correct what happened, I \ndo not know why we are here. That is how strongly I feel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my understanding is we are awaiting \nmidafternoon for an amendment that will be offered, we are told, by \nSenator Kyl. I should not speak for him, but I am told the amendment \nwill strike the renewable portfolio standard in its entirety.\n  What is the renewable portfolio standard? To some, when we talk about \nan energy policy, debate on that term sounds like a foreign language--a \nrenewable portfolio standard. It means an attempt by this country to \ndevelop different approaches, using renewable, limitless supplies of \nenergy to produce electricity in our country.\n  There are some who despair this energy bill that is designed to try \nto take us into a new day and a new approach to energy policy, does not \nhave the CAFE standard that was voted on last week. Some are concerned \nabout that. Frankly, with or without the CAFE standard, this piece of \nlegislation does include some significant areas of improvement in \ndealing with the efficiency of the transportation sector. It does, for \nexample, provide very significant financial inducements for people to \nbuy automobiles that have new sources of power: fuel cell automobiles, \nhybrid automobiles, and others. We recognize that if you are going to \ndeal with this country's energy problem, you have to deal with \nefficiency of the energy used in transportation. That is true. I \nunderstand that. There are many ways to do that.\n  Remaining in this bill are important provisions, including \nsignificant tax benefits to consumers with which they can purchase a \ncar that meets certain specifications, or a vehicle that meets certain \nspecifications with respect to gas mileage, the kind of power train it \nhas, and other issues. So while some despair about the vote we had last \nweek, let me say there remain in the bill significant areas of \nefficiency dealing with transportation.\n\n  But that is not the issue now. The issue is a renewable portfolio \nstandard with respect to the production of electricity. The question \nfor all of us has always been, when we debate energy on the floor of \nthe Senate, will we develop new policies? Will we really turn a corner \nor will we simply repeat the debate we had a quarter of a century ago \nand beef it up just a little bit so we can debate it again a quarter of \na century from now?\n  Will our policy simply be yesterday forever? Is that our policy? It \nis that just to dig and drill and dig and drill represents our policy \nfor the next 25 years?\n  Look, I support digging and drilling, provided it is done in an \nenvironmentally acceptable way. We must produce new energy. We must and \nwill produce new oil and natural gas and use coal. We must do that \nbecause we cannot solve our energy problem without producing more, but \nwe must do it also in a way that is environmentally acceptable.\n  As we transition toward more production and more efficiency and more \nconservation, we also must, then, turn to this other issue of trying to \nfind new sources of energy so we do not just rely on digging and \ndrilling: new sources of energy such as wind energy, biomass, solar \nenergy, geothermal, and more.\n  When we produce electricity in this country, there are several ways \nfor us to do it. We have in the past traditionally mined coal and used \ncoal in power plants to produce electricity and move that electricity \nover a series of transmission wires to places in America\n\n[[Page S2037]]\n\nwhere it is needed. Other plants use natural gas as the principal fuel. \nBut there are other ways to produce electricity.\n  We now have newer technology--wind turbines. Those wind turbines have \nthe capability, with much more effectiveness, to take that energy from \nthe air and, through those turbines, create electricity. That \nelectricity can be moved around the country where it is needed.\n  Likewise, with solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass--we also can \nproduce electricity using renewable and limitless supplies of energy.\n  We must, when this bill leaves the Senate, have a renewable portfolio \nstandard that is reasonably aggressive, and one that is workable. The \nrenewable portfolio standard of 10 percent is one that we agreed to, \ngenerally speaking, when we wrote the bill earlier. Some have talked \nabout 20 percent, which others have said is too aggressive. There are \nstill others in our Chamber who say there should be no renewable \nportfolio standard, there should be no standard by which we achieve \nmore in limitless and renewable sources of energy for the production of \nelectricity.\n  I could not disagree more with that position. For us to write an \nenergy bill in the Senate and say, let's just keep producing \nelectricity the same old way, let's not really have any changes, let's \nnot stretch ourselves, let's not turn the corner with respect to energy \nsupply, I think is not a step forward at all. That is not new policy. \nThat is, as I said, yesterday forever. We will not be here in most \ncases, 25 years from now, someone will have a new idea for a new energy \npolicy. It will be digging more and drilling more.\n\n  That is not new, and it does not resolve our issues in the long term \nthat are so important for this country.\n  September 11 described for all of us the fact that this is a pretty \nuncertain and dangerous world in some respects. We have talked a great \ndeal since September 11 about national security. Madmen, sick, twisted, \ndemented people who live in caves in Afghanistan, plot the murder of \nthousands of innocent Americans in America's cities. So we talk about \nnational security and we prosecute a war against terrorism and we talk \nabout homeland security and it is all very important. But there is \nanother part of national security that is also very important. That is \nthe security or the lack of it that comes with the need to get 57 \npercent of our oil, our energy supplies of oil and natural gas from \nabroad--most of which come from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in one of the \nmost unsettled regions of the world.\n  Connecting our country's need for oil to a supply from a region that \nis so unstable and so uncertain is not a smart policy for this country. \nWe have ratcheted this up to almost 60 percent of our energy supply \ncoming from abroad--most of it coming from a region that is a very \nunstable region. We need to begin stepping that back. One way to start \ndoing that is by reaffirming this afternoon that we believe in a \nrenewable portfolio standard; that is, we believe in a standard by \nwhich we want this country to aspire to a goal, an achievable goal and \na real goal of having 10 percent of its electric energy produced by \nrenewable and limitless sources of energy.\n  I mentioned wind a moment ago. Wind energy is something that has, \nnow, the capacity to produce a substantial amount of new energy for us. \nMy home State of North Dakota is last in numbers of trees, as I have \ntold my colleagues from time to time. We rank 50th in native \nforestlands, so we are dead last in numbers of trees. But according to \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, we are No. 1 in wind. We are what they \ncall the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. Putting up a turbine with the \ncapability to take the energy from the wind and, through that turbine, \nturn it into electricity and move it across transmission lines makes \ngood sense for this country. It is renewable; it is limitless; it is \ngood for our environment; it just makes good sense.\n  That is why just one step in this energy bill that would be helpful \nfor this country--just one--is to reaffirm today that we believe in \nthis standard, in stretching our country to at least achieve the 10-\npercent level on alternative energy for the production of electricity. \nThat is all we are talking about.\n  In North Dakota, for example, we have some transmission issues we \nhave to deal with in order to produce more wind energy. I hope we can \nmove to produce more energy from wind, from biomass, from solar, but we \nalso have to find ways to transmit it through transmission lines. We \nare talking now in this legislation that Senator Bingaman brought to \nthe floor about new technologies for transmission lines. It is for a \nrange of initiatives. I was helpful in working on some incentives to \ntry to move us toward composite conductor technology, for example, \nwhich is one technology, to double or triple the efficiency of \ntransmission lines. If you can triple the efficiency of transmission \nlines, you don't have to build new corridors. You can move \nsubstantially more electricity across the grid system in this country \nto where it is needed.\n\n  The point is, we have a lot to do. This legislation does a lot. I \nbelieve this afternoon we will be confronted with an amendment that \nsays, no, let's step back and not do quite as much. In the area of a \nrenewable portfolio standard, it would be awful, in my judgment, for \nthe Senate not to stand for and perhaps even improve that which is \nalready in the bill. The 10-percent standard that is in the bill, with \nrespect to some agreements, as I understand it, has been changed a bit. \nPerhaps we could even strengthen that. The point is, we ought not \nretract; we ought not step backwards on this issue.\n  So when Senator Kyl offers his amendment, I hope we can have an \naggressive debate today and have a vote in which this Senate, by a very \nstrong majority, says: We insist on a renewable portfolio standard in \nthis bill. It is the right way and the right step for this country, to \nmake a break towards less dependence on foreign oil and more national \nsecurity for this country, by having a renewable and limitless source \nof energy well into the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I asked questions this morning as to when we \nmight be able to get an agreement on proceeding to the campaign finance \nreform issue. I know there have been a lot of efforts underway--Senator \nMcConnell, Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein, and others. Of course, I \nknow the House has a real interest in this.\n  This morning I was beginning to feel that we were going to have to \nnudge it a little bit to get this worked out and get it agreed to so we \ncould get a vote and move on to other issues without it interrupting \nthem--the energy bill, for instance--even further.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Requests\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule \nXXII, the Senate now proceed to the cloture vote with respect to H.R. \n2356, the campaign finance reform bill, with the mandatory quorum being \nwaived. I further ask unanimous consent that following that vote, again \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the consideration of a \nSenate resolution, the text of which is at the desk; further, the \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then resume \nconsideration of H.R. 2356 and the time until 6 tonight be equally \ndivided between Senators McConnell and McCain.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the \nbill and, at 6 tonight, the bill be read the third time and the Senate \nthen proceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives from \nthe House a technical corrections bill regarding campaign finance \nreform or a concurrent resolution which corrects the enrollment of H.R. \n2356, and the text has been cleared by Senators McConnell and McCain, \nthen the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration, the bill be \nread the third time and passed, or the resolution be agreed to, with \nthe motion to reconsider laid upon the table and with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  Here is my point and why I make this request. I believe it is ready. \nI think it is time we bring this to conclusion. I think we can get a \nvote on it at 6 o'clock tonight, and then we would be prepared to get \nback to energy or other issues that the Senate would desire.\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me concur with what the leader said. As a Senator \nwho has fought for many years to defeat that bill, I believe it is \nclear that position is not going to prevail.\n  We had good negotiations over a technicals correction to the bill. \nThe consent request to which the Republican leader has asked that we \nagree gives Senator McCain and myself, who have been on opposite sides \nof this issue, a chance to review a subsequent technicals bill that \npasses the House. Either one of us would have the right to veto it. We \nare very close to an agreement.\n  I agree with the Republican leader that there is certainly no \nnecessity to have any all-night sessions or any of these other \nscenarios we hear have been suggested to the press, since the opponents \nof this bill are ready to move on with it. That is what this consent \nagreement makes clear.\n  I commend the Republican leader for offering it.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I do congratulate the leader. It is really important we \nhave gotten this far. We are very close. I say, however, Senator \nFeingold and others--but especially Senator Feingold--need to make sure \nthe resolution referred to in this request is appropriate--and the \ncorrecting bill. I have no doubt they will be approved by Senator \nFeingold. To my knowledge, he has not yet signed off on these.\n  I ask that the Republican leader and Senator McConnell recognize it \nis really important that we get this out of the way. No one wants to \nspend all night here. We have so many other important things to do. I \nthink there is no reason we can't work something out in the next little \nbit. But I have to do, as I have indicated, what needs to be done. I \nwill do that. As a result of that, I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could inquire of Senator Reid, I understand he needs \nto confer with other Senators, and we would perhaps need to do that \neven more on our side.\n  But let me clarify, this did not include the technicals correction; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What it does is set up a procedure by which, even \nafter the passage of Shays-Meehan, if the technical corrections on \nwhich we are working is agreed to and is passed by the House and comes \nover here, in order to make sure it is one on which we still agree, \nSenator McCain or I could veto it; otherwise, it could come up and be \npassed.\n  The point I think the leader is making is that we are ready to move \non. It is time to pass this bill. We understand debate is largely over \nand we would like to wrap it up.\n  Mr. LOTT. I emphasize that point, Mr. President. When I was talking \nto Senator Reid this morning, there were still, I guess, negotiations--\nor not even negotiations--the technical corrections were being reviewed \nby a number of people, including House people, and it seemed to be \nmoving very slowly and seemed to be holding up the final disposition \nof this issue. And this looks to me as if that problem is taken care of \nby doing it this way.\n\n  So I just would inquire of Senator Reid----\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader is absolutely right. We did have a \nconversation today. We have heard a lot of talk the last week or so \nthat things have all been wrapped up. But we never really got to that \npoint. I think we are almost there. This is a tremendous step forward \nfrom where we were this morning. I have no reason to doubt that we can \nbe back here very shortly and enter into this agreement. We will make \nsure the Senator from----\n  Mr. LOTT. You are indicating, then, you hope very shortly we could \ncome back perhaps and propound--or perhaps you would want to propound \nsomething such as this?\n  Mr. REID. I think we will be in a posture to do that very quickly.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank you.\n  Mr. REID. I see both Republican leaders. Senator Kyl is in the \nChamber. What we wanted to do is move to his amendment dealing with \nrenewables to get that issue out of the way. And I see Senator Bond and \nSenator Lincoln in the Chamber. They have an amendment that may be \nagreed to.\n  I ask my friend, Senator Nickles, are you going to speak on the \nderivatives issue?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am going to speak on the energy bill.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I am just wondering; Senator Kyl is back in the \nChamber, and he has had so many dry runs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will speak on the Kyl amendment as well.\n  Mr. REID. If we get this campaign finance agreement, everyone will \nstep aside, of course, and we will move to that. I indicated to the \nstaff on the Republican side, we are going to work something out \ntomorrow so we can go to an amendment the Republican leader has pending \non the Feinstein amendment.\n  So what I would like--I am sorry to have been interrupted, but it was \nimportant I be.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume the Bingaman \namendment No. 3016 and that Senator Kyl be recognized to offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Arkansas \nhas an amendment that I plan to cosponsor. I do not think it will be \ncontroversial. We do not have it fully cleared.\n  I talked to the Senator from Arizona. He does not seem to have an \nobjection. I ask if the Senator from Arkansas might be permitted to go.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and the Senator from Missouri wish to lay down an \namendment, and with the hope that it will either be accepted or \nfinished at some later time. But after your initial statements, we \ncould go to Kyl. It should not take too long; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object--and I do so to save time--I \nknow Senator Reid is trying to make use of time while he works out \nclearances. I would object right now to going to Kyl. In the meantime, \nwe have Senator Nickles who would like to speak, and also Senators \nLincoln and Bond, and then we can communicate and see if we can't get \nan agreement on the Kyl amendment after we get through this. But I \nobject at this point.\n  Mr. REID. The only thing I would ask: Senator Kyl has been over here \nlike a yo-yo. I hope he will not go too far away, so maybe we can lay \nthis down a little later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Lott second-degree amendment to the \nFeinstein first-degree amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3023 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 3023.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Bond, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Craig, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3023 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the eligibility to receive biodiesel credits and to \n   require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on alternative \n                 fueled vehicles and alternative fuels)\n\n       On page 142, strike lines 8 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 817.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined in \noffering this amendment with my good friend from my neighboring State \nof Missouri, Senator Bond. Senator Bond and I have worked together on \nnumerous issues during our tenure in the Senate, and I am pleased to \nwork with him again.\n  I am also pleased to be joined by Senators Johnson, Craig, Carnahan, \nHutchinson, Harkin, Grassley, Bunning, and Bayh as cosponsors of this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent to add Senators Carper, Fitzgerald, \nDayton, and Dorgan as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. The purpose of this amendment is to place biodiesel \nfuel on an equal footing with every other alternative motor fuel in \nthis Nation.\n  Biodiesel is a clean-burning alternative fuel that can be produced \nfrom domestic renewable sources, such as agricultural oils, animal \nfats, or even recycled cooking oils.\n  It can be used in compression-ignition diesel engines with no major \nmodifications. It contains no petroleum, but it can be blended with \npetroleum at any stage in the production and delivery process from the \nrefinery to the gas pump. Biodiesel is simple to use. It is \nbiodegradable. It is nontoxic and essentially free of sulfur and \naromatics. It is completely user friendly.\n  Although new to our country, its use is well established in Europe \nwith over 250 million gallons consumed annually. The Energy Policy Act \nof 1992 set a national objective to shift the focus of national energy \ndemand away from imported oil toward renewable and domestically \nproduced energy sources. When EPACT was passed in 1992, it recognized \nethanol, natural gas, propane, electricity, and methanol as alternative \nfuels. The original list of alternative fuels did not include biodiesel \nbecause the technology had not been fully developed at that point.\n  EPACT set a goal to replace 10 percent of petroleum-based fuels by \nthe year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. However, a GAO report \nissued in July of last year noted that ``limited progress had been made \nin increasing the numbers of alternative fuel vehicles in the national \nvehicle fleet and the use of alternative fuels'' as compared to the \nconventional vehicles and fuels.\n  We have not met the original EPACT goals of replacing 10 percent of \nthe petroleum-based fuels by the year 2000, and we are not on track to \nmeet the goal of 30 percent by the year 2010. In fact, we have not even \ncome close. That is partly a result of not allowing all alternative \nfuels to be used to meet that EPACT alternative fuel mandate.\n  My amendment will significantly increase the use of alternative fuels \nby enacting a temporary program to allow covered fleets to meet up to \n100 percent of the EPACT purchase requirements through the use of \nbiodiesel. Currently, covered fleets can meet up to 50 percent of \npurchase requirements with biodiesel.\n\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a \nstudy evaluating the availability and cost of alternative-fueled \nvehicles and alternative fuels.\n  The provisions of this amendment would automatically sunset after 4 \nyears. At that time, covered fleets would again be able to satisfy only \n50 percent of purchase requirements with biodiesel. This temporary \nprogram, in conjunction with the Energy Department study, is necessary \nto determine if vehicle and fuel markets are significantly developed to \nsupport continuing the purchase mandates or if a further extension to \nthe biodiesel credit program is warranted. We must allow all \nalternative fuels to count toward EPACT's alternative fuel \nrequirements.\n  Our amendment will allow us to make the most of existing \nopportunities. By offering an additional option for the use of \nalternative fuels, we will widen the possibilities for these fuels to \nbe made more widely available. Fleets will continue to have the option \nto choose the complying vehicles and fuels that best meet their needs.\n  This amendment is not expected to affect fleets that are currently \nusing ethanol or natural gas. But this amendment does provide a further \noption for alternative-fueled vehicles. Furthermore, it does not \ndirectly displace natural gas or ethanol sales since biodiesel is used \nin medium and heavy-duty trucks rather than light-duty vehicles.\n  It is in the best security interest of our Nation to reduce our \nreliance on foreign energy suppliers. We can no longer afford to be \nsubject to the whims of the foreign cartels such as OPEC which \nsuccessfully manipulate the price of oil.\n  Added to these threats posed by OPEC and the instability of the \nMiddle East are the even more threatening possibilities we face in \nother parts of world. Developments in many regions of the world where \nmuch of today's energy supplies are obtained--West Africa, the Caspian \nSea, Indonesia, and on and on--clearly serve notice that our Nation \ncannot continue to depend on these areas for our future energy needs. \nThese events make it even more pressing than ever that we proceed \nforward with developing our own domestic alternative energy resources.\n  By allowing fleets to meet 100 percent of their AFV requirement by \nusing biodiesel, we will take a positive step toward moving this \ncountry away from dependence on petroleum-based motor fuels and toward \nalternative motor fuels.\n  The time to start investing in renewable energy sources is now. We \nhave taken far too long to get to this point. There are many other \nnations way ahead of us in using these types of alternative fuels. I \nurge my colleagues to support our amendment to work hard on being able \nto present the realities of the fact that we are there. We have \nproducts now that we can be using. If we can provide the incentives and \nthe abilities to make sure the marketplace can become ready for these \nalternative fuels, we are on the cusp of finding the solution.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleague in working with me. I look \nforward to a very positive reception of our amendment with the \nwonderful cosponsors we have. I know the Senate will be ready to move \nforward on this one. I appreciate all the work Senators have put into \nthis alternative fuels effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I particularly appreciate the great work of \nmy colleague from Arkansas. There is a lot of rivalry across the \nborder, but on this one, the Senators from Arkansas and Missouri and \nmany other States are working together.\n  I have just come from a very exciting session outside with the \nNational Biodiesel Board Assistant Secretary, J. D. Penn; USDA; \nCongressman Hulshof; members of the Missouri Soybean Merchandising \nCouncil talking about the benefits that soy diesel can provide to our \nenvironment, to reducing our dependence on imported oil, and to \nstrengthening our rural economy.\n  They had a wonderful old soy diesel truck that the Missouri Soybean \nCouncil first brought here 10 years ago. That baby is still running, \nstill smells sweet. You follow that diesel down the road, you don't get \nsmoke coming out of it that smells like burning tires. Think of french \nfries. It is not only cleaning up the air, but it is using a renewable \nfuel. We have been talking about renewable fuels; they are doing it. \nThey are doing it in my State and Arkansas and Illinois and Iowa and \nDelaware, I gather. It works.\n  This is a fuel that doesn't require special kinds of newfangled \nengines. Right now the B-20 blend is being used in major bus fleets. \nThe St. Louis Bi-State Transit Authority has agreed to use 1.2 million \ngallons of soy diesel in a B-20 blend. We are working with the Kansas \nCity Area Transit Authority, which covers Kansas and Missouri, to use \nit. We have worked with Ft. Leonardwood in Missouri to train soldiers \nusing soy diesel for battlefield smoke rather than petroleum diesel. \nAgain, the real problem is that soldiers get hungry when they smell \nthat soy diesel smoke.\n  I think it is particularly useful because studies have shown there \nare dangers from using regular diesel in school buses, and soy diesel \ncan significantly clean up the emissions from buses as well.\n  What we are doing is very simple, as my good friend from Arkansas has \nalready pointed out. We are just changing a qualification or limitation \nthat was in the 1992 Energy Policy Act. We have not seen the progress \nwe expected under that act, also known as EPACT, to displace 10 percent \npetroleum by 2000 and 30 percent by 2010.\n  One of the problems is the limitations on the use of biodiesel or soy \ndiesel because they don't require alternative-fueled vehicles. \nIncidentally, the CAFE amendment proposed last week by the Senator from \nMichigan and myself and adopted on the energy bill specifically \nmandated that the alternative-fueled vehicles that are mandated in the \nexisting act actually use alternative fuels. And soy diesel is one way \nof getting there.\n  What we believe is important under the Energy Policy Act is to allow \n100 percent of the usage of biodiesel to be applied toward the \nrequirement.\n  Now, the fleets that are using it include the Army, Air Force, \nMarines, NASA, Department of Agriculture, national parks, State \ndepartments of transportation, in Missouri, Iowa, Ohio, Virginia, \nMaryland, and others, and public utilities, such as Commonwealth \nEdison, Georgia Power, Kansas City Power and Light, and Duke Energy.\n  These fleets have found the biodiesel fuel use option to give them \nmore flexibility to comply with their requirements, while more directly \naddressing the original intent of EPACT--displacing foreign petroleum \nsources. These fleets, particularly public utility fleets, that are \nstrapped for resources have urged Congress to lift the 50-percent \nlimitation on biodiesel fuel use credits. In addition to more directly \naddressing the primary intent of EPACT, the biodiesel fuel use \nprovision serves to address the secondary intent of EPACT, which is \nproviding for cleaner air emissions.\n  According to Government estimates, 90 percent of heavy-duty fleet \nemissions come from the oldest vehicles in the fleet. New vehicles that \nare being purchased are much cleaner. Biodiesel offers a solution to \ncleaning up the emissions of older vehicles.\n  Lifting the 50-percent limitation on biodiesel--which does not exist \nfor any other alternative fuel--will serve to enhance the effectiveness \nof the EPACT program. Biodiesel offers one of the best ways immediately \nto reduce our reliance on foreign petroleum through the use of our \nexisting national infrastructure and current and future diesel \ntechnology.\n  I would love to discuss the benefits of soy diesel at great length. \nIf anybody has any questions, the Senator from Arkansas or I will be \nmore than happy to discuss them. But given the fact that we do have \nmany contentious provisions and amendments to discuss, we will limit \nour comments, unless somebody wants to get into a debate. We welcome \nthe opportunity to provide more information on it.\n  With that, I simply urge all of my colleagues to support this \namendment. It has tremendous bipartisan support in the heartland. I \nthink, as more people look at it, this should be overwhelmingly \naccepted. I urge colleagues to look at it and ask questions and support \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to make a few comments \nconcerning the Senate and then the energy bill that is pending, and \nmaybe a couple of amendments that are pending as well.\n  I am very concerned, as an individual Senator who has been in the \nSenate for 22 years, about how the Senate is working--or, in some \ncases, not working. I am concerned about the pending bill and the fact \nthat I have served on this committee for 22 years and I didn't have a \nchance to offer an amendment. I am also concerned about how the bill \nhas grown. It started out at 400-some pages. The second bill, dated \nFebruary 26, had 539 pages. The bill we have pending, dated March 5, \nhas 590 pages.\n  This bill never went through committee and didn't have a committee \nmarkup. I didn't have a chance to amend it, to read it, or to improve \nit. The full Senate failed to have this opportunity as well. Twenty \nmembers of the Energy Committee didn't have that chance, either. So we \nnow face the situation where we are amending on the floor; we are \nsignificantly rewriting it on the floor. There were provisions that \ndidn't belong in the bill in the Energy Committee on CAFE. That \nbelonged in the Commerce Committee, but they didn't mark it up there, \neither. We had to amend that on the floor and fight that battle. Those \nprovisions on CAFE standards would have impacted every automobile user, \nconsumer, every person in the country. It would have made automobiles \nless safe, and it would have cost thousands of jobs and thousands of \ndollars per automobile. But we didn't have that debate in committee. We \ndidn't have a committee report to say what the impact would be.\n  We didn't have the committee report dealing with the energy bill, \neither. We didn't have minority views and majority views, which we \nusually do. Some people said it had been done before. It hasn't been \ndone in the Energy Committee. I have been on the committee for 22 \nyears. Every major substantive piece of legislation in the Energy \nCommittee has been bipartisan and has gone through the legislative \nprocess. Deregulation of natural gas comes to mind. That was a very \ncomplicated, comprehensive bill. We had both Democrat and Republican \nsupport.\n  But we didn't take these steps this case. We find ourselves rewriting \nthis, discussing it, and educating Members on the floor.\n  I noticed that Senator Daschle, when he was referring to the \nJudiciary Committee, made this quote in a news conference on March 6. I \nhave it behind me:\n\n       If we respect the committee process at all, I think you \n     have to respect the decisions of every committee. I will \n     respect the wishes and the decisions made by that committee, \n     as I would any other committee.\n\n  Then he said on March 14: Committees are there for a reason, and I \nthink we have to respect the committee jurisdiction, responsibility, \nand leadership, and that is what I intend to do.\n  That statement, I happen to agree with. It is just that we did not \nagree with it when it came to the energy bill. So we have been \nwrestling with this bill now for a couple of weeks. We may well spend \nanother couple of weeks on it. It is because we didn't do it in the \ncommittee. And so for the majority leader to say he respects the \nprocess, we didn't respect the committee process when we dealt with the \nenergy bill,\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\nunfortunately. We didn't respect it when we dealt with CAFE standards, \nwhich would have gone through the Commerce Committee. Now we are not \nrespecting the committee process in dealing with the Feinstein \namendment. That didn't go through the Banking Committee or the \nAgriculture Committee.\n\n  I happened to listen to the debate by Senators Gramm, Enzi, and \nFeinstein. I concur that most Members don't know much about the issue. \nI put myself in that majority group of Members. When you start talking \nabout derivatives and futures contracts, and so on, maybe your eyes \nglaze over and you say: Doesn't somebody else work on this issue? We \nare going to be deciding that on the floor of the Senate. We never had \na committee hearing on Senator Feinstein's proposal. Senator Gramm says \nit has impacts of $75 trillion. That is a lot of money. That is a lot \nof contracts. That is a lot of issues.\n  Should we not have committee hearings on that in the Agriculture \nCommittee, in the Banking Committee, where they deal with that issue \nand where they have expertise? I would think so.\n  We are going to be dealing with an issue of renewables. Senator Kyl \nhas an amendment on renewables. We had an amendment last week that \nSenator Jeffords offered, 20-percent renewables. He ended up getting \n30-some votes. Did the renewable section pass out of committee? No. But \nwe are going to pass a law that is going to mandate that every utility \nin the country has to come up with renewables of 10 or 20 percent? What \nis the impact of that? What does that mean to consumers on their \nutility bills? Is it even achievable?\n  What do you mean by renewables? When we look at the underlying \ndefinition that is in the Daschle-Bingaman bill, renewables doesn't \ncount hydro. Most of the definitions I have seen of renewables count \nhydro. According to this amendment, we are not going to count it as a \nrenewable. We are going to count solar, wind, biomass, and a few other \nthings; and if you add that together, that is about 1.5 percent of our \nelectricity production. We are going to waive a law, or a bill and say, \nbingo, you have to be at 10 percent, or maybe 20? What does that mean? \nHow much does that cost?\n  Senator Kyl has an amendment saying, hey, let's tell the States, do \nconsider renewables, give them flexibility on how to do it, and count \nhydro when you define renewables, as does everybody else in the world. \nEvery State counts hydro as a renewable. But it is not in this bill. \nWow. That little amendment, the 10-percent mandate for States to have \nrenewables--I have been trying to figure out how much it costs. I have \nchecked with experts. I get one figure of $88 billion over 10 or 15 \nyears. Other people are speculating since it simply depends on which \nrenewable you are talking about. Is it hydro or wind? We subsidized \nsome renewables--a lot.\n  Wind energy right now has a tax credit. I think it is about 1.7 cents \nper kilowatt. That is the equivalent of 40-some percent of the \nwholesale cost of electricity. That is a pretty large subsidy.\n  I guess wind energy could take up the balance. Can we take wind \nenergy from .2 percent of energy production up to 10 percent? I do not \nknow. We are going to have hundreds of square miles of windmills if we \ndo. Is that the right thing for our country to do, and can we do it \nwithout massive subsidies--we being the taxpayers--paying a significant \nportion of the energy cost? I do not know, but we are getting ready to \nvote on an amendment in the next day or two that will mandate this 10 \npercent. Is it going to be wind energy? Is it going to be solar? A lot \nof people are getting ready to vote and do not have a clue how much it \nwill cost or if it is even achievable.\n  I support Senator Kyl's amendment, and I hope my colleagues will as \nwell.\n  The Senate is not working and I am critical of the Energy Committee \nand I am offended because as a member of the Energy Committee, as \nsomeone who has invested a lot of time on that committee, for me not to \nhave any input on the composition of this bill is offensive to the \nprocess.\n  I read Senator Daschle's comments. He said: I will respect the wishes \nand the decisions made by that committee as I would with any other \ncommittee.\n  The wishes of the committee were not respected when it came to the \nenergy bill. We did not get that chance. We disenfranchised I know \nevery Republican member on the committee.\n  I have only been on the Energy Committee 22 years. Senator Murkowski \nhas been on it 22 years. Senator Domenici has been on it 26 years, \nmaybe longer, plus or minus. That is a lot of years not to have a \nchance to offer an amendment during a committee markup.\n  When Senator Daschle said he was going to respect the wishes and \ndecisions of the committee, he did not respect the wishes of the \ncommittee when it came to this major legislation, one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we will consider all year long. He did \nnot respect the wishes of the Commerce Committee when it came to CAFE \nstandards because they did not get to mark up the bill. They did not \nget to vote on it.\n  And I look at some of the other committees. It came to the \nAgriculture Committee. The Agriculture Committee did report out a bill \nbut, for the first time in my Senate career, it reported out a bill on \nan almost straight party vote. I think there was one member who crossed \nover. The committee came up with a very partisan agriculture bill for \nthe first time.\n  In addition, we had a partisan Finance Committee bill. We did not get \nthe stimulus package through. The Senate is not working.\n  The Judiciary Committee last week failed to approve the nomination--\nor send to the floor--of Judge Pickering who is now a district court \njudge. It is the first time in 11 years that the Judiciary Committee \ndefeated a nominee in committee, and 11 years ago is when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate.\n  I know I heard my colleagues, the leaders on both sides, say: We want \nto treat all judicial nominees fairly and give them appropriate \nconsideration. Circuit court nominees have not been treated fairly by \nthe Democrats who are running the Judiciary Committee today. They have \nnot been treated fairly.\n  There are 29 people President Bush has nominated for circuit court \nnominees. They have been nominated to be on the circuit court--29. \nSeven have been confirmed; two or three of those were Democrats \nnominated by the previous administration supported by Democratic \ncolleagues. We have done 7 out of 29. One was defeated. We have now had \na hearing on two. There are 19 who have never had a hearing--19.\n\n  There is a tradition in the Senate--maybe I should educate my \ncolleagues--there is a tradition in the Senate that we give Presidents \ntheir nominations by and large. If there is a problem with the \nnomination, fine, let's hold it, discuss it and debate it, but, by and \nlarge, Presidents have the majority of their nominations through the \nJudiciary Committee and through the Senate in their first 2 or 3 years \nas President.\n  I have a chart that shows President Reagan in his first 2 years got \n98 percent of his judges through, including 19 of 20 circuit court \nnominees. The first President Bush got 95 percent of his circuit court \nnominees, 22 out of 23. I might mention, that is when the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. Somebody said: No, Republicans controlled the \nSenate when Ronald Reagan was President. Yes, we did, but Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate when President Bush 41 was President, and he got \n93 percent of his judges in the first 2 years and 95 percent of the \ncircuit court nominees.\n  President Clinton in his first 2 years, with a Democratic Senate--got \n19 of 22 circuit court judges, 86 percent of circuit court judges, and \nby the end of his second year, he got 90 percent of all of his judges \nconfirmed. He got 129 judges. He got 100 judges confirmed in his second \nyear.\n  Why all of a sudden now with President Bush we have only done 24 \npercent? We have done 7 out of 29 circuit court nominees--7 out of 29. \nThat is pathetic. President Bush nominated nine on May 8 of last year. \nNine. We have disposed of one--that was Judge Pickering--and seven were \nconfirmed out of that nine. Eight have not even had a hearing.\n  Miguel Estrada, a Hispanic who immigrated to this country from \nHonduras when he was a young man--he immigrated, frankly, with nothing. \nHe\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\ncould not even speak English. He graduated with honors from Harvard. He \nhas argued 16 cases before the Supreme Court, and he has not even had a \nhearing. John Roberts argued 36 cases before the Supreme Court. He was \nnominated in May of last year. He has not even had a hearing.\n  We have only dealt with one-fourth of the circuit court nominees, \nwhile the three previous Presidents had 90-plus percent confirmed. 90-\nplus percent circuit court nominees in the three previous \nadministrations, Democrats and Republicans, were confirmed, and now we \nhave only confirmed 7 out of 29--that's one out of four.\n  That is not working. The Senate is not working. This institution I \nlove is not working. The Energy Committee did not work. It did not mark \nup a bill. So now we have to rewrite the bill on the floor.\n  The Commerce Committee did not work. The Agriculture Committee is \nbecoming partisan. We have never had a partisan agriculture bill in \ndecades. The Finance Committee could not even report out a stimulus \npackage. Eventually, we took half a package from the House and adopted \nit when in the past the tradition of the Senate has always been, \nwhether you are talking about Bob Dole, Bob Packwood, or Russell Long, \nwe had bipartisan tax bills almost every time, and we could not get it \ndone this year.\n  Mr. President, I am critical of the process. I happen to love this \ninstitution. I want the Senate to work. I want Members to do what \nSenator Daschle said: Have the committee process work. It is not \nworking, and it is not working in committee after committee.\n  I urge my colleagues that we lower the partisan rhetoric and do our \njob in committees and respect Members. I will also make a comment on \nJudge Pickering. It is unconscionable to me to believe that this fine \njudge was defeated. It is unbelievable to me to think Members would not \nconfirm a nominee who is a close friend of the Republican leader.\n  I cannot imagine that we would do something like that to the \nDemocratic leader. I cannot imagine that ever happening to Bob Dole. I \ncannot imagine it happening to George Mitchell. I cannot imagine it \nhappening to Howard Baker.\n  The Senate has really stooped, in my opinion, pretty low. Maybe in a \nway I am afraid we are trespassing where we should not go. It is very \nimportant that we step back and we figure out what is the right way to \nlegislate, what is the right way to consider nominees. If people are \nnominated to be a district court judge or a circuit court judge, they \nare entitled to a hearing, they are entitled to a vote whether \nDemocrats are in charge of the Senate or Republicans are in charge of \nthe Senate.\n  I am not saying we did it perfect either when the Republicans were in \ncharge. I do think, by and large, we ought to let people have a vote \ncertainly the first 2 and 3 years of a President's term. Maybe in the \nlast year of their term it is understood they do not get a lot of \njudges: Let's wait and see how the election goes. Particularly if the \njudges are nominated in the last few months of a Presidential term, \nthere are legitimate reasons to wait until after the election.\n  Let us come up with a little better understanding. We should not hold \npeople in limbo and maybe hold careers in jeopardy or on hold when we \nhave outstanding people who are willing to serve, and in many cases at \na great financial sacrifice. The President has nominated good people \nand they cannot even get a hearing? Something is wrong. Something is \nwrong on the Sixth Circuit Court when they only have 8 out of 16 \npositions filled. In other words, they have half that circuit court \nvacant. Something is wrong. The Senate is not working.\n  President Bush has nominated several outstanding nominees to the \nSixth Circuit and they should have a chance to have a hearing and to be \nvoted on. I am confident that the overwhelming majority would be \nconfirmed.\n  I saw Senator Daschle's comments when he said we ought to follow the \nSenate committee process. I agree with that. It is unfortunate we have \nnot been doing it. What happened last week in the Judiciary Committee, \nwhere Judge Pickering was defeated, I hope people do not go down that \nroad. Right now the Democrats are in control, but barely. My guess is \nRepublicans--I have been in the Senate where the leadership has \nchanged. I think this is the fourth time, and I am sure I am going to \nbe in the Senate where it is going to change again, and maybe again and \nagain. Who knows?\n  So people should recognize they can be in the majority, they can be \nin the minority. So to treat nominees the way they are being treated \nnow, because they happen to be a circuit court nominee, is not right. I \nwill also tell my colleagues on the Democrat side I will make the same \nstatement when Republicans are in control. I do not think we should \nhold people indefinitely and not give them hearings. I do not think we \nshould confirm 24 percent of the circuit court nominees. I think that \nis pathetic, and we need to do better. We need to do much better, and I \nhope and expect that the Senate will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that short biographies of the eight nominees \nwho were nominated on May 9 for the circuit court of appeals be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            May 9th Nominees\n\n\n john g. roberts, nominee to the court of appeals for the district of \n                                columbia\n\n       Mr. Roberts is the head of Hogan & Hartson's Appellate \n     Practice Group in Washington, D.C.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending business for the purpose of sending an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3038 to Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Miller, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3038 to amendment No. 3016.\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       (a) Requirement.--Section 111(d) of the Public Utility \n     Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2621(d)) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(14) Green energy.--\n       ``(a) Each electric utility shall offer to retail consumers \n     electricity produced from renewable sources, to the extent it \n     is available.\n       ``(b) Renewable sources of electricity include solar, wind, \n     geothermal, landfill gas, biomass, hydroelectric and other \n     renewable energy sources, as may be determined by the \n     appropriate state regulatory authority.''.\n       (b) Preservation of State Authority.--Nothing in this Act \n     affects the authority of a State to establish a program \n     requiring that a portion of the electric energy sold by a \n     retail electric supplier to electric consumers in that State \n     be generated by energy from any particular type of energy.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have laid down an amendment to the \nunderlying Bingaman amendment, which I think sets up a classic choice \nfor our colleagues. We have been selling this energy bill and \nespecially the electricity section of it as promoting competition, the \nmarket economy, and deregulation.\n  The underlying Bingaman bill is exactly the opposite of deregulation. \nIt is reregulation by the U.S. Government in a new and extraordinary \nway. The amendment I have laid down is an attempt to move forward with \nderegulation, keeping the Federal Government out of the business of \ntelling Americans what they have to do.\n  The Bingaman amendment reminds me of the old Soviet-style command \neconomy, where the Soviet government told the people of Russia what it \nwas going to have produced and they had to buy it. It did not allow \nchoice of production or consumption. The United States understands that \nis a road to ruin, but the Bingaman amendment says the U.S. Government \nis going to mandate, to require, to compel that 10 percent of the \nelectricity sold at retail in this country be produced with certain \nfuels, certain politically correct fuels.\n  They have been described as renewables, but not all renewables count \nbecause some renewables are more equal than others, to borrow the \nphrase from the animal farm. No, only those politically correct \nrenewables will count toward the requirement that 10 percent of the \nelectricity the people of this country buy in the future be from this \nparticular energy source.\n  It does not matter how much it costs. It does not matter what good it \ndoes. It does not matter how hard it is to do. It does not matter how \ndiscriminatory it is among different people within the country. None of \nthat matters. What matters is that people in Washington know best, and \nso the U.S. Government is going to tell people how much electricity \nthey have to buy from these unique sources of fuel: Biomass, wind, \nsolar, and geothermal. Other renewables such as hydropower, for \nexample, do not count. There is something wrong with hydropower. That \nis the underlying Bingaman amendment.\n  The Kyl amendment says let us leave it up to the States. Fourteen \nStates already require some percentage production of electricity with \nrenewables, as\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\ndefined by the States. They are moving toward the production of power \nthrough this so-called green energy, and that is fine. My own State has \na requirement that 2 percent of the energy sold at retail be produced \nin this fashion, all the way up to the State of Maine requirement that \n30 percent be produced through this kind of renewable fuel, and that is \nfine.\n  What the Kyl amendment says is each electric utility shall offer to \nretail consumers electricity produced from renewable sources, to the \nextent it is available. Then it defines renewable sources to include \nsolar, wind, geothermal, landfill gas, biomass, hydroelectric, and any \nothers as the State may determine are appropriate. Then it says that \nnothing in the act affects the authority of the State to establish a \nprogram requiring that a portion of the energy source come from \nrenewables. So we require the States to take a look at it, but we do \nnot tell them what they have to do because I do not think we know best.\n  I know the conditions in the State of Arizona are a lot different \nfrom the conditions in New York, for example. I do not think that New \nYorkers would be able to produce much solar electrical power, but we \ncan sure do that out in Arizona.\n  I heard my colleague from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, say his State of \nNorth Dakota had been defined as the Saudi Arabia of wind. I say \nwonderful. Then let them produce electricity through wind power. I am \nnot stopping them. Senator Bingaman is not stopping them from doing \nthat. The State of North Dakota can produce 100 percent of its power \nfrom wind generation if it wants.\n\n  It is interesting to me that North Dakota is not in that list of \nStates that requires any production of retail electricity from \nrenewable fuels--Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Wisconsin. Where is the Saudi Arabia of wind? It is not here.\n  The people of North Dakota who have all of this resource must have \nsome reason why they are not taking advantage of it. And since we are \nproviding a tax credit of a billion dollars a year to those who produce \nelectricity through these renewables, one would think that would be a \nbig incentive. As a matter of fact, that is how we are getting the \nrenewable produced energy in the country today. We provide a carrot, a \nbig tax credit. We just extended it for 2 more years in this bill at a \ncost of $2 billion. So there is a big incentive to produce electricity \nwith taxpayer subsidy.\n  As I recall, the subsidy is something like 1.7 cents per kilowatt \nhour for wind generation, which is about 40 percent or so of the cost \nof producing the power. That is a pretty generous subsidy. So if a \nState such as North Dakota has that much capacity to produce it, then \nwhy does it not produce it? Why does the Senator from that State say, \nlook, we have decided, or we have not decided, to require this in our \nown State, but we are going to require it for everybody else and then \nmaybe it will work for us.\n  Maybe what they are saying is we can have a lot of production in our \nState if everybody else has to buy it from us. Maybe that is it.\n  As a matter of fact, it transpires that there are a couple of \nutilities that apparently have access to a lot of wind generation, and \nthey are lobbying pretty hard to get this bill passed. The reason? They \nare going to get the U.S. Government to tell everybody else they have \nto buy power from these particular producers.\n\n  We have always been against oligarchy, monopolies, in this country. \nWhy would the U.S. Government force people to buy a particular kind of \nenergy knowing it is only produced by a very few sets of utilities \ntoday? Talk about a windfall. I suggest the Energy Committee ought to \nlook at this very carefully, take a little inventory of who is \nproducing this and who is not. My guess is there are a very few, very \nspecial people who are going to benefit from this big time. I would \nlike to know who they are. I would like to know to whom they have \ncontributed in their campaigns. I would like to know whom they have \nlobbied.\n  There has been criticism of energy people talking to Vice President \nCheney before he came up with the administration's energy plan. I would \nlike to know who, on behalf of these particular utilities, has talked \nto whom and what kind of support there is to enrich this small group of \nutilities that would take advantage of this particular amendment. I \nwould like to know that.\n  However, we did not have any markup in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. That was taken away from the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on which I sit. We had no opportunity to get into \nthat. We are going to be asking some of those questions. We never had a \ncost-benefit analysis. We have no idea whether this is going to do any \ngood and, if so, how much good, and how you can quantify it, but we do \nknow how much it will cost. On the order of $88 billion, for starters. \nThat is only until the year 2020. After that, it is $12 billion a year. \nWho pays? The electric customers. Is it equal for all of the electric \ncustomers in the country? No, it turns out it is not. If you are \nfortunate enough to be a State that can produce this renewable energy \nelectricity, it will not cost. You get to sell credits to the States \nthat do not produce it. They have to buy the credits. What do they get \nfor that? Nothing. They do not get any electricity. What they get is a \npass from the Federal Government from having to build those renewable \nenergy sources themselves.\n  What we are doing is creating a big new market in electric credits. \nThis is a la Enron--not producing anything but creating credits. As a \nmatter of fact, as I read the Bingaman amendment, it is not restricted \nto production in the United States. In fact, I believe it is \ncontemplated British Columbia electrical production could be imported \ninto the United States for the credits it would be provided. As a \nmatter of fact, I don't understand why other countries would not get \ninto this, too. The Three Gorges Dam in China might well qualify. Since \nthe generators have not been put in the Three Gorges Dam, that would be \nincremental additional electrical production by hydro--the only way you \ncan count hydro.\n  Since it is not limited by the current language, as I read the \namendment, what we are doing is creating a trading market in electrical \nrenewable energy credits which might well enrich not just a few special \ncompanies in the United States but some foreign countries as well. Who \npays the tab? The electrical retail consumer.\n  I have this challenge for my friends who think it is a wonderful \nidea: How will they feel when somebody runs an ad against them in their \nnext campaign that says: Are you sick and tired of high electric energy \nrates? You have Senator So-and-So to thank for that because he got a \nbill passed that required, by the authority of the U.S. Government, \nyour electrical retail seller to buy 10 percent of the energy from \nthese costly renewables or, if you do not buy that, to buy the credits. \nThe credits, of course, will cost a lot of money. As a matter of fact, \nthese credits probably will become a very valuable commodity.\n\n  The way the Bingaman amendment works, as I understand it, the \ngenerator does not get the credits. If I have an electrical generating \nfacility in Arizona and I decide to create a lot of solar-powered \ngeneration and I know there is a big market for electricity in \nCalifornia, I sell a lot of this power to California so the folks in \nLos Angeles can air-condition their homes or for whatever they need the \npower. I don't get the credit for that. The retailer in Los Angeles is \nthe one that gets the credit for whatever renewable fuel is used in the \nproduction of that electricity.\n  What does that mean? First of all, if I have any retail customers \nmyself, I will try to keep that power. Although electricity is \nfungible, I will somehow try to allocate it to my retail customers. But \nif I have extra power, what I might do is, instead of applying it to my \nrequirement, I might simply say I have this much on the market, and I \nwill withhold it from the market, and I will see how much it would \nbring on the market.\n  Of course, our friends from California complained about the fact that \nEnron and others withheld energy from the market, thus driving the cost \nup.\n  A retail seller in Los Angeles is going to need a lot of renewable \npower in order to meet this mandate. Where is\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nthat company going to get the renewable power? It will have to buy it \nfrom somebody. If that electricity or those credits are withheld from \nthe market long enough, the cost of the credits will escalate \nsubstantially. There is nothing in the bill that prevents that.\n  There is no regulatory regime, although I am sure once we get going, \nthere will be a very big regulatory regime. It is fraught with \npotential for fraud and abuse. Once we see all of that happening, we \nwill have to have a director of this and that, with a big bureaucracy \nand a lot of law enforcement and penalties in order to enforce the law \nso it will not be abused. We will have the Enron situations, and there \nwill be a big hue and cry, and we will all want to prevent that, so we \nwill establish more bureaucracy. The Soviet survival command economy \nwill march on as we have to enforce the policy we dictate.\n  What are we going to do? Are we going to force people to sell the \ncredits they have accumulated? Are we going to say they can only sell \nthem for a certain amount of money? As I read the Bingaman amendment, \nthere is one other place you can buy the credits. You can buy them from \nsomeone who has already produced the power or, I gather, if it is not \navailable, you can buy it from the Department of Energy. The Department \nof Energy, even though it does not produce anything, would be able to \nsell these credits at something like 200 percent their value or 3 cents \na kilowatt hour. Actually, the Federal Government might make some money \non this.\n  Who pays the tab? The retail electric customers. Is that what this is \nall about: Another way to tax the American people? It kind of sounds \nlike it to me. As a matter of fact, there are two new taxes in this \nlegislation. One is the tax of which I just spoke, and the other is a \nBtu tax by any other name. Remember when we defeated the Btu tax? It \nwas a tax on coal-fired, oil-fired, gas-fired, and nuclear production \nof electricity. We said: That is not fair. That is what is embodied in \nthe Bingaman amendment and the underlying bill. We are favoring some \nenergy sources over others.\n  What are the ones in disfavor, out of favor? Nuclear, coal, hydro, \noil, and gas. That is how we produce about 98 percent of the power in \nthe country today. Those are out of favor. The people who get their \nelectricity from those sources will pay a tax to those who are willing \nto pay for and generate the power through the renewable fuels or who \nbuy the credits. There will be a tremendous transfer of wealth in this \ncountry. If you live in the State of New York and New York has a hard \ntime producing wind power or solar-powered generation, then the retail \nseller in New York will have to somehow acquire credits to offset the \nfact that you cannot generate that kind of power in New York. Who is \ngoing to pay the cost of those credits? The retail customers of the New \nYork utilities. And to whom are they going to be paying them? They are \ngoing to be paying them to the favored States, those that actually \ncould produce this renewable fuel energy. This is the equivalent of a \nBtu tax. If you are going to get your power from coal or nuclear, for \nexample, you are going to pay a big premium. Your customers are going \nto have to pay because you are not producing electricity with the \nfavored fuels.\n\n  That is wrong. This legislation is costly, it is discriminatory, it \nwalks away from deregulation, and imposes a massive new regulation of \nwhat we can buy in this country, it is anti-American, and it also will \nfavor the few to the cost of the many. We don't even know who those few \nare. They know who they are. They are lobbying for this legislation. \nBut I suggest we better know who they are before we vote on it or this \nis going to come around and bite folks.\n  I know some of my colleagues say, Oh, I need a green vote. I need to \nimpress my environmentalists.\n  I have two responses to that. Vote your conscience. Do whatever you \nwant to do. But if you are just trying to do this to impress some \nenvironmental constituents, think about all the rest of the \nconstituents, the ones who have to buy electricity. Do they count? They \nare the ones who are going to have to pay the bill. I hope they \nremember at election time that they are just as important as this \nenvironmental community that wants a green vote out of some of my \ncolleagues.\n  Why are you willing to impose a requirement on others that they buy a \nparticular product that one of your friends has to sell? To me that is \nvery unfair.\n  This is one more thing that makes this unfair. There was a point of \norder that lay against part of this amendment as it pertained to a \nmandate on the municipalities and State-owned and co-ops and others \nthat are the political subdivisions that generate and sell power. \nBecause it would have required a significant expense for them, it was \nan unfunded mandate and would have been subject to a point of order. So \nSenator Bingaman has wisely agreed to take the mandate out as it \nrelates to those particular sellers of power and generators of power. I \nthink that is a good thing.\n  The problem is, it creates a great disparity and distinction between \nthose generators on the one hand and the investor-owned generators and \nsellers on the other hand. Now we have a massive discrimination. The \nmunicipals do not have to comply but the investor-owned utilities do \nhave to comply. To their credit, the power association for the \nmunicipals, and many of the individual municipals and political \nsubdivisions that are currently exempted, have taken the position that \nthe underlying Bingaman bill is still a bad proposition. It is bad on \nprinciple, regardless of the fact they do not have to comply with it \nnow. But they are also concerned that in the end they will have to \ncomply, that they were only removed from its provisions because a point \nof order lay, and that there would be an attempt later to include them \nin it--among other things, because it is unfair for one group of \nutilities to be treated one way and another group to be treated another \nway.\n  I appreciate that they have not backed off their opposition to the \nbill notwithstanding the fact that temporarily they are not subject to \nits provisions.\n  I note the cosponsor of my amendment to leave this to the States, the \nSenator from Georgia, is present. For the purpose of allowing him to \ncomment on this for a moment, I would like to yield to him and then, \nwhen he has completed all he wants to say, regain the time so I can \nmake some more comments. I would like to yield to my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Miller.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will not object to this procedure, \nalthough it is a little unusual. I would like a chance to respond to \nthe Senator from Arizona at some point here. So I do not want him \nyielding time to various people around the floor for the whole \nafternoon. I am glad to have the cosponsor, Senator Miller, go ahead \nand speak and then, when the Senator from Arizona concludes, I will \nexpect to speak at that point.\n  Mr. KYL. That is certainly acceptable to me, and I appreciate the \nsentiment of the Senator from New Mexico. I simply saw my colleague \nfrom Georgia and wanted him to have an opportunity to interrupt my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Georgia seeking \nrecognition in his own right?\n  Mr. MILLER. I ask to be recognized for up to 5 minutes to speak on \nthe legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I will be very \nbrief.\n  I rise in support of the Kyl/Miller amendment on the renewable \nportfolio standard. As a Governor and now a Senator, I have always been \nsensitive to the real-world effects of policy. I want to tell you about \nsome of the real-world effects of the issue before us today, the issue \nof renewable fuels.\n  I commend the majority leader and the Senator from New Mexico for \nincluding the subject of renewable fuels in the debate on the \ncomprehensive energy bill. I think it is very important for us to be \nable to enjoy the comfortable life we all expect and still leave a \nclean planet to our children and our grandchildren. Using renewable \nfuels helps our society to fulfill these goals.\n  But when I read the original provisions on renewable fuels in S. 517, \nthey give me pause. I understand Senator\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nBingaman's intent in putting a renewable standard in this bill. I think \nthat is good. With all due respect, however, I believe he is going \nabout it in the wrong way.\n  Perhaps it is because of my previous life, but I trust State \ngovernments. I trust the people who run them, and I think we need to \ntrust the States to create a renewable standard that meets both their \nneeds and their capabilities. We do not need to hand them an expensive \nFederal standard that they will not be able to meet.\n  Fourteen States already have renewable programs in place, and this \namendment would preempt them. It would be saying to them: We are \nsmarter. We know better.\n  States would be forced to pass renewable legislation to meet \nconditions mandated by the Federal Government. I don't think that is \nhow it should work.\n\n  These blanket conditions do not take into account the needs and \nrequirements of each individual State, and they are different. What \nworks in Georgia might not work in New Mexico, and vice versa.\n  My State of Georgia, I am proud to say, has been a leader in the \nproduction of reliable low-cost energy. If the underlying amendment is \nenacted, consumers in Georgia could end up paying for credits to \nsubsidize renewables in other parts of the country. Georgia would be \nforced to pay for a benefit that it will never receive, and I do not \nthink that is right.\n  In my State of Georgia, the Governor has commissioned an energy task \nforce to examine current and future needs for energy generation in the \nState. This will include a formal study and recommendations for how to \nuse renewable fuel sources, and how to best take advantage of Georgia's \navailable natural resources.\n  The task force will also assess the demand for renewable energy to \ndetermine if the cost and benefit will be supported by electricity \nusers in the State. These are the people who know and understand \nGeorgia's energy needs and capabilities. These are the people who \nshould be in charge of regulating Georgia's renewables. That is why \nSenator Kyl and I have introduced this amendment. That is why I urge my \nfellow Senators to support it. Our amendment encourages the use of \nrenewable fuels, but it lets the States decide how to do this.\n  This Nation can attain the goal of cleaner energy, but we must do it \nin the right way. We must let the States decide for themselves the \nlevel of renewable fuel that works best for each of them.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to say to the Senator from Alaska, I have a \ncouple more points I want to make before I conclude as does, I know, \nSenator Bingaman.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record numerous \nletters in support of the Kyl amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             American Public Power\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Senate Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of the American Public Power \n     Association (APPA), an association representing the interests \n     of more than 2,000 publicly owned electric utility systems \n     across the country, I would like to express support for your \n     amendment regarding renewable portfolio standards (RPS) which \n     is expected to be offered during consideration of S. 517, the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n       While APPA has consistently supported efforts to expand the \n     use of renewable energy, we nevertheless oppose the use of \n     federal mandates as a mechanism to achieve that goal. APPA \n     has always maintained that decisions of this type are best \n     made at the local level.\n       Your amendment would shift the RPS program to Section \n     111(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. \n     This would, in effect, remove the federal mandate and leave \n     decisions related to a RPS to the discretion of State and \n     local regulatory bodies. Further, your amendment preserves \n     the ability of States and local governing bodies to create \n     and implement their own renewable energy programs. This will \n     enable a balanced approach, which takes into account the \n     unique and diverse characteristics of regions and customer \n     bases, to promoting renewable energy sources. For these \n     reasons APPA supports your amendment.\n       While APPA continues to have major concerns with the \n     current language in Title II--Electricity of the bill, I \n     commend you for taking a leadership role on this critical \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alan H.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers and the 18 million people who make things in \n     America, I urge you to oppose federal mandated renewable \n     portfolio standards, and support the amendment to be offered \n     by Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) to the Energy Policy Act of 2002 \n     (S. 517). The NAM represents 14,000 members (including 10,000 \n     small and mid-sized companies) and 350 associations serving \n     manufacturers and employees in every industrial sector and \n     all 50 states.\n       The NAM will consider any votes that may occur on the \n     renewable portfolio standards as possible Key Manufacturing \n     Votes in the NAM Voting Record for the 107th Congress. The \n     NAM strongly urges you to support the renewable portfolio \n     amendment that will be offered by Senator Kyl, and oppose the \n     amendments to continue the federal mandates (using different \n     levels) that will be offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) \n     and Senator James Jeffords (I-VT).\n       Now is not the time to raise electricity rates by mandating \n     construction of renewable (mostly wind) technologies to \n     generate electricity--mandates that may not be achievable and \n     may threaten electricity reliability.\n       A one-size-fits-all national standard is not in the best \n     interests of the economy and energy security. States that do \n     not have adequate wind resources, or have already invested \n     heavily in renewable energy that will not be counted toward \n     meeting the mandates, will suffer disproportionately under \n     the Jeffords and Bingaman amendments.\n       Senator Kyl's amendment will encourage the various states \n     to tailor renewable portfolios to meet the needs and wishes \n     of their citizens, instead of having the federal government \n     dictate which energy sources each state must use to generate \n     electricity.\n       Congressionally mandated renewable portfolio increases will \n     have negative consequences for manufacturers and consumers, \n     while doing little to address our nation's energy security \n     goals. As the manufacturing sector struggles out of its 18-\n     month recession, it is vital that the Senate help--not hurt--\n     America's economy.\n       The nation needs a balanced energy policy that will serve \n     as the foundation for economic growth. Please support Senator \n     Kyl's amendment to eliminate the federal renewable mandate, \n     which will dramatically improve S. 517 and help to further \n     that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael E. Baroody,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: We are writing to express our deep \n     concern over the economic impact of the renewable electricity \n     portfolio mandates contained in the Substitute Amendment (the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2002) to S. 517. This renewable \n     portfolio standard would require that 10 percent of all \n     electricity generated in 2020 must be generated by renewable \n     facilities built after 2001. The renewable portfolio standard \n     would become effective next year, and the amount of renewable \n     generation required would increase every year between 2005 \n     and 2020. While we believe that renewable sources of \n     generation should have an important, and growing, role in \n     supplying our electricity needs, the provisions contained in \n     the Substitute Amendment are not reasonable and cannot be \n     achieved without causing dramatic electricity price \n     increases. This in turn would have the unintended consequence \n     of reducing the competitiveness of American businesses in the \n     global economy and, thereby, reducing economic growth and \n     employment.\n       Today, according to the Energy Information Administration, \n     non-hydro renewables placed in service over past decades make \n     up only about 2.16 percent of the total amount of electricity \n     generated in the United States. However, even this modest \n     existing renewable capacity will not count under the \n     Substitute Amendment toward satisfying the renewable \n     portfolio requirement. Generally, under that Amendment, \n     renewable facilities that can be used to meet the 10 percent \n     minimum must be placed in service in 2002 or thereafter. \n     Therefore, compliance with the Substitute Amendment's 2.5 \n     percent renewable mandate for 2005 would require doubling the \n     amount of non-hydro renewables that we now have in just three \n     years--even though it took us more than 20 years to get to \n     where we are today.\n       In addition, because the Substitute Amendment requires that \n     10 percent of all electricity generation, not capacity, must \n     come from renewables, vast numbers of renewable electricity-\n     generating facilities will have to be built. Wind energy, \n     perhaps the most promising non-hydro renewable technology, \n     operates effectively only between 20 percent to 40 percent of \n     the time. Solar is also intermittent. Therefore, the actual\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n     amount of newly installed capacity needed to generate enough \n     electricity to meet the Daschle Amendment's requirements \n     could well exceed 20,000 negawatts by 2005. To put this into \n     context, according to the American Wind energy Association, \n     we currently have less than 5,000 megawatts of installed wind \n     capacity in the United States.\n       Simply imposing an unreasonably large, federally mandated \n     requirement to generate electricity from renewables will not \n     guarantee that enough windmills and other renewable \n     facilities can be built on schedule; that the wind (or sun or \n     rain) will cooperate; or that the generating costs will be as \n     low as would be the case from a more diverse, market-dictated \n     portfolio of conventional, as well as renewable and \n     alternative fuels. If retail supplies do not comply with the \n     mandate, they would face a 3 cent per kilowatt hour civil \n     penalty. Some may suggest that this penalty would operate as \n     a ``cap'' on the inevitable run up of electricty costs under \n     the Amendment. Even if this penalty were effective at \n     limiting skyrocketing electricity costs--and experience with \n     similar ``penalties'' indicates that it will not--the penalty \n     still would constitute an almost doubling of \n     current wholesale electricity prices for renewable power. \n     Clearly, electricity rates will substantially increase if \n     the Substitute Amendment becomes law.\n       The federal government's past record in choosing fuel \n     ``winners and losers'' is dismal. The Powerplant and \n     Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which prohibited the use of \n     natural gas in electric powerplants and discouraged its use \n     in many industrial facilities, was essentially repealed less \n     than a decade later when its underlying premises were \n     conceded to be wrong. While holding back the use of natural \n     gas, the federal government spent billions of dollars \n     attempting to commercialize ``synthetic fuels,'' including \n     oil shale and tar sands, with little to show for its efforts.\n       While we believe that the federal government has an \n     important role to play in encouraging the development of \n     renewable and other energy technologies, we are troubled when \n     that role turns to mandates and market set-asides for one \n     particular fuel or technology. Mandates and set-asides \n     usually don't work, and create unintended consequences far \n     more severe than the underlying problem being addressed.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you support \n     efforts to modify the language in section 265 of the \n     Substitute Amendment to S. 517, in order to eliminate or \n     mitigate the harmful economic consequences of the renewable \n     fuels portfolio mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc.\n       Alliance for Competitive Electricity.\n       American Chemistry Council.\n       American Iron and Steel Institute.\n       American Lighting Association.\n       American Paper Machinery Association.\n       American Portland Cement Alliance.\n       American Textile Manufacturers Institute.\n       Association of American Railroads.\n       Carpet and Rug Institute.\n       Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy.\n       Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry.\n       Edison Electric Institute.\n       Electricity Consumers Resource Council.\n       Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n       Industrial Energy Consumers of America.\n       International Association of Drilling Contractors.\n       Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Lime Association.\n       National Mining Association.\n       National Ocean Industries Association.\n       North American Association of Food Equipment Manufacturers.\n       Nuclear Energy Institute.\n       Ohio Manufacturers' Association.\n       Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce & Industry.\n       Pennsylvania Foundry Association.\n       Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association.\n       Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       Utah Manufacturers Association.\n       Westbranch Manufacturers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: The undersigned associations urge you to \n     support the ``renewable portfolio standards'' (RPS) amendment \n     expected to be offered today by Senator Kyl and Senator \n     Miller to S. 517, the Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n       The Kyl/Miller RPS amendment will preserve the ability of \n     each State to decide for itself and its own citizens which \n     appropriate mix of renewable and alternative energy sources \n     is optimal for their own preferences and needs. In addition, \n     the amendment will ensure that businesses and homeowners \n     alike will have more affordable and reliable electricity \n     supplies in the future, with renewable energies being an \n     important and appropriate part of the energy mix.\n       The Senate should not adopt a one-size-fits-all national \n     mandate for an arbitrary quota for renewable energy use in \n     producing electricity, such as is currently in section 265 of \n     S. 517. Sen. Bingaman's amendment attempts to make the \n     mandates in S. 517 more technically feasible, but his \n     amendment still mandates an aggressive, nationwide renewable \n     portfolio standard that will raise costs, threaten \n     electricity reliability and create inequities among not only \n     energy sources, but also among States and electricity \n     generators.\n       Many States do not have access to optimal wind energy \n     locations or large volumes of inexpensive biomass. Under Sen. \n     Bingaman's amendment, consumers in these States would have to \n     pay for electricity generated in other States that have more \n     access to renewable energy. In addition, the Bingaman \n     amendment treats electricity generators differently--large \n     private utilities are covered, but, inexplicably, public \n     electricity generation is exempt, at least for the present.\n       Finally, adopting a mandated federal renewable quota will \n     establish a framework for additional market interference in \n     the future, such as by raising the percentage of the \n     portfolio or extending the mandate to other electricity \n     generators or other energy users. Such portfolio mandates fly \n     in the face of the goals of reasonable electricity policy--to \n     increase competition and efficiency in the electricity market \n     and to lower consumer costs.\n       We urge you to vote for the Kyl/Miller amendment to \n     eliminate mandated federal renewable portfolio standards and \n     replace them with a provision that encourages the States and \n     their citizens to determine their own goals for renewable \n     energy sources. Please support the Kyl/Miller amendment to \n     forge a sound energy policy that will promote economic growth \n     and prosperity for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc.\n       American Chemistry Council.\n       American Iron and Steel Institute.\n       American Paper Machinery Association.\n       American Petroleum Institute.\n       American Portland Cement Alliance.\n       American Textile Manufacturers Institute.\n       Association of American Railroads.\n       Edison Electric Institute.\n       Electricity Consumers Resource Council.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Electrical Manufacturers Association.\n       National Lime Association.\n       Naitonal Mining Association.\n       Natural Gas Supply Association.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       US Oil & Gas Association.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Second, if I could, I would like to make a couple of points \nin conclusion and then respond to any questions or comments that \nSenator Bingaman would like to make, and I also want to hear what our \nranking member, Senator Murkowski, wants to say because I know he and I \nwere both looking forward to having an opportunity to work on this \nissue in the Energy Committee. As I noted, we didn't have that \nopportunity.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Georgia just said. As a former \nGovernor of the State, he appreciates, probably more than most of us, \nthe responsibilities of the publicly elected officials and the need to \nknow what works and what does not work in any given State and what is \nfair for the people within their State. That is really the basis for \nthe Kyl-Miller amendment: to allow the States to determine what is in \ntheir best interest.\n  I note that in more than 90 utilities across the country there is \nalready a green pricing policy, what they call green pricing, which \nallows consumers to request and pay for the cost of this green power. \nIn other words, they can say, I want 50 percent of my power to come \nfrom renewable sources, or whatever it is, and whatever the cost of \nthat is, the utility is required to provide that power to them and \ncharge that cost to them. That is a customer's option.\n  That is one of the specific provisions in the Kyl-Miller amendment. \nObviously, this would be preempted, as with the other State programs, \nwith the underlying Bingaman amendment.\n  I also make the point that I did not make earlier, which is that the \nadministration, Secretary Spencer Abraham specifically, has told me he \nis supportive of the Kyl amendment and not supportive of the Bingaman \nproposal.\n  Another thing I want to do is make the point that section 263 of the \nbill allows the Federal Government to purchase a percentage of its \nelectricity from renewable sources--I am quoting now--``but only to the \nextent economically feasible and technically practicable,'' and the \nminimum required purchase is 7.5 percent, while section 265 imposes a \n10-percent mandate on private utilities, and it does not include the \n``economically feasible and technologically practicable'' waiver. So \nagain, there is another double standard here. The Federal Government is \nnot required to do as much as\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nthe private utilities are required to do and has a special waiver that \nit can exercise. If this is such a great idea, why wouldn't we apply it \nto the Federal Government just as much as we would to the private \nsector? I do not really have an answer to that.\n\n  I make a point, too, that with respect to the cost-benefit analysis, \none of the concerns I have had is that the ability of States to provide \npower through renewables is not without tradeoff. I will show you a \ncouple charts that illustrate this point.\n  In the case of the Southwest, where we have a lot of sunshine, maybe \nthis is the ``Saudi Arabia for solar power,'' but it is at significant \ncost. This chart illustrates the fact that you are going to have to \nhave an enormous quantity of desert covered with these reflective \nmirrors, about 2,000 acres of solar panels, it is estimated, to produce \nthe energy equivalent to 4,464 barrels of oil per day. Two thousand \nacres of ANWR would produce a million barrels of oil a day. So for the \nequivalent 2,000 acres: In one case, you get a million barrels of oil, \nand in the other case you get the equivalent of 4,400 barrels of oil.\n  It would take 448,000 acres, or two-thirds of the entire State of \nRhode Island, of solar panels to produce as much energy as the 2,000 \nacres of ANWR that are available for energy production here.\n  I do not know exactly how many square miles, but one of the \nassessments was it would take 2,000 square miles to produce the same \namount of energy that would be produced by a nuclear generating \nfacility. If that is true, you would have a corridor 5 or 10 miles wide \non either side of the highway all the way from Tucson to Phoenix with \nthese reflective mirrors. I have not done the environmental analysis of \nthat. I know it would not be very attractive. I do not know what the \nother costs to the environment would be. But that is the problem. We \nhave had no environmental analysis.\n  The same problem exists with respect to wind generation. Wind \ngeneration, we understand, has certain environmental consequences. It \nis not very friendly to birds, although with more and more of the \nFederal subsidy, they have been working on ways to design the \npropellers so they turn more slowly and therefore give the birds a \nlittle bit better chance.\n  But 2,000 acres of wind generators produce the energy equivalent to \nonly 1,815 barrels of oil each day; again, compared to a million \nbarrels of oil that would be produced out of the same number of acres \nin ANWR. It would take 3.7 million acres of wind generators, or all of \nthe States of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, to produce as much \nenergy as just 2,000 acres of ANWR.\n  Now the 2,000 acres, we have said before, is roughly the equivalent \nof Dulles International Airport. So you can get an idea, if you take \nDulles Airport on the one hand and the States of Connecticut and Rhode \nIsland on the other hand, you get a little bit of an idea of some of \nthe tradeoffs involved. I do think there has been adequate \nconsideration of the kind of tradeoffs that would be required to \nproduce the massive amounts of energy that are called for under this \nlegislation as a substitute for other ways of producing power.\n  As I understand it, the way the Bingaman amendment works is that each \npublic power, or, that is to say, investor-owned utility supplier, \nwould be annually required to report to the Secretary of Energy several \nfacts: One, how much their electric retail load is; what percentage of \nthat was produced by renewable fuels; how they acquired that renewable \nfuel--was it by production purchased through a wholesaler or renewable \ncredit, or in whatever form it was--and then there would be an audit \ndone. In the first year, it would be 1 percent required, the year 2005; \nand it would escalate to 10 percent by the year 2019.\n\n  You would exclude the eligible renewables, municipal waste, and hydro \nfrom that, and the credits would have to be from sources other than \nexisting hydro. The only way you could get additional hydro, or any \nhydro credit, would be if you did something such as rewinding the \ngenerators or, in some other way, added to the efficiency of a \nparticular unit.\n  As I said earlier, you could acquire, at a 200-percent market cost, a \ncredit from the Department of Energy as well, even though energy would \nnot be producing any new power. What would the cost of this be?\n  According to the Energy Information Administration of the Department \nof Energy, you are looking at a cost, starting in the year 2005, of \nabout $2 billion, escalating, by the year 2020, to a cost of about just \na little bit under $12 billion per year. And most of that would be from \nproduction. There would be a small amount through penalty payments \nbecause of the assumption not a whole 100 percent of the production \ncould actually be achieved at that point. Every year thereafter, for \nthe next 10 years, you would be paying $12 billion a year. So you are \ntalking about $88 billion of gross cost, in addition to $12 billion \neach year thereafter until the year 2030. That is a lot of money that \nwould have to be paid by the retail customers of the utilities.\n  Just a couple questions, and then I will give Senator Bingaman a \nchance to respond and perhaps answer some of these questions.\n  I made the point before that it does not appear to me the generation \nof the renewables is required to be within the State in which the \nelectricity is sold. So, presumably, you would have a credit trading \nsystem throughout the United States. And I do not even see a limitation \nto power produced in the United States. As a matter of fact, as I \nunderstand it, as drafted, incremental hydro from B.C. Hydro would \ncount, and then a retail supplier from the United States could use that \nas a required percentage to be achieved under the legislation.\n  One of the concerns--I guess another question I would have--is \nwhether there is actually a reverse incentive not to produce power with \nrenewables. I know that is the intention of the sponsors of the \namendment. But I think it could quite work in exactly the opposite \ndirection. Because of the tradeable credits that are being created \nunder this legislation, you would actually have an interest in \nwithholding those credits from the market and even preventing the \nsiting of any new generation.\n  Here is the concern I have for those of us who are in the West where \nthere is some potential for some new generation. In my State of \nArizona, in the State of Nevada, in the State of New Mexico, and \nothers, a very large percentage of the land is owned by the U.S. \nGovernment. In the State of Arizona, only 12 percent or 13 percent of \nthe land is privately owned. Another 12 or 13 percent is owned by the \nState. The rest is held in trust by the U.S. Government. In Nevada, it \nis approximately 90 percent.\n  You would have to have a lot of permits to cross Nevada Federal lands \nfor either the generation or the transmission. Every action is a \nFederal action. They have to have an environmental impact statement. \nAnd the opportunities to prevent the establishment of energy generation \nand transmission throughout the Western United States are substantial.\n  I suspect there would be an incentive on the part of those who have a \nmonopoly on the generation of this power right now to maintain that \nmonopoly by finding ways to throw roadblocks in the way of the \nproduction of this power, especially those States, as I said, where \nthere is substantial Federal land-ownership such as my State of \nArizona. Both because there would be an incentive to withhold the \ncredits from the market in order to enhance their value and because \nthere would be the natural tendency to use the Government yet again to \nadvance economic purposes by withholding approval of competitive \ngeneration, I suspect there could be actually a diminution in renewable \ngenerated power than an enhancement of that power.\n  I am especially sensitive to the concerns of those from California \nwho charge that there was a deliberate attempt to withhold energy from \nthe California market which jacked up the prices there. And we all know \nthat California consumers suffered as a result of much higher prices \njust 1 year ago.\n  These are some of the concerns and questions I have. I am anxious to \nunderstand how the amendment is intended to work and how it could be \nmade to work in such a way that it would not be as costly as I \nindicated; how it would not be discriminatory;\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nhow it would not preempt the States that already have programs such as \nthis, that I indicated; how it wouldn't impact the environment in a \nnegative way; how it would not result in the trading of credits to the \ndetriment of the retail purchasers in States that would have to buy \nthose credits; and, in fact, how it would work in States such as Maine \nwhere you already have a very high percentage of renewable energy \nrequired, 30 times the amount that is required in my own State of \nArizona. Yet there would not be any credit for the sale of that to \nother States, notwithstanding their high production from renewable \nenergy.\n  To cite an analogy, one of my staff members said he didn't quite \nunderstand why this was such a great idea. I tried to explain it to \nhim. He said: I still don't understand. Grapefruit is really good for \nyou, but I don't quite understand. Should the Federal Government then \npass a law that mandates 10 percent of all the fruit sold in the \ncountry be grapefruit?\n  He said: That might help my State of Arizona because we grow a lot of \ngrapefruit. I guess we could set up a trading deal where people in New \nYork would have to buy a credit since they couldn't actually produce \ngrapefruit. Since it is so good for you, if I am in a preferred \nposition politically, I might have the clout to pass a law that says \nthat 10 percent of the fruit has to be grapefruit. That might be a good \nidea.\n  I really don't think that it is any business of the Federal \nGovernment to impose that on the American people. Let the free market \nwork. Let's get back to deregulation. That is what this whole electric \nsection of the energy bill was supposed to be about in the first \ninstance: To deregulate, to reduce cost; not to reregulate and increase \ncosts; to provide more local control of the situation, not more Federal \ncontrol.\n  This underlying Bingaman amendment goes exactly in the wrong \ndirection, which is why Senator Miller and I have proposed an amendment \nto require the States to look at this but not require them to impose \nany particular percentage mandate. Let's let each State decide what is \nbest for their local retail electrical customers. If after a period of \nyears that we carry these significant tax credits, where we are \npromoting renewables, we still haven't gotten to the point where \npeople think we need to be, we can take another look at this.\n\n  My guess is we are going to continue to march on to produce as much \nof this energy as we can in an economic and feasible way, and the \npercentage is going to increase over time. And we can at that time \ndetermine whether we want to replace some of the existing generation \nwith this kind of new generation.\n  Now is not the time to be imposing this kind of requirement on the \ncountry with its additional costs, with its discrimination, and with so \nmany questions that could have been answered, had we done this in \ncommittee, that obviously have not been answered.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment. Let's lay this \nBingaman amendment aside, see how things work for a while before we try \nto regulate the market with a brandnew, very costly and discriminatory \nFederal mandate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for \na question.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I didn't hear all the debate. Do I understand that \nthere is nothing in the Bingaman-Daschle bill that would prohibit a \nscenario that would suggest that maybe the Three Gorges dam, which is \nin the process of being completed and would classify perhaps as an \nincremental renewable, could theoretically sell credits to U.S. firms \nthat would need credit in order to comply with a 10-percent mandate by \nthe year 2020; so this is not limited to just encouraging U.S. \nconstruction and development of new renewables that would give them \ncredit?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I asked the question of the staff people, who \nhave read and reread and reread the underlying bill and the Bingaman \namendment, if there was any limitation on from where the credits came. \nAnd they told me they could find none. There is no State limitation, no \nborder between the United States and Canada, or other border, so that \nindeed you could end up with a worldwide credit system, not just one as \namong the different States of the United States.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And a follow-up to that: As an example, I have been \nover to the Yangtze River. I have seen the construction of the Three \nGorges dam. It is truly one of the largest construction projects in the \nhistory of the world, much like the projects that occurred on the \nColumbia River in the 1930s where we attempted to reduce flooding and \ncombat the tremendous source of energy.\n  But my question is, With the potential credits available to them \nbecause of the size of that project, wouldn't it be attractive to \nacquire these credits at a relatively inexpensive price rather than \nputting in renewables that would be mandated by the amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. I say to the Senator, I think he is on to something here. \nThat is really a third reason why there would be a disincentive to \nproduce new renewables here in the United States. The Senator is quite \nright. There would be an incentive to acquire those credits from abroad \nbecause you could undoubtedly do it much cheaper because there would be \nso much hydroenergy produced out of this dam.\n  Of course, Senator Bingaman can answer this question, but under his \namendment, if we were--obviously, we will not be able to do this--able \nto build a dam here in the United States, you would not be able to get \nany renewable credit from that. The only way you get any credit from \nhydro would be if you went back in and made the generator more \nefficient. Then all you would get is that incremental improvement in \noutput in terms of renewable credit.\n\n  As I understand it, the Three Gorges dam is essentially constructed, \nbut the generation equipment has not yet been embedded in it. \nTherefore, if that is the situation when the bill becomes effective, \nthat would qualify as incremental electrical generation above and \nbeyond what the dam produced on the effective date of the act.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is something I think we should bring out in the \ndebate, and perhaps we can get enlightenment. Clearly, I am sure that \nis not what it was designed to do. The obvious objective was to try to \nencourage renewables being built and not to acquire credits that might \nbe relatively inexpensive.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I rise to make a \ncouple of comments in response to the presentation by the Senator from \nArizona. He has clearly thought through this and done a fair amount of \nhomework. He brought some charts with him and gave some examples of why \nhe thinks this is bad legislation.\n  I think he makes a terrible mistake by suggesting that this is not \nnational in scope. The implication of the proposal by the Senator from \nArizona is to say: If it is to be done, let's let the States do it. \nThis is not something that ought to be a matter of national policy.\n  Let me make a couple of comments about that. We would have had the \nsame kind of discussion over 20 years ago when we first discussed the \nClean Air Act in Congress. People said: Let's leave it to the States. \nThis isn't something we ought to do nationally. This is not a national \nresponsibility or a national goal. Let the States do it.\n  We didn't do that. We said: As a matter of national purpose, this \ncountry deserves clean air. We passed clean air standards. Why? Because \nthe Congress demanded it and said: This is a matter of national \npurpose and a matter of developing national standards, and national \naspirations for our country.\n\n  On the issue of energy, the question is: Are we going to write a \nnational energy bill and have an energy policy that turns the corner \nand moves us in a different direction in certain areas--Yes or no? It \nis not a question of can we do it. We can. The question proposed by the \nSenator from Arizona is, Should we do it? He says no.\n  Now, can we do it? Let me show you this chart. This is from the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. This chart \nshows the biomass resources in this country. The dark shades of green \nrepresent the potential kilowatts per county in America. Solar, \ngeothermal,\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nand wind resources: all of these represent real potential to extend \nAmerica's energy supply with renewable energy.\n  Now, it is perfectly reasonable for someone to say, I don't think we \nought to do it. I don't think it is a matter of national policy. It is \na perfectly reasonable position--wrong, but reasonable.\n  If we are going to address energy policy in the Senate, then we have \nto begin describing a new policy, and we have to begin describing it as \na sense of national purpose.\n  I recall a story about Mark Twain being asked to debate. He said he \nwould be happy to debate as long as he could be on the negative side. \nThey said: You don't even know the subject yet. He said: The negative \nside requires no preparation.\n  The affirmative proposal that is offered by Senator Bingaman is to \ndevelop a renewable portfolio standard. That is an affirmative \nproposal. Why? Because it will advance the interests of this country, \nextend America's energy supply, reduce our reliance on foreign energy, \nand improve America's security.\n  What are the consequences of doing nothing? My colleague mentions the \nfree market. The free market has allowed us to import 57 percent of our \noil supply from overseas, largely from Saudi Arabia. Is that the free \nmarket that helps this country? I don't think so. I think it makes our \ncountry and our economy more dependent on an oil supply that comes from \none of the most unsettled areas in the world.\n  What if, God forbid, tomorrow morning a terrorist should shut off \nthat supply of oil from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the United States? \nOur economy would be flat on its back. If we wake up tomorrow morning \nat 6:30 and turn on the morning news and discover that, God forbid, \nsomebody has interrupted this flow of energy from the Middle East, our \ncountry's economy is going to be flat on its back. We all know that \nthis puts America's economy in jeopardy. That is why, as we develop a \nnew energy policy, it is incumbent upon us to look at these new \napproaches.\n  The renewable portfolio standard can be controversial, yes, I \nunderstand that. Every new idea is controversial. But it is essential \nto pull this new policy along and to say that it is good for our \ncountry, good for our economy, and good for American security. That is \nour requirement in the Senate.\n  Now, my colleague from Arizona said that the State of North Dakota \ndoesn't have a renewable portfolio standard. That is true. It should. I \nam not in the State legislature. If I were, I would propose it. But \nNorth Dakota doesn't have an RPS. That is precisely why we need a \nnational policy. Some might have an RPS at the State level; some states \nmight not. Some might care about it; some might not. Some might think \nit would be fine to go from a 57- to a 70-percent reliance on \nforeign oil. Some might think that is fine because the cheapest oil in \nthe world comes from the Persian Gulf. But it is not fine. We all \nunderstand that. It puts our economy in jeopardy. It imposes on our \nnational security in a very significant way.\n\n  So the question is not, Do we understand these things? The question \nis, Are we as a Congress going to do something about it? Are we really \ngoing to decide there are certain national energy goals and aspirations \nthat we have as a country?\n  Let me end as I began. We have had this debate before. We had this \ndebate on clean air and clean water standards over two decades ago. We \nhad people who didn't want those standards. ``Don't you dare impose \nthese burdens on State and local governments,'' they said. Good for \nthose policymakers. Good for them for having the courage to say, let's \ndo this as a country, let's make progress in addressing this national \nissue.\n  That is exactly what the Bingaman renewable portfolio proposal in \nthis energy bill is designed to accomplish. It says, let's address this \nissue, let's aspire to higher goals, let's understand that energy comes \nnot just in a pipe or by digging it out of the ground. It comes from \nthe sun, wind, biomass, and geothermal resources. There isn't any \nreason that this country ought not aspire to do more in these areas. \nThat is what this standard is about.\n  As I said, it is easy to take the opposing side. It is more difficult \nto assume the responsibility to be on the affirmative side. But the \naffirmative side here is saying, let's do this as a country. That is \nthe right side.\n  I hope when the Senate finishes this debate, it will say, yes, this \nis the right thing to do--not State by State, but as a nation. This is \nwhat we aspire to do as a nation, to extend our energy supply, to make \nus less dependent upon Middle East oil, and to use limitless and \nrenewable sources of energy to help strengthen our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if my good friend will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that. We have had a long relationship on \nenergy matters. I look with interest at the chart the Senator has \ndisplayed. The one thing that strikes me is the areas. Obviously, the \nareas that can generate solar relatively efficiently is the South and \nSouthwest, as indicated by my colleague, with the red concentrated \narea, including Arizona and New Mexico. To some extent, that leaves the \nrest of the country without the same potential advantage.\n  I find it rather curious, in looking across from the solar down to \ngeothermal, most of that is on the west coast, in California. There is \nnot much on the east coast. The wind, on the far right of the chart, \nsuggests that the northern areas along the Canadian border, and other \nareas, have a predominance of wind. Of course, the green is the \nbiomass.\n  If we address the combination of circumstances on how we resolve our \nenergy crisis and address renewables, there seems to be a tradeoff, \nbecause I am sure the Senator from North Dakota would agree that the \nbiomass concepts suggest burning carbon, and we can address that \nthrough technology. Nuclear, of course, would not show any significant \nemissions.\n  The problem I have is that portions of this bill do not really get us \nthere from here. For example, in this bill, we are prohibited from \nusing any timber products from public land sales, with the exception of \npreconditioned thinning. So I can refer to the language specifically. \nIt says:\n       With respect to material removed from national forest \n     systems land, the term biomass means fuel and biomass \n     accumulated from preconditioned, thinning slash and brush.\n\n  So I take that to mean there would be a very narrow use of any of the \nproducts from public lands. In my State, we are all public lands, so we \ncould not develop biomass because we can't use the slash, the bark, any \nof the remains for biomass. I think that is an effort in this \nlegislation. I ask if my colleague agrees with me or not, where clearly \nwe have an oversight, because that doesn't allow some States that \nreally have no private or State timber to utilize the waste for biomass \nproduction. Is that not kind of an inconsistency?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My colleague from New Mexico will speak next and will \ndescribe some of the policies with respect to public lands.\n  I say this to the Senator from Alaska. If you take a look at this \nchart--the import of this chart--it shows a fairly balanced \nrepresentation across the country, to be able to achieve limitless, \nrenewable sources of energy that we don't really aspire to harness \nthese days. We are trying to see if we can pull the country along with \na national standard to actually harness energy from these renewable \nresources.\n  I understand there are some concerns about certain areas of the \nportfolio standard, and we can have some discussion about those \nconcerns. But I do believe that the principle here to aspire to have \nthe country using more renewable energy.\n  The Senator from Arizona, I think, toward the end of his \npresentation, described his real objection. It is not with some \nproblems over resources on public lands.\n  His problem is he believes that we ought not to mandate anything and \nthat the free market ought to help increase our use of renewables. That \nis the underlying objection.\n  I do not know whether the import of the question of the Senator from \nAlaska is----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In my State of Alaska, for example, I am precluded by\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\nthis language, and I am going to have to go out----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me finish my thought. I have the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am going to have to go out and buy credits which is \nnot----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My point was this: If the Senator from Alaska is saying \nhe has some concerns about timber, but he believes there ought to be a \nrenewable portfolio standard, that is one thing. My point is the author \nat the end of his presentation said: I do not think we ought to impose \na mandate on the States. This should be left to the States, No. 1, so \nit is not a national policy to embrace. Second, let's let the free \nmarket handle this.\n  My response to that is, the free market has gotten us to the point \nwhere over 50 percent of our oil is imported, mostly from Saudi Arabia. \nIf you think it strengthens national security, good for you. I am not \nsaying you believe that. No one believes we are in the position of \nincreasing our national security by increasing the amount of oil that \ncomes from the most unstable part of the world.\n  That is the point and the reason we need a renewable portfolio \nstandard.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assume the Senator from North Dakota is aware that \nsome of the predominant wind areas are in my State of Alaska in the \nhigh Arctic. I suggest there is little enthusiasm for putting up \nwindmills associated with the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where \nthere is lots of wind. We have inconsistencies in this. We expended $7 \nbillion in renewables, and now we are talking about a mandate that is \ngoing to cost the consumers of this country a considerable amount of \nmoney. The problem I have with the bill is we have not had this kind of \nconversation, as the Senator knows, in the committee process. We are \ndoing this on the floor, and that is difficult.\n\n  The problem I have with this particular application of the chart is \nthe inequity associated with what is good for the Southwest does not \nnecessarily address what is good for the east coast or the South.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are advised that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a final point that I think is \nimportant. The mandate here is going to strengthen this country's \nnational security and energy security. We can decide to do nothing. We \ncan decide, as my colleague from Arizona has, that we ought to \nessentially ignore this and let State-by-State judgments be made. We \ncan decide that whatever the free market determines is our future. But \nthat, in my judgment, does not resolve the need for a national energy \npolicy that stretches this country and moves it in a different \ndirection--one that I believe will strengthen national security by \nreducing our reliance on foreign oil.\n  Does anybody in the Senate want to stand at their desk in the Senate \nand say: We really think it is good for the country, we really believe \nit strengthens America's national security to have 57 percent of our \noil coming from the Middle East or from foreign sources? Is anyone \nmissing what is happening in the Middle East these days? Does anybody \nbelieve it does not injure our national security to be so dependent on \nthat source of oil?\n  If you believe--and I think almost everyone in this Chamber does \nbelieve--it actually hurts our national security to be that dependent, \nthen we ought to strive as a nation to find ways to change that. I am \nnot talking about Arizona, Alaska, North Dakota, or New Jersey by \nthemselves. The Nation ought to strive to back away from that \ndependency.\n  If my colleagues believe that, the question is, What is the menu of \nchanges that allows us to reduce our dependence on foreign oil?\n  One answer is the Bingaman proposal in the energy bill that aspires \nto have a renewable portfolio standard of 10 percent; 10 percent coming \nfrom renewable, limitless sources of energy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware, I am sure, that out of all the \npetroleum reserves in the world, the United States has 3 percent, and \nthe rest of the world has 97 percent. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is it pretty fair to state it is very difficult for us to \nproduce our way out of the problem we have with petroleum products?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague from Nevada, that is the case. We \ncannot produce our way out of this problem. We certainly can produce. \nWe had a vote in the Senate about production in the Gulf of Mexico. I \nsupported that. I also support incentives to increase production of oil \nand natural gas.\n\n  Yes, I do think we have to increase production and do it in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. We have to do a lot of other things and \ndo them well as a matter of national policy. That is the point of \nhaving an energy policy debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  If, in fact, the result of an energy policy debate is to say let the \nStates do whatever they want to do, that is a kind of yesterday-forever \nstrategy. Members of the Senate will, 25 years from now, be having the \nsame debate. The suits will have changed, the names will have changed, \nand the people occupying the desks in the Senate will have changed, but \nnothing else will have changed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator can explain to me how any of \nthe examples he has given on that chart will significantly reduce our \nimports of oil from foreign nations? He is talking about the generation \nof electricity from these sources, but we do not move out of \nWashington, DC, on hot air. It takes oil. There is no oil associated \nwith those particular examples.\n  We have to be careful in our definition of energy. There are many \nkinds of energy. The Senator is absolutely right, those are important \nalternatives. But to suggest somehow this is directly related to \nreducing our dependence on imported oil, I think the Senator would \nagree with me there is very little coalition there because we are \ntalking about two different things.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say, I do not agree with him, but I will be happy \nto yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator from North Dakota acknowledge one \nreason why we are interchanging these various issues of wind power, \nsolar power, and oil is because the Senator from Alaska has been using \ncharts for the last 2 weeks that try to equate the two and try to make \nthe point that we have to keep drilling more and more of Alaska in \norder to avoid using wind power?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Not just the Senator from Alaska, but the Senator from \nArizona, in the points he made toward the end of his presentation, \nspecifically talked about the size of the devices to gather solar \nenergy that would be required to offset X amount of oil. I believe it \nwas 2,000 acres, something the size of Dulles Airport.\n  He said: Here is the amount of wind energy; here are the number of \nwind turbines it would take to offset a certain amount of oil.\n  The point is, when we talk about a renewable source of energy, we are \ntalking about electricity. That is the case. How do you generate \nelectricity? You generate it through electric generating plants. We can \nput coal in them, use natural gas--there are a number of ways to \ngenerate electricity.\n  Our colleague, for example, from Utah, now drives this hybrid car I \nsaw parked in front of the Capitol yesterday. His car uses less \npetroleum, because it runs, in part, on battery-powered electricity.\n  Renewable and limitless sources of energy will help us reduce our \nsupply of imported oil. I am not suggesting, and I would not suggest, \nthat doing all we can on renewables takes us far down the road in \nrelieving us from the substantial amount of oil we now receive from \nabroad. I am not suggesting that at all.\n  I do believe, especially in the area of production of electricity, we \nhave opportunities to do things in a different way. The question in the \nSenate is, Do you want to do that or don't you?\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\nSome say, no. The same attitude prevailed, as I mentioned, on the clean \nair and clean water debates about 20 years ago with respect to this \nenergy debate.\n  My hope is that at the end of the day on the Kyl amendment we will \nvote no and say we really do want to be involved in a different way \nwith respect to production of electricity.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Just a few miles out of Las Vegas--I explained this to the \nSenator, and I want to see if he remembers this--we are going to build \na wind site at the Nevada Test Site. We have permission from DOE to do \nthat. Within 2\\1/2\\ years, that will be producing 260 megawatts of \nelectricity, enough to satisfy the needs of 260,000 people in Las \nVegas.\n  Will the Senator agree that is a pretty good step in the direction \nfor wind energy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. A leading question, but of course I agree. Take a quarter \nof an acre of land, put on it a 1-megawatt, new, very efficient wind \nturbine, and produce electricity that is used to power 1,000 homes. \nPretty good deal? I think so. With 160 acres of land, especially with \nthe new turbines, you can produce electricity for nearly 160,000 homes \nin this country.\n  My point is, this is the right thing to do. Let's do it as a matter \nof national policy. Let's establish a national renewable portfolio \nstandard.\n  Let me finally say, as I conclude, I understand it is controversial. \nI understand why some people do not want to do it. In fact, there are \nsome people who have never wanted to do anything for the first time. I \nunderstand that, too. But if we are talking about national energy \npolicy, and we end the day in the Senate having done nothing that is \nnew, then we have only postponed for another 25 years a debate that is \nidentical to the one we are having today, and we will find ourselves in \nexactly the same situation. Let's hope between now and then we do not \nencounter some dramatic circumstance that really shuts off the supply \nof energy that is critical to our country.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator's predecessor, Quentin Burdick, I remember once \nwhen he came back from North Dakota in February. I read in the papers \nand saw on the news there was a terrible storm in North Dakota. I said \nto him: That must have been a bad weekend, Senator Burdick.\n  He said: Bad weekend? It was a good weekend. I love that weather. The \nwind blows there all the time, and we like the wind.\n  I say that to remind the Senator from North Dakota, as he said \nearlier today, the Saudi Arabia of wind is North Dakota. I can see that \nfrom the map. I never realized, even though Senator Burdick told me the \nwind blew there all the time, he was really right.\n  I have said in this Chamber, if one looks at geothermal resources, \nthe Saudi Arabia of geothermal is Nevada. So I would hope Nevada--we \nhave a lot of wind. We do not nearly match what happens in North \nDakota, but it is not bad. I hope when we complete this legislation \nthere are some goals set whereby the potential of Nevada with \ngeothermal and the potential of North Dakota with wind can be realized.\n  Is that what the Senator is saying, simply that we should set some \nmarks and guidelines and try to reach them?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. We have the potential to do \nthings in a different way, and we ought to use that potential. Now we \ncan decide to ignore it, as my colleague from Arizona would have us do, \nor we can decide to embrace it, believing it will strengthen this \ncountry and move us toward greater energy security.\n  I believe it makes sense to take the natural, renewable resources \nthat exist and produce energy from them. I do not want the Senator from \nNevada to leave this Chamber somehow describing to others that North \nDakota has bad weather. That certainly should not be a conclusion that \nis left. North Dakota is a wonderful State. It has perhaps more \nsunshine than the State of Nevada. We have a little bit of a breeze, \nand it is fairly constant. That is why it ranks well in wind energy. It \nis a great State, with a great temperature, and a great climate, and \nthe Senator from Nevada should visit it more often.\n  The point is, we also have the opportunity to, from that general \nbreeze I have described, capture the energy and use it to extend \nAmerica's energy supply, just as is done with geothermal in the \nSouthwest, biomass in the East, and solar resources in much of the \ncountry, especially the Southwest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think the expectation was I would \nspeak at this point in response. I know Senator Jeffords from Vermont \nhas been waiting to speak, and I will allow him to go ahead at this \npoint. Then Senator Voinovich will follow Senator Jeffords, and then I \nwill respond after Senator Voinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I listen to this debate and at times it \ngets discouraging because I was around 27 years ago when the cars were \nlined up trying to get gasoline and the people of this country were \nabsolutely ballistic about the fact that we were hostage to the oil \nsuppliers in the Middle East.\n  We did some authorization in the hopes we would build an energy \nsupply and this Nation would make it so that those kinds of situations \nwould never occur again. Here we are, with the recognition of the \nvolatility in the Middle East, again ignoring the possibility of moving \nforward to ensure we do not become subject to that kind of control by \nthe Middle East.\n  So I oppose very strongly the practical effect of Senator Kyl's \namendment. The practical effect will be to remove all renewable energy \nproduction from this bill. It would strike the modest 10 percent \nprovision in the underlying Daschle bill and leave us with effectively \nnothing. It would strike the 10 percent renewable energy standard, even \nthough most recent studies by the Department of Energy estimate that a \n10 percent national renewable energy standard would cause consumer \nenergy prices to decline by almost $3 billion by the year 2020. It is \nhard to understand why we would not want to encourage clean energy, \nenergy which causes our consumer costs to go down.\n  The amendment before us, however, says no to clean energy, no to \nreducing carbon dioxide, no to reducing smog and acid rain, and no to \nassisting our American companies to expand domestically and to compete \nin the thriving international market.\n  I cannot support this amendment. It simply is not an option for me to \ngo home to my State of Vermont and tell them I have done nothing to try \nto slow the flow of emissions from fossil fuel powerplants into \nVermont's air and water. Remember, this is an air pollution problem as \nwell.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is not \nan option for me to ignore the fact that electricity production is the \nleading source of carbon dioxide emissions in this country, accounting \nfor over 40 percent of that total. I cannot be blind to the fact that \nthe powerplants contribute significantly to emissions of sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury. These pollutants greatly increase \nasthma, lung cancer, and other health risks, and contaminate our air \nand our water. We must enhance production of clean, domestically \nproduced, renewable energy in this country, and we can.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Arizona would reject all \nFederal renewable energy standards and instead require utilities to \noffer consumers energy from renewable resources. It would also allow \nStates to continue to establish State standards for renewable energy.\n  States already are establishing State renewable energy standards, and \nutilities are already offering consumers green energy. Federal \nlegislation along that line is already happening. It is not necessary. \nEven if such legislation were needed, it would not be enough. We would \nstill have a national renewable energy shortage. We would have no \nstandard.\n  A nationwide standard would address the reality that electricity is \ngenerated on a regional basis. Many State standards require that \nrenewable energy credits come from energy generated from within State \nboundaries. A national renewable standard would enable\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\nutilities to meet requirements by purchasing and selling renewable \nenergy outside of the State boundaries. A national renewable standard \nwould therefore guarantee broad, long-term, and cross-regional \nrenewable power generation.\n  To date, only 12 States have established State renewable energy \nmandates, although others are actively considering them. A national \nstandard would increase renewable energy production, thereby expanding \nenvironmental and health benefits and facilitating greater market entry \nof renewables into the energy sector.\n  As is indicated by this chart, public opinion polls constantly show \nthat an overwhelming majority of voters nationwide favor requiring \npower companies to generate electricity from alternative energy \nsources. A 2002 survey conducted by the Mellman Group found that 70 \npercent of those surveyed favor requiring power companies to generate \n20 percent--that was my amendment awhile back, which received a pretty \ngood vote--from renewable sources, even if it would raise their monthly \nelectricity bills by $2 or more.\n  Polls conducted by Texas utilities show consumers are willing to pay \nas much as $5 per month to receive energy from renewable sources. This \nis almost five times as much as the Department of Energy has found that \nthe national renewable energy standard of 20 percent would cost \nconsumers.\n  Without a strong provision to expand the use of renewable fuels, I \nhave to question why we are here at all. If all we are doing is \ncontinuing business as usual, we might as well finish up and go home. \nWe do not need massive new legislation simply to preserve the status \nquo. Before we do that, however, I think we need to remember that \nrenewables will not only help clean our environment and provide \ncountless new high-tech jobs, they will also diversify our energy \nuse. In our current security conscious environment, that is worth \ndoing.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed a letter \nwritten to myself and other Members by several former national security \nexperts regarding a contribution of renewable portfolio standards to \nour national energy security.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               September 19, 2001.\n     Senators Thomas A. Daschle, Tom Harkin, Robert C. Byrd, Carl \n       Levin, Jeff Bingaman, James M. Jeffords, Max Baucus, Joseph \n       R. Biden, Jr., Trent Lott, Richard Lugar, Ted Stevens, John \n       W. Warner, Frank H. Murkowski, Robert C. Smith, Charles E. \n       Grassley, Jesse Helms.\n       Dear Senators: Americans are aware of the enormous and \n     complicated tasks ahead in dealing with the consequences of \n     the unprecedented September 11th attack against our Nation.\n       There are many corrective actions that require lead-times \n     that could be months or even years. But, there are actions \n     that can and must be taken now. One of those critical actions \n     is to advance America's energy security. The Congress will \n     soon act on that issue.\n       It is not enough just to ensure uninterruptible supplies of \n     transportation fuels and electricity. We must also act to \n     advance the security of those supplies, and the nation's \n     ability to meet its needs in all corners of the country at \n     all times. Our refineries, pipelines and electrical grid are \n     highly vulnerable to conventional military, nuclear and \n     terrorist attacks.\n       Disbursed, renewable and domestic supplies of fuels and \n     electricity, such as energy produced naturally from wind, \n     solar, geothermal, incremental hydro, and agricultural \n     biomass, address those challenges. Fortunately, technologies \n     to deliver these supplies have been advancing steadily since \n     the Middle East fired its first warning shot over our bow in \n     1973. They are now ready to be bought, full force, into \n     service.\n       But, while the U.S. Government has committed intellectual \n     and monetary resources to developing these technologies, the \n     status quo marketplace is unwilling to accommodate these new \n     supplies of disbursed and renewable fuels and electricity. \n     Speedy action by the Administration and the Congress is \n     critical to establish the regulatory and tax conditions for \n     these renewable resources to rapidly reach their potential.\n       Fortunately, such actions are under consideration by the \n     Energy, Environment, and Finance Committees. We urge the \n     Energy Committee to immediately adopt the Renewable Portfolio \n     Standard (for electricity) as well as provisions to ensure \n     ready interconnection access to the electric grid, and cost-\n     shared funds to the state public benefit funds to continue \n     essential support for emerging technologies and the provision \n     of electricity to the truly needy. We urge the Environment \n     Committee to immediately adopt the Renewable Fuels Standards \n     in conjunction with measures to deal with environmental \n     issues. Finally, we urge the Finance Committee to immediately \n     adopt residential solar credits and renewable energy \n     production tax credits, including a provision for fuels \n     (liquid, gaseous and solid fuels), or their Btu equivalent, \n     similar to the fuel provision tax credit made available in \n     Section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       These actions will also develop new industries and jobs, \n     strengthen communities, enhance the environment, and assist \n     in the stabilization of greenhouse gases. On the \n     transportation fuels issue, ethanol, biodiesel and other \n     biofuels will slow the flow of dollars to the Middle East, \n     where too many of those dollars have been used to buy weapons \n     and fund terrorist activities.\n       Consequently, we also recommend a major and concerted \n     effort to assemble the talent and resources needed to launch \n     a ``Liberty Ship'' type program to convert agricultural \n     wastes and cellulosic biomass into biofuels, biochemicals and \n     bioelectricity. The technology to do so is in place; all that \n     is lacking is the political will to deploy it.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     R. James Woolsey,\n       Former Director, Central Intelligence.\n     Robert C. McFarlane,\n       Former National Security Advisor to President Reagan.\n     Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN (Ret),\n       Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. On September 19, shortly after the attacks on the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon, James Woolsey, former Director of the \nCIA, ADM Thomas H. Moorer, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and Robert C. McFarlane, former National Security Adviser to \nPresident Reagan, sent a letter urging in the strongest possible terms \nthat we must take immediate action to address our energy security.\n  One portion of the letter reads:\n\n       Americans are aware of the enormous and complicated task \n     ahead in dealing with the consequences of the unprecedented \n     September 11 attack against our nation. . . . There are \n     actions that can and must be taken now. One of these critical \n     issues is to advance America's energy security. . . . We urge \n     the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to immediately \n     adopt the renewable portfolio standard.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join with me in heeding this \nadvice from the great leaders of our Nation who know best why we should \ndo this. I strongly disagree with the amendment offered by Senator Kyl.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl. I ask unanimous consent I be made a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to encourage the use of renewable \nelectricity generation. I agree that renewable energy is an important \npart of the future and should be developed. I also strongly believe \nrenewable energy sources are vital as this country seeks to diversify \nenergy supplies and decrease our dependence on foreign sources to meet \nour energy needs.\n  However, I cannot support the renewable portfolio standard included \nin the underlying amendment because it mandates unrealistic levels of \nrenewable usage in a short period of time at the virtual expense of all \nother sources of electricity generation. Instead, I believe the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona is a reasonable approach to \nmaking renewable energy a greater piece of our overall energy mix. One \npoint that seems to get lost in the debate over the use of renewables \nis America relies very little on renewable sources of energy right now \nand will for the foreseeable future.\n  This chart shows a breakdown of how our electricity is generated \ntoday. Coal contributes 52 percent; nuclear energy is 20 percent; \nnatural gas is 16 percent. For all electricity generation by renewables \nnationwide, and that includes geothermal, hydro, biomass, as well as \nwind and solar, the total generation is only 9 percent. When that is \nbroken down, hydro is 7.3 percent of the renewables; biomass, wood, \nwaste, and others is 1.1 percent; geothermal is .4 percent; and wind \nand solar is .2 percent.\n  This last number is important, since a number of my colleagues have \nput\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nquite a bit of faith in solar and wind power. However, the American \nconsumer does not appear to share that enthusiasm which is evidenced by \nthe fact that wind and solar combined make up only .2 percent of our \ncurrent electricity generation. Another startling but little known fact \nis, if you do not include existing hydropower as renewable, which the \nunderlying amendment does not, again, renewables are only 1.7 percent \nof our electricity generation.\n  Although the amendment includes incremental hydropower prospectively, \nit still will make up a very small portion of the electricity \ngeneration in our country.\n  Now, when you factor what the Department of Energy believes our \nelectricity usage will be over the next 20 years, you see that the use \nof coal will continue to rise, natural gas will rise dramatically, \nnuclear fuel remains fairly level and hydropower remains steady. At the \nbottom is petroleum, and just above that, non-hydro renewables increase \nslightly. These projections show, renewables will make up a very small \nportion of the production of energy in this country for the next 15 to \n20 years.\n  However, the underlying amendment says, regardless of market forces, \nAmerica is going to dramatically increase its use of renewables. In \nfact, the underlying amendment stipulates we must develop a mandatory \nminimum standard for renewable energy of 10 percent for our electricity \ngeneration by the year 2020. The only way I can see that we can \naccomplish this mandate, if it is implemented, is for energy-producing \ncompanies to take a dramatic turn toward using renewables. That means \nthey have to cut back on clean coal technology, put the brakes on \nnatural gas, which is the current energy source of choice in America, \nand restrict the further development and use of nuclear power. This \nwill have a particularly dramatic impact on energy producers in regions \nof our country that do not currently rely on a tremendous amount of \nrenewable resources.\n  For example, in my home State of Ohio, our use of renewable energy is \nmuch lower than the national average. Renewables, including hydropower, \ngenerate 1 percent. Remove hydro from this number and the State of Ohio \ngenerates less than .4 percent of its electricity from renewable \nsources. This is predominantly biomass power which comes mostly from \nwood-burning boilers in woodworking and paper manufacturing industries.\n  However, there are many other States which rely on renewable sources \nfor electricity generation. According to 1998 data from the Energy \nInformation Administration, at least 10 percent of the electricity \ngenerated in 16 States comes from renewable power sources. Of these 16 \nStates, 5 States receive more than 50 percent of their electricity from \nrenewable sources, and the primary source is hydroelectric power. Four \nof the five States--Idaho, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington--rely on \nhydroelectric power for more than 60 percent of their electricity.\n  Maine is the only State east of the Mississippi to rely on more than \n50 percent of electricity generation from renewables, 30 percent coming \nfrom hydro and 30 percent coming from other renewable fuels. Regions, \nand even individual States, that currently have a high percentage of \nrenewable energy sources would be less impacted by the requirements of \nthe underlying provisions. However, forcing a mandatory minimum will \nunduly burden States such as Ohio.\n  I don't want my colleagues to misunderstand me. I do believe we need \nto continue to invest in renewable forms of energy. They are \nenvironmentally friendly and contribute to meeting the requirement of \nnational energy self-reliance, and as the technology gets better, have \nthe potential to become inexpensive.\n  Right now, electricity from renewable energy sources is very \nexpensive. However, we need to realize that the current research and \ndevelopment costs make a practical national application of a mandatory \nminimum renewable standard very difficult. Renewables simply do not \nhave the capacity to meet our needs in the timeframe established in the \nunderlying amendment. Their growth will come, however, and we should \nsupport research funding that will get us to the point where renewables \nare a viable energy option.\n\n  In fact, over the past 5 years, Congress has provided more than $7 \nbillion in tax incentives and other programs to assist renewables. \nRecently, we extended a renewable energy tax credit for $1 billion, and \nthe Finance Committee has reported legislation that provides an \nadditional $3 billion.\n  However, I believe it is not prudent for the Senate to mandate a \nrenewable standard. The amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona, \non the other hand, lets the free market decide.\n  If the demand for energy derived from renewable sources exists, then \nI have no doubt that energy suppliers will respond to their customers \nand satisfy the demand, just as they are doing in Cleveland, OH.\n  Last year, the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council made an agreement \nwith Green Mountain Energy Company in Texas to supply customers in \neight northeast Ohio counties with electricity. Green Mountain Energy \nCompany uses a blend of sources including wind, water, and solar \nenergy. Customers in these counties were able to make the decision \nthemselves if they wanted to purchase the power instead of being \nmandated to purchase green power.\n  Having spent 10 years as Mayor of Cleveland, and as mayor I ran a \nmunicipally-owned utility, and 8 years as Governor, I have developed \nsome very strong beliefs regarding federalism and the role of our \nvarious levels of government.\n  The Kyl amendment lets the States decide whether a mandatory \nrenewables program is something they would want to implement for their \nresidents. Right now, 14 States have already implemented mandatory RPS \nprograms. This is consistent with the policy of the National Governors' \nAssociation, which states that any Federal legislation should:\n\n       . . . allow a State to decide what mix of renewable \n     technologies should be included in any renewable portfolio \n     package implemented in a State.\n\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico does eliminate \nthe original language which would require that larger municipally owned \nutilities meet the RPS standard, but it still does not address the fact \nthat this mandate will ultimately be paid for by ratepayers. In \nCleveland, and in many of our cities and communities nationwide, a lot \nof these ratepayers are poor and a lot of them are elderly and it would \nbe hard for them to afford the cost of this standard.\n  If you look at this chart, the people who seem to be left out are the \nratepayers. They seem to be left out so often from debates we have here \non the floor of the Senate. These are the least of our brethren, the \nones who were the most affected a year ago when the demand for natural \ngas in this country went way up and their utility bills skyrocketed.\n  If you look at people with annual income under $10,000, you see that \nalmost 30 percent of their income goes for energy costs. If you are in \nan income bracket between $10,000 and $24,000, you spend 13 percent on \nenergy costs; and of course if you make over $50,000, only 4 percent of \nyour income is spent on energy. There are a lot of people in this \ncountry who can afford that. But I have to tell you, there are a lot of \npeople in this country who cannot afford it.\n  Last winter, in the midst of the heating cost increase, I held a \nmeeting in Cleveland with Catholic Charities, Lutheran Housing and the \nSalvation Army and heard first-hand the effects of the high energy \ncosts were having on the people who could least afford it. Many of them \nwere just hanging on trying to stay in their own homes.\n\n  I am concerned about them and I think that the Senate should be \nconcerned about them as well.\n  I honestly believe if the decision to implement a Renewable Portfolio \nStandard is left to the discretion of the Governors in the States, many \nof them will go forward with it. Some states will not go as fast as \nother ones, but overall we will probably achieve the goal of the \nsponsors of the Bingaman amendment, but do it without mandating it \nthroughout the country in each and every State.\n  Renewables and conservation need to be a bigger part of our energy \npolicy--\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nI agree with that. But we have to be realistic about our challenge. \nThese two strategies do not have the capacity to meet our growing \nenergy needs in the timeframe mandated in the underlying amendment.\n  I have to say, anyone who says renewables are going to take care of \nthe energy needs of this country by the year 2020 just is not being \nintellectually honest in terms of what renewables can do.\n  We are going to need more coal, we are going to need more nuclear \npower, we are going to need more natural gas, we are going to need more \nhydropower and other renewables, we are going to need more \nconservation. We are going to need it all.\n  I think the Senator from Arizona is on the right track with his \namendment and I urge my colleagues to support his amendment. It \nencourages the use of renewable power without mandating it and meets \nour energy, environmental and economic needs in a responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nfollow Senator Cantwell, since we are both in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have heard the discussion by the two \nsponsors of the amendment, Senator Kyl and Senator Miller, and, of \ncourse, now Senator Voinovich and my colleague, Senator Murkowski, who \nis the ranking member of the Energy Committee. I want to try to respond \nto some of the points that were made and put this issue in some kind of \nperspective as I see it.\n  First of all, why are we even proposing this amendment? Why does my \nunderlying amendment that Senator Kyl would propose to eliminate--why \ndoes my underlying amendment try to move us in the direction, as a \ncountry, of using more renewable energy to produce electricity? Why is \nthat a priority for the country?\n  I have essentially the same chart as that to which my good friend \nfrom Ohio referred. and it has the same basic information on it.\n\n  This chart points out that when you look ahead--we do now depend \nprimarily on coal. We do now depend heavily on nuclear. We do now \ndepend heavily on natural gas. And renewables are not a major part of \nour energy mix, particularly the nonhydro renewables are not a major \npart of our energy mix.\n  One of the purposes we have in this energy legislation--and in this \nparticular renewable portfolio standard provision--is to diversify the \nsources from which we generate power, so when we get to 2020 the chart \nI show you in this Chamber does not look exactly like it looks now as I \nam pointing to it here.\n  Today, in 2002, about 69 percent of the electricity we generate in \nthis country is produced from coal and natural gas. If we do not adopt \nsomething such as this renewable portfolio standard, the expectation is \nthat by 2020 it will be 80 percent produced by those two fuels. That is \ntoo much concentration. That is not smart.\n  The Presiding Officer is familiar with investment strategies. One of \nthe simplest, most basic investment strategies is to diversify so you \nare not too dependent on what happens to one particular thing. We are \ntoo dependent today on what happens to the price of natural gas.\n  My colleague from Ohio was citing the terrible plight which many \npeople in this country faced when natural gas prices went up 100 \npercent, 200 percent 18 months ago. I certainly saw that in my State. \nMany of the people I represent were very adversely affected. That is \nwhat we are trying to get away from with this renewable portfolio \nstandard.\n  We are trying to say some of this electricity that is produced in the \ncountry--some modest amount of it--I would be the first to admit that \nthis amendment to require up to 10 percent by the year 2020 is a modest \namendment. I think it is very doable. It is a movement in the right \ndirection, but it is a modest requirement. We are saying, let's at \nleast do that. Let's at least require utilities to do the best they \ncan, wherever they are located, to generate some of the electricity \nthey sell from renewable sources. So that is what we are about here.\n  This chart I have shown before on the Senate floor. It tries to make \nthe point that as compared to other countries, particularly in Europe--\nthat is what is reflected on the chart--the United States has done much \nless in the way of trying to generate energy from renewable sources. It \nshows on the chart that Spain has had a 300-percent increase from the \nyears 1990 to 1995; Germany, over 150 percent; Denmark, nearly 150 \npercent; the Netherlands, over 50 percent; France, a substantial \namount. The United States is the one shown on the chart with the yellow \ncircle around it. We have been moving ahead at a very, almost \nimperceptible, rate.\n  So what we are trying to do with this legislation is incentivize and \nrequire that some action be taken to move toward more production of \nenergy from renewable sources.\n  My friend from Arizona, in his zeal, referred to this as ``Soviet \nstyle command and control.'' This proposal, which we brought to the \nSenate floor, is essentially the same as President George W. Bush \nsigned into law in Texas. We all know how sympathetic he is to Soviet \nstyle command and control. It has worked tremendously in Texas. In \nfact, there are all sorts of articles being written about how \nsuccessful that State has been in increasing the use of renewables, and \nincreasing the generation of power from renewables, and how the rest of \nthe country ought to learn something from Texas. What we are trying to \ndo here is learn something from Texas.\n  I see the majority leader in the Chamber. If he has comments or a \nstatement to make, I would be glad to yield to him at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for \nhis kindness.\n  Mr. President, I make an announcement that there will be no more \nrollcall votes tonight. We will pick up, hopefully, on the Kyl \namendment tomorrow and have a vote on it at some point shortly after we \nreconvene.\n\n\n                   Technical Amendments Negotiations\n\n  Mr. President, I also announce that it appears it is unlikely we are \ngoing to reach an agreement with regard to the so-called technical \namendments that have been the subject of a good deal of discussion and \nnegotiation over the last several days. I appreciate the effort made by \nmany of our colleagues. That will, as we have all understood, \nnecessitate the cloture vote tomorrow.\n  My expectation is that we will come in late morning and then have the \ncloture vote and begin the debate on the campaign finance reform bill. \nPerhaps we still may reach some agreement with regard to the technical \namendments, but at least as of this hour no agreement has been reached.\n  Senator McCain has indicated to me he is not in a position to agree \nto the amendments that have been discussed. As a result, while I \nencourage further discussion, I do want people to know that it is very \nlikely, I would say, we could have that cloture vote as early as late \ntomorrow morning. So I want to inform my colleagues of that.\n  I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the leader will yield, I must say that I am \nsomewhat frustrated. The leader may or may not know that Senator McCain \nand I have had three meetings on this subject. My staff and his staff, \nand others on the other side of that issue, worked for 3 weeks to \nresolve six very small items. There were 10 meetings between the staffs \nof Senator McCain and Feingold and mine, several phone conversations \ndaily when staff was permitted to speak to each other, phone \nconversations late at night and over the weekend. Late last night, \nSenators McCain and Feingold provided a draft incorporating two \ntechnical changes of their own, to which we immediately agreed. In \nfact, we agreed to all of Senator McCain's and Senator Feingold's \nprovisions and their changes. And I have been representing to my \ncolleagues for over a week now we were almost there.\n  I was hoping we would be able to end this debate with everybody \nfeeling good about the situation, but I must say I am not sure I have \nbeen dealt with in good faith, having worked on\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\nthis now for 3 weeks, and every time I am told we are almost there, we \nare never there.\n  So I think the majority leader is correct. That is where we seem to \nbe. But I am going to say, I am astounded. This is my 18th year in the \nSenate. I have been involved in a lot of negotiations--never one so \npainful over so little: six rather small items.\n  So I do think we are going to wrap this bill up tomorrow. It is too \nbad we will not, apparently, be able to pass a technical package that \nwould benefit both sides because of our inability to bring this to \nconclusion.\n  But I say to the leader, as I have said repeatedly over the last \nweek, we are anxious on this side, those of us who oppose this bill, to \ncomplete it. And, hopefully, we can wrap it up tomorrow, not only the \ncloture vote but final passage, and the resolution that I believe we \nhave agreed upon, which is separate from the technical amendments. It \nis really regretful that we negotiate for 3 weeks over relatively small \nitems and cannot seem to get there.\n\n  So let me say to the leader, we look forward to wrapping this bill up \ntomorrow--we know it is essentially over--and hope we can do it in a \nminimal amount of time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I appreciate all of \nhis efforts. I said a moment ago, I still hold out the possibility that \nsome agreement can be reached. And, of course, the cloture vote does \nnot preclude that. So we will keep talking.\n  I think Senators should be on notice that the cloture vote will take \nplace, and, hopefully, we can then reach some kind of unanimous consent \nagreement with regard to the time required for further debate on the \nbill prior to the time we have a final passage vote.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3038\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just speak for a few more minutes \nand conclude my comments. I know there are others waiting to speak on \nthis Kyl amendment.\n  One of the issues that was raised by the Senator from Georgia was a \nconcern about whether or not this preempted States from doing what they \nwanted to do about renewable energy generation. It does not do that. \nThere is no way that we in any way preempt a State from taking action.\n  There are many States that have taken action which far exceeds the \nstandards to which we would be holding them. So this is not in any way \nan effort to preempt States. It is an effort to move them along this \nroad, and some of them are already a great deal of distance down this \nroad.\n  Let me also discuss the idea of wealth transfer. My colleague from \nArizona has said repeatedly that this is a terrible thing because some \nStates are at such a terrible disadvantage. The truth is--and the \nvarious maps that my friend from North Dakota showed earlier make the \npoint very clearly--we do not specify in this legislation which type of \nrenewable resource be used. Instead, we allow each State to use \nwhatever is available to them. There are a great many different \nresources available.\n  Finally, let me talk about cost. There has been a real concern that \nthe cost of this provision would be substantial for ratepayers, for \nvarious individuals.\n  I have the Energy Daily, which is a well-known publication in town \nand around the country. This is dated March 12. There is an article \nentitled ``EIA Sees RPS Having Little Impact On Prices.''\n  What that means is that the Energy Information Administration was \nasked by my colleague, Senator Murkowski, to do a study on what would \nbe the impact of this provision on prices?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. You have just stated that many States have already \nimplemented greater RPS standards than required in your amendment. In \nmy statement, I said 14 already have RPS standards. But this bill does \nmandate a 10-percent renewable requirement on all the States. In a \nState like Ohio, we are currently generating less than four-tenths of 1 \npercent of our electricity with non-hydro renewable power sources. We \nare also facing some dramatic increases in electric generation costs to \nreduce the pollution from coal-fired plants by using clean coal \ntechnology. About 85 percent of our plants use coal today.\n  I can't believe an RPS in Ohio will reach 10 percent because in all \nprobability, the utilities that serve my State, if this goes in as a \nmandate, will buy credits and then the cost of those credits will be \npassed on to Ohio ratepayers.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me respond: There clearly are some challenges for \nsome States in this legislation, but I am persuaded that there are ways \nfor them to meet those challenges through coal-fired generation, using \nbiomass. That is one way to do it. We are glad to work with the Senator \nto be sure that the legislation has the flexibility in it so that this \nis a goal that can be achieved in his State by utilities operating in \nhis State. I think it can be.\n  If I could just conclude the description of this study, this is the \nstudy by the Energy Information Administration, it concludes:\n\n       . . . that the retail price impacts of a requirement that \n     electricity generators provide at least 10 percent of their \n     output from renewable sources by 2020 ``are projected to be \n     small because the price impact of [the program] is projected \n     to be relatively small when compared with the total \n     electricity costs and to be mostly offset by lower gas \n     prices.''\n\n  Then they go on to say:\n\n       The study, which was requested by Sen. Frank Murkowski of \n     Alaska . . . concludes that increased electricity generation \n     from renewables would have the biggest impact on natural gas-\n     fired prices, which EIA said would drop as a result of \n     competitive pressure from renewables.\n\n  So the chart my friend from Ohio put up showing gas prices going \nthrough the ceiling, as they did 18 months ago, that would be less \nlikely if there were other sources from which energy was being \ngenerated.\n  Mr. President, I have other points I can make. I know there are \nseveral Senators who have been waiting quite a while to speak. I may \nhave an opportunity later on before the vote to conclude my comments.\n  Mr. President, I have a series of letters in support of the \nunderlying Bingaman amendment that Senator Kyl would wipe out with his \namendment. I ask unanimous consent those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              National Hydropower Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The National Hydropower Association \n     (NHA) writes to ask you to support Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle and Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman \n     Jeff Bingaman for their inclusion of ``incremental \n     hydropower'' in the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) \n     contained in S. 517, the ``Energy Policy Act of 2002.'' \n     Additionally, we ask that you oppose any efforts to modify or \n     remove incremental hydropower from the RPS when the bill is \n     considered on the Senate floor and to support S. 517's RPS in \n     the event of an ``up-or-down'' vote.\n       Both Democrats and Republicans have recognized the \n     importance of hydropower--our nation's leading renewable \n     technology--in meeting future energy demands. What's more 93 \n     percent of registered voters overwhelmingly support an \n     important role for hydropower in the future, and 74 percent \n     favor incentives for increased hydropower production at \n     existing facilities.\n       With the inclusion of incremental hydropower in the RPS, \n     approximately 4,000 Megawatts (MWs) of new hydro generation \n     could be developed meeting today's environmental standards at \n     existing hydropower facilities--none of which would require \n     the construction of a new dam or impoundment. This is enough \n     power for four million homes--clearly a significant \n     contribution to our nation's energy supply.\n       The most commonly used definition of incremental \n     hydropower, including that of S. 517, allows new hydro \n     generation to be achieved from increased efficiency or \n     additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric dam. \n     This concept is based on extensive discussions and a general \n     agreement between the hydropower industry, a segment of the \n     environmental community and other members of the renewable \n     energy community.\n       NHA strongly supports Senators Daschle and Bingaman for \n     their inclusion of incremental hydropower in S. 517 and hope \n     you will do the same. What's more, we hope you'll support the \n     RPS when it is debated on the Senate floor as it will allow \n     America to rely more on clean, renewable energy.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\n       If you have any questions, please contact Mark R.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: Please consider this letter an \n     endorsement of the compromise Renewable Portfolio Standard \n     (RPS) contained within S. 517, the Energy Security Policy \n     Bill.\n       As you may know, FPL Group, comprised of its two major \n     subsidiaries, Florida Power & Light (FPL) and FPL Energy \n     (FPLE), is one of America's cleanest, most progressive energy \n     companies. Our commitment to the environment is manifested by \n     FPL's diverse generation mix and by FPLE's largely renewable \n     energy portfolio. FPLE operates the two largest solar \n     projects in the world, over 1,000 megawatts of hydroelectric \n     power, a number of geothermal projects, and a number of \n     biomass plants. And, significantly, with over 1,400 megawatts \n     of net ownership in wind energy, FPLE is the nation's largest \n     generator of wind power.\n       FPLE plans on adding up to 2,000 megawatts of new wind \n     generation over the next two years. Due to the wind energy \n     production tax credit (IRC Sec. 45(c)(3)) and the industry's \n     success in reducing production costs, wind energy has become \n     economically feasible. A long-term extension of the credit \n     combined with your RPS will allow wind generation--and, \n     hopefully, other renewable sources--to contribute to \n     America's energy independence and security. Ultimately, such \n     an aim should be the keystone of any American energy policy.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue, and \n     we strongly support your efforts to enact a fair and balanced \n     RPS. Please do not hestitate to call on me should you require \n     any assistance in your endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael M. Wilson,\n     Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Calpine Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of Calpine Corporation, I \n     am writing to convey our support for the Renewable Portfolio \n     Standards (RPS) amendment that I understand you plan to \n     offer.\n       We support a reasonable RPS that will provide a market-\n     based incentive for increasing the amount of energy that is \n     produced by renewables. Your amendment is a significant \n     improvement over both the existing Senate energy bill \n     language and the Jeffords amendment to be offered on this \n     subject. We particularly support the fact that your amendment \n     treats all types of renewable energy the same.\n       We also believe that an RPS is only workable when it is \n     coupled with tax incentives for the production of renewable \n     energy and we strongly support the production tax credit for \n     basic renewables that is contained in the underlying energy \n     bill.\n       As the world's largest producer of geothermal energy, we \n     are concerned, however, that only new renewable capacity will \n     be eligible to receive tradable credits under the RPS. While \n     I understand your desire it to encourage new capacity rather \n     than reward past behavior, it seems that there should be some \n     recognition for early action. Perhaps when this issue comes \n     to conference, you might consider a system whereby existing \n     renewable capacity is eligible for credits that phase out \n     over time. We would certainly be willing to work with you on \n     such a proposal.\n       Finally, I want to thank you for your leadership in guiding \n     this energy legislation through the Senate. The bill contains \n     some important features that will help to promote more \n     competitive markets and we appreciate everything you have \n     done to maintain these features and oppose amendments that \n     would turn away from open access and competition.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeanne Connelly.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       MidAmerican\n\n\n                                      Energy Holdings Company,\n\n                                        Omaha, NE, March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am pleased to write in support of \n     your efforts to include provisions to promote the development \n     of renewable energy resources for electric generation in the \n     Senate's comprehensive energy bill. MidAmerican Energy \n     Holdings Company is one of the world's largest developers of \n     renewable energy, including geothermal, wind, biomass and \n     solar.\n       MidAmerican has been a long-time proponent of both a \n     production tax credit for electricity generated by renewables \n     and a federal government purchase standard for renewable \n     electricity. We strongly support these provisions in the \n     comprehensive energy bill before the Senate, as well as \n     recent modifications to the bill's renewable portfolio \n     standard (RPS) section that will ensure that implementation \n     of the RPS is achievable and affordable.\n       Renewable electricity can play a critical role in \n     diversifying the nation's fuel mix and providing emissions-\n     free electricity for American consumers. By including both \n     supply and demand side components in the comprehensive energy \n     package, your legislation will benefit the environment and \n     American energy security.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in promoting renewable \n     energy.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               David L. Sokol,\n\n                                                      Chairman and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Wind Energy Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I write on behalf of the Board of \n     Directors and member companies of the American Wind Energy \n     Association (AWEA) in support of the Renewables Portfolio \n     Standard (RPS) contained in the proposed substitute to S. \n     517, the Energy Policy Act of 2002.\n       While we believe that all of America's renewable energy \n     technologies--wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and \n     hydropower--are capable of contributing higher levels of \n     electricity generation than would be required by the proposed \n     RPS, the provision is a significant step forward in meeting \n     America's growing energy needs.\n       In 2001 alone the wind energy industry installed close to \n     1,700 megawatts of new generating capacity, enough to meet \n     the needs of about 475,000 households. More than half of this \n     new wind power development (915 megawatts) was produced in \n     Texas--a state with the most effective renewable energy \n     requirement law in the nation. In addition to producing \n     electricity without emitting any pollutants, each megawatt of \n     wind power creates at least $1 million in economic activity.\n       The wind industry is proud to support the RPS contained in \n     S. 517, aimed at diversifying America's energy production \n     while also enhancing our effort to secure cleaner air and a \n     more sustainable energy future. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Randall Swisher,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Geothermal Energy Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: This afternoon, Senator Bingaman plans to \n     offer a substitute for the RPS provisions in S. 517 that the \n     geothermal industry urges you to support.\n       While we believe that significantly more renewable energy \n     could be brought on-line over the next twenty years, the \n     Bingaman amendment would establish an important national \n     minimum requirement for new renewable development. This will \n     help ensure the continued growth and health of renewable \n     industries and will have positive economic and environmental \n     benefits for our Nation.\n       Moreover, the Bingaman proposal would preserve the \n     essential market-based approach that is at the heart of a \n     renewable portfolio standard. This proposal--together with \n     the provisions proposed by the Senate Finance Committee that \n     would equalize renewable tax treatment by expanding the \n     production tax credit to include geothermal energy--will \n     stimulate market forces to develop reliable and cost-\n     effective renewable technologies to help meet our country's \n     energy needs.\n       On behalf of the geothermal industry, I strongly encourage \n     you to support the Bingaman amendment and the renewable \n     energy tax provisions reported by the Senate Finance \n     Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Karl Gawell,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized, followed by the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. What I can do is--I would be pleased to speak for \nmyself; I know Senator McCain wants to speak--if I could get 10 minutes \nbefore the vote tomorrow to speak, I would be pleased to relinquish the \nfloor last.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am not in a position to commit to that \nwithout the assistant majority leader, floor leader, to talk about \nthat. I don't know what the procedure is. Since we are jumping from the \nenergy bill to the campaign finance reform bill and back every few \nminutes, it is very difficult for me to commit to that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I just ask my friends from Minnesota and from New \nMexico--three of us are on the floor. We would take about 2 minutes to \nkind of clear up a problem that has arisen. If I could ask unanimous \nconsent that we could take a maximum of 3 minutes, 1 minute each.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that would be fine. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I just immediately follow them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. And then I would be followed by Senator Cantwell as in \nthe original agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                   TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will take less than 1 minute. We have \nbeen working with the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from Wisconsin \nand I have, and our staffs. We have come up with a package of technical \namendments with which we are in agreement. We are ready to move that \npackage. There seems to be a problem with another Member, a very senior \nMember. I hope we can get that worked out.\n  I do have it worked out. I think we should be ready to move forward \ntomorrow. I think we have had good-faith negotiations.\n  I yield to either one of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I said before the Senator from Arizona had arrived \nthat I was totally frustrated. I recounted all the meetings he and I \nand our staffs had had, and I was exasperated that we seemed to have \ngotten so close and not been able to complete it. I confirm what the \nSenator from Arizona said, that we have reached an agreement among the \nthree of us on this technical package. We would like to be able to move \nit, and we would plead with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto give us a chance. I don't think there are three Members of the \nSenate who know any more about the subject than we do. Our positions \nare pretty well established. We have actually reached agreement, and we \nwould hope that the Senate would let us act on it in some kind of \nconsent arrangement sometime tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there have been good-faith negotiations. \nI agree with the Senators from Arizona and Kentucky that we have \nfinally reached agreement on the technical amendments package. There is \na different Member of the Senate who has a concern about it. Because we \nare operating on the basis of a unanimous consent, we have to deal with \nthat. But we have finally reached the point where the actual provisions \nare something we can agree on, and we are hoping we can work this out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I assume we will have time to talk \nabout campaign finance reform.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3038\n\n  As a matter of fact, I think I can do it in just a couple of minutes. \nLast week when we had the debate on the Jeffords amendment, to increase \nthe renewable portfolio to 20-percent electricity, I spoke at some \nlength. I just want to pick up on a couple of points that Senator \nBingaman made, and probably my colleague from Washington can speak \nabout this with more eloquence. Nobody, to respond to the Senator from \nOhio, is making the argument that, by 2020, we will be totally \nindependent from fossil fuels. No one is making that argument. It's \nreally a ``straw man'' argument.\n  I think the question is whether or not we will, no pun intended, \ncontinue to barrel down the fossil fuel energy path. Will we continue \nto rely primarily on oil, coal, or on other fossil fuel? Or do we want \nto take a new direction. I, frankly, think this is going to be a test \nvote for a new direction in energy policy. I think the Senator from New \nMexico agrees that this is going to be a test vote on this bill. This \n10-percent renewable energy portfolio, which is from my point of view \ntoo little, makes this legislation a reform bill--it makes this an \nenergy bill that is sensitive to how we produce energy in connection \nwith the environment. It takes us down a different energy path.\n  The different path is significant for many States. For example, in \nMinnesota, we produce enough wind to produce all of our electricity \nthrough wind, when the technology is there. In fact, Minnesota, South \nDakota, and North Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas could produce enough \nenergy through wind generation to produce electricity for the whole \ncountry.\n  So there is enormous potential here. In addition to wind, we have \nbiomass to electricity, solar, and geothermal. When my colleague from \nOhio was giving some projections, I think he missed the point about the \npotential of efficient energy use and where that figures in. Again, one \nmore time, it is a marriage ready to be made between being much more \nrespectful of the environment, clean technology, many more small \nbusiness opportunities, keeping dollars and capital in our States and \nour communities, national security, and less dependent on Middle \nEastern oil.\n  Look at what happened last year with natural gas prices. We would be \nmuch less dependent on a few giant energy conglomerates for energy.\n  This is pro-environment, pro-consumer, pro-small business, pro-clean \ntechnology, and is going to be a huge growth industry in our country. \nFrankly, the only folks who are really opposed to this renewable \nportfolio standard are some Senators are opposed because they think it \nis a mistake to have a mandate or a subsidy. Although I have to tell \nyou, the oil and gas industry have gotten huge subsidies over the \nyears. Last year the House passed a bill with over $30 billion in tax \nbreaks, most of them going to oil, coal, and the nuclear industry. Now \nthat is a government subsidy. If I were to look back over the last 50 \nyears of energy policy, it would be a massive amount of money we have \ngiven to the fossil fuel energy industry. We don't want to stack the \ndeck against renewables. We want to nurture and promote energy policy \nfor all of the good reasons I have tried to outline.\n  Frankly, if we can't hold on to this 10 percent renewable energy \nportfolio, then I don't think we have much of a form bill here at all.\n  This is a key vote. That is why I wanted to speak briefly about it. I \nhope we will get a strong vote against the Kyl amendment, and I think \nwe will. I think it should be defeated.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the Kyl \namendment. We are debating this energy bill against the backdrop of one \nof the country's most severe energy crises, which has definitely \nimpacted ratepayers in my State and in many parts of the West.\n  After September 11, the war against terrorism even more underscores \nthe need for us to develop a national energy policy that helps create \nmore independence. It is clear that the time has come for us to enact a \n21st century energy policy. But we will fail if this bill is simply \nabout the extent to which we should increase oil production or \ndetermine the best route for pipelines. We will fail if we do not learn \nfrom the lessons of the past and recognize that we are on the cusp of a \nrevolution of energy technology that could be as significant as the \nrevolution in computing technology.\n  We are faced with a clear choice: We can go down the path of debating \nfalse choices of conservation versus production, regulation versus \nderegulation, nuclear versus fossil. But I think it is time that we \nrecognize what is at the core of the debate is this 21st century energy \npolicy; about developing a new policy that will lead us to a system of \ncleaner, more efficient, distributed power, located closer to the homes \nand businesses that it is built to serve.\n  Mr. President, the renewable portfolio standard we are debating today \nis the centerpiece of our effort of a 21st century energy policy marked \nby environmentally responsible sources of energy. An aggressive \nrenewables portfolio standard will help this Nation diversify its \nenergy, level the playing field for renewable resources, and encourage \ninvestment in clean energy technology. A transition to clean, renewable \nsources of energy will help stabilize increasing and volatile fossil \nfuel prices, ease energy supply shortages and disruptions, clean up \ndangerous air pollution, and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  Again, arguments in favor of a strong Federal renewables portfolio \nstandard are straightforward. An RPS will spur more environmentally \nresponsible generation, diversify electricity sources, and that is \nenhancing and helping to protect our economy from price spikes; and, \nthree, create a national market\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\nfor renewables and clean energy technology, spurring innovation and \nreducing their cost--potentially for international export.\n  Today, less than 2 percent of the Nation's electricity is generated \nby nontraditional sources of power such as wind, solar, and geothermal \nenergy. This has to change. By putting a renewables portfolio standard \nin place, we will set the Nation down a path toward a more independent, \nsustainable, and stable power supply.\n  I want to emphasize just how important it is to diversify our \ngenerating resources. As many of my colleagues are aware, last year the \nPacific Northwest suffered the second worst drought in the history of \nour State. In Washington State, about 80 percent of our generation \ncomes from hydroelectric sources. So because of this drought, consumers \nin my State were exposed far more directly to the pervasive market \ndysfunction activity that happened in the West. As a result, many of \nour utilities have had to raise their retail rates by as much as 50 \npercent.\n\n  So I believe we must diversify our resource portfolio, but to \naccomplish this goal, many of our utilities are making a tremendous \ninvestment in new generation. Much of it is from ample renewable \nresources. We realize the investment in renewables is affordable and a \nperfect complement to our hydroelectric base. For example, I visited, \nin our State, the Stateline Wind Project last August, which is located \nin Walla Walla, WA. The wind farm, which went into operation December \n13, consists of 399 turbines and has a capacity to produce 263 \nmegawatts of electricity. That is enough energy to serve almost 70,000 \nhomes. So this is working.\n  The Bonneville Power Administration, which supplies about 70 percent \nof the power consumed in Washington State, has set a goal of obtaining \na total of a thousand megawatts of energy.\n  Many of our small and rural utilities are banding together to invest \nin wind projects, and the Yakima Tribe is also exploring similar \noptions.\n  As we consider the renewables portfolio standards provisions of this \nbill, I think it is important to recognize the tremendous untapped \npotential that these renewables represent. Washington State and the \nPacific Northwest have begun to make this investment. With the \nconstruction now underway, our regional renewable resources, excluding \nmost hydropower, will soon approach 4 percent--far surpassing the \nnational average. But I believe we can still do better.\n  A strong renewables portfolio standard will create the market \ncertainty that companies and utilities need to continue down the path \ntoward resource diversification and technological innovation. \nSpecifically, increasing our supply of renewable resources makes not \njust environmental sense but also economic sense. A study released last \nNovember, sponsored by a group of Northwest utilities and interest \ngroups, estimated that the international market for clean energy \ntechnologies will grow to $180 billion a year over the next 20 years--\nthat's right, $180 billion a year over the next 20 years.\n  It is in our national economic interest to set policy that will \nensure the United States captures a major part of this market.\n  Already the Northwest has a $1.4 billion clean energy industry that \nis on track to grow to $2.5 billion over the next several years, \ncreating 12,000 new jobs in our region. That is right, 12,000 new jobs \nin our region.\n  With the right public policies in place, we can attain 3.5 percent of \nthe worldwide market for clean energy technologies, including not just \ngeneration but smart-grid transmission technologies needed to bring \npower to market more efficiently and create as many as 35,000 new jobs \nin the Northwest.\n  Developing the clean energy technology industry on a national level \nmeans job creation. We need a Federal renewable portfolio standard both \nto break our century-old reliance on traditional fossil fuels and to \ncreate predictable markets for renewable technologies and lay the \ngroundwork for even greater innovations.\n  Last week, the Senate was unable to make meaningful progress on the \nimportant issue of corporate average fuel economy standards for our \nNation's vehicles. We had an opportunity before us to alleviate threats \nto our national energy and economic security posed by our dependence on \nimported oil. Nonetheless, it is important that we make progress today \nin this particular area and make sure that we make a renewable standard \nan important part of this legislation.\n  The renewable portfolio standard is one of the thresholds that will \ndetermine whether the Senate really does create an energy policy that \nsets itself apart from the 19th century focus of digging, burning, and \ndrilling and focuses more importantly on these 21st century \ntechnologies.\n  Now is the time to enact an energy policy that will help us meet \nthese goals. A strong renewable portfolio standard will encourage use \nof renewable sources and reduce harmful air and water pollution from \ncoal and fossil fuels. It will help ensure a sustainable, secure energy \nsupply and protect our environment for future generations. It will \ncreate the investment, income, and jobs in our communities, especially \nour rural areas.\n  These are the characteristics that I think should be part of our 21st \ncentury energy policy. I ask my colleagues to support a strong \nrenewable portfolio standard and, most importantly, oppose any efforts \nto strip from this bill or in any way undermine this measure which I \nbelieve is critical. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kyl \namendment and to vote instead for a strong renewable portfolio \nstandard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to respond to some of the comments \nmade relative to my amendment by various Senators who have spoken since \nI laid that amendment down earlier this afternoon.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two letters \nfrom the Public Service Commission of the State of Florida, both dated \nMarch 18, 2002, one to the Honorable Bill Nelson and the other to the \nHonorable Bob Graham, the two Senators from the State of Florida.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                    Public Service Commission,\n\n                                  Tallahassee, FL, March 18, 2002.\n     Re: Energy Legislation (Substitute Amendment 2917 to S. 517).\n\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The purpose of this letter is to let you know \n     that the Florida Public Service Commission has major concerns \n     with the 400-page Substitute Amendment currently being \n     addressed by the Senate. It is extremely preemptive of State \n     Commission authority. If legislation moves forward, we ask \n     that it provide a continuing role for States in ensuring \n     reliability of all aspects of electrical service-including \n     generation, transmission, and power delivery services and \n     should not authorize the FERC to preempt State authority to \n     ensure safe and reliable service to retail customers. Also, \n     we support the Kyl amendment on the renewable portfolio \n     standard.\n       In particular, our concerns are:\n       (1) Electric Reliability Standards.\n       The substitute amendment would limit the States' authority \n     and discretion to set more rigorous reliability standards \n     than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) over \n     transmission and distribution. In fact, the Substitute \n     Amendment appears to provide no role for States at all on \n     transmission reliability. Yet, the Florida Legislature has \n     carefully set cut statutory authority for the PPSC over \n     transmission.\n       If legislation moves forward, Congress should expressly \n     include in the bill a provision to protect the existing State \n     authority to ensure reliability transmission service. We note \n     that the Thomas amendment passed. The amendment appears to \n     strengthen state authority. In that regard, the amendment is \n     better than the overall bill under consideration. Our \n     interpretation is that the amendment will not restrict state \n     commission authority to adopt more stringent standards, if \n     necessary.\n       (2) Market Transparency Rules.\n       The section is silent on State authority to protect against \n     market abuses, although it does require FERC to issue rules \n     to provide information to the States. State regulators must \n     be able to review the data necessary to ensure that abuses \n     are not occurring in the market.\n       (3) Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA).\n       The FPSC supports lifting PURPA's mandatory purchase \n     requirement, but States should be allowed to determine \n     appropriate measures to protect the public interest by\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     addressing mitigation and cost recovery issues. Thus, we do \n     not support preempting State jurisdiction by granting FERC \n     authority to order the recovery of costs in retail rates or \n     to otherwise limit State authority to require mitigation of \n     PURPA contract costs. States that have already approved these \n     contracts are better able to address this matter than the \n     FERC.\n       (4) Federal Renewable Portfolio Standards.\n       This requires that beginning with 2003, each retail \n     electric supplier shall submit to the Secretary of Energy \n     renewable energy credits in an amount equal to the required \n     annual percentage to be determined by the Secretary. For the \n     year 2005, it will be less than 2.5 percent of the total \n     electric energy sold by the retail electric supplier to the \n     electric consumer in the calendar year. For each calendar \n     year from 2006 through 2020, it shall increase by \n     approximately .5 percent.\n       The Secretary will also determine the type of renewable \n     energy resource used to produce the electricity. A credit \n     trading system will be established. While a provision is \n     established to allow states to adopt additional renewable \n     programs, we continue to have concerns. Thus, we strongly \n     support the Kyl amendment which provides some flexibility \n     to the States.\n       The FPSC believes that States are in the best position to \n     determine the amount, the time lines, and the types of \n     renewable energy that would most benefit their retail \n     ratepayers. This is particularly true in the case of States \n     without cost-effective renewable resources. A one-size-fits-\n     all standard will likely raise rates for most consumers.\n       (5) Consumer Protection.\n       The FPSC is concerned with language in Section 256 that \n     requires that State actions not be inconsistent with the \n     provisions found in the bill. While the FPSC favors strong \n     consumer protection measures, preempting States by Federally \n     legislating retail consumer protections is not necessary. \n     States are better positioned to combat retail abuses. States \n     are partners with federal agencies in these efforts to ensure \n     consumer protection.\n       The critical role of State Commissions in the analogous \n     area of implementing the Federal Telecommunications Act \n     provision against slamming (the unauthorized switch of a \n     customer's primary telecommunications carrier) serves as a \n     good example. The Federal Communications Commission saw the \n     benefit of having State Commissions carry out the anti-\n     slamming program. State Commissions are simply better \n     situated and have a more in-depth understanding of the abuses \n     in the consumer protection arena. As a result, Florida's \n     slamming rules are actually more strict and provide better \n     remedies to the consumers than the FCC rules. We would like \n     to retain the ability to take similar steps in the energy \n     area if warranted.\n       It is our understanding that there are now 100-200 \n     amendments. We are in the process of reviewing all of them. \n     In the meantime, please call us with questions on them. We \n     appreciate that your staff has been in frequent contact with \n     FPSC staff.\n       In conclusion, we request that you take these points into \n     consideration as energy legislation progresses. Please do not \n     hesitate to call if we may be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lila A. Jaber,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                    Public Service Commission,\n\n                                   Tallahassee, FL, March 18, 2002\n     Re Energy Legislation (Substitute Amendment 2917 to S. 517).\n\n     Hon.

Jaber,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what those two letters say is that the Kyl \namendment should be adopted and the Bingaman amendment should lose. \nThey are echoing the sentiments of a lot of other groups both in the \nprivate and public sectors. I have put in the Record some other letters \nfrom the public sector and associations that strongly support the Kyl \namendment.\n  I wish to respond to some of the comments from colleagues that have \nbeen made in response to my presentation. My colleague from North \nDakota made the point that we should have a national energy policy just \nlike the Clean Air Act and that is why we need a national energy bill.\n  There is a difference between a national policy and a Federal policy. \nWe do have national problems, but not all national problems are best \nsolved by a Federal solution.\n  In this case, we have a combination because we have clearly decided \nthat the Federal Government does need to be directly involved in the \nnational energy policy debate, but we do not say --none of us says--the \nFederal Government should take it all over; it is a\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nFederal problem; therefore, we have a Federal solution.\n  Most of what we do as a nation we do as private sector operatives, as \nState and local governments, and then, of course, the U.S. Government \ndoes a fair amount of directing and financing of programs, but clearly \nwe cannot run everything from Washington, DC.\n  The Bingaman amendment does deviate from this otherwise pretty \ncommonsense approach to American life by saying: This is not just a \nnational problem; we do not need just a national solution, we need a \nFederal solution to the point that we are going to mandate, compel, \nrequire, under penalty of law, that you will produce 10 percent of your \npower through renewable sources or else.\n  I actually misstated that a little bit. It is not produce, it is \nsell. We are requiring that the retailer account for 100 percent of the \npower sold so that you can prove to the Department of Energy that 10 \npercent of that power sold came from renewable sources. You do not have \nto produce it yourself. You either have to buy it from somebody who \nproduced it or you have to buy credits from somebody who produced it or \nyou have to buy credits from the Department of Energy that does not \nproduce anything. But if you are willing to assess your retail \ncustomers for that, then you can get away without producing it \nyourself.\n  Either way, the energy is going to cost you something; it is going to \ncost them something. In one case, you actually have to buy it from \nsomebody, and, in the other case, you have to buy it from somebody or \nthe Department of Energy. There is a big difference between having a \nnational policy and having a Federal mandate.\n  There are a lot of items in this bill that are OK, and they have \nnational scope to them. There are a lot of items in the President's \nplan that are national in their scope, but they do not all provide for \nFederal mandates, and that is a distinction we need to make.\n  As a matter of fact, the Senator from Washington just talked about \nthe need for Federal encouragement. In fact, her exact statement was: \nWe need a policy to encourage the use of renewable energy as part of a \n21st century national plan. I agree we need to encourage, but there is \na big difference between encourage and require.\n  The encourage part we already have in the law. As a matter of fact, \nunder this bill we are actually extending and expanding the tax credit \nthat we currently provide for renewable energy sources to encourage \ngreater production of that renewable energy. In fact, it would not make \nany economic sense to produce this without the Federal Government \nsubsidy of 1.7 cents per kilowatt hour, for example, for wind \ngeneration. One could not compete in wind generation without this \nFederal tax credit which provides roughly 40 percent of the cost of the \nproduction of the power.\n  We do encourage, in a big way. We are already doing the encouraging \npart. The question is whether we should have both a carrot and a stick. \nI am all for the carrot approach, but I do not think the Federal \nGovernment should be taking a stick to people who buy electricity and \nsay you have to buy 10 percent renewable power or we are going to make \nyou pay for it. That is exactly what the Bingaman amendment does.\n  What the Kyl-Miller amendment says is, let the States decide. If we \nare going to have a national policy for this national problem, then \nlet's let all the States within the country decide what is best for \nthem.\n  I am intrigued by the chart that is on the easel behind the \ndistinguished chairman of the Energy Committee. The Senator from North \nDakota used that chart to illustrate that we have potential renewable \nresources throughout the country.\n  He demonstrated that by pointing to four different kinds of renewable \nenergy power source. Biomass and solar, I guess that is the one that is \nvery bright red down in my part of the country. Then geothermal in the \nlower left, and wind power in the lower right, and certainly in the \nState of North Dakota there is a bright red color, the Saudi Arabia of \nwind power in North Dakota, and in South Dakota, it seems.\n  What one can see from those four charts is the renewable \nopportunities are very divergent around the country. They are \ndistributed not fairly in one sense but in a very disparate way.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer does not have much of a shot, it \nseems, for wind power or geothermal power or solar power, but there \nmight be some good biomass opportunities. I certainly hope so, because \nit is going to have to be produced or credits are going to have to be \nbought from somebody else who can produce it.\n  The real story behind these four charts is not the disparity and the \nfact there are winners and losers and there will have to be trading \namong the States, but according to the EIA report dated February 2002--\nthat is the Energy Information Agency of the Department of Energy--on \npage 16, and I am quoting, only wind capacity is projected to make \nsignificant change between the renewable portfolio standard and the \nbaseline, or the status quo.\n  In other words, of all of these renewables--solar, geothermal, \nbiomass, and wind--that have been examined by the Department of Energy, \nthe only one projected to make a significant change is wind power. \nThere are a couple of reasons for that. The amount of the subsidy that \nhas been used to develop the wind power industry and the general \nefficiencies with respect to wind power make it the only one \neconomically viable, even close to being economically viable, as a \nproducer of mass amounts of energy of the four basic renewables.\n  As much as we would like to produce it from solar power in the \nSouthwest, the economics are not there, even with the substantial \nFederal subsidies. The same is true with respect to geothermal and \nbiomass. I would like to burn more biomass in the State of Arizona. It \nis not an efficient way to produce power. The Btu content is not there.\n  So of these four basic energy sources, only wind power, the \nDepartment of Energy says, can really make a significant difference. \nThat is a fact.\n  What is the importance of that fact? Well, first of all, the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from North Dakota are sitting pretty \ngood when it comes to production of electricity from wind power, it \nwould seem, and maybe a couple of other States which I cannot quite see \non that chart. Maybe northern Idaho, it looks like, and it looks like a \nlittle piece of Oklahoma. I hear the wind blows pretty well there, and \nI think there is a red dot where Oklahoma is, but that is about it. The \nrest of us do not appear to have a great deal of capacity to generate \nby wind power.\n  What does that mean? That means a transfer of wealth from all of the \nother parts of the country into those regions.\n  I am not suggesting the proponents of the legislation all are from \nthose particular States. That is not true. But it is true that those \nwho would utilize that resource in those areas would stand to gain the \nmost. That is why I ask my colleagues to consider the discrimination \nthat exists in this legislation. If we left it to the States to decide \nwhat percentage to set and how to define the renewable so as to take \nadvantage of what is available in their locales, and how to set the \ntimeframe so they could achieve some reasonable level, that would be \none thing. That is what we have done. Fourteen of the States, including \nmy State of Arizona, do have a renewable requirement. If we mandate at \nthe Federal level, we are saying in Washington we know best for the \nentire country and this is a one-size-fits-all proposition now, we are \ngoing to define what counts as renewable and, by the way, hydropower \ndoes not. That is the first big difference.\n\n  We know full well going into this that only one of these sources, \nwind power, has a chance to really make a significant difference \nanytime in the foreseeable future. So the reality is we are not talking \nabout renewables, we are talking about wind.\n  As I said before, I would kind of like to know who the winners and \nlosers are if we are going to pass this bill. I do not want to buy a \npig in a poke.\n  There was a lot of talk about Enron investing in certain kinds of \nenergy and then trying to get the Federal Government to make everybody \nelse trade in that particular energy or to make it easier to trade in \nthat energy, and there were a lot of us in the Senate and elsewhere who \ncriticized a Federal policy that would have favored a particular entity \nor group of entities within our economy. That should not be\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\nwhat the use of Federal power is all about.\n  If we are going to talk about deregulation as the goal in this \nlegislation, why would we be imposing a brandnew kind of regulation \nover the market that mandates that fully 10 percent of the energy has \nto come from a particular source--in this case, the reality, wind? That \nis what the Department of Energy says is the only renewable that can \nmake a significant difference as part of a renewable portfolio. It only \nexists in a few parts of the country in abundance, apparently. So who \nare the winners and losers? What are the people in other parts of the \ncountry going to have to pay to the producers in this limited area of \nthe United States for the privilege of continuing to generate power \nfrom oil or gas or coal or nuclear or hydro?\n  What are we going to have to pay to those areas that have the benefit \nof a lot of wind in their State? Nobody knows for sure. The Department \nof Energy calculates the gross cost at about $88 billion for the first \n15 years; $12 billion each year thereafter. Of what is that cost \ncomprised? It is the equivalent of credits or penalties. In other \nwords, one is either going to have to produce it or they are going to \nhave to buy a credit--and they estimate what that credit will cost--or \nthey will pay a penalty because they did not do one of those two \nthings. They calculate the cost of that at $88 billion, plus $12 \nbillion a year thereafter after the first 15 years, after the year \n2020. That is a huge cost passed on to the retail consumer.\n  There is also some evidence that if that much of the market replaces \nother energy sources, and there is a big footnote here, the question \nis: Will it replace or will it be providing additional energy because \nthe energy needs of the country will grow over time? Let us assume we \nremain static, stagnant, and therefore the universe is exactly what we \ncan envision today; we actually replace some natural gas or coal. The \nidea is the cost of that fuel will then go down because there is not as \nmuch demand for it, and so the people who get generation from those \nsources will be paying less because there will be lower fuel. As a \ntheoretical proposition, that cannot be argued.\n  I suggest we have done no cost-benefit analysis. The committee has \nnot looked at this. We really do not know what might happen 25 years \nout into the future in terms of the market price of these various kinds \nof fuels, but we do have pretty good numbers as to what the penalties \nand the credits are going to cost because they are fixed in the \nstatute.\n  As a matter of fact, one could buy the credits from the Department of \nEnergy at a very specific 200 percent of market or certain kilowatts \nper hour. So the costs are going to be significant to the retail \npurchasers of power. There is going to be discrimination from one part \nof our country to the next because the only real renewable that can be \nutilized under this legislation, according to the Department of Energy, \nis wind power, and the opportunities for that are somewhat limited.\n  As a result, to those who say we need a national policy, I say, yes, \nwe need a national policy, not a Federal policy, one that takes into \naccount all of these differences. So let us stick with the State option \nthat currently exists.\n  Tomorrow our colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, is going to address \nthe allegation that this bill is, after all, patterned after the Texas \nlegislation, so what could possibly be wrong with it? Well, somebody \nfrom Texas can explain what the Texas legislation does, and I will let \nSenator Gramm do that, but I would note the first point, which is that \nTexas did something on its own for the State of Texas does not mean \ntherefore that the Senate should say everybody else has to do the same \nthing. I daresay, as much as I like Texas and Texans--I did not say how \nmuch; I said ``as much as I do''--I am not willing to say whatever \nTexas does is what everybody else in the country should be mandated to \ndo. So bully for Texas.\n  Arizona has a standard as well. I am not really keen on mandating \nthat the rest of the country do exactly what Arizona did. So I am not \nmuch impressed by the fact that part of this is patterned after what \nTexas did. The Senator from Texas will point out why it really is not \nthat much like the Texas plan.\n  Leaving that aside, it is irrelevant. The fact that one State did it \na certain way suggests to me that the State found a way to make it work \nfor itself and other States ought to look at it, too. But the State of \nMaine did not copy Texas. Maine has a 30-percent requirement. Should we \npick Maine instead of Texas as the great example to follow and require \neverybody to have 30 percent? If 10 percent is good, why not 30 \npercent? I ask my friends, if the object is to diversify, if 10 percent \nis good, why not 30 percent?\n  One of my colleagues said the United States is too dependent on coal \nand natural gas. I have an answer. We can drill for oil at ANWR and \nproduce more nuclear power. That is a great way to diversify.\n  There is a problem. One of my colleagues from Washington State said: \nWe need to diversify because in the Northwest, where we rely so much on \nhydro, we are getting killed by the drought. And it shows there won't \nbe as much hydro available, so we need to diversify.\n  Let's examine that. We get some hydropower in the State of Arizona, \nbut we have diversified by relying a lot more on nuclear, oil, and \ncoal. We know there can be a drought and therefore that renewable is \nnot as much of a sure thing as our coal supply, our natural gas supply, \nor our nuclear energy supply.\n  How about wind? Can you get wind power when the wind does not blow? \nNo. How about solar? Can you get solar power when the Sun does not \nshine? No. That is why with all of the so-called renewables, because \nthey are not as sure a thing as the other sources--which is why we use \nthe other sources--we have to combine them with some other source. We \nhave to combine them with a storage capacity or some other source so \nwhen the Sun is not shining, where the wind is not blowing, or the \nwater is not flowing, you have stored the energy or you have an \nalternative source to provide that energy. That is one of the reasons \nthese are not part of the baseline energy production in the country.\n  Think about it. It is why you would not want to have too much \ndependence on these unreliable resources. We call them renewable \nbecause we know there will always be wind, sun, and water, but you do \nnot know exactly when or where.\n  We have an almost inexhaustible supply of coal in this country and we \nhave spent millions to generate clean coal technology. We are producing \na very large percentage of power in this country on clean coal. We \nadded scrubbers. We demand all kinds of things that take the pollution \nout of the air. We now produce very clean power with coal.\n  Natural gas is even cleaner. It is available where we are able to \nprovide the exploration. Today we have an abundant supply of natural \ngas. And, of course, nuclear is virtually inexhaustible. We can produce \nnuclear power energy for centuries to come. It is the cleanest burning \nfuel, in effect. It produces no pollution whatever. Its supply is \nvirtually inexhaustible.\n  To those who say we should diversify in order not to be dependent \nupon a particular source of energy, and use the example of hydropower, \nI say you are absolutely right; that is why we do not rely upon these \nrenewables. They are not dependable, as are the other major sources of \nelectrical generation in the country today.\n  Why should the Federal Government be mandating unreliable sources for \ngeneration if we want to become more energy dependent and diversify our \ncapacity and have greater ability to be assured of power production in \nthe future? This is folly. This is like going back to the 18th century. \nWindmills are great. If you are in the middle of ranch country, you \nhave to have a windmill to pump the water. It is a great way to do it. \nBut it is not a great way to generate thousands of megawatts of power \nto serve our great cities in the United States in the 21st century. At \nbest, it is a supplemental source of power and we encourage it. We \nprovide tax credits for it.\n\n  The Kyl amendment will permit customers to say this is what we want, \nand if they want it, the States let them buy it at cost. I don't think \nwe should be mandating all sellers of electricity have to provide more \nand more and more of their power from less and less\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\nand less reliable sources--all in the name of diversification and a new \nenergy policy that is going to make us ``safer'' and less reliant upon \nothers? It does not make any sense.\n  There was a suggestion that the Federal mandate is not a preemption \nof the State plans. I beg to differ with my colleague. It certainly \npreempts the States that have decided to have no renewable portfolio \nand preempts those that want a different kind of standard than the \nFederal standard. There may be some things in common with some of the \nStates that provide a requirement but only to the extent is it not \npreemption. To a far greater extent it is preemption.\n  To say it does not transfer wealth from one part of the country to \nanother clearly is erroneous. It will result in that disparity and \ndifferential treatment.\n  I also pointed out other discriminatory features: this does not apply \nto governmental entities such as Bonneville and TVA or other \ngovernmental producers but investor-owned utilities. Why? What is the \npolicy rationale for that? I happen to know, so I will explain.\n  If it had applied to the governmental entities, that part of the bill \nwould have been subject to a point of order because it constitutes an \nunfunded mandate, imposing huge costs on those governmental \nsubdivisions which under our law, now at least, we cannot do without \nsubjecting that proposal to a point of order by the Members of the \nbody. To avoid that point of order, the sponsor of the amendment wisely \nremoved those utilities from the requirement of renewables. That \ncreates a great imbalance. The investor utilities have to comply.\n  The public sector utilities do not have to comply. That is not fair. \nI guarantee we will see the customers of one screaming because they \nhave higher utility bills.\n  I take my hat off to the municipal power producers that have written \nletters saying, notwithstanding the fact we are temporarily out of this \nbill, we still think it is a bad idea. It is not fair for our \ncompetitors that we have an advantage over them. And besides that, we \nare not too sure you will not try to come back and do it to us at a \nlater time.\n  I appreciate their willingness to help out their competitors. There \nis probably some self-interest in it, but it does not matter. They are \nright.\n  There is also discrimination with respect to States such as Maine \nthat have a huge hydro generation right now. They call that a \nrenewable. But the Bingaman amendment does not. Maine says hydro is \ngood; This is a renewable source and we count it toward our 30-percent \nrequirement. The Bingaman amendment says, no, we do not let you count \nthat for this Federal standard. The only thing you can count is if you \nsomehow rewind the generators there and get a little more capacity out \nof this hydrodam in the future. We will let you count that incremental \nsavings, that economy that you effected or the additional production, \nas going toward the renewable. Why do we discriminate in that way? Why \ndo we count solar twice as much as geothermal? Why do you get twice as \nmuch credit on an Indian reservation? It looks as if there was a lot of \nlooking at special interests and politics and issues such as dealing \nwith the point of order issue rather than sound policy.\n  They talk about national energy policy. This looks to me as if it is \na lot more than a national energy policy. There are a lot more \ndifferent considerations than would go into a real national energy \npolicy.\n  I hope my colleagues who have already said to some folks--and I \nacknowledge this--I need a green vote, I need to show I am pro-\nenvironment, that being for renewable energy will demonstrate that, I \nhope they ask themselves the following questions: What are all of my \nconstituents who buy power going to think about that? I suggest that is \nalmost everybody who is eligible to vote. You might want to please an \nenergy company here or there or some environmental group here or there. \nBut you are going to have to be accountable to all of the people who \nuse electricity in your State.\n\n  For those who are going to have to buy credits from elsewhere, it is \ngoing to cost and they are going to wonder why their power bills have \ngone up. If that is the way you are inclined to vote, you are going to \nhave to be prepared to explain that to them. I daresay there are \nprobably going to be some political opponents or people in the media \nwho are going to remind the folks about how this happened. So that is \nthe first thing I think you are going to have to answer; you are going \nto have to answer to the people who buy the power at greater cost \nbecause you needed to have an environmental vote.\n  Second, there is the matter of discrimination. How are you going to \nbe able to explain that it is going to cost you, but it doesn't cost \nsomebody else in the country, just because of where you happen to live \nand where the wind happens to blow? You are going to have to explain \nthat.\n  Frankly, to the extent solar power could be produced in my State, I \ncould say I am really for this and I might benefit. The problem is, we \ndon't have that much wind potential, as a result of which we are still \ngoing to be losers, so it wouldn't matter anyway.\n  I don't want to make somebody else suffer to buy a product I produce \nexcept at the marketplace. If people need to buy what I can make \navailable because they need it and the market is open to their purchase \nof it, then that is great and I am willing for Arizona companies to \nmake some money on that. But I don't want to use the Federal Government \nas my hammer, as my agent, to say I have something I want to sell and I \ncan't figure out a way to make people buy it. I know, I will get the \nFederal Government to pass a law to say people have to buy it. That is \nthe way I will take care of my investment.\n  That is wrong and that is what a few people are urging us to do. I am \nnot talking about people in the body here, of course. I am talking \nabout some folks on the outside. They have the good fortune of having a \nresource they would like to be able to sell. They would like to make \nsome money on it and they haven't been able to do it that well yet \nbecause it is not that economical. The way they get it done is to have \nCongress pass a law to say you have to buy it. I don't think that is \nwhat the Federal Government should be all about.\n  We are going to be taking up campaign finance reform tomorrow and my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, has made a point that I totally agree with \nhim on, that the real problem here ultimately is that the Federal \nGovernment has become so powerful now that everybody comes running to \nthe Federal Government to seek special benefits because the Government \ncan grant those benefits. It becomes very valuable after a while, so \npeople decide they want to spend money influencing governmental policy.\n  In the abstract that is fine. We understand that is the way it is in \na democracy, and there is nothing wrong with spending money to \ninfluence Government policy. But when you have a lot of money and you \ncan influence the Federal Government to make people buy something that \nyou have to sell that you could not sell to them otherwise, that is \nwrong. It is an abuse of power. Frankly, it is something that we as \nSenators should not countenance.\n  We should say to those people: Look, go develop a product that can \nsell. We have already given you a big tax break. If you can't sell it \nbased upon that and you can't convince the State utility commissions or \nGovernors or legislators to mandate a particular level of renewable \nenergy resource in your own State, don't come to the Federal Government \nand ask us to do your work for you by forcing everybody to buy your \nproduct.\n\n  That is wrong. That is what creates the problem with the campaign \nfinance issue--we make the Government so powerful that it can make or \nbreak businesses and therefore they all come rushing to us to get us to \nchange Federal policy and to use it as a hammer rather than as an \ninducement.\n  I hope my colleagues will be able to answer these questions when they \nvote and that they will conclude we are really better off at this point \nin our history saying: We are not ready for an absolute Federal \nmandate. It is better to let the States decide this. With the \nencouragement that we provide through the tax incentives, we will see \nwhat kind of progress we can make toward the goal that we want. Then we\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nwill reevaluate it to see if we really want to impose something on the \nAmerican purchaser of electricity.\n  As I said before, we have to be very careful about mandating the use \nof unreliable energy sources. The renewables, with all due respect to \nthose who think they are the great wave of the future, renewables \nprovide some capacity for diversification, some ability to produce \npower in the future, but they should not be considered a good idea for \nbaseload or for any significant portion of power requirements as a \nmandate because they are simply not that reliable.\n  I hope colleagues will consider supporting the Kyl amendment, and, as \na result of that, it will eliminate the underlying Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request, that \namendment No. 3023 be modified with the language that is at the desk. \nThis modification is technical in nature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3023), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To expand the eligibility to receive biodiesel credits and to \n   require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a study on alternative \n                 fueled vehicles and alternative fuels)\n\n       On page 185, strike lines 9 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 817.

Mr. President, I know my colleague from Nevada is here \nto speak on this amendment, so I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2064-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2064-S2069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2356\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I would \nlike to propound to the Senate. I see my friend from Kentucky, who has \nspent so much time allowing us to arrive at this point. I hope we can \nwork this out for everyone's benefit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. tomorrow, that \nis Wednesday, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2356, the \ncampaign finance reform bill, with the time until 1 p.m. equally \ndivided between the leaders or their designees prior to the vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture, with the mandatory live quorum under rule \nXXII being waived; further that, if cloture is invoked, there be an \nadditional 3 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nvote on passage of the act with no amendments or motions in order, with \nno intervening action or debate; further, if cloture is not invoked \nthis agreement is vitiated.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately after final passage \nof the bill, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a \nSenate resolution, the text of which is at the desk, and that the \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I am not going to \nobject, I say, once again, that what is missing from this consent \nagreement is a technical corrections package which Senator McCain, \nSenator Feingold, and I have agreed to. This is the first time in the \nhistory of this debate, over all of these years, that the three of us \nhave actually agreed to something.\n  Regrettably, it has now been objected to by someone else on that side \nof the aisle. I say to my friend, the assistant majority leader, I hope \nat sometime during the course of the day tomorrow we can get that \nobjection cleared up and hopefully Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, \nand I will offer a unanimous consent agreement tomorrow related to this \ntechnical package which the three of us have agreed to and hopefully we \ncan work out some way tomorrow to clear that as well.\n  But I have no objection to this package as far as it goes. The only \ncaveat I issue is that we hope to be able to achieve yet another \nconsent agreement tomorrow, to move a technical package out of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Kentucky \nfor his work on this issue. It has been a very difficult thing for him, \nbut he has persevered and we have gotten to the point where we are now \nand look forward to trying to work on the other problem that he \nmentioned today.\n  I will be very brief. I know the hour is late. I say to the \nRepublican manager of this legislation that at such time as the Senate \ngets back on this legislation, the first thing that will be done is \nmove to table this Kyl amendment. I explained that to the floor staff. \nI have explained that to Senator Kyl. But we thought, rather than doing \nthat today--we had the right to do that earlier today--that there was \ninterest in this. Even though we had the right to do that, we wanted to \nmake sure everyone had an opportunity to speak on this. People can \nspeak as long as they want on this tonight.\n\n  But I do say that as soon as we get back to this legislation, unless \nthere is some kind of an agreement that we will vote on this motion \nwhere we would have 10 minutes equally divided or 20 minutes equally \ndivided, something reasonable, the majority leader will seek \nrecognition to move to table because we have spent enough time on \nrenewables.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3038\n\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly we need to diversify the Nation's \nenergy supply by stimulating the growth of renewable energy.\n  America's abundant and untapped renewable resources are essential for \nthe energy security of the United States, for the protection of our \nenvironment, and for the health of the American people.\n  We should harness the brilliance of the Sun, the strength of the \nwind, and the heat of the Earth to provide clean, renewable energy for \nour Nation.\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment by Senator Kyl to strike \nprovisions in this important legislation that would establish a \nrenewable portfolio standard. The prospect of passing an energy bill \nwithout a renewable portfolio standard, to me, is embarrassing. It \nshould be, I would think, to the country.\n  We have already told the automobile industry to build the cars as big \nas they want, using as much gas as they want. We are not going to \nincrease fuel efficiency standards. So I think we can at least go this \nstep further.\n  In the United States today, we get less than 3 percent of our \nelectricity from renewable energy sources about which I have spoken--\nwind, Sun, geothermal, and biomass--but the potential is much greater.\n  This visual aid in the Chamber says it all.\n  In Nevada, we have great resources for geothermal. If you look on the \nmap, you'll see that we also have wind all over the State. As the \nSenator from Alaska has heard me say, Nevada is the most mountainous \nState in the Union, except for Alaska. We have over 300 mountain \nranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. By Alaska \nstandards, I guess that is not very high. We have one mountain that is \n14,000 feet high. By most standards, Nevada is a pretty mountainous \npart of the world.\n  In many of those areas we already have people who are beginning the \ndevelopment of wind farms, especially with the production tax credit \nthat was passed for wind energy as part of the economic stimulus \npackage. So, the credit for wind energy has been renewed, which is \ngood. There is a 260-megawatt wind farm being constructed at the Nevada \ntest site, as we speak. So there really are a lot of resources in \nNevada and around America for this alternative energy.\n  My friend, who I have the greatest respect for, the junior Senator \nfrom Arizona, has talked a lot about the cost in dollars of renewable \nenergy. It reminds me that many years ago there was a company called \nthe Luz Company, which was in Eldorado Valley, near Boulder City, NV. \nIn this big valley, they wanted to build a big solar energy plant--\nabout 400 megawatts.\n  They went to the Nevada Public Service Commission, and they were \nturned down. Why? Because, in effect at that time there was a law and a \nregulation by the utilities commission saying that you had to have \npower produced that was the cheapest. Solar was not the cheapest in \nactual dollars. But it is cheaper in many ways when it comes to \nproviding clean air for my children and grandchildren who live in Las \nVegas.\n  What has happened? In that valley today they have natural gas plants. \nThey are clean, but they are not as clean as solar energy. I think it \nwould have been wonderful to build that solar facility. The cost is not \nalways the dollars it takes to build a power plant. The cost is other \nthings including environmental and health effects. What does it do to \nfoul the air? What does it do to people's health? What does it do to \nthe environment?\n  That is why we need more alternative energy. It is more than just the \ncost that we see in dollars and cents that you can add up when you \nbuild a plant. It is the dollars and cents in people's health, people's \ncomfort.\n  Eldorado Valley used to be as clear as the complexion of a newborn \nbaby. Not anymore. So the potential for renewable energy in real terms \nis significant.\n  Senator Dorgan from North Dakota has talked about wind. The ``Saudi \nArabia in America for wind'' is North Dakota. The ``Saudi Arabia in \nAmerica for geothermal'' is Nevada. We need to change what we have been \ndoing in the past and diversify the Nation's energy supply.\n  My State could use geothermal energy to meet one-third of its \nelectricity needs--a State which will soon have 2.5 million people--but \ntoday this source of energy only supplies about 2\\1/2\\ percent of the \nelectricity needs in Nevada.\n  I have said before that I remember the first time I drove from Reno \nto Carson City. I saw this steam coming out of the ground. I thought, \nwhat is that? I had never seen anything like that. It was heat coming \nfrom the depths of the Earth. Every puff that came out of the ground \nwas wasted energy. We need to harness that steam energy and produce \nelectricity.\n  Other nations are doing better than we are doing. We started out \ndoing great, but now we are falling behind. They are using a lot of \nequipment that we have developed. We need to stimulate the growth of \nrenewable energy and become a world leader.\n  Drawing energy from a diversity of sources will protect consumers \nfrom energy price shocks and protect the environment from highly \npolluting fossil fuel plants.\n  Fourteen States have already enacted a renewable portfolio standard, \nincluding Nevada, which has the most aggressive standard in the Nation.\n  I hope the Senate will be willing to establish a national portfolio \nstandard with achievable goals. I support Senator Bingaman, but I think \nhis goal of 10 percent is too low. I supported Senator Jeffords' \namendment. I think we should go for 20 percent.\n  In Nevada, we are going to require 15 percent of the State's \nelectricity needs be met by renewable energy by the year 2013. That is \npretty quick.\n  We must diversify the Nation's energy supply by stimulating the \ngrowth of renewable energy. This is essential to the energy security of \nthe United States, the protection of the environment, and the health of \nthe American people.\n  My friend from Arizona, the junior Senator, has stated that \nrenewables are more expensive than conventional power sources, \nincluding nuclear. But I would just mention in passing, no electric \nutility of which I am aware--I could be wrong--has ever declared \nbankruptcy because of investments in renewable energy. But I do know \nthat El Paso Electric, on the other hand, was driven into bankruptcy by \nits investment in the Palo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona.\n  I think we need to be aware of the volatile nature of the supplies \nand price of natural gas. There have been charts shown earlier today \nwhere you see the amount of natural gas that is going to be used in the \nfuture.\n\n  From 1970 up until 2020, natural gas is just going up in consumption, \nbut the price variables during that period of time, because of supply \nand demand, have been really like a teeter-totter. With renewables, you \ndo not have that. You have price stability.\n  I am a big fan of coal. We have a lot of resources in America for \ncoal. But I am for clean coal technology. We should be spending more, \nnot less, money on clean coal technology. In the United States, we have \nmore coal than the rest of the world. We need to figure out a way to \nuse coal that burns clean. We have not done a real good job on that. We \nhave made progress, but we need to do more.\n  I hope we defeat the Kyl amendment. I cannot imagine an energy bill \nthat has no renewable energy in it. I heard people get on the floor and \nsay: Well, we have to look at this State by State. Some States are more \nable to produce alternative or renewable energy. That is probably true, \nbut remember, we are not saying, in this legislation, it has to be \nState by State. We are saying utilities have to do that. As we know, we \nhave excluded co-ops and a lot of the smaller producers.\n  But there is no reason in the world these big utilities should not \nuse renewables for part of their portfolio. That is what we are saying. \nIt is not a State by State issue; it is a utility by utility issue.\n  I hope we resoundingly defeat the Kyl amendment. If there were ever \nan amendment that deserves defeat, it is the Kyl amendment. We need to \nencourage the growth and development of renewable energy resources in \nour great country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \ngood friend, the majority whip, and I am certainly fascinated by the \nexample he has given with regard to geothermal.\n  Geothermal has a tremendous potential in certain parts of the United \nStates. One of the problems, however, is that a lot of our geothermal \nis adjacent to or in national parks. Clearly, there is a tradeoff there \nas to whether or not we want to develop that. But in many cases, \nparticularly out in California, there has been enough public\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\npressure to suggest that this natural phenomena should remain \nuntouched. As a consequence, to a large degree the potential has not \nbeen realized to the extent it might have.\n\n  I am also inclined to question the tactics and the strategy of the \nDemocratic side relative to the announcement that the amendment is \ngoing to be tabled. That sounds like a fishing expedition to me. They \nare going to make a determination of just where the votes are, and it \nmight make it easier for some Members to simply justify their vote by \nsaying, well, we tabled it. That doesn't really mean that we have a \nposition one way or another on it.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Without losing the floor, I will.\n  Mr. REID. Of course. We would be happy if Senator Kyl and/or the \nSenator from Alaska wanted to have an up-or-down vote. We would agree \nto that also.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. All I know is that I was advised that the majority had \nmade the decision to table it. I was not aware that the minority had \nmade the decision. I can only comment on what I have heard. In any \nevent, I would certainly honor the statement by the whip, as well as \nSenator Kyl, as to just how this is disposed of. But if indeed the \ncommitment and the agreement is that we will have a tabling motion, it \nappears we will have a tabling motion.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues, that kind of determination, in my \nopinion, is a bit of a finesse. There is other terminology I could use. \nMembers have different ways of justifying tabling motions. We are all \nquite aware of it. I would prefer to see an up-or-down vote.\n  We have had a good debate on this issue. Some of the things, however, \nthat I think we have overlooked are, this isn't the first time we have \ncome up with renewables in this country or discussed it or debated it \nor argued the merits. Clearly, there is a tremendous merit to \nrenewables. But the question is, How fast and how far can we move?\n  I am told that about 4 percent of our entire energy mix comes from \nrenewables. That includes hydro. Two percent of our electricity is \ngenerated from renewables. That is significant as well. But, clearly, \nwhen you understand we have spent some $6.5 to $7 billion investing in \nrenewables, in tax credits, in subsidies, in loans, I am sure it is \nwell spent, but we have had a reasonable concentration.\n  So as we look at the mix now and say, here we are going to have a \nmandate, a 10-percent mandate, we ought to look at just what the cost \nof this is and how significant it is going to be, what effect it is \ngoing to have on the economy. I know that is what Senator Kyl has been \ncommenting on for some time.\n  First, I would like to address a couple of statements made in this \ndebate. One is that the U.S. is too dependent on coal and natural gas. \nI would be happy to be corrected, but I believe that was the statement \nmade by the chairman. We can do something about that if we wish. We \ncould concentrate on nuclear energy. I don't see any great support for \nnuclear energy in this package, even though it is clean and the \nconsequences of any air quality emissions are nonexistent. We have a \nproblem with the waste, but everything seems to have a tradeoff.\n  Certainly, we could go to my State and open up ANWR. That would \naddress dependence on coal and natural gas.\n  But we have to recognize the role of coal in this country. The United \nStates is the Saudi Arabia of coal. U.S. coal, for all practical \npurposes, is never going to run out. The question is the technology of \ncleaning up the coal.\n  I notice a good deal of attention has been given to the chart of the \nmajority. That chart was rather interesting because it proposed \nbiomass. Let's not make any mistake; I don't think a lot of people know \nwhat biomass is.\n  Biomass is primarily wood waste. What do you do with wood waste? You \nburn it. And when you burn it, you generate heat. The heat generates, \nin the process of generating in a boiler, steam. The steam goes into a \nturbine, and it generates electricity.\n  But is it magic? No, it has tremendous emissions. I know in my State, \na few small sawmills that, by the Environmental Protection Agency, have \nbeen mandated to burn their waste. They have to use so darn much fuel \noil to get it hot enough to burn that the economics are out the window.\n  Another thing that I can't understand why the majority doesn't face \nup to is the provision in here that says you can't use any wood waste \nfrom public land. What does that mean?\n  In my opinion, that is another finesse. I have another word for it, \nbut I shall refrain. It simply is in response to America's \nenvironmental community. It doesn't want any timber harvesting in the \nnational forests, which is where the public lands are. It says you \ncan't, in your biomass mix, use anything from the national forests \nother than residue that has come from thinning. In other words, you can \nhave a mill that has a timber sale in the forest, and they have mill \nends, they have bark, they have sawdust. In this legislation, you can't \nuse it.\n  That is not a practical way. The specific reading deserves to go into \nthe Record. These are the things that are wrong with this particular \nbill. That is why I think it is so important to recognize the \ncontribution of the Kyl amendment. We will pick that up in a minute.\n  Nevertheless, it is a crass inconsistency. Good heavens, what \ndifference does it make? Waste is waste. If you have cut a tree from a \nnational forest legitimately, you could make lumber out of it, but you \ncan't use the residue for biomass. The issue here is obvious to those \nof us out West. This is to discourage harvesting in the national \nforests.\n  What are you going to do in my State of Alaska? I don't have any \nnonpublic timber. We have two forests. We would have to, under this \nlegislation, go out and buy credits. We couldn't make biomass because \nall our timber, all our sawdust, all our mill ends come from those \nforests. Let's get realistic.\n  I will have to offer an amendment, and I am prepared to do it.\n  Let me read what it says here. This is on page 6:\n\n       With respect to material removed from the national forest \n     system lands, the term ``biomass'' means fuel and biomass \n     accumulation from precommercial thinning, slash and burn.\n\n  That is the limitation. You can't use the residue from a commercial \ntree that you take out of the forest.\n  That is inconsistent with the utilization of the product. What are \nyou supposed to do, waste it? Save this and waste that?\n  The chart wasn't ours, but it was an interesting chart because it \nshowed biomass. And, again, biomass is not the magic it is cracked up \nto be because you have to burn it. To burn it, you have emissions. \nBecause of emissions, you have to address air pollution. Air pollution \nmeans technology. Technology means cost. Don't think you are going to \nget a free ride with biomass.\n  Solar works great in Arizona and New Mexico, the Southern States. It \ndoesn't work in Barrow, AK. We have a long dark winter where the sun \nnever rises above the horizon for about 3 months. Solar has an \napplication, I grant you. I don't belittle it. But nevertheless, the \nfootprint is pretty broad. You would have to cover several States with \nsolar panels to equal what I can produce from ANWR in 2000 acres. I can \nproduce 1 million barrels a day, and it would take somewhere in the \narea of two-thirds, three-quarters of the entire State of Rhode Island.\n  We had some discussion earlier today relative to wind generation. \nWind generation has an application. I think one of the tremendous \napplication of wind generation is using it to fill dams. In other \nwords, the technology is relatively simple because when the wind blows, \nthe wind powers electric pumps or generators that pump water from a \nlower area to an upper area. And then you have the fall into the \nturbines and you can generate. There is a lot of thought that says that \nsome areas near saltwater, where you have canyons and so forth, you \ncould theoretically dam up a little inlet where you have wind, and you \ncould have the wind generating power for the pumps. And then you pump \nthe saltwater up and run it through the generator. You are really \npicking up something if that is the kind of technology you are talking \nabout. But make no mistake, there is a footprint.\n  This chart shows San Jacinto, CA, between Banning and Palm Springs. I\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nhave driven through there many times. If you look at it, it is rather \nastounding because you see literally hundreds of these windmills. And \nsome of them are turning; some are not. Sometimes they have technical \nproblems because the wind pitch and velocity is such that it can tear \nup the transmissions.\n  We have some in a few areas of Alaska where they actually have brakes \non the ends of the blades. It has a tendency to brake itself rather \nthan tear the transmissions up or to get ice on them, and so forth.\n  But the point I want to make here is that this is about 2,000 acres \nof a wind-generating area that is committed to the placement of the \nwind generators and the towers, and that equates to making about 1,815 \nbarrels of oil. So the footprint there, 2,000 acres, equates to 1,815 \nbarrels of oil in an equivalent energy Btu comparison. Yet 2,000 acres \nof our area, in ANWR, will produce a million barrels of oil. So there \nis a tradeoff. So we have solar, and we have wind, and we have biomass. \nThey are all meaningful, they all make a contribution, but they have a \ncertain cost to them. Now, there is either biomass, wind, solar, \ngeothermal--I mentioned geothermal and a good portion of those, \nunfortunately, are in or adjacent to our parks.\n  Another point made earlier in the debate is that this is not a State \npreemption. It really is a State preemption, Mr. President. It preempts \nthose States that have decided that a renewables portfolio standard is \nnot in the consumers' interests. There are 14 now that have come in \nvoluntarily. But this legislation would mandate that all States achieve \nit.\n  Let's take the State of Michigan, for example. What is in it for \nMichigan? I am not from Michigan. I can't speak about it, other than to \nshare some observations that the staff has made. But we have some wind \nin Michigan; some solar; not much hydro potential; biomass--I suppose \nthere is some; geothermal, very little. But they clearly don't have a \nsignificant segment of one of these alternatives available. So what are \nthey going to do? Well, probably buy credits.\n  Another thing that came out of the debate that is wrong with this \nlegislation is there is nothing to prohibit. The Three Gorges dam on \nthe Yangtze River in China, which is about completed--but they are \nputting in turbines now, and so forth--it is my understanding that \nwould qualify for credits. That is a pretty big project--one of the \nlargest hydroprojects ever undertaken in the history of the world. Are \nwe going to see a situation where utilities are going to be allowed to \ngo buy credits? There is nothing in the legislation to prohibit it.\n  That isn't the intent. The intent is to encourage the development of \nrenewables.\n  That is another thing wrong with this legislation. I am sure this can \nbe corrected; nevertheless, it suggests that we have left an open door \nin this concept of buying credits.\n  Another point that was brought up in the debate is the issue of \ntransferring wealth from one part of the United States to another. It \nis fair to say that the State of California, with a large population, \ndynamic economy, depends on energy coming from the outside. They would \nrather buy energy than develop their own. We saw that last year in the \ncrisis in California. We have seen it time and time again. My good \nfriends from Louisiana have indicated that they get a little tired of \nthis ``not in my backyard'' business. Louisiana is developing oil and \ngas offshore. They are subject to the impact of that on their school \nsystems, roads, and so forth. Do they get anything extra? No. The OCS \ngoes into the Federal Government fund. Yet they are generating this for \nthe benefit of other States.\n  So it is not fair, necessarily, to consider this transfer of wealth \nfrom one part of the United States to another. In other words, those \nareas that have the potential of generating biomass from either solar \nor wind are not going to have to buy credits. Others that don't have \nthis availability are going to have to do so. I suggest to you this is \nnot necessarily equitable.\n  There are other examples that I think deserve a little examination; \nthat is, under this mandate, each electric utility, other than public \npower--and why is that, Mr. President? We have investor-owned power and \nwe have public power. But we make a distinction here. We do the mandate \non every electric utility other than public power. What is the politics \nof that? I don't know, Mr. President, but I know public power opposes \nit, and they have prevailed. They don't have to maintain a mandate. You \nare a businessman, Mr. President, and so am I. What does this mean?\n  This means that investor-owned power companies are not necessarily \ngoing to have the same comparative cost mechanism because investor-\nowned companies are going to have to go out and buy credits or put an \ninvestment in renewables.\n  Does that mean public power can increase their rates a little bit to \ncoincide within investor-owned? Who pays that, and is that kind of a \nwindfall profit? I don't know, but I think every Member who is going to \nvote on this ought to be able to go home and explain this because it is \nnot equitable. Power produced by investor-owned and by public power--\nthey both do a good job, but why are we excluding one? It is because of \nthe politics. They don't want it. I would like to hear the debate from \nthe other side, but I see they have adjourned for the evening--at least \non that side of the aisle. I would like to hear an explanation of that.\n  So what we have here is each electric utility other than public power \nmust have one renewable credit for the required percentage of its \nretail sales. That starts at 1 percent and increases to 10 percent in \nthe year 2020. Who are we exempting, Mr. President? We are exempting \nBonneville, which you heard of, out West, and TVA, WAPPA, which are \nsignificant power groups in their own right, entitled to the process; \nnevertheless, the public and we should question this.\n  To obtain a credit, a utility can, one, count its existing wind, \nsolar, geothermal, or biomass, but not hydro. Well, I have been \nchairman of the committee, and I have been ranking, and how they can \nconclude that hydro is nonrenewable is beyond me. But I have made my \ncase. It looks as if they have put this in here so it will fit. That is \nwhat is wrong.\n  This legislation has been shopped on the other side to the point \nwhere it has accommodated virtually every special interest group. That \nis what is wrong with it. It never had the process that normally takes \nplace around here, and that is the committee process, where the \nlegislation is developed within the committee, the bill is introduced, \nreferred to the committee, hearings held and markups and so forth. We \nknow the history. But it is beyond me that the media has not picked up \non the injustice of that.\n  The majority leader obstructed the committee of jurisdiction --Energy \nand Natural Resources--to do this. He said it was too contentious. He \npulled it away from the chairman. Here we are on the floor of the \nSenate at 7:10 enlightening one another as to what is in the \nlegislation. That should have been done in the committee process. It \nwas not and that is a tragedy.\n  It is kind of interesting, to make a parallel--I will not make an \nissue of this, but what is good for the goose is good for the gander. \nSomebody made an observation of that nature, where we had the majority \nleader, in the Pickering nomination, on a question relative to sending \nthe matter directly to the floor, taking it up, and resolving it on the \nfloor. Oh, no, we had to observe the traditional process of the \ncommittee jurisdiction. I don't know why it is not good enough for the \nEnergy Committee, but it certainly applies in the case of Judge \nPickering. I don't want to go down too many rabbit trails this evening, \nbut I wanted to point out an inconsistency.\n  As I have indicated, to obtain a credit, a utility can count existing \nwind, solar, geothermal, and biomass, but not hydro.\n  It can build a new renewable powerplant or purchase the credit from \nanother new renewable powerplant or purchase the credit from the \nSecretary of Energy. Is the Secretary of Energy going to be selling \nthese credits? Is that revenue to the Federal Government? What is it \nworth? What is it going to cost?\n  My understanding is the average cost of electricity is about 3 cents \nper kilowatt hour. You are going to have to pay something for these \ncredits. I am told it may be another 3 cents. So that\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nis 6 cents. That is going to be passed on to the consumer, Mr. \nPresident. Public power is not going to pay it, just investor-owned \ncompanies. Isn't there some kind of subsidy, tax credit, associated \nwith this of about 1.7 cents?\n  We are now taking power that usually goes to the consumer, about 3 \ncents, and that consumer is now going to be paying about 7.5 cents. Is \nanybody concerned about that? I do not see a lot of concern. Evidently \nthe public is just willing to pay from the investor-owned business only \nan increase from 3 cents to 7.5 cents. Think about that: Every Member \nand staff who is watching, you had better be prepared to explain that \nto your ratepayers and your consumers. That is the price you are paying \nfor this mandate.\n  In the early years of the renewable portfolio program, there will be \nfew tradeable credits because only new facilities produce credits for \nsale. The renewable credit would be, as I said, about 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour through the wholesale market price of power. This is on \ntop of the 1.7 per kilowatt hour renewable tax credit. That \nsubstantiates what I said.\n  Let's talk about a few key States.\n  West Virginia: American Electric Power serves the bulk of West \nVirginia. Ninety-seven percent of the American Electric Power \nGeneration is from coal. A smaller portion is from natural gas and \nnuclear, and eight-tenths of 1 percent is hydro. We are told that \nAmerican Electric Power could not meet the renewable portfolio standard \nthrough existing renewable generation. They would have two choices: \nBuild new renewable powerplants or purchase credit.\n  New York: Consolidated Edison serves New York City. Con Ed has \ndisposed of most of its generation, as we know, and now purchases 95 \npercent of its electricity. All of its remaining generation is gas \nfired and located within the city of New York. Con Ed could not build \nrenewables production in New York City to satisfy its renewable \nportfolio requirement. It would have to purchase credits to satisfy the \nrenewable portfolio standard requirement. They simply cannot do it in \nNew York. They acknowledge that.\n  Arkansas: Arkansas is served by Entergy. It is 98 percent natural \ngas, nuclear, and coal, and only 2 percent hydro or wind. It would not \nmeet its RPS--renewable portfolio standard--requirement through \nexisting wind generation. It would have to purchase credits to satisfy \nthe RPS requirement.\n  Illinois: Exelon serves most of Illinois, including Chicago. It is 88 \npercent nuclear, coal, and natural gas, and 8 percent hydro. They would \nhave to build renewables or purchase credits to meet the RPS \nrequirement.\n  What are they going to do? Are they going to purchase them or build \nthem? They are going to make a business decision, and the business \ndecision is going to be made on the quickest return on investment. That \nis what you make business decisions on--the least risk and the highest \nreturn. Are they going to build renewables or buy? It depends on the \nmix.\n  I do not think we have really reflected because the other side is so \nanxious to salvage something in this energy bill. This energy bill can \nonly be salvaged by good amendments because it was a bad bill to start \nwith. It has been improved dramatically. I support the continued \nprocess, but the continued process toward a good bill can only be \nresolved by amendments.\n  The Kyl amendment is not a vote against renewables; it is a vote for \nStates, it is a vote for consumers, and it is a vote for the freedom to \nchoose.\n  This is not in the House bill. What is going to happen when it goes \nover to the House for conference? There is nothing in the House bill. \nWe all have a little idea what the House is going to do.\n  The Bingaman amendment, in my opinion, subsidizes renewables at the \nexpense of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. What does that mean? \nTo me that is a Btu tax, British thermal unit tax. It was the first \nlegislation introduced by former President Clinton when he first took \noffice, looking for revenues: We are going to put on a Btu tax.\n  Do my colleagues know what happened? He was defeated because the \npublic said: This country is energy rich. We have a broad choice of \nenergy mix. We have coal, we have oil, we have natural gas, we have \nrenewables, we have biomass, and you want to tax us first thing.\n  This is a Btu tax on coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, make no \nmistake about it. Fourteen States have existing programs with different \nfuel mixes, and they would be preempted by this legislation.\n  Senator Kyl's amendment replaces the Bingaman renewable mandate--and \nremember, renewable mandate; we all know what mandate means: you must \ndo it--Senator Kyl's amendment would replace it with a program to \nencourage renewables without preempting the States, without \nmicromanaging the market.\n  What is the matter with the way this market is working? Fourteen \nStates have initiated programs because they believed it was in the \ninterest of their State, the consumers, the air quality, and good \ncitizenship. But, no, we are going to mandate it, and at what cost?\n  The Kyl amendment requires State utility commissioners--and I use the \nwords ``to consider''; it is not a mandate--``to consider the merits of \na green energy program.'' It does not order them to implement one. It \nsays consumers can purchase green power if they want to; they are not \nrequired to. And I guess the utilities can charge them for green power \nif it is higher. There is nothing wrong with that if that is what they \nwant.\n  Over the past 5 years, Congress has provided more than $7 billion in \nsubsidies, tax incentives, and other programs to assist renewables. As \nI said earlier, I support those. That is how we bring on technology. \nBut you do not get a free ride from it. If we do make this mandate the \nlaw, we are going to increase the cost of electricity to the consumer, \nbut only for the investor-owned company, because that is to whom it \napplies. It does not apply to public power. I have yet to get an \nexplanation as to why. We all know why. It is politics. They do not \nwant it. They want to enjoy a differential. Is the public aware of \nthat? Are they aware why one source of power should enjoy the benefits \nand not another?\n  If you happen to have public power providing you with energy, you are \ngoing to break. If you are an investor-owned business, you do not. This \nis not the American way, and people ought to begin to understand this. \nMembers had better be able to explain it when they go home.\n  Now the Bingaman amendment, in my opinion, is not good policy, \nfrankly. I have the greatest fondness for my friend Senator Bingaman, \nbut what it does, it picks winners and losers; it favors types of fuel \nbased on politics, not policy; exempts public power, although there is \nno policy justification.\n  On the other hand, the Kyl amendment points out fundamental \nphilosophical differences between--and we have heard that today--\nDaschle-Bingaman. We really want consumers to choose for themselves. On \nthe other side, they want the Government to choose for the consumer. \nThat is what this Daschle-Bingaman proposal is all about.\n  We want the States to make decisions on the needs of the people. They \nwant the Federal Government in charge. This issue, renewable mandates, \nis opposed by the United Mine Workers, Public Power, Investor Owner \nUtilities, Chamber of Commerce--well, I have an explanation, and I \nappreciate that. I want to make sure the record reflects it because I \nhave been saying that this would benefit Public Power, but I have been \ncorrected by my staff to say that Public Power also is opposed to it.\n  Why is Public Power opposed to it? Because they are fearful it will \nbe lost in committee, and they will in the committee process be also \nincluded in this mandate.\n  The record should reflect my reference to Public Power and the \nclarification.\n  So the renewable mandate is opposed by the Chamber of Commerce, \nUnited Mine Workers, Public Power, Investor Owned Utilities.\n  The fear that Public Power has is they will be exposed in committee \nand have to be subject to this as well.\n  I think all Members should consider the merits of what we are getting \ninto, the precedence we are setting, and the emotional argument \nassociated with: Gee, we have to do something on renewables. We have \nnot been able to respond on CAFE. We have not been able\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nto move in a manner in which we could address even the pickup issue, on \nwhich we had a vote. Let us make sure the legislation we pass is good \nlegislation; that it is well thought out; it is applicable; that it \ndoes something meaningful that is in the appropriate role of government \nto do, as opposed to what I think the States are doing very nicely by \nthemselves. They are proceeding, should they wish, with their own \nrenewable mandate proposal, and that is where I think these types of \ndecisions belong.\n  I think we would all agree as Members of the Senate that one size \ndoes not fit all.\n  With the recognition it is late, I am prepared to yield the floor. I \nbelieve we will be on this bill in the morning. Might I ask the \nPresiding Officer what the order of tomorrow might be again for those \nof us who might not have heard the majority whip?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be a cloture vote tomorrow at 1 \np.m. on campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may ask further, upon the conclusion is there any \norder from the leader as to what we would go to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no special order. The Senate, by \ndefault, will resume consideration of the energy bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3039 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a technical correction to the desk \nwith respect to amendment No. 2917. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nhonor the late Fred Scheffold, a battalion chief with the New York City \nFire Department and one of the many NYC firefighters who so bravely \ngave their lives on September 11, 2001.\n  Today, I had the honor of meeting Fred's widow, Mrs. Joan Scheffold, \nand their daughter, Karen Scheffold-Onorio, at a news conference in the \nMansfield Room of the U.S. Capitol Building. They were here to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Stabenow, Senator Allen, Senator Kyl, \nand me to announce the next steps in the implementation of the Unity in \nthe Spirit of America Act, the USA Act.\n  The USA Act is legislation introduced by Senator Stabenow that \nestablishes a program to name national and community service projects \nin honor of victims killed as a result of the terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11. The measure was signed into law by President Bush in \nJanuary. To recognize the heroism of New York Firefighter Fred \nScheffold, and all the victims of September 11, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the statement of Joan Scheffold be printed in the Record. It is a \nwarm and loving tribute to a heroic husband, father, and American.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Remarks by Mrs. Joan Scheffold, March 19, 2002\n\n       The world lost many treasures on September 11th, and I \n     mourn the loss of my own gem, my husband Fred. Fred's 32 year \n     career with the NYC Fire Department brought him to many \n     corners of New York and on the morning of September 11th, he \n     was just finished his 24 hour tour as a Battalion Chief in \n     East Harlem. When the alarm came in, he rushed to the scene \n     along with the Chief who was relieving him. Like so many \n     others that day, he was not obligated to respond to the alarm \n     but he did so out of the sense of duty and the simple fact \n     that he knew his help and expertise would be needed.\n       But, he was so much more than just a fireman who was lost \n     on September 11th. As an avid runner, skier, and golfer, he \n     inspired our 3 daughters to reach their highest goals and set \n     them higher once again. A talented painter and sculptor, our \n     home and yard are decorated with many of his pieces, \n     including a giant insect made of metal and wood on the front \n     lawn and a front door painted purple. A self-proclaimed \n     ``news junkie'', he read everything that he could get his \n     hands on and could hold an intelligent conversion about any \n     topic. Essentially, he had a lifelong love of learning.\n       He had the unique ability to make you feel like you were \n     the only one of the room when you were talking to him and \n     that what you were saying was the most interesting thing he's \n     heard all day. But he never failed to end the conversation by \n     making you laugh.\n       We mourn the loss of Freddie every single day. He was a \n     magnificent human being and a beautiful soul who will never \n     be forgotten. Fred's memory has been celebrated in many ways \n     including a scholarship fund that has been established at his \n     alma mater in the Bronx and trees that have been planted in \n     his honor. We hope that we can continue to honor his life and \n     the lives of those 3000 others lost on September 11th through \n     projects of the Unity in the Spirit of America Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2069-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2069-S2070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALT LAKE 2002 PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the last 2 weeks of February, the \nworld watched the 2002 Winter Olympic Games held in our home State of \nUtah. The success of these games and the achievement of the competing \nathletes have been recognized as high points in the long Olympic \ntradition. We are all proud of the spectacular athletic accomplishments \nof the participation and support of this outstanding event.\n  Today I rise, as a Senator from the great State of Utah, to call \nattention to and express support for the Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic \nGames which concluded with the closing ceremony this past Saturday.\n  As meaningful and significant as the 2002 Winter Olympic Games have \nbeen, the Paralympic Winter Games, perhaps, elevate that significance, \nfor paralympic athletes must not only excel in athletic skill and \nprowess, but must also accommodate a disabling condition.\n  During the 10 days of the Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic Winter Games, \nworld-class athletes brought together their minds, their bodies, their \nspirits, and their determination to pursue the highest level of \nperformance and commitment.\n  I especially want to recognize the fantastic achievements of our \nathletes from Utah. Steve Cook showed incredible speed and skill \nearning four silver medals in cross country skiing events--the 5K, the \n10K, as an anchor on the relay, and the biathlon.\n  No less exceptional was Muffy Davis who was awarded three silver \nmedals in alpine skiing. Her performances were stellar.\n  Lacey Heward excelled in both the Super G and the Giant Slalom, \nwinning bronze medals in both events.\n  Also winning two bronze medals was Christopher Waddell in the Giant \nSlalom and downhill skiing event. Christopher also captured a silver \nmedal in alpine skiing.\n  Monte Meier, through strength and courage won a silver medal in \nalpine skiing. Our alpine skiing is exceptional in Utah.\n  Stephani Victor earned a bronze in the downhill skiing through her \ngreat diligence and prowess.\n  No less outstanding is the participation of Daniel Metivier and Keith \nBarney, who also gave their all in these games. The stellar achievement \nof our Utah athletes has been magnificent. I am so proud of their \nexcellence.\n  While it is fitting that the U.S. Senate express recognition and \npraise to these outstanding athletes, I cannot forget to applaud their \ndedicated coaches, trainers, and families. These individuals provide \nthe needed unconditional support for the athletes. Though they stand in \nthe background, they are no less deserving of Olympic glory.\n  I compliment the U.S. Olympic Committee, which is designated as the \nNational Paralympic Organization. Under\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nthe direction of President Sandy Baldwin and Chief Executive Officer \nLloyd Ward, the U.S. Olympic Committee has offered their incredible \nsupport for these games.\n  I also pay tribute to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, SLOC, for \ntaking the challenge to improve on the success of the Utah Winter \nOlympics by organizing and carrying out the 2002 Paralympic Winter \nGames. Nancy Gonsalves, who has been at the head of this venture for \nthe Salt Lake Organizing Committee, is to be commended.\n  My colleagues might be interested to learn that this was the first \ntime the Paralympic Winter Games have been held in the United States. \nIt was also the first time a local organizing committee assumed the \nresponsibility for the organization, acquiring of sponsors, and staging \nof the games. The contributions of the sponsors, the volunteers, and \nSLOC were essential to the success of the Salt Lake 2002 Winter \nParalympic Games. The commitment of the people in Salt Lake City and \nthe great state of Utah deserve our appreciation and recognition.\n  In addition, I wish to give special recognition to the national media \nfor the attention they gave to the Paralympic Winter Games. The purpose \nof the 2002 Paralympic Winter Games, the events, and the individual \nstories of the athletes were covered more extensively by the national \nand international media than in any previous Paralympic games. This \ncoverage suggests that we, as a society, not only recognize outstanding \nphysical performance requiring concentration, dedication, and \ndiscipline, but, in addition, we recognize the challenges that must be \naccommodated by people with disabilities. These Paralympic Games proved \nthat there is no limit to what an individual can accomplish.\n  The Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic Winter Games enriched the lives of \nthousands of people with disabilities and their families. Even more \nimportant, they enriched the lives of those of us fortunate enough to \nlive free of disability. I wish to commend the dedication and \ncommitment of the athletes, their families, their trainers, the Salt \nLake Organizing Committee, and the citizens of the great State of Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nUtah in recognizing the outstanding success of the Salt Lake 2002 \nParalympic Winter Games. Ten days after the conclusion of the Winter \nOlympic Games, another group of elite athletes from around the world \ngathered in Salt Lake City to push the limits of physical achievement. \nThese athletes, along with their coaches, trainers, families, and many \nvolunteers, made the 2002 Paralympic Winter Games a remarkable 10-day \nevent.\n  The paralympic movement began in 1948, when Sir Ludwig Guttmann \norganized a sports competition for World War II veterans with spinal \ncord injuries in Stoke Mandeville, England. From that small beginning \ncame what we now know as the Paralympic Games, which have grown \ndramatically in recent years. The Salt Lake games were the eighth \nofficial Paralympic Winter Games, with over 1,000 world class athletes \nfrom 36 countries competing in 100 medal events.\n  While the athletes at the Paralympic Games all have some form of \ndisability, the level of competition is no less intense. Because the \ngames emphasize the participants' athletic achievements rather than \ntheir disabilities, spectators quickly forget that these athletes face \nspecial challenges and instead focus on the thrill of competition.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments of my State during the past 2 \nmonths. The Paralympic Games were an outstanding partner to the Olympic \nGames. I congratulate everyone involved, especially the athletes, who \nshowed us that with dedication and commitment, no obstacle is too great \nto overcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2070-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 8, \n2002, in Missoula, MT. A lesbian couple and their 22-month-old son were \nvictims of an arson attack. An intruder broke into their home, poured \naccelerant throughout, and set it on fire while the victims slept. The \nattack came 4 days after the couple received statewide publicity for \nsuing their employer for same-sex domestic partner benefits.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2070-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2070-S2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            SORROW TO SOLACE\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I decided that the Congressional \nRecord should use the same heading, ``Sorrow To Solace,'' on what I am \nabout to say to the Senate as the Raleigh (N.E.) News and Observer used \non its heart-rending story on March 12 about Christelle Geisler.\n  Who is Christelle Geisler? For openers, she is a charming student at \nRaleigh Meredith College whose home is in Hickory, NC, in the western \npart of my State. But that does not tell the real story about \nChristelle, so let me begin at the beginning of my brief relationship \nwith her a few days ago.\n  James Humes was waiting for me when I arrived at my Senate office in \nthe Dirksen Building. In the hallway were a number of other visitors. \nJames Humes is well known and highly respected in this city. He looks \nlike Winston Churchill, he walks like Winston Churchill, he sounds like \nWinston Churchill. He served a stint as speech writer for a President \nof the United States; he is a well-known and highly respected author, \nhis most recent book bearing the title, ``Eisenhower and Churchill,'' \nwith a subtitle reading, ``The Partnership That Saved The World.''\n  Jamie Humes and I met Christelle Geisler at the same moment. \nChristelle giggled quietly in appreciation of Jamie Humes' imitation of \nChurchill. The three of us had our picture taken together; then Jamie \ndeparted with her appealing smile and her good manners. I recall being \ndisappointed that she could not stay longer.\n  An hour or so later I found a portion of The News and Observer's \nMarch 12th story about Christelle. It began with the three-word heading \nI asked to appear at the top of these remarks in the Senate this \nmorning. The subhead: ``A Girl Scout uses what she learned from grief \nto help other teens''.\n  It is touching story about how Christelle having written a brochure \ndesigned to help other teenagers cope with grief. Catawba County, \nChristelle's home county, has distributed hundreds of copies of the \nbrochure.\n  At this point, allow me to ask to print in the Record the News and \nObserver story, written by Kelly Starling, to finish the heart-warming \nstory about a young lady who has been honored by the Girl Scouts of \nAmerica because she wanted to help others in their time of grief.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Raleigh News and Observer, Mar. 12, 2002]\n\n                            Sorrow to Solace\n\n\n   A GIRL SCOUT USES WHAT SHE LEARNED FROM GRIEF TO HELP OTHER TEENS\n\n                          (By Kelly Starling)\n\n       At the sound of the front door closing, her ears always \n     perked up. She listened for the rap of a briefcase hitting \n     the wood floor. Then the patter of shoes that meant Daddy was \n     home. Christelle Geisler would dart from her bedroom, speed \n     down two flights of stairs and into his arms. He kissed her \n     and his two younger daughters. Then he gave the gifts: a \n     coral necklace from the Philippines or dolls from Indonesia, \n     a Japanese kimono.\n       She was dad's girl.\n       Phillippe Geisler traveled a lot, looking for new \n     merchandise for his furniture store. He journeyed to foreign \n     countries searching, and attended North Carolina furniture \n     shows. Home in Hickory, Christelle was his buddy. She filed \n     papers at his office. They played tennis. He teased her about \n     practicing violin.\n       He was on a business trip in Florida one July night when \n     the doorbell rang.\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n     Christelle, then 15, turned away from ``Law and Order,'' got \n     up and squinted through the peephole. Two policemen stood on \n     her porch. They asked for her mother, then ushered her\n     to another room: There had been a car accident, they \n     explained. Police suspected that . . .\n       Christelle, who had been listening by the open door, \n     howled.\n       ``I don't think I've screamed so loud in my life,'' \n     Christelle said. ``It was just raw emotion.''\n       She recalled that three-year-old memory last week sitting \n     on a wooden bench across from the chapel at Meredith College, \n     where she is a freshman. Gazing at the pond, Christelle wore \n     a distant look. Grief is hard for adults to manage. But when \n     you're a teenager, she said, the voyage can be even lonelier. \n     Everyone thinks they know what you're feeling. There are few \n     resources to help you cope.\n       The night she learned of her father's crash, Christelle \n     walked around like a zombie, she said. When her boyfriend, \n     Brian Giovannini, called later that night, she was crying.\n       ``She was always daddy's little girl,'' he said. ``She went \n     to him for strength, for advice. When something came up in \n     her life, he was the first person she talked to.''\n       That night, Christelle slept with her mother, Marie-Alix, \n     in bed. Her baby sister, Margot, who would turn 2 in the \n     following week, was asleep in a nearby cradle. In coming \n     days, they picked up her sister Emilile from violin camp. \n     And the ordeal began.\n       She learned the details of her father's death: His car had \n     malfunctioned, gone over the median strip, landed in oncoming \n     traffic, flipped over. He was 40. She endured the days-long \n     wait for his body to be brought home. Neighbors cleaned their \n     house. They brought food.\n       ``We had ham for about two months,'' she said.\n       But Christelle couldn't eat. She kept to herself, stayed \n     away from the phone. The one time she did pick it up, the \n     caller asked about her father's organs; her dad was a donor. \n     She just wished the reality would go away: She had just one \n     parent. No father to help her choose her first car that fall. \n     Or walk her down the aisle one day.\n       ``She couldn't believe it,'' Giovannini said. ``Even after \n     the funeral, it was hard for her to accept.''\n       Life changed. At school that fall, Christelle kept up with \n     homework and her clubs. But in the evening, with time alone \n     to focus on herself, she faced the pain. Christelle cried in \n     her room. Her mother sent her to a church counselor, and to a \n     school counselor. Christelle resented them, feeling that they \n     didn't understand what she was facing. Mail addressed to him \n     arrived. Friends who had been out of town when the crash \n     happened asked about her dad. People kept dredging up his \n     death.\n       ``You have to face it again and again,'' she said. ``What I \n     hated the most was `I've been there' from people who hadn't \n     even lost a parent yet. How could the tell me it was going to \n     be OK?''\n\n\n                            A chance to help\n\n       Christelle found solace in going to church each week and \n     becoming more active in youth group. ``It had more meaning \n     for me,'' she said.\n       Then Christelle came up with the idea of researching teen \n     grief for a Girl Scout project. She had been a Girl Scout \n     since second grade, rising from Brownie to Senior Cadette. \n     She loved the support system the organization gave her, which \n     helped her learn more about herself. She earned all of the \n     pins and completed almost all the projects she needed to earn \n     a Gold Award, the Scouts' highest honor. The only thing left \n     to do was a research project: Teen grief, she decided, was \n     the perfect subject.\n       She started working toward the award in January of her \n     senior year, going to public and college libraries. She found \n     scant to nothing on the subject of teen grief. She tried \n     Barnes & Noble: same thing.\n       She met JoAnn Spees, director of the Council on Adolescents \n     of Catawba County. Spees helped her find enough information \n     to start her research and talked with her about her plan to \n     present it. Christelle decided that her research could \n     benefit more than herself: She would create a teen-to-teen \n     brochure for others struggling with grief.\n       ``She is one of the most capable young women I've ever \n     met,'' Spees said. ``She's very talented, has an incredible \n     joie de vivre and a maturity level beyond her years.''\n       Now, Christelle had a cause, Spees said. After visiting the \n     Council, Christelle left with books and diaries on grief to \n     read at home. She read everywhere, even on the beach. She \n     interviewed classmates who had lost parents to illness. She \n     talked to psychologists, to teachers whose parents had died \n     when they were young. The Gold Award project required 50 \n     hours of research; Christelle, who completed the project that \n     October, logged more than 92.\n       Her desire to learn was never sated. What were the stages \n     of grief she would go through? What would Emilie and Margot \n     face? Her notebook was the size of a phone book when she \n     finished. Her journal was full of pages expressing her jumble \n     of feelings: denial sometimes, longing the next.\n       The brochure she created is simple and powerful. A \n     childlike drawing of a heart graces the cover. Inside, \n     there's a road map showing the journey through grief with \n     exits to shock, the ``whys'' (why them? why me? why now?) and \n     healing. She reminds teens that there's no speed limit or \n     deadline for working through grief. On the back, she offers \n     tips and explains that she is a teen who has lost someone \n     too.\n       The brochure not only earned Christelle her Gold Award--an \n     honor achieved by about 3,500 Girl Scouts each year--but also \n     led to her being named one of this year's Girl Scout Gold \n     Award Young Women of Distinction--an honor shared by only 10 \n     Scouts. Christelle was chosen because of the impact her \n     brochure had on the community, said Michele Landa, \n     spokeswoman for Girl Scouts of the USA. Catawba County's \n     council on Adolescents has circulated more than 800 copies to \n     school counselors, pediatricians and psychologists. It has \n     been used to help students at a school where three teens died \n     in a car accident. Everyone always wants more, Spees said.\n       As part of her award, Christelle is in Washington, D.C., \n     this week for a Girl Scout anniversary celebration and gala. \n     She is thought to be the first North Carolina Girl Scout to \n     receive the honor since the award began three years ago, \n     Landa said. Christelle will receive a White House tour and \n     attend a luncheon presided by U.S. Supreme Court Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor. She is scheduled to meet influential \n     women such as fashion designer Vera Wang U.S. Senate \n     candidate Elizabeth Dole and Kathryn Sullivan, the first \n     American woman to walk in space.\n       ``Isn't that cool?'' Christelle said.\n\n\n                           an emerging woman\n\n       Doing the research, Spees said, gave her a deeper sense of \n     maturity. She had always been self-assured. But when \n     Christelle spoke at a luncheon put on by the Council on \n     Adolescents last year, Spees saw an emerging woman.\n       ``She was calm, confident,'' Spees said. ``She just had a \n     sense of new control, a peace that she was conveying. Before \n     it was a cause, but now that the project was finished she \n     found a sense of closure.''\n       At Meredith, Christelle looks young in a pale yellow \n     cardigan and jeans, her smooth skin and dark brown ponytail \n     accented by a red and green striped bow. But she has grown in \n     ways that don't show. She pulls out a memorial card with a \n     grainy black and white picture of her dad, showing his hair \n     parted on the side, his quirky smile.\n       ``I see so much of my sisters in him now,'' she said, \n     looking at the picture while the chapel bells ring. ``His \n     smile is exactly like my little 4-year-old's. I'll never be \n     able to look at her and not see him. Dad is with us in his \n     own way.''\n       It has been three years, but Christelle still returns to \n     her grief from time to time. Thinking about a special moment \n     with her dad can cause the tears to run again. She gains \n     comfort from the silver circle of moons and suns on her \n     finger--the ring he bought her in Charleston, S.C., and that \n     she still wears every day. And she leans on her faith. She \n     has even taught her youngest sister that to talk to Daddy she \n     can pray Sometimes you have to turn things over to God, she \n     said, and everything will be OK.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2071-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN RECOGNITION OF NOTTINGHAM INSURANCE & FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntruly inspiring woman, Ms. Sharon Darling. Ms. Darling is this year's \nrecipient of the prestigious National Humanities Medal. President Bush \nand First Lady Laura Bush will be personally presenting this award to \nMs. Darling at a ceremony to take place next month.\n  Sharon Darling is the founder and president of the National Center \nfor\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nFamily Literacy, NCFL, a non-profit organization located in Louisville, \nKY, recognized world-wide for their effectiveness and innovativeness in \nteaching children and adults to read. The NCFL, founded in 1989, has \nworked diligently year after year in an attempt to bring about a \npositive change in the level of family literacy rates. This group has \nbeen soulfully dedicated to placing family literacy on the national \nagenda and has been very successful through their efforts. The NCFL \nrightly understands that to live without an education is to live \nwithout a future.\n  Sharon Darling got her start in education 35 years ago in the \nbasement of the Ninth & O Baptist Church. The basement of this Baptist \nChurch is where she first began to teach illiterate adults to read. It \nwas also the first time she began to realize that she could make a \ndifference in people's lives. She recognized that without access to \nknowledge, these people would never possess the ability to fight their \nway out of poverty or empower themselves with the gift of rational \nthought. If they cannot read, no amount of money or Federal assistance \nwill help.\n  Throughout her career in education, Sharon has spent time as a \nteacher, administrator, and educational entrepreneur, constantly \nworking to develop new and improved strategies for teaching children \nand adults how to read and how to interpret what they read. She has \nserved as an advisor on issues dealing with education to governors, \npolicy makers, business leaders, and foundations across the country. \nShe has been and remains an invaluable resource to the educational \ncommunity.\n  The National Humanities Medal will not be the first time Sharon has \nbeen recognized for her work. She received the 2000 Razor Walker Award \nfrom the University of North Carolina for her contributions to the \nlives of children and youth; the Woman Distinction Award from \nBirmingham Southern University in 1999; the Albert Schweitzer Prize for \nHumanitarianism from Johns Hopkins University in 1998; the Charles A. \nDana Award for Pioneering Achievement in education in 1996; and the \nHarold W. McGraw Award for Outstanding Educator in 1993. She has also \nreceived several honorary doctorate degrees for her contributions to \neducation and has been featured on the Arts & Entertainment television \nnetwork's series, ``Biography.'' Her latest accolade places her in the \ncompany of such great men and women as Stephen Ambrose, Ken Burns, and \nToni Morrison. The National Humanities Medal is the Federal \nGovernment's highest honor recognizing achievement in the humanities.\n  Sharon Darling has been a shining star for the literacy movement \nthroughout her career as an educator, guiding the unfortunate into a \nland of opportunity. I congratulate Ms. Darling for this much deserved \ndistinction and thank her for striving to make the world a better place \nto live and to learn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2072-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN'S OLYMPIANS\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commend the residents \nof the State of Michigan who participated in the recently concluded \n2002 Winter Olympics.\n  ``Swifter! Higher! Stronger!'' That's the Olympic motto.\n  I am proud to say that at least 13 athletes who call or have called \nMichigan their home followed that motto and competed with the world's \nbest in this year's Winter Olympics. Among them was Naomi Lang, the \nfirst Native American to compete in the history of the Winter Olympics \nand who placed 11th in ice dancing.\n  Athletes included members of the men's Silver Medal hockey team: \nChris Chelios, of Detroit; Mike Modano, of Livonia; Brian Rafalski, of \nDearborn, Brian Rolston, of Flint; Doug Weight, of Warren, and Mike \nYork, of Waterford.\n  Other athletes from Michigan were: Women's hockey team Silver \nMedalists Shelley Looney, of Brownstown Township and Angela Ruggiero, \nof Harper's Woods; Mark Grimmette, of Muskegon, and Chris Thorpe, of \nMarquette, who won the Silver and Bronze medals respectively in the \nmen's luge doubles; Jean Racine, of Waterford, who placed 5th in the \nwomen's bobsled, and Todd Eldredge, of Lake Angelus, who placed sixth \nin men's singles figure skating.\n  I am so proud of all of them!\n  Besides these wonderful athletes, I am pleased to say that another 15 \nOlympic competitors and one coach came from the U.S. Olympic Education \nCenter based at Northern Michigan University in Marquette.\n  These athletes didn't just do Michigan proud, or the Nation proud; \nthey made the whole world of amateur athletics proud.\n  They, and all the great athletes who participated, gave us a chance \nto share together in another motto of the Winter Olympics, \n``Celebrating Humanity.''\n  It was impossible to watch these games without marveling at all the \nhard work and dedication these young people brought to the games.\n  So, again, let me congratulate the athletes from Michigan as well as \nthe athletes from across our Nation and around the world who gave us a \nchance to watch the best compete against each other and together \ncelebrate the spirit of humanity, the spirit of the Olympics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2072-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO MR. CLIFFORD C. LaPLANTE\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat American who has served his country well. For over five decades, \nCliff LaPlante has dedicated himself to supporting the defense needs of \nthe Nation. Born in upstate New York, Cliff entered the service of his \ncountry as an Air Force officer during the Korean War. During his 20 \nyears of Air Force service, Cliff specialized in acquisition matters \nwhere he helped ensure that our troops were provided with the best \nequipment our industrial base could provide.\n  Cliff became well known to this body long before leaving the Air \nForce in his role as a legislative liaison officer to Capitol Hill. He \ntruly distinguished himself as a trusted and admired representative of \nthe Air Force.\n  Selected to be a full Colonel in 1970, Cliff decided to forgo this \nmuch deserved promotion and instead served for eight years as the \nBoeing Company's first full-time liaison representative to Capitol.\n  In 1979, Cliff joined the General Electric Company where he has \nremained for the past 23 years helping General Electric to ``Bring Good \nThings to Life.''\n  Now, after more than 50 years of service, Cliff is retiring from \nGeneral Electric, to begin yet another chapter in his life. Together \nwith his wife, Cecilia, Cliff has established a charitable foundation \ncalled ``Children Come First.'' This foundation is dedicated to helping \nunderprivileged children. In the same spirit that has exemplified all \nof Cliff's past undertakings, he will devote much of his time lending a \nhelping hand to kids to ensure they have a chance filled with hope for \ntomorrow.\n  I will miss this jaunty man with the fast walk and warm, charming \npersonality. Along with all my colleagues who have enjoyed his \nfriendship over the years, I wish him well in his latest ``retirement'' \nand the best of luck with his ``Children Come First'' \nFoundation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2072-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2072-S2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR DOUGLAS H.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mayor \nDouglas Palmer of Trenton, NJ who is being honored by the Mercer County \nChamber of Commerce as its Citizen of the Year.\n  Mayor Palmer has achieved a long list of accomplishments since \nbecoming the mayor of his hometown. Under Mayor Palmer's leadership, \ntremendous strides have been made in the Trenton area. He has overseen \nthe construction and rehabilitation of hundreds of new homes for \nworking families and created numerous economic development projects \nthat have led to the lowest unemployment rate in a decade.\n  Some of Mayor Palmer's most impressive achievements include the work \nhe has done for the children of Trenton. He established the ``Trenton \nLoves Children'' program, representing the city's first comprehensive \nprogram for children that ensures preschoolers will receive free \nimmunizations against childhood diseases. He also brought the\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\ncountry's first federally funded Weed and Seed anti-drug program to \nTrenton.\n  In light of Mayor Palmer's achievements as mayor of Trenton, he \nserves as an exemplar of the positive goals that can be achieved by a \nmayor who is a tireless advocate for his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/19/senate-section/article/S2073-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DESIGNER TICKETS & MORE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

The students redirect their \nprofits back into the business as an insurance policy for progressive \nthinking.\n  Students who wish to participate in this business venture must submit \nresumes and go through an interview process just as if they were \napplying for a job in my office. From among the applicants, Ms. Witt \nchooses chief executive officers, department heads, and employees. The \nstudents are held responsible for clocking in and out and must inform \ntheir boss if they will be unable to come to work due to sickness or \nvacation. Up to 30 students are in charge of running the business each \nsemester. They are required to make sales calls, fill out order forms, \ndesign creative products, and prepare invoices.

After it came to \nlight on October 13th that the anthrax-tainted letter sent to the NBC \noffices was processed at the United States Post Office on Route 130 in \nHamilton, the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital stepped forward \nto meet the needs of the community. Under the dynamic leadership of \nChristy Stephenson, the hospital assessed the potential need for Cipro \nwithin the community and took steps to secure the amount of Cipro the \nsituation required.\n  Further, understanding the urgent need for its services, the hospital \naccommodated its schedule to treat the patients from the anthrax \nexposure area while continuing to keep its appointments with regular \nclients.\n  As an exemplary corporate citizen of the Mercer County community, \nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital's efforts during this time of \ncrisis were of life saving importance to over sixteen hundred \nindividuals.

A bill to convert the temporary judgeship for the eastern \ndistrict of Virginia to a permanent judgeship, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation to help ensure the continued effective \nadministration of justice in the Commonwealth of Virginia. I am joined \nin the Senate on this initiative by my colleague Senator George Allen. \nCongressman Robert Scott is introducing similar legislation today in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  Simply put, the legislation we are introducing today will convert a \ntemporary judgeship in the Eastern District of Virginia into a \npermanent one. Without swift passage of this legislation, the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia could lose an authorized judgeship, thus placing \nan even greater workload on the already hard working judges that serve \nin this judicial district.\n  By way of background, in 1990, Congress authorized a temporary \njudgeship for the Eastern District of Virginia, bringing the total \nnumber of authorized judgeships in that district to ten, nine permanent \njudgeships and one temporary judgeship.\n  In 2000, Congress looked closely at the heavy caseload the judges of \nthe Eastern District of Virginia carried, and as a result Congress \nauthorized one additional permanent judgeship. With the advice of \nSenator Allen and me, President Bush has nominated Mr. Henry Hudson to \nfill this judicial vacancy. I strongly support Mr. Hudson's nomination \nand look forward to him receiving a confirmation hearing and a vote in \nthe full Senate. Mr. Hudson has been deemed ``well qualified'' by the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  Thus, to date, eleven judgeships are currently authorized on the \nEastern District of Virginia's bench. However, the temporary judgeship \nin the Eastern District of Virginia is set to expire with the first \nvacancy occurring after April 8, 2002. Thus, when one of the active \njudges on the Eastern District bench retires, takes senior status, or \npasses away, that position will not be filled, thus leaving the court \nwith one less authorized judgeship than it has currently. It is \nimportant to note that Mr. Hudson's nomination will not be effected by \nthe lapsing of the temporary judgeship.\n  If the temporary judgeship in the Eastern District of Virginia \nlapses, and this judicial district loses an authorized judgeship, an \nalready overworked judiciary will be without relief.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States recommends that a \ndistrict have a newly authorized judgeship when the weighted filings \nper judge exceed 430 cases. In 2001, the weighted caseload per judge on \nthe Eastern District was 617. If Virginia's temporary judgeship \nexpires, the per judge weighted caseload would sky-rocket to 679 cases \nper judge.\n  Moreover, it is now clear based on experience that the Department of \nJustice has prosecuted and will continue to prosecute terrorist cases \nin the Eastern District of Virginia. Already, the Eastern District is \nproceeding with the cases of Zacaris Moussaoui and John Walker Lindh. \nWhile the judges\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\non the Eastern District bench stand ready to proceed with these and \nother cases, these cases could significantly increase the numbers of \ncases and the complexity of cases the judges on this bench preside \nover.\n  Given its already high case load and given the fact that the Eastern \nDistrict is facing the likelihood of even a higher caseload with the \nterrorist prosecutions, the Eastern District of Virginia is in a unique \nposition. Converting the temporary judgeship to a permanent one will \nprovide some relief.\n  Accordingly, Congressman Scott, Senator Allen and I have joined \ntogether in support of this legislation that will simply allow the \nEastern District to continue to maintain its current level of eleven \ndistrict court judges.\n  This request is inherently reasonable. We are simply asking to \nmaintain the status-quo of eleven authorized judgeships on the Eastern \nDistrict bench. Meanwhile, the Judicial Conference currently recommends \none additional permanent judgeship and the conversion of a temporary \njudgeship to a permanent judgeship.\n  I ask Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch to swiftly report this \nlegislation from the Judiciary Committee, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport final passage. Time is of the essence. We must ensure that the \njudicial system in the Eastern District of Virginia continues to be \nable to serve Virginians, and indeed the country, in an efficient \nmanner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISTRICT JUDGESHIP FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF \n                   VIRGINIA.\n\n       (a) Conversion of Temporary Judgeship to Permanent \n     Judgeship.--The existing judgeship for the eastern district \n     of Virginia authorized by section 203(c) of the Judicial \n     Improvements Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 133 note; Public Law 101-\n     650) shall, as of the date of enactment of this Act, be \n     authorized under section 133 of title 28, United States Code, \n     and the incumbent in that office shall hold the office under \n     section 133 of title 28, United States Code (as amended by \n     this Act).\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table \n     contained in section 133(a) of title 28, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking the item relating to Virginia and \n     inserting the following:\n\n``Virginia:\n\n    Eastern.....................................................11 ....\n\n    Western...................................................4''. ....\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2030. A bill to establish a community Oriented Policing Services \nanti-methamphetamine grant program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation intended to \nmarshal the resources of the Federal Government, the expertise of State \nand local law enforcement, and the eyes, ears, and caring of our \nNation's communities, to work together to eradicate the scourge of \nmethamphetamine from our Nation.\n  Meth statistics are startling, not only for what they say about where \nwe are currently, but even more important about the potential magnitude \nof the problem in our very near future. Nationwide U.S. Drug \nEnforcement Administration, DEA, meth lab seizures have increased \nseven-fold from 1994 to 2000. The North Dakota lab seizure numbers are \neven more dramatic: a nearly twenty-fold increase from 1998 to 2001. \nAmong 2001 high school seniors, 6.9 percent had tried meth; the eighth-\ngrade figure was 4.4 percent. Even more startling perhaps is that 28.3 \npercent of high school seniors said it was ``fairly easy'' or ``very \neasy'' to obtain meth. This is particularly alarming because meth is \nmore addictive than cocaine, leading to paranoia, aggression, violent \nbehavior, and hallucinations, and ultimately, and amazingly quickly, to \nbrain damage similar to Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and epilepsy.\n  The COPS Anti-Methamphetamine Act of 2002 has one aim, to focus the \nprinciples of community policing on the problem of methamphetamine. \nSince its inception in 1994, the Community Oriented Policing Services \nCOPS, program has been a catalyst for establishing a partnership \nbetween police and the community, leading to a reduction in crime and a \nstrengthening of our neighborhoods. It is now time to tightly focus the \nCOPS success on our nation's meth scourge.\n  Until now, meth use and production has too often occurred underground \nand below the radar screens of local law enforcement. My COPS \nmethamphetamine initiative, by bringing the community and the local \npolice closer together, will help law enforcement to react more quickly \nbefore a meth epidemic get ingrained in a locality, to weed it out \nbefore its roots get too deep. If a meth problem already exists in a \nneighborhood, the community-oriented policing model will allow police \nto have a better pulse on the drug market, on both the supply and the \ndemand ends to better know the market's pressure points.\n  My initiative calls for five years of grants, at $75 million a year, \nto be given to localities for programs aimed at anti-meth enforcement, \nproduction, prevention, treatment, training, and intelligence-gathering \nefforts. And because meth is such a problem in rural States like North \nDakota, I include a mechanism to ensure that smaller localities get \ntheir fair share of funding.\n  Meth is a continuing problem and challenge in our nation and in North \nDakota, and I have been a strong supporter of providing the resources \nfor local law enforcement to combat this drug. In 1998, for example, I \nwas able to include North Dakota in the Midwest High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area, which has provided additional Federal funding to \nensure that Federal, State, and local law enforcement works better as a \nteam. The last piece of the puzzle is to ensure that local police are \nable to work as closely as possible with the community. It is simply \nimperative that if we are going to eradicate our Nation's spreading \nmeth epidemic, and the countless associated shattered lives and futures \nlost, we all need to work together.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of \nintellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court issued \na pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with respect to \nintellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid versus College \nSavings Bank and\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nits companion case, College Savings Bank versus Florida Prepaid. The \nCourt ruled in these cases that States and their institutions cannot be \nheld liable for damages for patent infringement and other violations of \nthe Federal intellectual property laws, even though they can and do \nenjoy the full protection of those laws for themselves.\n  Both Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the \nsame five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the \nCourt threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, \nunanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, \ncopyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.\n  I believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the \nFlorida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.\n  First, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal \nintellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot \ntolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual \nproperty system get legal protection but need not adhere to the law \nthemselves. If we truly believe in the free market, we cannot tolerate \na situation where one class of market participants have to play by the \nrules and others do not. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a \nfloor statement that was highly critical of the Florida Prepaid \ndecisions, they ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of \naffairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous advantage over their \nprivate sector competitors.''\n  This concern is not just abstract. Consider this. In one recent \ncopyright case, the University of Houston was able to avoid any \nliability by invoking sovereign immunity. The plaintiff in that case, a \nwoman named Denise Chavez, was unable to collect a nickle in connection \nwith the university's alleged unauthorized publication of her short \nstories. Now, just a short time later, another public university funded \nby the State of Texas is suing Xerox for copyright infringement.\n  The second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid \ndecisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of \nCongress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-\nfour decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' \nthe current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation \nwith a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In \ndoing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State \nsovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of \nthe Constitution.\n  Some of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; \nbut that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away \nat the legitimate constitutional authority of the Federal Government. \nAt the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We \nare faced with a choice. We can respond, in a careful and measured way, \nby reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that is \ncrafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, \nabdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, \nand go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.\n  Just last month, the Court decided to intervene in another copyright \ndispute, to decide whether Congress went too far in 1998, when we \nextended the period of copyright protection for an additional 20 years. \nMany of us on the Judiciary Committee cosponsored that legislation, and \nit passed unanimously in both Houses. A decision that the legislation \nis unconstitutional could place further limits on congressional power.\n  About 4 months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I \nintroduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual \nProperty Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore \nFederal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by \nstates.\n  I regret that the Senate did not consider my legislation during the \nlast Congress. It has now been nearly 3 years since the Court decisions \nopened such a troubling loophole in our Federal intellectual property \nlaws. We should delay no further.\n  Last month, the Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on the \nissue of sovereign immunity and the protection of intellectual \nproperty. I want to thank again everyone who participated in that \nhearing, which helped greatly to clarify the issues and challenges \nposed by the Court's new jurisprudence.\n  Today, I am pleased to be reintroducing the Intellectual Property \nProtection Restoration Act with my friend and fellow Judiciary \nCommittee member, Senator Brownback. I commend the Senator from Kansas \nfor taking a stand on this important issue. I am also proud to have the \nHouse leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Coble \nand Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill, H.R. \n3204.\n  This bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that \nthe Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual \nproperty rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-\nengineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and \nintellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the \nCourt's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has \nearned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the \nendorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American \nBar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, \nthe Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners \nAssociation, the International Trademark Association, the Motion \nPicture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of \nAmerica Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  In essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates \nreasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in \nintellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. \nStates that choose not to waive their immunity within 2 years after \nenactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of \nthe Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties \nthat sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for \ninfringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived \ntheir immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.\n  This arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach \nconditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property \nprotection under its Article I intellectual property power just as \nCongress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of Federal funds \nunder its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach \nconditions to the Federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny \nthe benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or \nproportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full \nprotection for your Federal intellectual property rights, you must \nrespect those of others.\n  I hope we can all agree on the need for corrective legislation. A \nrecent GAO study confirmed that, as the law now stands, owners of \nintellectual property have few or no alternatives or remedies available \nagainst State infringers, just a series of dead ends.\n  We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign \ntrading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property \nbecomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the \ninternational ramifications here. American trading interests have been \nwell served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective \nintellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other \ninternational fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole \nin U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has \ncreated.\n  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores \nprotection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, \nunder current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping \nlegislation earlier this decade, but were thwarted by the Supreme \nCourt's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation \nwithout further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n                                S. 2031\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     Court's decisions give States an unfair advantage in the \n     intellectual property marketplace by shielding them from \n     money damages when they infringe the rights of private \n     parties, while leaving them free to obtain money damages when \n     their own rights are infringed. These decisions also have the \n     potential to impair the rights of private intellectual \n     property owners, discourage technological innovation and \n     artistic creation, and compromise the ability of the United \n     States to advocate effective enforcement of intellectual \n     property rights in other countries and to fulfill its own \n     obligations under international treaties. The Intellectual \n     Property Protection Restoration Act of 2002 creates \n     reasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in \n     intellectual property cases and participate in the \n     intellectual property marketplace on equal terms with private \n     parties. The bill also provides new remedies for State \n     infringements that rise to the level of constitutional \n     violations.\n       Sec. 1. Short Title; References.

Intellectual Property Remedies Equalization. Places \n     States on an equal footing with private parties by \n     eliminating any damages remedy for infringement of State-\n     owned intellectual property unless the State has waived its \n     immunity from any damages remedy for infringement of \n     privately-owned intellectual property. Intellectual property \n     that the State owned before the enactment of this Act is not \n     affected.\n       Sec. 4. Clarification of Remedies Available for Statutory \n     Violations by State Officers and Employees. Affirms the \n     availability of injunctive relief against State officials who \n     violate the Federal intellectual property laws. Such relief \n     is authorized under the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. \n     123 (1908), which held that an individual may sue a State \n     official for prospective relief requiring the State official \n     to cease violating federal law, even if the State itself is \n     immune from suit under the eleventh amendment. This section \n     also affirms that State officials may be personally liable \n     for violations of the intellectual property laws.\n       Sec. 5. Liability of States for Constitutional Violations \n     Involving Intellectual Property. Establishes a right to \n     compensation for State infringements of intellectual property \n     that rise to the level of constitutional violations. \n     Compensation shall be measured by the statutory remedies \n     available under the federal intellectual property laws, but \n     may not include treble damages.\n       Sec. 6. Rules of Construction. Establishes rules for \n     interpreting this Act.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Leahy in \nsponsoring S. 2031, a bill that will protect intellectual property \nrights fully and fairly by complying with the Court's new \nconstitutional requirements. This bill builds upon the same common-\nsense goals as the statutes that Senator Hatch championed a decade ago. \nI would like to commend both members for their outstanding leadership \nin this area. My hope is that S. 2031 will finally bring closure to our \nefforts in trying to clarify a complex and difficult issue for both \nCongress and the Courts.\n  There are two sides to this issue and both are compelling. For \nindividuals and companies who make the investment and take the risk in \ncreating new products and services, their property rights are at stake \nwhen a state infringes upon their intellectual property. States on the \nother hand also want to protect their sovereignty under the \nConstitution and want to assert their intellectual property rights \nespecially in the context of private/public partnerships where \nownership issues may be in doubt, creating the prospect for protracted \nlitigation.\n  That is why this inherent conflict demands congressional action. With \nthe arrival of the digital revolution where exact copies and \nreproductions can be made without limitations, this is an important \neconomic issue for individuals and companies trying to compete in the \nmarketplace. The question is how to fashion a legislative remedy in \nlight of recent Supreme Court decisions that struck down previous \nattempts to bring clarity to the issue.\n  I believe the Leahy/Brownback bill is a reasonable compromise \nsolution without running afoul of the constitutional issues highlighted \nby the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe and the Florida Pre-paid cases.\n  S. 2031 presents States with a choice. It creates reasonable \nincentives for States to waive their sovereign immunity in intellectual \nproperty cases. States that choose not to waive their immunity within 2 \nyears after enactment would continue to enjoy many of the benefits in \nthe intellectual property marketplace. However, like private parties \nthat sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for \ninfringement will not be able to recover any money damages unless they \nwaive their immunity from liability in intellectual property cases. All \nother remedial actions will continue to be available to State \nlitigants.\n  As Chairman Leahy previously observed, this is clearly constitutional \nand avoids the concerns raised by the Courts with regard to past \nstatutes addressing this matter. Under the Constitution's Article I \nspending power, Congress can attach limited conditions to a State's \nreceipt of Federal funds. Similarly, it would seem to me that a State's \nreceipt of Federal intellectual property protection under Article I's \nintellectual property power can similarly be conditioned. Especially in \nlight of the commercial implications of this bill, it seems reasonable \nto expect that a condition to respect the rights of others is a \nnecessary and logical complement to obtaining the full protections of \nthe Federal intellectual property rights.\n  I would also add that a recent GAO study initiated by Senator Hatch \nwhen he chaired the Judiciary Committee confirmed the lack of \nalternatives or remedies against State infringers.\n\n  I would also like to add that this matter has repercussions which \nextend far beyond the domestic realm. The United States is one of the \nleading proponents for the enforcement of intellectual property rights \nthroughout the world. That's why we cannot afford to be inconsistent in \nour own observance of intellectual property rights. Through \ninternational agreements such as TRIPs and NAFTA, the United States has \nvigorously challenged international institutions and other nations to \nadopt and enforce more extensive intellectual property laws. When \nStates assert sovereign immunity for the purpose of infringing upon \nintellectual property rights, it damages the credibility of the United \nStates internationally, and could possibly even lead to violations of \nour treaty obligations. Any decrease in the level of enforcement of \nintellectual property rights around the world is likely to harm \nAmerican businesses, because of our\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nposition as international leaders in industries like pharmaceuticals, \ninformation technology, and biotechnology.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill which provides a balanced \nand appropriate intellectual property remedy for American inventors and \ninvestors without compromising the sovereign rights of States under our \nConstitution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Kennedy):\n  S. 2033. A bill to authorize appropriations for the John H. Chafee \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor in Massachusetts and \nRhode Island, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize funding for the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley \nNational Heritage Corridor. I am pleased to be joined by three of my \ncolleagues, Senators Reed, Kerry and Kennedy, as original cosponsors of \nthis legislation. Representative Patrick Kennedy is joining this effort \nby introducing companion legislation in the House today.\n  Since the Corridor's inception on November 10, 1986, the Blackstone \nRiver Valley has undergone a profound rebirth. The Blackstone River, \nonce polluted and neglected, has been transformed into an object of \ntremendous community pride and national importance. Historians \nrecognize the Valley of the Blackstone River, gracefully winding \nthrough 24 communities in the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, \nas the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution. Slater Mill, \nfounded by the textile maker Samuel Slater in the 1790's, was the first \nto adapt English machine technology to cotton-yard manufacturing \npowered by water wheels. The success of the Slater Mill heralded in \nAmerica's first factory-based industry of mass production, with \naccompanying communities dedicated to the production of manufactured \ngoods. Gradually, this new ``Rhode Island System of Manufacturing'' led \nto profound changes economically, socially and culturally across the \nnew nation.\n  This nationally significant story was all but forgotten when Senator \nJohn H. Chafee authored Federal legislation to establish the Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor with the purpose of preserving \nand interpreting for present and future generations the uniqueness and \nsignificant historical value of the Blackstone Valley. A Corridor \nCommission, consisting of federally-appointed local and State \nrepresentatives from Massachusetts and Rhode Island, was established to \nwork in partnership with the National Park Service to carry out the \nmission of the Blackstone Corridor. For over 15 years, the Corridor \nCommission and its Heritage Partners have worked to instill a vision of \ncommunity revitalization, historic preservation, and environmental \nprotection in the Blackstone Corridor. The Corridor is a truly unique \nnational park area, for the Federal Government does not own or manage \nany of the land or resources within the system. Yet, the Blackstone \nCorridor includes cities, towns, villages and almost 1 million people, \nand has become a model for other heritage corridors across the country.\n  Working in partnership with two State governments, dozens of local \nmunicipalities, businesses, nonprofit historical and environmental \norganizations, educational institutions, and many private citizens, the \nCorridor Commission has instilled a sense of community and identity to \nthe residents of the Blackstone Corridor. These partnerships have \nresulted in the reversal of a long-standing lack of investment in the \nValley's historic, cultural and natural resources. A Valley-wide \nidentity program has placed over 200 educational signs across the \nCorridor to guide visitors into the Blackstone and its heritage sites. \nKey historic districts and sites have been preserved through the \nassistance of the Commission and its partners working to identify \ncritical historic preservation funding and assistance. The water \nquality of the Blackstone River has seen dramatic improvements through \ncooperative, community-driven projects that have worked to ensure more \nconsistent water flows; the protection of open space along the valley; \nthe initiation of local river cleanups; and the remediation of toxic \nsites along the river's banks.\n  Since 1986, Congress has established three accounts for the \nmanagement of the Corridor: the Operation Account providing funding for \nNational Park Service staff support; the Technical Assistance Account \nto provide assistance to communities and Corridor partners; and the \nDevelopment Fund to provide construction funding for the implementation \nof interpretive programming, river restoration, historic preservation, \ntourism and economic development and educational activities within the \nCorridor. A 10-year plan, completed by the Commission in 1998, outlines \na strategy for the implementation of development funds by focusing on \nthe ``resource protection needs and projects critical to maintaining or \ninterpreting the distinctive nature of the Corridor.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with Senators Reed, \nKerry, and Kennedy, will reauthorize the Development Fund account to \nprovide $10 million in Federal funding from fiscal years 2003 through \n2006. This authorization is consistent with the Blackstone Corridor's \n10-year Plan guiding the Corridor's future development needs. \nDevelopment funding will be used to move forward with projects that \ninclude a bi-State 45 mile long Blackstone bikeway; construction of \nriver access points for recreational and tourism opportunities; \nrenovation and reuse of historic structures and surrounding landscapes; \nand educational programs to raise the awareness of the Corridor's \nsignificance in the region.\n  With over 15 years of success and a number of challenges lying ahead, \nwe urge Congress' continued support for the John H. Chafee Blackstone \nRiver Valley National Heritage Corridor. The Blackstone Corridor tells \nthe story of the beginnings of America's movement into the industrial \nera. We must allow the telling of this story to continue.\n  I ask by unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 10 of Public Law 99-647 (16 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Development Funds.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out section 8(c) for the period of \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2006 not more than $10,000,000, to \n     remain available until expended.''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that has \nbeen filed today to reauthorize the development fund for the John H. \nChafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. The bill is \nsponsored by Senator Chafee, and I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor.\n  The John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor \nwas established by Congress in 1986 to recognize and preserve the \nnatural, cultural and historical resources of the region. I would like \nto read a description of the Blackstone River written by the National \nPark Service. I think it captures its special nature.\n\n       The Blackstone River Valley illustrates a major revolution \n     in America's past: the Age of Industry. The way people lived \n     during this turning point in history can still be seen in the \n     valley's villages, farms, cities and riverways--in a working \n     landscape between Worchester, Massachusetts and Providence, \n     Rhode Island. In 1790, American craftsmen built the first \n     machines that successfully used waterpower to spin cotton. \n     America's first factory, Slater Mill was built on the banks \n     of the Blackstone River. Here, industrial America was born. \n     This revolutionary way of using waterpower spread quickly \n     throughout the valley and New England. It changed nearly \n     everything. Two hundred years later, the story of the \n     American Industrial Revolution can still be seen and told in \n     the Blackstone River Valley. Thousands of structures and \n     whole landscapes show the radical changes in the way people \n     lived and worked. The way people lived before the advent of \n     industry also can be seen on the land, and the choices for \n     the future are visible as well. For good and bad, each \n     generation makes its choices and changes the character of \n     life in the valley. Today, the rural to city landscapes tell \n     the story of this revolution in American history. Native \n     Americans, European colonizers, farmers, craftsmen, \n     industrialists, and continuing waves of immigrants all left \n     the imprint of their work and\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n     culture on the land. The farms, hilltop market centers, mill \n     villages, cities, dams, canals, roads, and railroads are \n     physical products of tremendous social and economic power.\n\n  With the assistance of the National Park Service, the Commission has \nforged collaborative partnerships with a new spirit of ownership among \ngovernment leaders, private investors and residents for the river \nresources and communities. The Blackstone has been called ``America's \nhardest working river'' because of its industrial legacy. That same \ndescription could apply to the people who have decided themselves to \nmaking the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor a success \ntoday. The natural value and historical importance of the Blackstone \nand the dedication of the people involved is why I am eager to support \nSenator Chafee's legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        DeWine, and Mr. Warner).\n  S. 2034. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to impose \ncertain limits on the receipt of out-of-State municipal solid waste; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with a bipartisan coalition of my colleagues, Senators Feingold, \nDeWine, Levin, and Warner that will allow States to finally obtain \nrelief from the seemingly endless stream of solid waste that is flowing \ninto States like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Virginia.\n  Our bill, the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and \nLocal Authority Act, gives State and local governments the tools they \nneed to limit garbage imports from other States and manage their own \nwaste within their own States.\n  Each year, Ohio receives well over one million tons of municipal \nsolid waste from other States. Over the last four years, annual levels \nof waste imports have been steadily increasing, and estimates for 2000 \nindicate that Ohio imported approximately 1.8 million tons of municipal \nsolid waste. While these shipments are not near our record level of 3.7 \nmillion tons in 1989, I believe an import level of nearly two million \ntons of trash is still entirely too high.\n  Because it is cheap and because it is expedient, communities in a \nnumber of States have simply put their garbage on trains or on trucks \nand shipped it to be landfilled in States like Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, \nPennsylvania, and Virginia. This is wrong and it has to stop.\n  Many State and local governments in importing states have worked hard \nto develop strategies to reduce waste and plan for future disposal \nneeds. As Governor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to limit shipments of \nout-of-state waste into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio \nlandfill operators and agreements with other States. We saw limited \nrelief. However, Ohio has no assurance that our out-of-state waste \nnumbers won't rise significantly, particularly in light of last year's \nclosure of the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. Unfortunately, \nthe Federal courts have prevented States from enacting laws to protect \nour natural resources from being utilized as landfill space. What has \nemerged is an unnatural pattern where Ohio and other States, both \nimporting and exporting, have tried to take reasonable steps to \nencourage conservation and local disposal, only to be undermined by a \nbarrage of court decisions at every turn.\n  Quite frankly, State and local governments' hands are tied. Lacking a \nspecific delegation of authority from Congress, States that have acted \nresponsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal plans and \nrecycling programs are still being subjected to a flood of out-of-state \nwaste. In Ohio, I set up a comprehensive recycling program when I was \nGovernor that was meant to reduce the waste-stream and help protect our \nenvironment. However, the actions of other States have worked to \nundermine our recycling efforts because Ohioans continue to ask why \nthey should recycle to conserve landfill space when it is being used \nfor other States' trash. Our citizens already have to live with the \nconsequences of large amounts of out-of-state waste--increased noise, \ntraffic, wear and tear on our roads and litter that is blown onto \nprivate homes, schools and businesses.\n  Ohio and many other States have taken comprehensive steps to protect \nour resources and address a significant environmental threat. However, \nexcessive, uncontrolled waste disposal from other States has limited \nthe ability of Ohioans to protect their environment, health and safety. \nI do not believe the Commerce Clause requires us to service other \nstates at the expense of our own citizens' efforts.\n  A national solution is long overdue. When I became governor of Ohio \nin 1991, I joined a coalition with other Midwest Governors--Governor \nBayh now Senator Bayh, of Indiana, Governor Engler of Michigan and \nGovernor Casey, and later Governors Ridge and O'Bannon, of \nPennsylvania--to try to pass effective interstate waste and flow \ncontrol legislation.\n  In 1996, Midwest Governors were asked by congressional leaders to \nreach an agreement with Governor Whitman of New Jersey and Governor \nPataki of new York on interstate waste provisions. The importing States \nquickly came to an agreement with Governor Whitman of New Jersey--the \nsecond largest exporting State--on interstate waste provisions. We \nbegan discussions with New York, but these were put on hold \nindefinitely in the wake of their May, 1996 announcement to close the \nFresh Kills landfill.\n  The bill that my colleagues and I are introducing today reflects the \nagreement that Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania reached with \nthen-Governor Whitman.\n  For Ohio, the most important aspect of this bill is the ability for \nstates to limit future waste flows. For instance, they would have the \noption to set a ``permit cap,'' which would allow a State to impose a \npercentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste that a new \nfacility or expansion of an existing facility could receive annually. \nOr, a State could choose a provision giving them the authority to deny \na permit for a new facility if it is determined that there is not a \nlocal or in-state regional need for that facility.\n  These provisions provide assurances to Ohio and other States that new \nfacilities will not be built primarily for the purpose of receiving \nout-of-state waste. For instance, in 1996, Ohio EAP had to issue a \npermit for a landfill that was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a \nday--approximately 1.5 million tons a year--from Canada alone, which \nwould have doubled the amount of out-of-state waste entering Ohio. \nThankfully this landfill lost the Canadian bid. Ironically though, the \nwaste company put their plans on hold to build the facility because \nthere is not enough need for the facility in the State and they need to \nensure a steady out-of-state waste flow to make the plan feasible.\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that landfills and incinerators \ncould not receive trash from other States until local governments \napprove its receipt. States could also freeze their out-of-state waste \nimports at 1993 levels, while some States would be able to reduce these \nlevels to 65 percent by the year 2006. This bill also allows States to \nreduce the amount of construction and demolition debris they receive by \n50 percent beginning in 2007.\n  States also could impose up to $3-per-ton cost recovery surcharge on \nout-of-state waste. This fee would help provide States with the funding \nnecessary to implement solid waste management programs.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on out-of-\nstate waste shipments have been perceived by some as an attempt to ban \nall out-of-state trash. On the contrary, we are not asking for outright \nauthority for states to prohibit all out-of-state waste, nor are we \nseeking to prohibit waste from any one State. We are merely asking for \nreasonable tools that will enable state and local governments to act \nresponsibly to manage their own waste and limit unreasonable waste \nimports from other states. Such measures would give substantial \nauthority to limit imports and plan facilities around our own states' \nneeds.\n  I believe the time is right to consider and pass an effective \ninterstate waste bill. The bill we are introducing today is a consensus \nof importing and exporting States--States that have willingly come \nforward to offer a reasonable solution.\n  States like Ohio should not continue to be saddled with the \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\ncosts of other States' inability to take care of their own solid waste. \nWe in Ohio have worked hard to address our own needs. We are actively \nrecycling and working to reduce our waste-stream to preserve our \nenvironment for future generations.
