Madam President, I rise today to discuss the state of \nour Nation.\n  Our President has asked us to give him the authority to begin a war \nwith Iraq, and I look forward to a full and frank debate on that \nquestion.\n  But today I want to discuss other issues, important issues that are \nnot getting the attention they deserve, an agenda the President would \nrather not discuss, an agenda I fear is being obscured by gathering \nclouds of war.\n  Whether or not to go to war in Iraq is surely a grave and momentous \ndecision, but I fear our President is neglecting other crucial matters \nhere at home: the quiet crisis American families are facing everyday.\n  In Vermont and across this great land families are hurting. When they \nsend their children to an overcrowded, underfunded school in the \nmorning, they ask, is this the best we can do? When they go to work and \nsee an empty desk beside them they wonder, am I next? And they ask, is \nthis the best we can do? When they see their dwindling retirement \naccounts and read of endless corporate corruption, they ask, is this \nthe best we can do? When they have to cancel their child's doctor's \nappointment because they\n\n[[Page S9780]]\n\nhave lost their health insurance coverage, they ask, is this the best \nwe can do? When they send their kids out to play only to realize that \nthe air pollution levels are dangerously high, they ask, is this the \nbest we can do?\n  Is this the best we can do? Of course not. We can do better. We must \ndo better, because American families deserve better--and they deserve \nbetter from their President. In talking about one thing only, the \nPresident is forgetting many others. And so today I call on the \nPresident to engage this Nation on this forgotten agenda.\n  Less than a year after this Congress and the President worked to \nincrease the Federal role in elementary and secondary education by \npassing the No Child Left Behind Act, we are in danger of leaving many \nmore children behind because sufficient dollars will not be forthcoming \nto see that every child in this Nation receives a quality education.\n  The lack of funding for our Nation's schools is a disgrace. Across \nour Nation, headline after headline tells the story of school districts \nhaving to cut back staff, end the school day early, and cut short the \nschool year all because of a lack of funding.\n  More than 25 years ago, the Federal Government promised to pay 40 \npercent of special education costs for children with disabilities. \nToday, we only pay 18 percent of the costs. That is not just a broken \npromise for one of the richest nations in the world, it is an outrage.\n  Remember, the very reason that the Federal Government has a role in \neducation is because the Congress realized that our national defense \ndepended on our students leading the world in math and science. One of \nthis country's first education bills, passed in the late 1950s, after \nthe Soviets launched Sputnik, it was entitled the National Defense \nEducation Act.\n  An even more dramatic action occurred after World War II when we \npassed the GI bill, vastly increasing the Federal contribution to \neducation and narrowing the tremendous educational gap.\n  A similar gap exists now. Similar action is needed now.\n  Of the major industrial nations, the United States ranks among the \nlowest in terms of funding education at the Federal level, providing \nonly 7 percent of the costs. Nations such as Turkey, Korea, Italy, the \nCzech Republic and Mexico put us to shame in their expenditure on \neducation.\n  Recent national test scores tell us that 60 percent--60 percent--of \n12th graders are below the proficiency level in reading. This is basic \nreading.\n  By neglecting education today, we are not only shortchanging our \nchildren's opportunities, we are sapping our Nation's future strength.\n  Right now we have over half a million foreign workers here on H1-B \nvisas. Those are the visas we give to people from other countries to \nfill jobs within our borders. We shouldn't have to import workers to \nfill the high skill, high wage jobs that we have. We should educate our \nown workers to fill them.\n\n  Our economy is faltering. The President has committed to bringing \nthis economy out of recession. After convening an economic summit in \nTexas last August, which was more show than substance, he hasn't been \nengaged.\n  We learned in the last week that incomes declined and the poverty \nrate increased for the first time in almost a decade. The annual Census \nBureau income and poverty report stated that 1.3 million more Americans \nslipped below the poverty line. This increase means that 11.7 percent \nof the United States population is defined as living in poverty.\n  In regard to overall income, the Census Bureau said that the median \nhousehold income dropped for the first decrease since 1991. In less \nthan 2 years more than two million private sector jobs have been lost.\n  Our economic growth is the weakest it has been in 50 years.\n  And for the workers who don't need to worry about their jobs, they \nare worrying about their savings. More than 50 percent of Americans \nhave investments in the stock market--and they have seen the value of \nthose investments decline by over $4.5 trillion since last January.\n  Now is the time to restore confidence in the economy. Now is the time \nto show leadership--but this administration's economic leadership has \nbeen lackluster.\n  On environmental issues, I fear we are moving backward instead of \nforward under the Bush administration. The statistics are startling.\n  Right now in America there are about 30,000 premature deaths related \nto power plant pollution, about 160 million people breathing unhealthy \nair, and significantly higher risks of cancer and developmental \nproblems in urban areas from toxic tailpipe pollution.\n  Think about this: 2,500 Americans face premature death from power \nplant pollution each month. That's like suffering casualties from Pear \nHarbor every 30 days.\n  Parents are thinking twice before telling their kids to go outside \nand get some fresh air. First, they have to check on the air pollution \nalerts.\n  If global warning proceeds as scientists expect, weather will become \nincreasingly more hostile and difficult to predict.\n  I was proud to work with the first President Bush on the Clean Air \nAct amendments of 1990. He called our work, ``a new chapter in our \nenvironmental history, and a new era for clean air.''\n  Now, this President Bush insists on moving us backward--undoing his \nfather's legacy and our Nation's environmental policy.\n  This is a dangerous time. We face many threats. They require all of \nour best judgment and careful deliberation.\n  Threats of war dominate our headlines. If we were to ignore those \nthreats we would do so at our peril.\n  So, too, if we ignore the quiet, steady erosion of economic \nopportunity and well-being here at home.\n  If we take action in Iraq, Saddam Hussein will rue the day he defied \nthe international community and the world's greatest power. But our \ngreatness rests on more than our military strength. It rests on our \nability to meet great challenges whenever and wherever they arise. \nGreat challenges have arisen here at home.\n  Our men and women in uniform wherever they are--whether they are \nhelping to bring order in Kabul or awaiting orders in Kuwait--deserve \nmore than our pride and our support. They deserve to come home to a \nnation that is not only free but strong and prosperous.\n  We have got to address all the problems facing this Nation. Right now \nwe are not. The drumbeat of war cannot and must not drown out the needs \nof our families, our children and our environment.\n  I call on President Bush to lead this Nation. One person can make a \ndifference--and change only comes one person at a time.\n  It would be nice if the world were as simple as foreign and domestic, \ngood and bad--or even Democrat and Republican. But the world is not a \nsimple place and problems do not come along one at a time. Now is the \ntime for leadership, collective will and individual action.\n  In a rush to solve problems overseas, we must not ignore the problems \nhere at home. They are real, and they deserve our attention.\n  There has never been a problem that America could not solve if we \ncome together. That is exactly what we need to do, what we should do, \nwhat we must do now.\n  I yield the floor, not with happiness or good feelings but with \nconcern and deep hope that we can work together to save this Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. May I inquire, since the Senator from Vermont \nhas finished his major address on the economy, is it appropriate and do \nwe have the time at this point to continue the comments from this side \nof the aisle?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls the time \nuntil 10, and the Senator may speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9781-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9781]]\n                         A STRENGTHENED ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, yesterday I had occasion to \nbegin some remarks, thinking I could make them within 10 minutes, with \nregard to the economy. There were others waiting in line at the end of \nmy 10 minutes. I rise to continue those comments, pointing out that as \nwe discuss these highly important, weighty decisions we have to make \nabout war and peace and about homeland security, the Nation's military \nstrength is undergirded by its moral strength and its economic \nstrength.\n  It is due to the lack of that economic strength, as evidenced in an \neconomy that has been in the tank, as evidenced by so many different \nindicators--unemployment going up, the stock market going down, the \nweakness of retail sales, the laying off of people, the poor earnings \nreports of companies all over America--that it is incumbent upon the \nSenate to bring its attention not only to the highly important matters \nof war and peace but that if we are to continue this war against \nterrorism, and if we are to do something about the developing of \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq, for us as a Nation to be able to \nsuccessfully prosecute these wars, we need to have a strengthened \neconomy, a solid foundation in our economy.\n  There are a number of things we can do. Yesterday, I pointed out that \nwe were faced with, about a year and a half ago, the beneficence, the \nwonderment of a surplus that was projected over the next decade that \nnot only was going to allow us to accommodate a huge tax cut and \nspending increases on such things as we anticipated then, such as \nincreased defense spending--this was before September 11--there were \nother high-priority items such as modernizing Medicare with a \nprescription drug benefit, increased spending to recognize and honor \nthe veterans, the protection of the environment, a much larger \ninvestment in education; that we could accommodate not only a major tax \ncut along with those spending increases, but then we would also be able \nto save a part of that surplus--particularly the surplus that was \ngenerated in the Social Security trust fund--and that the surplus, in \neffect, over the next decade, was going to be able to pay down the \nnational debt, and thus save us the sum of $250 billion to $280 billion \na year that we are paying in interest.\n\n  But that did not occur. What occurred was that the projections for \nthe surplus over the next 10 years were way too rosy. How many of us \nstood on this floor and said exactly that--not only this Senator from \nFlorida but the Senator in the chair from New York said we ought to be \nconservative in our estimates of what this is going to be so we do not \noverobligate ourselves. We also said that when we enact a tax cut--and \nwe want to--it ought to be a balanced approach so the tax cut doesn't \nabsorb all of the surplus so that you can do these other things. The \nother things were increasing defense expenditures--and we said that \nbefore September 11. How true was that prophetic statement. But it \ndidn't happen that way. Now we are running deficits in this year to the \ntune of about $150 billion. We have deficits that are projected over \nthe next decade.\n  When you take into consideration that we are now borrowing out of the \nSocial Security trust fund surpluses--something every one of us in the \nelection of 2000 said we were not going to do--we were going to fence \noff the Social Security trust fund and it wasn't going to be touched. \nAs a result of that, the surpluses were going to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  Well, that did not occur because we were not wise and balanced in our \napproach to the Federal Government. It is a major contributor right now \nto the stock market being in the tank, and it doesn't make any \ndifference that the stock market went up 350 points yesterday. The two \nprevious days it went down that much. It is still sort of rocking along \nbelow 8,000.\n  What is that? That is a reflection of the lack of American investor \nconfidence in American corporations. Why? In part, it is because the \nFederal Government has returned to deficit financing on an annual \nbasis--that is, borrowing money to pay expenditures; therefore, it is \ndeficit financing--when we said we had the opportunity to get out of \nthat.\n  I had a little experience in this back in 1981 as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. I voted for a big tax cut and it took us not \nonce, not twice, but three times to undo that tax cut in order to get \nthe fiscal house in order.\n  I said I was for a big tax cut. I voted for a version on this floor \nlast year to the tune of $1.2 trillion over a decade. But that wasn't \nwhat we enacted. What we enacted was $1.35 trillion--which is what it \nwas billed at--but it really wasn't because, when you consider the 10th \nyear that the tax cut was suddenly reverted to the present tax law, it \nwas, in effect, a $2 trillion tax cut, which has usurped all of the \navailable surplus.\n  In my speech yesterday, I pointed out the percentages; the biggest \npart was taken up by the tax cut. The recession, certainly, was a part \nof that. The projections were another major factor; they ended up being \nway too rosy.\n  Our economy at this time is still continuing to be sluggish, and \nalthough most analysts remain optimistic that we will pull out of this \nrecession eventually, the path is not rising very fast. I think we \nought to be conservative in how we approach this fiscal house to see if \nwe can get it in order.\n  The economic indicators are disturbing. Last week those economic \nindicators dropped for a third month in a row and Nasdaq hit a 6-year \nlow. Of course, most people know about the Dow Jones--it is really in \nthe tank. Since the beginning of 2001, 2 million jobs have been lost--\nthe first decline in the number of private sector jobs in half a \ncentury. The U.S. poverty rate rose last year for the first time in 8 \nyears. Last year's administration's spending and tax cut plan is part \nof the reason it has resulted in today's collision course of more \ndeficits, more debt, higher economic insecurity, higher interest rates, \nlower economic growth, and lower employment.\n  I come back to the floor of the Senate to again say to my colleagues \nwhat some of us in the moderate sphere of politics were trying to say \nlast year as we were going through these budgetary discussions--that we \nought to use moderation and we ought to use balance and take an \napproach that ultimately would get the fiscal house in order of \nstopping the annual deficit spending and fulfilling the promise that we \nmade that the Social Security trust fund surpluses would not be used \nfor other spending but, rather, would be fenced off and left so their \nsurpluses could start paying down the national debt.\n  I appreciate the ongoing dialog about this impending war, but we also \nneed to pay attention to the battles that we are already waging in \norder to keep a strengthened national economy, to help support the \nnecessary battles that we are fighting in terrorism around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9781-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9781-S9782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the decline of our economy in the last \nyear and a half is truly staggering. It is absolutely critical that we \nin Congress, before we leave, do everything we possibly can to help \nAmericans who have been hurt by this downturn--in particular, the \npeople who are unemployed and having trouble getting back into the \nworkforce. That is why it is essential that before we leave we extend \nunemployment benefits and adopt the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nAct of 2002, which has been introduced by Senator Wellstone, Senator \nClinton, myself, and others.\n  Over 8 million Americans are unemployed. Since January of 2001, the \nnational unemployment rate has risen from 4.2 percent to 5.7 percent. \nAccording to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, between May \nand July of this year, approximately 900,000 workers exhausted all of \nthe additional weeks of Federal unemployment benefits that they \nreceived as a result of the economic stimulus legislation that passed \nthe Congress last March. By the end of this year, that number will \nswell to 2.2 million workers having exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits.\n  We have lost more than 2 million private sector jobs since January of \n2001. For the first time in 50 years, the number of private sector jobs \nhas actually\n\n[[Page S9782]]\n\ndeclined in this country. Now, the rate of increase in those jobs has \ngone up and down over the last 50 years but never in the last 50 years \nhas there been an actual decline in the number of private sector jobs \nuntil this last year.\n  The legislation introduced last week would do something about these \nproblems by providing all States with an additional 13 weeks of \ntemporary extended unemployment benefits. It would also authorize \nStates with the highest levels of unemployment to get funds for an \nadditional 7 weeks of benefits on top of the 13.\n  This is especially important to my home State of Michigan. Michigan \nhas one of the higher unemployment rates nationwide, currently 6.2 \npercent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The time controlled by the \nmajority has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I notice a number of our colleagues are in \nthe Chamber, and my time has expired. I ask unanimous consent that I be \ngiven an additional 3 minutes to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I am sorry, I did not hear \nthe Senator's question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 3 \nminutes to complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we introduced last week would do \nsomething about these problems by giving all States an additional 13 \nweeks of temporary extended unemployment benefits and would authorize \nStates with the highest levels of unemployment to get funds for an \nadditional 7 weeks of benefits above the 13 weeks.\n  As I indicated, my home State has one of the highest unemployment \nrates in the Nation, currently 6.2 percent. That is the seventh highest \nin the Nation, and it is almost a full percentage point higher than it \nwas just a year and a half ago. More than 60,000 workers in Michigan \ncurrently receive Federal unemployment benefits, with an additional \n50,000 Michigan workers having already exhausted their benefits.\n  Michigan's median household income fell by 4.1 percent last year. \nOnly four other States fared worse. In the country as a whole, median \nhousehold income fell 2.2 percent last year, the first drop since 1991. \nSo this legislation is crucial for Michigan's hard-pressed workers and \ntheir families, as well as for workers across the land.\n  This is not just doing what is fair and what is right and what is \nequitable. Those reasons ought to be sufficient. In addition to that, \nproviding additional benefits is a good stimulus for our ailing \neconomy. The money we are talking about is money that will be spent. \nThose eligible to receive these benefits are people trying to make ends \nmeet on a day-to-day basis, people who need money to put food on the \ntable, to buy a prescription drug, to make a car payment, to pay rent, \nor to pay a mortgage. They spend this money.\n  According to a 1999 Department of Labor study, every dollar invested \nin unemployment benefits generates $2.15 in gross domestic product. \nThis bill extending unemployment benefits will put money into the hands \nof people who need it, people who will spend it, and that is good for \nour economy, as well as for them, because it sustains the jobs other \npeople still have.\n  There may be Members who will argue we cannot afford to extend \nunemployment benefits. Obviously, we should be concerned about our \ncurrent budget situation. The 10-year surplus projection has declined \nby $5.3 trillion, or 94 percent, since January of 2001. But our budget \nproblem does not come from extending desperately needed benefits to \nout-of-work Americans.\n  The major problem is last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut which provides \nmore benefits to the top 1 percent of all taxpayers than it does the \nbottom 80 percent of taxpayers combined. According to analysts who \nreviewed the CBO numbers, last year's tax cut is the single largest \ncause for our evaporated surplus.\n  September 11 and its aftermath had an enormous impact on an economy \nthat was already sputtering. The economy has not recovered. There are \nsigns that it will not recover for a while longer. The tax cut has \nblown a hole in our budget, yet it is not just the centerpiece of the \nadministration's economic policy, it appears to be the only economic \npolicy we hear about from the administration.\n  Since Congress passed a bipartisan extension of unemployment benefits \nin March, nearly 2 million people have exhausted those benefits without \nfinding new jobs. The ability for them to receive additional benefits \nhas expired. Yesterday, Senator Wellstone attempted to pass this bill \nby unanimous consent, but was prevented from doing so. This issue \nshould be one of our top priorities. We should not leave this year \nwithout extending these benefits for America's unemployed. I am hopeful \nthat Democrats and Republicans in Congress will be able to come \ntogether as we have done in the past and support the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Act of 2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my intent today to make a few \ncomments about someone I hold in such high esteem, perhaps in higher \nesteem than anyone else I can think of at this moment. Before doing \nthat, I am compelled, however, to respond to some of the statements \nthat have been made concerning the economy.\n  I think we all recognize our economy started turning south about 3 \nyears ago. We did see this coming. I really do not like people saying--\nbecause I am always afraid someone is going to believe it--that somehow \nwhen we reduce tax burdens on individuals that is going to \nautomatically reduce the revenues that would have otherwise come from \nthose taxes.\n  History tells us just the opposite. In fact, yes, we are going to \nhave a deficit. We understand that. We are currently in a war, and we \nunderstand even though the amount of additional money, some $48 \nbillion, that went into the war effort is totally inadequate, it is \ngoing to have to be more, and we are going to see deficits.\n  The other factor causing deficits is a downturn in the economy. We \nall know for every 1 percent drop in economic activity, that translates \ninto $24 billion of lost revenue. Turning that around, for every 1 \npercent increase in economic activity, revenue will increase by $24 \nbillion. It has been proven over and over throughout the history of \nthis country that every time we have had the opportunity and the \ncourage to reduce taxes, not raise taxes, it has resulted in increased \nrevenues.\n  The best evidence of this is 1980. My colleague from Florida talked \nabout the decade of the eighties, but let's look at what happened in \nthe decade of the eighties.\n  In the 1980s, the total amount of money that was raised from marginal \nrates was $244 billion. In 1990, that same figure was $406 billion. We \ncan see in a 10-year period revenue almost doubled, and that was the \n10-year period when we had more reductions in marginal rates and in \ncapital gains taxes and other taxes than any other 10-year period in \nthis Nation's history.\n  Is this a Republican idea? No, it is a conservative idea. Liberals do \nnot like to think we can return money to the people. They do not \nunderstand this adds to our economy. I hate to think of where we would \nbe today if we had not had the tax cuts because they have, in fact, had \na positive effect on the economy.\n  This is not a Republican idea. I remember a great President of the \nUnited States in the sixties. It was President Kennedy. President \nKennedy felt Government needed to do more for the Great Society. He \nsaid we are going to have to have more revenues. He said: The best way \nto increase revenues is to decrease taxes. So President Kennedy \ndecreased taxes and revenues increased.\n  Mr. President, I say to my liberal friends, I know they do not \nbelieve the private sector and individuals left with freedom in the \ntheir hands can operate as well as Government can. They are wrong.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9783-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9783-S9785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9783]]\n              NATIONAL 4-H YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WEEK\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, my wife and I have four kids and 11 \ngrandkids. My youngest daughter Katie is the chairman of the Jesse \nHelms Fan Club. Katie, who looks like she is about 14 or 15 years old, \nis in her thirties. She just had her second baby. She has, I say to my \ngood friend, Senator Helms, prominently framed as you walk in to her \nhome a picture of Senator Helms holding her first baby, Baby Kate. You \nsee, I have a wife named Kate, a daughter named Kate, and a \ngranddaughter named Kate. The picture is prominently displayed in her \nliving room.\n  She talks about this wonderful, gentle man in Washington who is \ndifferent than anybody else we have known in Washington. She says he \nhas to be the most lovable man in the history of Washington, DC.\n  Jesse, I say to you, that is not just one little girl talking. She \nspeaks for so many people.\n  Since one of the programs that Senator Helms has always held up and \nsaid is the greatest program because it does not involve Government \ndollars, it involves putting into the hands of young people in America \nthe ideals that made this country great, I thought it would be \nappropriate if we adopt S. Con. Res. 143, which is the 4-H resolution. \nThe Senator from North Carolina has been such a prominent part and one \nof the first cosponsors of this resolution. So let's adopt this \nresolution on Jesse Helms Appreciation Day.\n  My resolution, S. Con. Res. 143, designates next week, October 6 \nthrough 12, as the ``National 4-H Youth Development Program Week.''\n  The 4-H Youth Development Program sponsors clubs in rural and urban \nareas in every county throughout the Nation. As neighbors and \ncolleagues, 4-H members and volunteers are making a difference by \npledging the four Hs: their ``heads'' to a clearer thinking, ``hearts'' \nto greater loyalty, ``hands'' to larger service, and ``health'' to \nbetter living for the club, the community, the country, and the world.\n  In an era when education is recognized as more important than ever, \n4-H offers a variety of training through its diverse programs. Young \npeople gain experience and citizenship and civic education, \ncommunications and expressive arts, consumer and family sciences, \nenvironmental education and earth sciences, healthy lifestyle \neducation, personal development and leadership, plants and animals, and \nscience and technology; and it goes on.\n  4-H has grown to over 5 \\1/2\\ million annual participants from all \nethnic backgrounds, ranging from ages 5 to 19. 4-H clubs strengthen \nfamilies and communities and foster leadership and voluntarism for \nyouth and adults.\n  I will say something about my State of Oklahoma. Turning to a survey \nof 22 counties in Oklahoma, 4-H members and volunteer leaders \nparticipated in 4 million hours of community service. No Government \nprogram told them to do that. They just did it out of their hearts \nbecause they had leadership they could look up to, the ultimate leader \nbeing Senator Helms in this case.\n  Whitney Ferris, a 4-H club member and student at the Oklahoma State \nUniversity, is one example of someone who has given back to her \ncommunity. She has used skills she has developed through 4-H to conduct \nleadership development classes for Native Americans in the Chickasaw \nNation. As a result of her efforts, Whitney is now working with other \nNative American tribes in Oklahoma to help them establish development \nworkshops in order to learn skills that will make them tomorrow's \nleaders.\n  That is what we are really talking about: tomorrow's leaders. We \nwould like to produce more Jesse Helmses for this world.\n  Other OSU students, who are also 4-H members, have won the \nprestigious Truman Scholarship for their outstanding academic and \nleadership skills.\n  Recently, I supported 4-H by requesting funding for a national civic \neducation program to be conducted by the National 4-H Council. This \nprogram is aimed at involving young people from all socioeconomic \nbackgrounds in public policy and community involvement, with a special \nfocus on community governance and leadership skills.\n  I have also requested funding for an innovative Rural Health Outreach \nProgram, which will be administered through the 4-H Youth Development \nProgram.\n  This program will develop, implement and evaluate an overall youth \nhealth promotion and awareness strategy designed to target youth and \ntheir families, particularly in rural America. It will also devise \nstrategies to reach minority and disadvantaged youth and their \nfamilies.\n  4-H is changing the lives of America's youth for a brighter, better \ntomorrow and I am proud to recognize this important program.\n  Congratulations, 4-H, on your good work and your centennial.\n  I conclude by saying we have hundreds of thousands of kids around \nthis country who are participating today and have participated in this \nprogram. I think that each one of them would look up to the top and see \none person who really sets an example for what truly makes America \ngreat, and that would be our good friend Jesse Helms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of S. Con. Res. 143 and the Senate then \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 143) designating \n     October 6, 2002, through October 12, 2002, as ``National 4-H \n     Youth Development Program Week''.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution to designate next week as National 4-H Youth Development \nProgram Week. 4-H is a wonderful organization that promotes \nvolunteerism and leadership among this country's youth. With the \nparticipation of over 415,000 youth in New York State, 4-H is a \nwonderful organization devoted to enhancing the citizenship, \nleadership, and entrepreneurial abilities of youth.\n  4-H educates the young people in our country by giving them the \nopportunity to learn by doing. 4-H empowers our youth in their local \ncommunities, and encourages them to be active and to give back to their \ncommunity.\n  In New York State, there are many 4-H clubs that are doing incredible \nthings to help educate and shape our youth.\n  In New York City young people learn more about science through the \neducation programs of 4-H. In the middle of an urban area, they can \nlearn about agriculture and the source of their food through \nhorticulture and hydroponics projects.\n  In Syracuse 4-Hers are participating in an Urban Delight program \nwhere young people participate in a farmers' market. They learn about \nwhere their food comes from and develop their entrepreneurial skills as \nvendors at the market.\n  The Genesse County 4-H offers a Government internship program. Young \npeople are paired with county legislators to learn more about local \ngovernment. 4-Hers see first-hand the process of decisionmaking that \noccurs in their local government.\n  On Long Island, afterschool 4-H programs are enriching the minds of \nyoung people through science and technology education. 4-Hers spend \ntime in computer labs, learning about technology. 4-Hers are also \nparticipating in a science program thats taken a hands-on approach to \nlearning chemistry by doing projects on topics such as water quality, \noil slicks, and clothing fibers.\n  In New York's North Country, 4-H is alive and well. Youth have \ndeveloped their entrepreneurial skills through operating a fish \nhatchery. They also enrich their communication skills by choosing a \ntopic of interest and making presentations at local, regional, and \nState events.\n  4-H has made a commitment to be present on every military base. In \nparticular, Jefferson County 4-H has partnered with the Army at Fort \nDrumm to provide educational opportunities to young people there. \nMembers have access to national curriculum to provide them with the \nmaterials and information to pursue their interests.\n  4-H is a strong link between a State academic research institution, \nCornell\n\n[[Page S9784]]\n\nUniversity, and the youth of New York. When West Nile Virus was \ndetected in New York State, 4-Hers working with horses and other equine \nprojects were concerned for the health of their animals. Because of 4-\nH, information from the researchers at Cornell University was \ndisseminated to these young people to better educate them on the \ndisease and how to care for their animals.\n  4-H does incredible things for the 415,000 youth involved in New York \nState. But it also provides incredible opportunities for adults to \ninteract with young people. Over 22,000 adults have volunteered to help \nguide the young people and make 4-H programs so successful.\n  I congratulate 4-H on 100 years of helping to shape this country's \nyouth in a positive manner. With my colleagues, I am pleased to request \nthat October 6-12 be designated as National 4-H Youth Development \nProgram Week.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the youth \norganization 4-H for its achievement in developing leadership among our \nyouth for 100 years. I have always been impressed by the leadership and \nenthusiasm shown by members of the 4-H Program. More importantly, I \nhave always been a firm believer in the goals and directives of the 4-H \nProgram. Through participation in fairs and shows, camps, gatherings, \nconferences, Character Counts, and the international youth exchange, \nthe 4-H Program helps young people develop important life skills, self-\nconfidence, and a better sense of the world around them.\n  I was proud to cosponsor the National 4-H Program Centennial \nInitiative, which President Bush signed into law. This bill authorizes \na grant to the National 4-H Council to conduct a program of discussions \nthrough meetings, seminars, and listening on a national, State, and \nlocal level on strategies for youth development. I can't think of a \nbetter way to commemorate the 4-H Centennial than enacting this \nlegislation and looking ahead to the youth of our future.\n  The 4-H Centennial Initiative is a wonderful example of a public-\nprivate partnership to develop new strategies for youth development. As \nour economy becomes increasingly global and technology-oriented, we \nmust ensure that our Nation's youth are well-prepared for the ever-\nchanging demands and challenges they will most certainly face. The 4-H \nProgram has long been a developmental foundation for South Dakota \nyouth, and I am pleased that this initiative will honor the celebration \nof the 4-H Centennial and enhance this program for the 21st century.\n  Each time a young person recites the 4-H pledge, ``I pledge my head \nto clearer thinking, my heart to greater loyalty, my hands to larger \nservice, and my health to better living for my club, my community, my \ncountry, and my world,'' it reflects the important values and \ncharacteristics that guide 4-H members through their daily activities. \nThese principles have helped 4-H become strong over the last 100 years, \nand they will set the course for 4-H in the future. It is with great \nhonor that I have this opportunity to recognize such an outstanding \nyouth organization. On behalf of all past and present members of 4-H, I \ncongratulate the organization for its dedication, achievements, and \ncontinued success.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nacknowledge the 100th anniversary of the 4-H Youth Development Program \nand express my support for the ``National 4-H Youth Development Program \nWeek.''\n  Since its inception, 4-H has played an integral role in extending \nagricultural education to young people all over the country, \nparticularly in rural areas like Wyoming. Being a former 4-H member has \ngiven me an even greater appreciation of one of America's longest \nserving youth development organizations. The four H's--head, heart, \nhands, and health--are precepts I have never forgotten. I still \nremember as a high school student traveling away from home for the \nfirst time to the National 4-H Congress and the positive impact this \norganization has had on my life.\n  Today, there are over 60 million 4-H alumni world-wide, and the \norganization has expanded to meet new challenges of the 21st century. \nFor example, 4-H provides a number of educational projects and \nactivities in the areas of animal science, home economics, natural \nresources, handcrafts, as well as leadership and citizenship. Through \nthese programs, young men and women have the opportunity to meet new \nfriends, build self-confidence, learn to set and achieve goals, and \ndevelop a sense of pride as they ``learn by doing.'' These types of \nactivities underscore the importance of personal development, as well \nas encouraging our youth to become involved in their community. I am \npleased to note that more than 8,000 young people from the State of \nWyoming have chosen to make 4-H a part of their lives.\n  The motto of 4-H is ``To Make the Best Better.'' I know that the \norganization will continue to do just that and I commend their efforts \nto provide an even greater service to our country's most valuable \nnatural resource, our young people. I am pleased to join Senator Inhofe \nand many of my other Senate colleagues in support of 4-H and this \nConcurrent Resolution.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nresolution that Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, myself, and others today \noffer to designate next week, October 6-12, 2002, ``National 4-H Youth \nDevelopment Program Week''.\n  I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for initiating this well-deserved \ntribute to 4-H for being such a positive influence on tomorrow's \nleaders--as it has done so well for the past century.\n  Throughout the years I have met with many of Kansas's finest young \npeople. Many of whom I have recommended for scholarships and awards, \nhad the honor to nominate to one of the service academies, or had the \nchance to meet and visit with in person. I am impressed with the \ncaliber and character that the young leaders in my state possess. Mr. \nPresident, I am equally impressed with the high percentage of these \nleaders who happen to also be members of 4-H.\n  4-H is an organization that strives to ``Make the Best Better.'' I \ncommend them for their efforts in providing tomorrow's leaders with the \nopportunity to apply the valuable leadership skills that they develop \nas 4-H members.\n  Although 4-H began in rural America over a century ago and has grown \nto nearly 7 million members nation-wide, it has remained consistent in \nits focus of being a positive and motivating influence in the lives of \nAmerica's youth.\n  There is a reason that so many of the young leaders from my state \nhappen to also be 4-H members. 4-H has given them the guidance, the \nresources, the support, and most importantly the courage to face all \nthe challenges and responsibilities that being a leader involves.\n  The events of September 2001 have taught us that tomorrow's leaders \nwill continue to face new and difficult challenges. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I will also, in addition to offering well-deserved praise to \n4-H on a 100 years of success, issue 4-H the serious challenge to \ncontinue to work hard to keep the youth of today involved in their \nclubs and their communities, so that they may be prepared to assume the \nresponsibility of leadership when they are called to do so.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to again congratulate 4-H on a century of \nservice to our nation's youth and I wish them another 100 years of \nsuccess. I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the 4-H Youth Development Program and to thank my \ncolleagues for their support a resolution introduced by Senator Inhofe \nand myself last month. The resolution designates the week of October 6, \n2002 as ``National 4-H Youth Development Program Week'' and it was \nadopted by unanimous consent today.\n  Those who participate in 4-H pledge their heads for clearer thinking, \ntheir hearts to greater loyalty, their hands to larger service, and \ntheir health to better living for the club, the community, the country \nand the world.\n  I have been a member, a leader and an employee of 4-H. The skills and \ntalents I learned with 4-H are ones I still use today. When I was a \ngirl I learned to raise small animals, like rabbits. I also learned \nphotography, sewing, cooking and public speaking. Most importantly, 4-H \ngave me self confidence.\n  This important program also taught me that adults need to share their\n\n[[Page S9785]]\n\nskills and knowledge with children, and I was happy to share what I had \nlearned later as a 4-H leader. Eventually, I went to work for 4-H and \nset up an urban 4-H program in the south side of Lansing, MI where I \nlearned organizational skills. We went door to door recruiting children \nto join as members and identified adults who were willing to volunteer \nand share their knowledge and skills with the children. Soon we had a \nnumber of groups on topics like auto mechanics, carpentry, sewing and \ngardening, as well as a sports program.\n  I am proud that 4-H is celebrating its 100th anniversary. It is a \npleasure to be one of the lead cosponsors of the bill designating a \nweek in honor of 4-H. I wish this organization many more years of \nsuccess, and I know that future generations of children and families \nwill have a better quality of life because of 4-H.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements regarding this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pleasure but also \nsadness that I come today to pay tribute to the great Senator from \nNorth Carolina--sadness because I have enjoyed so much knowing him and \nworking with him over the last 30 years, watching him in the Senate and \nin North Carolina and across America, loving him in so many ways and \nbeing inspired by him.\n  I remember when I first came to the Senate, he said: Thank goodness \nthe cavalry is arriving.\n  I said: Senator Helms, we will be glad to be the light cavalry for \nyour heavy artillery any day.\n  So it is a moment of sadness but also of celebration of a great life, \na great Senator, a lovely wife and a great family. Dot Helms is just \nthe sweetest woman in the world. We come today to wish them much \nhappiness and many years of enjoying their grandchildren and their \nbeloved home in North Carolina in the years ahead. So it is with mixed \nemotions.\n  When the Duke of Wellington peered through his spyglass and saw \nNapoleon astride his white charger crossing the field of Waterloo, he \nturned to an aide and said, ``The wave of his hat is worth 40,000 men \non the field.''\n  For me, and many others, that is the way it is when Jesse Helms walks \non to the floor of the Senate. Like his mentor Richard Russell, a \nDemocrat, Jesse Helms transcends his times. He is the Senator's \nSenator.\n  To many of us, Jesse Helms is a hero of almost mythic proportions. To \nthose of us from the South, he exemplifies what we were taught in \nSunday school and aspired to be--the true gentleman, soft spoken, \ninnately fair, unfailingly courteous, and a man to whom his word is his \nbond. That is the Jesse Helms that so many of the staffers and so many \nof us know on a personal basis. It is not necessarily the one that one \nhas seen portrayed sometime in the media, but that is the one we really \nknow, an incomparable gentleman.\n  For 30 years, he has combined the rare qualities of humility and \nvision; love of country and statesmanship; and a faith in God and \nfreedom that made him a legend across many parts of America and around \nthe world.\n  Senator Helms believes that the most sublime word in the English \nlanguage is ``duty''--duty to God, to country, to the Constitution, and \nto family.\n  As I noted, if one reads some of the national media, they get a \ncompletely different impression. He long ago was labeled ``Senator \nNo,'' and they condemned him to the liberal version of purgatory. I \nthink what really made him mad was that Senator Helms was the one \npolitician who never really cared too much about what the chattering \nclasses had to say. After all, he had been one of them. He pays \nattention to the English language. He was a journalist. He had higher \ncommitments on which he was focused.\n  What counts to Jesse Helms in the end is what people say in Monroe, \nRocky Mount, Dunn, the larger cities and hundreds of small towns and \nchurches across the ``Old North State,'' as they call it in North \nCarolina.\n  Jesse likes to tell a story recounted to him by another great North \nCarolinian, the late Senator Sam Ervin, also a Democrat. When ``Senator \nSam'' picked up a copy of the Charlotte Observer one day and read what \nit had to say about him, he shook his head in disgust. The fellow \nselling the paper was an old man named Lum Garrison. Senator Helms \nliked to talk about Lum Garrison.\n  When Lum saw how upset the Senator was, he said: Don't worry, Sam. \nThe Charlotte Observer don't know nothing and they got it mixed up.\n  Incidentally, it was Jesse's friend Sam Ervin who walked out of his \nhome in Morganton, NC, when Senator Helms was in the political fight of \nhis life in 1984, faced down the news media and endorsed Jesse Helms \nfor reelection. Senator Ervin bucked his own party and his Governor \nwhen he said there are many intelligent people in public life but few \nof them are courageous. Jesse Helms is courageous. That was from Sam \nErvin.\n  If we listen to what some people say, we would not know that Jesse is \nthe son of a small town sheriff, and that he and his beloved wife of 60 \nyears, Dorothy--or ``Dot''--have three children, one of them adopted, \nand seven grandchildren. We would not know that Jesse Helms was the \nfather of the United Cerebral Palsy Telethon and that he never lost an \nelection, whether it was for the Raleigh city council or the Senate. We \nwould not know it was Jesse Helms who defied a sitting Republican \nPresident to rescue the moribund candidacy of a former actor and \nGovernor of California in the 1976 North Carolina Republican primary, \nthus laying the groundwork for the Reagan revolution 4 years later. We \nwould not know that the positions he championed singlehandedly for so \nmany years, the sanctity of life, smaller government, lower taxes, \nwelfare reform, prayer in schools, and an American-centered foreign \npolicy are now in the mainstream of American political thought.\n  Senator Helms is an uncompromising foe of the enemies of freedom. \nWhen some politicians were trying to make peace with communism, \naccepting the ``inevitability of history,'' Jesse jeered the Soviet \nUnion and its acolytes, echoing Winston Churchill's words,\n\n[[Page S9786]]\n\n``We will have no parley with Communists or the grisly gang who worked \ntheir wicked will.'' He gave inspiration to Margaret Thatcher and \nAlexander Solzhenitsen and freedom fighters throughout the world. He \nwas a friend of Sadat and Begin and championed the cause of the \nAmerican military when that cause was in some ways out of favor.\n  In the 1970s, when some people would say freedom was in retreat, no \none was as fearless or courageous in crusading for liberty as Jesse \nHelms. When he spoke, the Kremlin and Castro trembled.\n  The great English Prime Minister William Gladstone noted that the \nSenate was one of the most remarkable political institutions invented \nby the mind of men.\n  This place has been witness to some great giants, men and women, who \nhave made a difference. Obviously, we all think about Webster and Clay \nand Calhoun and Russell. When Jesse Helms retires to North Carolina \nwith Dot, he will join this rollcall of American heroes and take with \nhim the thanks of a grateful Nation.\n  We won't see his like again anytime soon. You have earned, Senator \nHelms, as you leave this institution, the recognition of having done \nthe job, having completed the race.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. ``Well done, my good and faithful servant.'' Thank you so \nmuch for what you have done for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues today in \nthanking Senator Helms for his extraordinary service to our Nation.\n  When I was younger, in my college days, going through my early \nexperience in government in New Hampshire--which tends to be in the \nmore liberal bastions of the regions of our Nation, dominated by those \non the left--in the press, with whom Jesse Helms has dueled for so many \nyears, Senator Helms was characterized sometimes in not all that \nflattering a manner by the news outlets to which I had recourse, such \nas the Boston Globe or New York Times or even the national media.\n  But you could sense, cutting through all that clutter, this was an \nindividual of courage and purpose, a man who stood for what he believed \nin and was willing to carry those beliefs forward, even when they were \nnot popular.\n  His direction, his willingness to stand up and say what he believed \nwas right, is the essence of what it takes to be an effective member of \na legislative body, in my opinion. But, more important even than that--\nmaybe not more important but equally important as his commitment to his \npurpose and his cause, was the fact that he did it in such a \ngentlemanly way. I do not believe there has been an individual who has \npassed through this body since I have been here--and I haven't been \nhere that long--who has been as courteous and as generous and as kind \nas he dealt with people around him. He is the true gentleman.\n  Two of my children had the opportunity to serve here as pages. In \ncomments to me after their days working here, there were some instances \nwhere people had not necessarily been all that kind to them. But the \none comment that always came through was that Senator Helms was the \nmost interested in them, the kindest person, the person who always took \nthe extra time to come down and talk with the pages. That reflected his \nattitude towards all of us. When I first arrived in the Senate, he made \nan extra effort to make me feel comfortable as a new Member. It is that \ncourtesy which really defines his nature so well. So we are going to \nmiss him immensely. He is, has been, and I am sure will continue to be \na spokesperson for many of the causes in which I believe and which he \nhas done so effectively.\n\n  We will miss him because he brought grace, decency, and courtesy to \nthis body. So it is a pleasure for me to rise and thank him, with my \ncolleagues, for his exceptional service to our Nation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today we bid farewell in an official \nsort of way to our friend and colleague from North Carolina, whose \ncareer has, indeed, been extraordinary. As Senator Lott and Senator \nGregg have said, if you took a poll around here of people who actually \nwork in the Capitol--the pages, the staff, and the Senators--Senator \nHelms would win hands down as the nicest man in the Senate.\n  There is an extraordinary disconnect between the Jesse Helms that we \nknow and love and the one portrayed in the media, an incredible \ndisconnect, because nothing could be further from the real Jesse Helms \nthan the one frequently portrayed by the fourth estate.\n  How did that come about? I think it came about for this reason, as \nwas said of our friend Jesse by Fred Barns, one of the most respected \nconservative columnists and commentators around town:\n\n       Helms has gained respect, not as many conservatives have, \n     by moving left. Helms has earned it the hard way, by not \n     moving at all.\n\n  By not moving at all. There are convenience politicians and \npoliticians with conviction. Jesse Helms is the most conspicuous \nexample in the Senate today of a politician who acts on conviction. So \nas a result of that, he enjoys wide respect throughout the Senate, both \nleft and right, because we know when Jesse speaks he is speaking from \nthe heart. He is doing exactly what he thinks is in the best interest \nof his State and in the best interest of America.\n  There is an enormous temptation once you come here, even if you think \nyou are somewhat conservative, to try to please your critics; to pick \nup the editorial page of the New York Times or Washington Post every \nmorning and just move in that direction because there is a tendency on \nthe part of everyone, and I think particularly those in public life, to \nwant to be liked. They want to be appreciated. Senator Helms has \nresisted that temptation.\n  After I first came to the Senate--of course, I had admired him for \nmany years--I went by his office to see him, and I looked up on his \nwall and there was a vast collection of cartoons. I am sure Senator \nHelms will agree with me, not many of them were complimentary. It \nstruck me instantly that this was a man who really delighted in \nconfounding his critics; in not yielding to those kinds of attacks. \nThat, it seems to me, is a man of principle and of conviction.\n  Jesse and I had one other thing in common. That was the burden of \ndealing with a particular agricultural commodity that is quite common \nin our two States. I might say to my friend, Senator Helms, I had a \nchief of staff one time who said you ought to get combat pay for \nworking for a Kentucky Senator because on the agenda every week, of \ncourse, we had the tobacco issue, America's most politically incorrect \nactivity. So as soon as I got to the Senate in 1985, I was immediately \nthrown into one of the many crises. It seems as if we have nothing but \ncrises in the tobacco area. But indeed the crisis of the day in 1985 \nwas the Tobacco Reform Act. I had a chance to get to know Jesse up \nclose and personal very quickly after getting to the Senate because we \nhad a common interest in trying to protect the income and the \nlivelihood of thousands of tobacco growers in our State who make a \nliving raising a legal crop.\n  These are Godfearing, honest people engaged in a legal activity who \nhave been under assault certainly for as long as I have been here, and \nI know it started before I got here. So Jesse and I had a bonding \nexperience trying to deal with the politics of tobacco, a situation in \nwhich tobacco growing is popular in two States and which is widely \nlooked down on in 48 others. Those are some of the challenges we have \nshared over the years.\n  I also have particularly appreciated Senator Helms' strength and \nconviction in the foreign policy area, an area to which you have \ndevoted an enormous amount of your time during your service here. There \nis no question you have made an enormous difference through your \nleadership as both chairman and ranking Member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. We all look up to you. We admire your work.\n  As others have said, and as others will say after I sit down, you \nwill be missed around here. We love you and we love Dot. It won't quite \nseem the same with you not around. But I know that you will go back \nhome and enjoy North Carolina and enjoy your family.\n\n[[Page S9787]]\n\nI am confident you will keep up with what we are up to, and, if you \ndisapprove of anything we are doing, I expect you will call us. We will \nlook forward to receiving your advice.\n  Let me say good-bye in an official sort of way to your tenure here in \nthe Senate. I quoted Washingtonian Magazine which recognized Jesse \nHelms as ``The Nicest Senator.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9787-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9787-S9804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an order for morning business until \n11:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. There appears to be a number of people who wish to speak \nfor Senator Helms, and we are happy about that. We also want to make \nsure we have our half hour from 11 a.m. until 11:30. I think it would \nbe in everyone's best interest to extend morning business until 12:30--\nan additional hour--and equally divided between both sides. I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this is a happy day in the Senate. We are \nhere to talk about our buddy, Jesse Helms. It is a sad day in that we \ntalk about Jesse Helms leaving. Other than the Senator from Alaska, \nthere is no one who has served longer with Jesse Helms than I have. We \ncame here during the same election cycle, and we came here the same \nday. We started off with a rocky start. I was a 30-year-old kid who had \nonly been in this Senate once before in my life. That was when I came \non the floor of the U.S. Senate while spending a weekend at Georgetown \nUniversity. Back in those days, you didn't have all the guards and all \nthe security. I came in Saturday morning. I was mesmerized by this \nmagnificent place. I walked in the back doors. They were open. I walked \nright through. The Senate had been in on Saturday. I was unaware it had \nbeen in session. By the time I got here, it had gone out of session. I \nliterally walked onto the floor of the Senate. I was absolutely, as \nkids used to say, blown away. I stood there in awe. I literally stood \nat that door. I walked up there. No one was here. I stood where the \nPresiding Officer was. The next thing I knew, this guy grabbed me by \nthe shoulder and put me under arrest. He was a Capitol policeman. He \ntook me downstairs.\n  Most people do not know there is a Capitol police office in the \nbasement of the Capitol. He took me down there, and he was going to \narrest me for trespassing. He realized I was just a college kid who was \nin awe. They didn't do anything. They just said do not do it again.\n  The next time I was on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and the first \ntime I really spoke spontaneously on the floor, was to my friend Jesse \nHelms. I remember he was a junior Senator with immense experience. He \nhad been an administrative assistant to one of the leading Senators in \nthe U.S. Senate. He knew the place. He knew the system. He was standing \nat the desk, if I recollect, in that quadrant in the back. He was on \nthe floor. There was another Senator from Kentucky named Marlow Cook \nwho was standing on the floor. He was moving what is the most thankless \njob in the U.S. Senate for any Senator other than being on the D.C. \nCommittee; that is, he had the responsibility of moving the legislative \nappropriations bill.\n  I walked onto the floor to see what was going on. I was literally \nwalking through. We had a committee meeting which had ended. I walked \nover to see what the state of play was. I was aware of the junior \nSenator from North Carolina. My seat used to be in the very back \ncorner. I walked onto the floor through that door, walked across, and \nstopped where the junior Senator from North Carolina was. There was a \nheated debate going on between the junior Senator from North Carolina--\nSam Ervin was the senior Senator--and Marlow Cook, the Senator from \nKentucky. It was about either staff pay or Senators' pay, or whatever \nit was, and the Senator from North Carolina, as usual, was making a \nvery compelling case as to why we should be basically not paying \nanything.\n  I am only kidding, Jesse. It was close to that.\n  I stood there on the floor, and as I have done many times in my 30-\nyear career in the U.S. Senate, I did not listen to the admonition I am \ntold you used to be given by the Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn. I \nam told in his board-of-education way he used to say to new Members of \nthe House back in the 1950s, If you can say nothing, say nothing; if \nyou can nod, don't speak; if you don't have to nod, don't do anything \nor something to that effect, meaning keep your mouth shut.\n  I have often broken that rule, unfortunately. I stood there listening \nto this debate, and I spoke up. I made the mistake of taking on the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  He won't remember this.\n  The result was I ended up with a black-box editorial--literally, an \neditorial on the front page of the New Hampshire Manchester Union \nLeader with a big black box around it, which used to be done by Mr. \nLoeb in those days, talking about the audacity of the young Senator \nfrom Delaware taking on the point being made by the Senator from North \nCarolina. That was my first encounter of debating the Senator. It \nwarranted me a front-page article in the Manchester Union Leader that \nwas not flattering at all, which taught me two things. No. 1, if you \nare going to debate the Senator from North Carolina, come prepared with \nthe facts. No. 2, understand that his reach goes far beyond North \nCarolina.\n  It did even then as a new U.S. Senator, a freshman U.S.\n  Senator, the Senator from North Carolina, walked on this floor. From \nthe day he arrived, he had an impact. I do not think that can be said \nof anyone, I say to Senator Helms, in our class. We had a big class. \nThere were, I think, 13 new Members that year. Far and away, the man \nwho stood out was the Senator from North Carolina. He has stood out \nevery day since then.\n  It is no surprise to anyone here the Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Helms, and I have not always seen eye to eye. We come from \ndifferent political points on the spectrum. We have had some heated \ndebates. The Senator advocated some positions I would fight to my dying \nday to defeat as he would things I proposed which he feels in principle \nare not the way to go.\n  One of the magic things about this place I learned from Senators with \nwhom Senator Helms and I served when we first got here--Senators such \nas Goldwater, Humphrey, and Kennedy--is you can have serious \ndisagreements on this floor about the direction of this Nation, but \nthat is no excuse to be personally disagreeable.\n  I can remember--as my friend from North Carolina can, as can my \nfriend from New Mexico, who came the same year, and as can the Senator \nfrom Alaska, who was here before us--the day when Hubert Humphrey \nwalked on the floor literally dying, and we watched Barry Goldwater \nwalk up to him, embrace him, and put his arms around him in that well, \nand both of them cried. These were men of opposite sides of the \npolitical spectrum of the day--two leading figures in American politics \nrepresenting the left and the right, and they stood in that well and \nembraced. They embraced in an emotional moment no one could \nmisunderstand the meaning of. It was real. It was genuine. It was deep.\n  It is, in my view, the unique and, I think, single most endearing \nfeature of this body, the U.S. Senate.\n  If we serve here long enough, and if we are smart enough, we \nunderstand that it is not appropriate to question the motivation of a \nSenator for what he or she is proposing. It is totally appropriate to \nquestion their judgment. It is totally appropriate to question whether \nthey are right. It is totally appropriate to disagree. But it is \ninappropriate to question the motivation of a Senator because the men \nand women who come here are men and women of honor. They come here \nbecause they care deeply about the fate of their Nation. They care \ndeeply about specific issues, and some intensely on some issues.\n  The thing that I think the Senator from North Carolina embodies most \nis that tradition that no matter how intensely you disagree on the \nissue, the\n\n[[Page S9788]]\n\nSenator from North Carolina, speaking for myself, has never, ever \nquestioned my motive, never, ever questioned my desire to do good, \nwhether or not he thought what I was proposing would, in fact, ``do \ngood.''\n  We have not agreed on a lot of things, but we have also agreed on an \nawful lot of things. I can tell you that I will miss Senator Helms.\n  Let me tell you, with, as they say in this body, a point of personal \nprivilege, a few stories about Senator Helms.\n  There are two figures remaining in the Senate who are, for either \npolitical extreme, left and right--left of the Democratic Party and \nright of the Republican Party--who are lightning rods. It is Senator \nHelms in the Republican Party and Senator Kennedy in the Democratic \nParty. They are sort of the icons of both parties. They are men who are \nrevered in their parties. They are both nationally known.\n  I can say what a lot of people don't know about the Senator from \nNorth Carolina: For all the intensity with which he takes on issues, \nfor all the depth of his feelings about issues that are so socially \nhighly charged--left and right--this is a man who has a very, very soft \nside.\n  I had gone to the Senator, when I was the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and indicated to him--not even asking but \nlamenting--the fact that I did not have enough staff allowance to hire \ncertain people. And the Senator from North Carolina said: Take my \nmoney. The Senator from North Carolina said: Who do you need? What do \nyou need? OK.\n  He did not have to do that, by the way. Many other committees around \nhere fight tooth and nail over exactly who is going to get to be the \ndoorman to whether or not you have to sign off to get stationery. Not \nthe Senator from North Carolina, not the Senator from North Carolina.\n  When I was ill, it was the Senator from North Carolina who was on the \nphone immediately checking to talk to my doctors to make sure he \nthought I had the right doctors, and checking at Walter Reed regularly \nto see how I was doing.\n  If you want to understand something about Senator Helms, you ought to \nmeet Mrs. Helms.\n  If you met Mrs. Helms, who is one of the finest, most decent women I \nhave ever met--she is the definition of a lady--you would understand \nthe depth of Jesse Helms. For a woman of her grace, a woman of her \ncompassion, a woman of her depth, to love and be devoted to this man as \ndeeply as she is, you know, you know, you know there has to be \nsomething awfully, awfully, awfully good about Jesse Helms.\n\n  My mom has an expression. She says: If my children love somebody, I \nlove them, too, because I know how good they are and they could not \nlove unless there was something there.\n  Dot Helms adores Jesse Helms, as he adores her. Those of us who have \nhad the privilege to serve with Jesse up close and personal for a long \ntime have seen some of what Mrs. Helms has seen and what a lot of the \nworld does not see. They see the gentlemanly side of him. They see the \ncourtly side of him. They appreciate him. But they do not fully \nunderstand the depth of the compassion, the depth of the friendship, \nthe depth of the loyalty that resides in that man Jesse Helms.\n  There was a guy named Bud Nance. If you knew Bud Nance, you knew \nJesse Helms. If you knew how Bud Nance adored Jesse Helms, that would \nbe the second piece of evidence you would know of what a fine man this \nman Jesse Helms is.\n  Jesse, I love you. I think you are dead wrong on the issues, still. I \ndisagree with you completely. As you said, when I cast my 10,000th \nvote, you congratulated me as the youngest man in history to have cast \n10,000 votes, and lamented it would have been better had I cast some of \nthem the right way. And I understand. We both feel that way about each \nother's voting record.\n  But I want you to know how I personally feel about you and how I \nthink the vast majority--anybody who has gotten to work with you as \nclosely as I have--feels about you. I am going to sincerely miss you, \nJesse. And we are going to miss your courtly manners. We are going to \nmiss the fact that whenever there is a crunch, one of the first guys to \nstep up to offer help is Jesse Helms.\n  But I have no doubt you will still be there for me. I have no doubt \nyou will still be there for the rest of us. We need you.\n  Some think Jesse Helms and I could not possibly see eye to eye, that \nwe come from opposite points on the political spectrum. There is no \ndenying that is true.\n  Senator Helms has advocated some positions I would fight to my dying \nbreath to defeat but he also represents the best of this institution. \nHe is a friend, an honorable Senator who holds boldly to his values, \nand yet has always held to the civility of debate in the pursuit of \ncomity.\n  Some said he and I couldn't possibly work together on the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  In fact, I think we have worked very well together and I think he \nwould agree.\n  We may not have agreed on many of the important issues that have \nfaced this Nation. In fact, we probably haven't agreed on most of them.\n  But I can say this: I will deeply miss Senator Helms. I will miss his \nvoice in this Chamber. I will miss his counsel. I will miss his genuine \nkindness. His devotion to his duty and the dignity with which he \nunfailingly performs it.\n  I will miss his brand of leadership. That determined, dedicated, \nforceful, committed leadership, that leadership that comes from a deep \nand abiding concern for this Nation and from deeply held values and \nbeliefs which he fights to uphold.\n  And, yes, I will miss his warmth. Though some might not always see \nit, it is there, I can assure you.\n  Some of my more combative Democratic friends might be skeptical of me \nfor saying these things, but they don't know Jesse Helms like I do.\n  They don't know that even if you find yourself precariously balanced \non your side of the political spectrum, in the heat of a debate, \nwhether it is on foreign aid, on issues of war and peace, civil rights, \nequal rights, constitutional law, whatever the issue, Senator Helms may \ndisagree with you and point out the holes in your argument, but you can \ncount on him to hold out his hand.\n  He holds strong views, but he is exceedingly respectful--a gentleman \ncommitted to his position but willing to listen to yours.\n  He is, in the truest sense, a man of honor and considerable decency. \nAnd, quite frankly, there are no qualifies more important to this \nChamber.\n  Few Senators in my tenure have played as significant a role in the \naffairs of this Nation as Jesse Helms.\n  But the most remarkable thing about this man is that, not \nwithstanding his impeccable conservative credentials, when confronted \nwith new facts and new ideas, he has always been at least willing to \nlisten.\n  A perfect example was his leadership in reconciling and restoring the \nposition of the United States at the U.N.\n  And, while chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he directed \nand accomplished the most significant reorganization of the State \nDepartment in recent memory.\n  Having served with Jesse Helms for almost 30 years, I can tell you, \non a personal level, he is one of the most thoughtful, considerate, and \ngracious Senators to grace this Chamber.\n  If you knew Mrs. Helms, his beloved Dot, you would know why he is \nthis way.\n  Senator Helms and I arrived here the same day and took the oath \ntogether.\n  Before he came, he served in the Navy in World War II. As a \nbroadcaster and journalist, Senate staffer, editor of a banking \npublication that he made the largest in the Nation, a broadcaster CEO, \neditorial writer, city councilman, a Baptist deacon, a Sunday school \nteacher, and a U.S. Senator, Jesse Helms has served with distinction.\n  These 30 years have passed all too quickly. But I am honored to have \nknown him. I am proud to have worked with him, especially over these \nlast 6 years.\n  I have learned much from him, and will continue to seek his counsel \nand his advice.\n  William Penn said, ``A good friend . . . advises justly, assists \nreadily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously, \nand continues a friend unchangeably,'' Jesse Helms has been a good \nfriend, and I expect to continue our friendship as well as our debate \nlong after he leaves this Chamber. He will, indeed, be missed.\n\n[[Page S9789]]\n\n  I thank my colleagues for the extended time. I could talk for an hour \nabout what a good man Jesse Helms is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to be able to come \ndown this morning and speak to my colleague and on his behalf, a \ncolleague who I have now had the privilege of serving with for 4 years \nin the Senate.\n  I say, first, to Senator Helms, and to Dot, his wife, thank you for \nthe extraordinary kindness you have shown to myself, my wife, and my \nfamily. Senator Helms knows--and Jimmy Broughton is sitting beside him, \nand other members of his staff are on the floor--he also has an \nextraordinary group of people working with him, not just here in \nWashington but also back in North Carolina, because our folks in North \nCarolina have had the privilege of working with Senator Helms' staff in \nNorth Carolina.\n  As I said--and I am sure Senator Helms heard while he was off taking \ncare of his health--his office ran very smoothly. Sometimes I think, \nSenator Helms, both of our offices run more smoothly when we are not \nthere. But they did a terrific job in your absence. I know you are not \nsurprised to hear that, but we are proud of the work they did. I know \nyou are proud of the work they did then and have always done on your \nbehalf.\n  I have had the privilege of going around my State for the last 4 \nyears now, talking to people about what they need, the problems they \nare faced with--whether it is farmers, whether it is textile workers \nwho have lost their jobs, people trying to get a relative a visa, \nwhatever it is--and you cannot hardly move in North Carolina without \nfinding people who Senator Helms has touched over the time he has been \nin the Senate.\n  The people of North Carolina will never forget the work and the \nkindness and the personal attention that he has given to them. He has \nbeen a relentless advocate for the people of our State and all the \nproblems they face.\n  The people here in Washington and around the rest of the country see \na certain side of Senator Helms. Senator Biden just mentioned this. \nSenator Helms knows well he and I do not agree about a lot of things, \nbut there is a side of him that most people here in Washington do not \nget to see, at least not publicly--the people who work in the Senate \nsee it--which is the extraordinary kindness and friendship that he \nshows basically to anyone who touches him.\n  We had a meeting of Senators a few weeks ago to talk about how we \nshould deal, as publicly elected officials, with people who we \nrepresent who are faced with a tragedy of one kind or another. And I \nused Senator Helms as the best example I could ever imagine for someone \nwho knows how to deal with those kinds of problems, having had a \npersonal experience with Senator Helms on that level. I say here, as I \nhave said to him before, myself, my wife, my family, we will never \nforget--as long as I am alive--the way Senator Helms treated us during \nthat time.\n  It meant an unbelievable amount to us, Senator.\n  I thank him on our behalf. I thank him on behalf of all of the people \nof North Carolina for whom he has done so much for so long, the many \nlives that he touched, in a very positive way, below the radar screen, \nin ways that people don't see or don't hear but, more importantly, they \nknow about. I thank him personally for being my friend during the time \nI have been in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues rising not to \nbury Jesse Helms but to praise him. We can take Shakespeare and turn \nhim on his head for just a moment.\n  I find it interesting that there are some people in the press \ngallery. That is not very often the case in this situation, in this \ncircumstance in the Senate. I welcome the presence of reporters who \nwill pay attention now as Senators talk about Jesse Helms, because the \npress, for Jesse's entire political career, has made a caricature of \nthis man, outlined him as some kind of a demon, some kind of an anti-\nintellectual, some kind of a throwback to an earlier time, and that the \nbody politic would be best served if somehow he could be removed from \nit.\n  He has demonstrated his appeal to the voters of his State and has \nstoutly resisted the attempts of those to remove him from politics. Now \nhe has decided that the time for retirement has come. He is leaving at \nthe top of his game and on his own terms.\n  I listened to the stories being told by those who have served with \nJesse for a long period of time. I have not had that privilege because \nI have not been here that long. I have my own story to add, which \ndemonstrates a side of Jesse that needs to be on the record and, once \nagain, people in the press need to understand about this man.\n  My story arose from the fact that I, too, disagree with Jesse Helms \non occasion. The issue on which I disagree with Jesse Helms has to do \nwith the National Endowment for the Arts. I have been dedicated to \nsupport for the arts all of my life. I have been enriched by \nassociation with the arts. In my home, food was a necessity, but music \nlessons for the children were almost as big a necessity, at my wife's \ninsistence. We have supported the symphony, operas, things of that \nkind, all of our lives.\n  So when the Gingrich revolution occurred in 1994 and the House sent \nus an appropriations bill that would have eliminated the National \nEndowment for the Arts, I found myself in that battle. We came to a \nlate night session where the fight was rising as to what would happen \nin this situation. I had expressed myself on one side of that issue and \nhad not realized what I had done by virtue of that expression because \nas we were in the Republican cloakroom that late night, someone said to \nSenator Dole: What about the NEA? As he walked through these doors on \nto the floor, leaving us all behind, he said: Bennett is going to \nhandle that.\n  I suddenly realized I had a responsibility I hadn't known about. I \ntook up what could only be called Kissingerian shuttle diplomacy \nbetween the Republican cloakroom, between Jesse Helms and Ted Kennedy \nand Pat Leahy on the other side, and back and forth. Finally, I arrived \nat a deal. I thought I understood the terms of the deal and took it \nback to the Democratic cloakroom: If you will allow this, Jesse will \nallow that. We will get it all done.\n  Grumbling and complaining a little, the Democrats said: All right, we \nwill at least keep the NEA alive. We will give Jesse his pound of \nflesh. We don't like it, but this is where we are.\n  I reported that to Slade Gorton, chairman of the subcommittee \nhandling the appropriations. He said: It is too late at night.\n  My memory is, this was about 10:30 or 11.\n  He said: It is too late tonight. We will do it first thing in the \nmorning.\n  The next morning came. I went to Slade and repeated the terms of the \ndeal as I had understood them. He said: Fine, let's go ahead.\n  Jesse was in the cloakroom, and I went to the cloakroom to tell him \nwe were about to implement this deal. He looked at me--a very young, \nnew, fresh Senator--and he said: Senator, that is not my understanding. \nThat is not what I agreed to.\n  My heart fell. I didn't know what to say. Here was this pillar of the \nSenate who had staked his reputation on this particular fight, and he \nsaid: If I agree with that, that means that I have agreed to vote \nagainst my own amendment. I can't do that.\n  I looked at him in great agony, and I said: Senator, this will set \noff a whole filibuster, a whole disaster on the other side. I have told \nthe Democrats that this is what it would be.\n  That is what I had understood. I didn't have any solution. I was just \nthere trying to figure out where I had gone wrong in going back and \nforth.\n  Jesse Helms looked at me, and he said: Senator, that is not my \nunderstanding of what we agreed to last night. But if that is your \nunderstanding and you have pledged your word to the other side that \nthat is what you will deliver, I will honor your agreement.\n  There are not many around here who would do that, not many Senators \nwho would take a position that was contrary to that which they had \npublicly espoused for decades, to keep an agreement, when the Senator \nbelieved the\n\n[[Page S9790]]\n\nagreement was not what he had agreed to. There are not many senior \nSenators who would defend the honor of a junior Senator to make sure \nthat the junior Senator was not embarrassed.\n  I have told that story a lot. I have told that story to the \nsupporters in the NEA, both in my home State and in Washington. I have \nsaid to them: You need to understand Jesse Helms. Yes, you will \ndisagree with him. You believe that he is a philistine when it comes to \nthe arts; you don't understand how he can possibly hold the position. \nBut you need to understand the integrity of this man, the compassion of \nthis man, and the willingness of this man to keep alive important \npersonal relationships to see to it that the Senate works.\n  This was an action on his part to see to it that the Senate worked. I \nam grateful to have had the experience. I am grateful for the \nopportunity of repeating it to those who might not understand this man. \nAnd like those who have spoken before, I will miss him.\n  I pay whatever tribute I can in my humble way to the public service \nand the public integrity and the example of Jesse Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in an era when courtly manners are seldom \nobserved or practiced, my friend Jesse Helms has embodied the spirit of \na true southern gentleman. For almost 30 years, Senator Helms has \nprovided a model of gentlemanly bearing for a younger generation that \nis used to much more casual conduct. His old-fashioned gentility will \nbe sorely missed in these Halls.\n  The two of us have been together a great many long nights in the \nSenate. Despite his gentle southern drawl, it has never been difficult \nto figure out where Jesse Helms stands. He has held passionately to his \nconvictions and has worked hard for what he believes are the best \ninterests of the people of our Nation and North Carolina.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms has dealt \nwith international issues of deep importance which have had global \nimpact.\n  As I have worked with others here on defense matters over these long \nyears, there has been no greater patriot for this country on this floor \nthan Jesse Helms. He has always supported the men and women who wear \nour uniform. He has been a true stalwart in fighting for national \ndefense.\n  Jesse Helms is a tough guy. He hasn't let aches or pains, which have \nsidelined some folks, stop him from performing his responsibilities as \na Senator. When our daughter, Lily, now a senior at Stanford, was a \ntoddler and used to visit the Senate Halls, she could always count on \nJesse for a smile and for making her feel special and welcome. She told \nme she has great memories of those days and Jesse Helms. Like Strom \nThurmond, Lily looks on Jesse Helms as one of her uncles, and we are \nproud of that.\n  Mr. President, saying farewell to my friend that I have known for \nthese three decades is difficult. There aren't many of us left, Jesse. \nWe are going to miss you, and we are going to miss Dot. Dot's happy \nsmile and her energy has been a great support for Jesse, and as we wish \nhim Godspeed, we want to include Dot, too, because they are a team.\n  As they enter this new phase of their lives, we thank them for their \ndedication and hard work, for the elegant manners they have brought to \nthe Senate, and for all that you have done to earn what we are saying \ntoday.\n  You deserve every word I have heard today, Jesse. You are a great \nfriend, a great patriot, and I hate to see you go.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Hagel, is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join our colleagues \nin recognizing a part of an institution that unto himself is an \ninstitution.\n  Senator Helms will retire this year after five distinguished terms in \nthe Senate. He has had a remarkable 30 years of service in the Senate.\n  Senator Helms began his service to our country in the U.S. Navy \nduring World War II. He has always been a supporter of a strong U.S. \nmilitary and the need for a forward thinking National Security Policy. \nAfter his military service, Senator Helms had a colorful career as an \neditorial commentator in radio, television and print media. He also \nserved as Administrative Assistant to United States Senators Willis \nSmith (D-NC) and Alton Lennon (D-NC) in the early 1950's. His interest \nin serving the public continued to grow as he served on the Raleigh \nCity Council from 1957 to 1961 while working in the banking industry. \nBeyond his extensive list of leadership positions in numerous \norganizations, Senator Helms has filled his life with philanthropy. He \nhas been active in research on cerebral palsy and is one of the \nfounders and directors of Camp Willow Run for youth in Littleton, North \nCarolina.\n  Senator Helms is a member of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration; a member and past Chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and the Ranking Minority member \nand past Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. I have had the \nprivilege to serve with Senator Helms on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for the past 6 years. We will miss his common sense and \nstrong perspective on foreign affairs. I am grateful for his many \ncourtesies to me and his constant help and support. I will miss him.\n  Senator Helms will celebrate his 81st birthday this month. We wish \nhim a happy birthday and thank him and his dear wife, Dot, for their \nyears of devotion to our country. I am proud to have served with him.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I am a very junior Senator here and so I \ndo not have the depth of relationship with Senator Helms as do many who \nhave gone before me this morning. But I have served with Jesse Helms \nfor 6 years, 4 of those under his tutelage as chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. I don't know of a Senator with whom I have \nserved in my short term in this body who has been more fair, more \ndirect, and more complete than Jesse Helms. I think that is in itself a \ngreat testament to the man, yes, and to the Senator.\n  I have not always agreed with Senator Helms, but he has always \nafforded me the courtesy of not only an opportunity to explain my \nposition but encouraged me to explain my position, even when he \ndisagreed. That, too, is a measurement of the man and of the Senator.\n  You especially, Mr. President, know that west of the Missouri in the \nland on the prairie called Nebraska, we have fallen on dark times. I \ndon't speak of the drought but of our football team. I never thought I \nwould be in a position to be envious of the football team of the senior \nSenator from North Carolina, but I am this morning. I, of course, \nattribute his leadership and inspiration to their great football team \nthis year.\n  His wife Dot has been mentioned this morning, and I wish also to \nacknowledge Mrs. Helms, for it is Mrs. Helms, as much as any one \nindividual who has shaped and molded this fellow from North Carolina, \nthis individual who not only has given 30 years of his life to the \nSenate, but has given a great majority of his almost 81 years to this \ncountry.\n  Some of us who have had the honor of serving our Nation in uniform \nmore recently than Senator Helms occasionally get more attention for \nthat service. This has always struck me about the World War II \ngeneration, of which Jesse Helms is a part. He served in the U.S. Navy \nin World War II. They never talk about that service. My father was in \nWorld War II in the South Pacific for 3 years in the Army Air Corps. I \nhave always admired World War II veterans for many reasons, but one in \nparticular; that is, they came back, never asked for recognition, never \nasked for special breaks. They saw their service as only part of being \na responsible citizen--their responsibility. And it is that way to this \nday in the Senate, where we have few World War II veterans left.\n  When we lose a World War II veteran in this body, we lose a very \nsignificant part of America. That is a dimension of Jesse Helms that is \nnot often talked about.\n  Let me conclude, because others wish to speak about this very unique \nSenator and man. I don't know of an individual who has fulfilled the \ncommitment of his own value system and his own standards, or lived it, \nlike Jesse Helms has. You either can agree with those commitments and \nstandards and policies and values and positions or not, but none can \ndeny that Senator\n\n[[Page S9791]]\n\nHelms has indeed lived what he has said. That in itself, after almost \n81 years, is rather unique.\n  I wish Senator Helms a happy birthday this month. I know it will be a \nhappy occasion. We are glad to have you back in this body, Jesse, for \nthese last few months, and we are also particularly pleased with your \nrecovery. Senator Helms will be known to many of us--certainly this \nSenator from Nebraska--forever as ``Mr. Chairman.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I salute you and thank you for your service and your \nmany courtesies and kindnesses. You are an inspiration to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought maybe I could jump ahead of \nthe Senator from New Mexico for just 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought the agreement was that we got \nour time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will follow the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the Republican \nleader.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will yield 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I come here to the floor to announce that I have been in agreement \nwith Senator Helms on just about every issue since he has been here--\nnot quite, but I will say this. I think one of the ways you judge a \nperson is just the way you watch them treat people. I don't know if \nthis has been said, but when I watch the way Senator Helms treats the \npages here and the elevator operators and the support staff, I don't \nthink there is anybody in the Senate who treats them with more grace \nand is kinder and more appreciative. In fact, I think there have been \nsurveys that have put him at the very top.\n  I thank him for the way in which he has treated staff. I wish to tell \nhim, though we have not agreed on the issues, I have appreciated \ngetting to know him. I hope it is mutual.\n  I wish you, Senator Helms, and my wife wishes you the very best. We \nwish you well.\n  Mr. President, there is going to be another time before the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, leaves when I wish to talk about him \nbecause there is much positive to say about him from the point of view \nof somebody who stood up for what he believes. I think it has to be \npart of the Record. I look forward to doing that.\n  Senator Helms, I wish you well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I bring regards from my wife \nNancy to both you and Dot. She asked me today--it was written on my \ncalendar--if I would say that for her, and I do.\n  I do not think all Senators know that 30 years ago, a class of new \nSenators numbering nine arrived in the Senate. I was one of those nine, \nSenator Sam Nunn, Senator Bennett Johnston, Senator Biden, myself, and \nour wonderful Jesse Helms. That group saw Senator Helms as being the \nfather of all of us. We thought we were youngsters, and then we met \nJesse, and we said: We do have some wisdom and some experience with us. \nIt has been a sheer joy to serve with him.\n  The whole group that came together has left of their own accord, and \nthat is good. It speaks well of them; it speaks mightily of the class \nand the capacity they had.\n  Jesse, as I saw you get sick and then get well, I was truly hopeful \nthat whatever the good Lord had in store for you, you would leave here \non your own, saying goodbye to the Senate with your own capacity, and \nthat nothing would be the cause of taking you from us.\n  That is why it is a good day, because you have lived through it all, \nand you have been, from what outsiders know, the absolute opposite of \nwhat people say you are. They judge you by your record, and if they do \nnot like the record, they have things to say that are totally without \nthe character of Jesse Helms.\n  My friend who just spoke clearly put it right when it comes to \nkindness. Senator Helms truly believes that everybody, no matter how \nlittle, how poor, how vintaged, what seat they occupy, deserves a \nkindness from him. He does not walk by anyone to whom he does not say \nhello. If he knows they have been sick, he will stop and talk with them \nand ask them about their relatives. In a way, for some of us, we are \namazed at how he can do that. For that, I say I am glad I shared that \nexperience with Senator Helms.\n\n  What really made me come down here today, I say to Senator Helms, is \nthat he has been very decent and nice to me. I think now, looking back \non occasions on the floor when I had a budget to handle that was \nparticularly difficult or I had to make a speech that was particularly \ndifficult--he did not sit very far from me--almost invariably, Senator \nHelms would call me to his desk and congratulate me. He even told me \nhow I was changing as a Senator: You are getting better; you are \ngetting to be as good as there is; you are responding; that was a great \nspeech.\n  I do not know how many of those remarks Senator Helms passed on to \nme. I believed it, so it helped me. I do not know if it was true, but \nit was true as he saw it, and that was enough for me to leave with just \na little more hop in my step because somebody I really wanted to note \nwhat I was doing apparently had.\n  For that, I wish to tell Senator Helms, that means an awful lot to a \nSenator, especially as he is getting started. I was thrilled with it, \neven in the last 4 or 5 years when he continued to do that. I thank him \nfor that.\n  The Senate will miss this man. The truth is, there are many people \nfrom the outside who criticize Jesse Helms, but nobody questions \nwhether he believes what he says. Nobody questions that he says what he \nbelieves. I do not think one can have either a better friend, a better \nservant, or a better patriot than one who knows what he believes and \nbelieves what he knows. That is what our friend is. That is the essence \nof him. One does not have to second-guess Senator Helms. For that class \nof Senators of 30 years ago, there are now three of us left. When \nSenator Helms leaves, there will be two. I will be running, and so will \nSenator Biden. If we come back, the marvelous class will be getting \nsmaller, and Senator Helms will have left us this year. I am sorry to \nsee him leave. I thank him very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues in \nsaying thank you to Senator Helms for his 30 years of service to the \nSenate and to the country.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Helms for 22 years, \nand the last several years I had the pleasure of sitting right in front \nof him or, conversely, having him at my back. I like that. I moved over \nto Senator Thurmond's desk so I can look at Senator Helms when I make \nthese remarks.\n  I pointed out to Senator Wellstone when he was complimenting you on \nyour demeanor, politeness, kindness to our fellow employees, that was \nmy first recollection of Jesse Helms. The character of Senator Helms \nwas one of this pretty tough Senator. In my career of 22 years, I have \nnever known a kinder, gentler, more polite Senator than Senator Jesse \nHelms.\n  I say that because he has been kind to me. Obviously, he was kind to \nSenator Domenici. He has been kind to every Senator, Democrat and \nRepublican--Senator Wellstone mentioned it--but also to every single \nstaff member, to every single elevator operator and security officer. I \nam amazed at the number of people he calls by their first name. I have \ntried to emulate that and have not done it very well. I have tried to \nemulate Senator Helms in many ways. Senator Helms will never know how \nmany people he has inspired in the Senate.\n  I say that because of his kindness. I say that because of his \npoliteness. I say that because he says grace before meals and he does \nit today. I say that because he has shown such courage and conviction \non so many issues. His ability to be courageous and kind at the same \ntime is a very unusual special talent that very few have been able to \ndo, and Senator Helms has done it well for so many years.\n  The word ``patriot'' was used. If anybody ever defines ``patriot,'' \nSenator Helms' name comes to mind. Standing at Strom Thurmond's desk, \npatriot comes to mind when I think of Strom Thurmond, and it comes to \nmind when\n\n[[Page S9792]]\n\nI think of Jesse Helms. We are losing two patriots in the Senate in \nthis retirement, and I hate to see that happen, but I am so grateful to \nhave had the privilege of having Senator Helms as a mentor, as a \ncolleague, as a confidant, as a teacher.\n  I remember in my early career, we had battles. I served in the Senate \nfor 22 years, and he served in the Senate for 30 years. Prior to his \nservice in the Senate, Senator Helms served as administrative assistant \nto a couple of Senators.\n  During that time, he learned the Senate rules. I remember some of our \nearlier battles having Senator Helms help me learn the Senate rules. I \nwas amazed that someone would go to that trouble. But he used the \nSenate rules both politely and correctly, and in the process made the \nSenate a better institution.\n  I realize this goes all the way back to Richard Russell. It goes back \nto some of the greats in the Senate, and how this tradition is passed \non is truly amazing--and with a whole lot of fond memories.\n  I remember, Senator Helms, when you taught me some of the rules, I \nbelieve it was in 1983, when we had the little battle on the 5-cent-\nper-gallon gasoline tax, that most of the Senate was for, including the \nmajority leader at the time, our very good friend Senator Baker. \nPresident Reagan, I believe, was in favor at the time, but we were sort \nof opposed to it, thinking it should be left to the prerogative of the \nStates. It was rather a difficult time because it was right before \nChristmas. It was a pretty protracted and extended debate, one that \nrequired cots in the back. Our colleagues' tempers were short because \nwe were getting closer to the holiday season and most everybody wanted \nto vote and get out of here.\n  I remember going into your office one night when things were kind of \ndifficult, and we talked about it. You said: I have an idea. We will \njust pray about it. Let's call Rev. Billy Graham. Well, I was awestruck \nthat we were calling Rev. Billy Graham, and impressed. I will not \nforget that conversation.\n  I also will not forget another thing that you said. If it was not \nthat night, it was the next night--we had two or three nights of this \nlittle battle--and I remember you telling me a story which I have never \nforgotten. In fact, I think about it all the time when I fly at night. \nI do not even know if you will remember it but I bet you do. You \nrelayed to me how you were flying over North Carolina at night. And if \nany of my colleagues have been with Senator Helms for any period of \ntime, they know he has a great love for his State of North Carolina, \nand vice versa. It is a mutual love, respect, and admiration.\n  You relayed to me, Senator Helms, that while flying over North \nCarolina at night you see all these lights, and you realize how big \nRaleigh is and you realize how remote small towns and some rural areas \nare, a light here and there. I remember you told me you were flying \nover there somewhat in awe but also thinking about individuals who live \nin those areas, and every one of those homesteads represent some of \nyour constituents. You wondered if they really thought anybody in \nWashington, DC, cares about them living in that little rural area or \nmaybe living in the city.\n  There you are, flying over their State and you are thinking about \nthem. I think that was one of the guiding principles of your public \nservice and career. I will never forget that. You were thinking about \nthem when we were fighting over that nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax. You \nhave been fighting for them. Whether talking about a strong national \ndefense or about giving them some tax relief, you were thinking about \nyour constituents, those people in the rural areas that probably never \ngave two thoughts about who their Senator was. Maybe they do not know, \nmaybe they do not vote, but you cared about them.\n  I can tell you cared about them because of the way you have served \nthis Senate and the way you have served your State, the way you have \ntalked to individuals on the floor, the way you talk to employees, \nwhether they are the lower level employees or people just starting out, \nor whether it is my daughter who was working as an intern one summer. \nYou were so kind to her. She loves Senator Helms. I saw her last night \nand she wanted me to say thank you, Senator Helms.\n  You have inspired more people than you will ever know. I see some of \nyour employees are in the Chamber and you are sitting with one of the \nbest, Mr. Broughton, but I wonder how many of those employees, who have \nlaunched their career under your tutelage, have very bright futures. \nThey are going to make outstanding contributions. Some of them are in \nthe State Department. Some of them are working in very high level \npositions. Some of them are on the Federal bench because you got them \nstarted. They are some of the best people in the country. I think of \nthem as expanding good government, and you have made that contribution.\n  I wanted to say thank you on behalf of Oklahomans, and on behalf of \nall Americans for your 30 years of service in the Senate. I have had \nthe privilege of working with you for 22 years, getting to know you and \nDot Helms. I think the world of both of you. God has truly blessed all \nof us for your service to our country and we thank you for it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute today to \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms.\n  The son of a police chief from Monroe, NC, Jesse Helms has been part \nof the fabric of the United States Senate for nearly three decades. \nUpon his retirement after five terms of service, it is fitting that we \npay tribute to his leadership and commitment to the people of North \nCarolina and this country.\n  Senator Helms has served in the Senate during the administrations of \nseven Presidents, from the Vietnam War, through the launch of the war \non terrorism.\n  His views have enlivened the debate on the editorial pages of \nnewspapers in his home State and throughout the country. He defines the \nterm ``sticking to your guns.''\n  From 1960 until he ran for the Senate in 1972, Senator Helms \ndelivered some 2,700 editorials on WRAL-TV in Raleigh, NC. Those \nopinions also appeared in more than 200 papers across the Nation and on \n70 radio stations, making Jesse Helms a household name.\n  He built that name on the principles of free enterprise, \nrepresentative democracy and conservative values--ideals he holds true \ntoday.\n  He has always stood on principle. He does not waiver or falter, and \nis not easily persuaded, a fact to which many of my colleagues can \nattest.\n  Senator Helms has never forgotten the people he represents while in \nWashington. An editorial about his retirement in the Charlotte Observer \nobserved, ``People who can't stand his views go to the voting booth \nevery 6 years and push the button next to his name. Maybe he helped \ntheir mama get Social Security. Maybe he kept their farm alive. Maybe \nthey just like the idea of a North Carolina boy going to Washington and \nraising hell.''\n  He's always had a place in his heart for the youth of our Nation. In \nhis retirement speech, he calculated that he has met with more than \n100,000 young people during his tenure in the Senate. He always took \nthe time to talk with them about what an honor it was to serve America.\n  The issues that have driven his Senate career have varied from the \nminute to the global. He has left an indelible mark on American foreign \npolicy from his service on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nhis tenure as chairman. From favoring the lifting of the arms embrago \non Bosnia to his opposition of U.S. military intervention in Haiti, he \nhas consistently fought to keep our Nation focused on U.S. interests \nabroad.\n  On February 24, 1996, when Cuban Mig-29 fighter jets shot down two \nCessna 337s in the Florida Straits, killing four members of the \nhumanitarian group ``Brothers to the Rescue,'' Jesse Helms demanded \nthat the U.S. call Fidel Castro to account for his actions.\n  His time as a Navy recruiter during World War II gave him insight \ninto the importance of supporting our military troops. He has \nvigorously fought to strengthen the U.S. armed forces and ensure that \nour men and women in uniform are deployed only when clear U.S. \ninterests are at stake.\n  On behalf of the American taxpayer, he demanded and received greater \naccountability at the United Nations for\n\n[[Page S9793]]\n\nthe funds America pays as part of our dues. He was one of the chief \narchitects responsible for dramatically reshaping and reorganizing the \nDepartment of State.\n  Indeed, no matter what the cause, whether it affects a North Carolina \nfarmer or textile worker, or the U.S. relationship with the U.N., Jesse \nHelms has stood his ground.\n  He has always done so without rancor and has always been a gentleman \nwhen the fight was over. He is stubborn, he is committed to his cause, \nand he fights vigorously, but he is also one of the most gentle and \nkind men in the Senate.\n  For years he sat next to the late Senator John Chafee on the Senate \nfloor. They were two Republican colleagues who didn't agree on a great \ndeal, yet were best of friends and spoke affectionately of each other. \nWhen John died, Jesse made it his first order of business to visit his \noffice and personally comfort the Senator's grieving staff. There are \nhundreds of similar stories of Jesse's graciousness and caring nature. \nEach of us has been touched at one time or another by his kindness.\n  His conviction, his determination and his passion will be missed. As \nJesse leaves Washington to join his beloved wife, ``Miss Dot,'' at home \nin North Carolina, we wish him well.\n  The 108th Congress will be a different place without Jesse Helms. The \nset from North Carolina will be filled, but it will never be the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, over the course of our \nlives, many of us have role models. Role models mold and shape us as \nhuman beings. Who we choose for role models can leave an indelible mark \non our character.\n  As a young boy, I had several role models. When I was 3 years old, I \nhad a dad who lost his life at the end of the Second World War. He was \ncertainly a role model for me. My mother worked very hard to try to \nkeep the family together; she never remarried. She was a Navy widow who \nkept my brother and me and the family together all of those years. I \nhad a granddad who worked hard to try to keep us on the straight and \nnarrow, helping my mother. They were all my heroes and role models.\n  Politically, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan come to mind as role \nmodels, as well as former Gov. Mel Thomson of New Hampshire, who once \ntold me you stand for something or you stand for nothing, which brings \nme to Jesse Helms. He is a man who has been a treasured friend, a \nconfidant, a great Senator, and my role model for all the years I have \nbeen in the Senate. His steadfast example has helped shape who I am as \na Senator and as a person.\n  I remember talking to Senator Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, your \nformer colleague. I asked him one time: What is Jesse Helms like? And \nhe said: Jesse Helms is the nicest person in the Senate. He was right; \nyou are. Others have said that about you as well, including the \nelevator operators and pages and so many people you are nice to. I have \nseen you on so many occasions talking to students and posing for \npictures with people who were not always from North Carolina. You would \nstop and say, Where are you guys from? And then you would talk to them. \nAnd I would hear them after you walked away and the things that they \nsaid. It really is a shame that all Americans do not know you \npersonally, Senator Helms, because you are one fine man. You have a \nlong, distinguished record of service to your country and service in so \nmany areas before you came to the Senate, and you did a lot of \ncharitable work after you came to the Senate.\n  Since he was first elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North \nCarolina nearly 30 years ago, Senator Helms has tirelessly served the \npeople of North Carolina and this nation.\n  Before that, the Senator's tenure of service to the United States of \nAmerica began in the 1940's. Serving in the U.S. Navy during the second \nworld war, Senator Helms pledged his loyalty and love to the United \nStates. I lost my own father in WWII and understand and respect the \npassion that the men and women of the Greatest Generation has and still \nhave for the United States. No one embodies these ideals better than \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina.\n  Upon returning from battle in WWII, Senator Helms got his first taste \nof Washington politics by serving as an administrative assistant to \nboth Senator Willis Smith and Senator Alton Lennon. Senator Helms took \nhis experience in the Senate and began his own historical career in his \nhome State of North Carolina.\n  Before going to Washington Senator Helms served the people of his \ncommunity and home State in many ways. He served his community for two \n2-year terms on the Raleigh city council, as well as being the \npresident of both the Raleigh Rotary Club and the Raleigh Executives \nClub. As a man full of compassion for his fellow man, Senator Helms \nfurther served his State as the director of the North Carolina Cerebral \nPalsy Hospital in Durham, the Director of the United Cerebral Palsy of \nNorth Carolina, and the Director of the Wake County Cerebral Palsy and \nRehabilitation Center in Raleigh. As a man who cares deeply for the \nfuture generations of this country, Mr. Helms has served as a deacon \nand a Sunday School teacher, sat on the Board of Trustees of Meredith \nCollege, John F. Kennedy College, Campbell University and Wingate \nCollege.\n  The thing I am going to remember is that you used your life \nexperiences and your faith, and they were your guiding principles in \nthe Senate. The kind of person you are is the kind of Senator you are. \nYou were a veteran and you used that in your capacity as the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. You have \nbeen an unflinching proponent of a principled foreign policy throughout \nthe world for so many years. There is no greater supporter of human \nrights, no more steadfast defender of American sovereignty, no stronger \nadvocate for our national interest than you, Senator Helms.\n  I have been in so many meetings--and I see the assistant leader in \nthe Chamber as well, Senator Nickles, who can vouch for this. So many \ntimes in meetings we have said: Senator Helms, do you think maybe we \ncould have your support to let this nominee go through, and Senator \nHelms would never raise his voice but he would say, no, can't do it. It \nwas always disagreeing without being disagreeable. That is why you have \nso much respect, and that is why there are so many people here to honor \nyou.\n  When faced with a policy that you feel is counter to your values, you \nare like a rock. Even your opponents marvel at your fortitude. You are \nthe irresistible force for justice and human liberty. You are an \nimmovable object against big spending and immorality. You are not \nafraid to stand up on the floor time after time--and I am proud to have \nstood with you on many occasions, Senator Helms. You are a man of great \npersonal faith. This has led you to be a crusader for the lives of the \nunborn. Not too many people come down to talk about that issue these \ndays, but you inspired me to weigh in on this. This, I believe, will be \nthe defining moral issue. This will be the slavery issue of the 20th \ncentury and perhaps even the 21st century. You were right to defend the \nunborn. History will judge you as being right, and I am proud to follow \nin those big shoes of yours, Senator Helms.\n  Being a conservative Republican has led Senator Helms to fight for \nthe rights of taxpayers, small businessmen, and the constitutional \nrights of all Americans.\n  Most importantly, Senator Helms has used his experience as a husband, \na father, and a grandfather, to promote strong family values and to \nguide this country over the last 30 years.\n  You have never shied away from controversy. You always do what is \nright, never even considering the political consequences to yourself. \nWhether you are fighting for the right of students to pray in school, \nthe right of the Boy Scouts of America to organize and inspire young \nboys to join, or the right of the taxpayers not to have their hard-\nearned money wasted, you do not worry about the opponents or distorted \nreports by the news media. You follow your heart.\n  I have always admired Senator Helms' dedication to his conservative \nvalues. The example that Senator Helms sets is something that we all as \nconservatives need to follow. There has been no senator as outspoken on \nthe\n\n[[Page S9794]]\n\nconservative agenda over the past three decades. Jesse was recognized \nin 1980, 1981, and 1983 as the ``Most Admired Conservative in \nCongress''. He also received the ``Conservative Caucus 97th Congress \nStatesman Award'' in 1983.\n  It will be one of the fondest memories in life to know I sat here and \nserved with you in this body.\n  The news media used to call him ``Senator No,'' because he never \ncompromised his values or beliefs, and that is something for him to be \nproud of and the rest of us to admire. While Senator Helms, always full \nof humor, embraced the reputation, I think those of us who know him \nunderstand that the media did not tell the whole story.\n  I believe they should have called him ``Senator Yes.'' Because when \nCongress was trying to waste the taxpayers' money, Jesse Helms stood up \nand said ``yes'' to the taxpayers.\n  When the unborn were being threatened, he said ``yes'' to human life.\n  While some were saying ``no'' to human rights, to personal freedom, \nto limited Government, to morality, to family values, Jesse Helms \nalways stood up with a resounding ``yes.''\n  And even when his more ardent opponents in the Senate will vouch for \nthe fact that there is not a more decent human being in the entire \nSenate. Always a smile on his face, always time for schoolchildren, \nalways courteous, always a friend.\n  As an American, I am truly grateful for Jesse Helms' patriotic \nservice to his country. But, personally, what I will most treasure is \n12 years of friendship.\n  Jesse, you were always there for me, and while I bid you a fond \nfarewell as we both part from our Senate service, I will always stay in \ntouch. I will always consider you one of my best friends.\n  Senator Helms has pledged a lifetime of loyalty, love and service to \nthe United States. The senator is a patriot in every sense of the word. \nThank you, Senator Helms, for serving this country as you have over the \npast three decades.\n  May God bless you and your family.\n  I want to close on a couple of points. The news media gave you a \nname, and I know you had some fun with it. For those of you who have \nnot been in Senator Helms' office, it is just plastered with all these \ncartoons. Some of them are pretty rough. But they always called him \n``Senator No.'' There are two ways to look at that because you never \ncompromised on your values or your beliefs. So oftentimes you were down \nhere voting no when others were compromising those values and beliefs. \nThat is something of which I am going to be proud. The thing I am most \nproud of remembering about you--always full of humor, always embracing \nthe reputation--but those of us who really know you understand that the \nmedia had it wrong. You were not Mr. No. You were Senator Yes because \nyou were right. It was ``yes,'' to try to stop wasting taxpayers' money \nand stand up for them. It was ``yes,'' the right thing to do, to stand \nup for the unborn. It was ``yes,'' to stand up for human rights, \npersonal freedom, limited Government, morality, family values. It was \nnot Mr. No, it was Senator Yes.\n  Each of your most ardent political opponents in the Senate--you heard \nSenator Wellstone--will vouch for the fact that there is not a more \ndecent human being who ever lived in the United States of America, or \never served here.\n  I am standing now at the desk of Daniel Webster. There are going to \nbe a lot of people following the Senator from North Carolina, from \nNorth Carolina, who are going to be standing at the desk of Senator \nHelms.\n  I am proud to serve with you, my friend. You are a great American, a \ngreat patriot, and I wish you the best in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. God bless you. Thank you, Bob.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as long as I might consume regarding the tribute \nto Senator Helms, and ask for that privilege as well for the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \noffering tribute to my friend and fellow Senator, Jesse Helms. As my \ndear friend so loved to say, even a blind hog finds an acorn sometimes. \nSo I hope my poor words may be able to rise and find the acorn here in \na proper tribute to Senator Helms for the years of service and \ncontribution he has made to this great country and what he has given to \nthe world.\n  I know today many of my colleagues are lauding him for his grit and \ndetermination, his principled stands, and his ability to always fight \nthe good fight even if it was a lonely and sometimes frustrating fight. \nSenator Helms has always done so. He has always stood firm despite the \nopposition and the disapproval.\n  We have had a number of colleagues already speak about these traits \nand speak of them in laudatory terms. In fact, he was known for telling \nhis staff and his allies that it did not matter, if they stuck to \nprinciple, if they lost. What mattered was they stuck to principle. All \nthe other things would fall by the wayside, but you have to stand by \nyour principle and you have to fight for it regardless of whether you \nwin or lose. That was a great lesson to me, coming to this body, of the \nservice that we have here for the world. You fight for your principles.\n  There is so much to say about Jesse Helms, my dear friend. There is \nmuch to say that is obvious. There are some things to say that are not \nknown very well publicly. I know from personal experience about his \ntraits and his attributes that so many people are talking about--his \ndetermination, standing by principle. I served with the Senator when I \nfirst came to the Senate. I haven't been in this body a long time, but \nI served with him the entire time on the Foreign Relations Committee. I \nknow he always treated new Members in a manner unlike most people treat \nnew Members. He treated new Members with a great deal of respect, with \na great deal of courtesy, which is the way he treats everybody--it is a \ntrue Biblical principle. You don't treat the great and the lesser any \ndifferent. He always did that for new Members.\n  I came into the Foreign Relations Committee, the first meeting I had \nthere, sitting way at the end of the bench. There was not a seat \nfurther away from the chairman where I could sit. They had to actually \nbuild another seat there to give me a space to sit. And then he calls \non me first at the committee, which had me quaking in my boots at the \ntime. I was ready and prepared to sit for a couple of hours and wait my \nturn and build up some knowledge. But it was his trait and his standard \nthat each year when he had a new Member come in, he recognized him \nfirst at the first meeting. It was very kind of him to do that, to \nwelcome people. That was just his nature and his characteristic, and it \nwas always done.\n  It is no surprise that he has always been voted by the Washingtonian \nmagazine as the nicest Senator, which I think is quite a tribute when \nwe look back. I have on my wall a picture of Mother Teresa and a quote \nfrom her. She says: At the end of life we are not going to be measured \nby the positions that we achieved or the things we accomplished or the \nwealth we had. What we will be measured by is the amount of love with \nwhich we did the work we had. We will be measured that way.\n  It doesn't matter if you are a Senator presiding in the Senate, the \nPresident of the United States, if you work at any job anywhere--it is \nnot the accomplishment of the physical that you do, it is not the \naccumulation of money you accomplish, it is not the wealth, it is the \nlove you express in the job that you have.\n\n  Senator Helms has expressed a great deal of love to everybody and has \nhad a high degree of success and will be very rich in rewards.\n  These are the examples he has given to so many of us so constantly. \nIt is such a beautiful tribute.\n  He has a robust sense of humor that many have not had the pleasure of \nbeing able to experience, although I have. One of my favorite facts \nabout the Senator--Senator Smith just mentioned it--is when you go into \nSenator Helms' office, he has on the walls every cartoon that has ever \nbeen done about him. There are quite a few of them. They are scattered \naround the walls. A number of them Senator\n\n[[Page S9795]]\n\nSmith said are not glowing in their comments, but he puts them up. I \nthink it is quite a tribute there as well that he would show both \nsides, so anybody who comes into his office can see the caricature that \nis made by anybody. I think that is a good trait of humility. Humility \nis the first grace. We need much humility.\n  In addition, one of his prize possessions is a big rubber stamp that \nsays ``No'' on it. Needless to say, he has wielded it often and with \npassion. But in reality it was not just saying no or being Senator No, \nthough those working on treaties and nominees over the years may have \nbelieved so, he was actually one of the most effective compromisers in \nthe Senate.\n  Yes, it is true. That is what happens when everyone knows exactly \nwhere you stand and that your word is your bond. For Senator Helms, his \nword was definitely his bond. One of the facts to know about Senator \nHelms, though, is what a true gentleman he always was. Several people \nhave spoken about that. No matter how bitter a foe or how fierce a \ndisagreement, he was always kind to his opponent. You are to love your \nfriend and you are to love your enemy. He practiced that Biblical \nadmonition as well if not better than anybody I have ever seen.\n  A foe who might be fierce in disagreement, in most cases would, \nafterwards, and even during the debate, admire and like his opponent. \nFor example, he has always truly liked Madeleine Albright, Secretary of \nState, though most on the outside saw them as no more than simple \nenemies. He and Madeleine Albright had a marvelous relationship, even \nthough they would disagree on probably the complete course of the meal, \nsoup to nuts. But they had a wonderful personal relationship--although \neven that, too, is too simplistic an analysis. Clearly, not enough to \nreally say about his character, it is a true sign of character to \nunderstand the best results come from fighting worthy opponents and to \nbe willing to graciously acknowledge and admire these opponents. It was \na lesson I took to heart, seeing how he fiercely defended his \nprinciples, yet how much he cared for and always took time to honor \nthose he fought against and with whom even disagreed. He honored them. \nHe did love his opponents.\n  He took almost as much care in those cases as he did with his own \nstaff--many of whom are here, as was noted. Senator Helms is also known \nfor being deeply devoted to his staff, considering them his family and \ntreating them as such, practicing an open-door policy and complete \nloyalty and always ensuring that he knew what was going on in each \nstaffer's life.\n  As in so many areas, he did not just preach family values, he \npracticed them. This has been a great lesson to me as well. So many \ntimes you get busy and you feel you are just trying to suck things out \nof your staff--I need this information; I need that--when our true role \nis as a shepherd, to feed them, to care for them, to tend them, and to \nnourish them. These are people with whom we have an unusually positive \nrelationship. Senator Helms does that well.\n\n  One of the reasons he and I bonded was something that we share--the \nadoptive children we have. He has unmeasurable effort he has made for \nadoptive children and for adoptive parents across the country, and even \naround the world. He has always cared incredibly deeply about children \nand those less fortunate. That is just one area of many where he has \ntruly put his energy and where his beliefs are.\n  There is a personal story that is just too personal to tell. But it \nis about his adoptive child in a red cap that Senator Helms told me \nabout. It is too personal to say here, but it is such a touching story, \na tribute to a man adopting a child, the gift that child was to him, \nand the gift he was to that child.\n  But I think the most important things to consider when contemplating \nthe Senator's great and illustrious career are some of the things he \nwould probably say are his proud achievements--his long and true \nmarriage to his beloved Dot, volunteering for the Navy right after \nPearl Harbor, the Jesse Helms Foundation, his solitary action as a lone \nRepublican stumping for a gentleman by the name of Ronald Reagan back \nin 1976, and his unlimited love for children. Throughout his lifetime, \nbut especially during his career in Congress, he has never forgotten \nthe children, including them and introducing them to worlds they may \nnever experience; for example, inviting the pages, who are so often \noverlooked by all of us despite their hard and dedicated work, to his \nJesse Helms Foundation dinner, assuring that all of them will be \nintroduced to everyone attending the dinner.\n  Senator Helms has often been seen as the Rock of Gibraltar, an \noftentimes lonely role, yet always a steadfast defender of American and \nRepublican principles. He is so much more than that. He is a kind and \ngentle soul who has brought humor, compassion, and character to this \naugust body. He has been and always will be a role model of the true \ngentleman.\n  In his Second Epistle to Timothy, St. Paul writes: ``I have fought \nthe good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.'' \nSenator Helms has certainly done so.\n  You have fought the good fight, you finished the course, you kept the \nfaith. God bless you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a short quorum \ncall, followed by Senator Byrd for a brief moment on the floor, \nfollowed by me, and followed by Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today not entirely with \nsadness in my heart but, rather, a sadness that is commingled with joy, \nas I look back across the 30 years I have known Jesse Helms as we have \nworked in this body.\n  I can remember him when he came to this Senate Chamber 30 years ago: \ntall, strong, black hair. Some things have changed about him; some \nthings have changed about me. But there are some things that have not \nchanged. One of those things is my respect for him.\n  He comes from a State which is the State in which I was born, North \nCarolina. I have a brother living in North Wilkesboro today. He became \n89 or 90--I forget which--in August, last month.\n  My dear mother is buried there in an unmarked grave. She died during \nthe great influenza epidemic. She died on the night before the \narmistice was signed. I have a little pillow that she made. And I know \nthat I have been guided by my mother's prayers over these soon to be 85 \nyears, although I do not remember ever seeing her face or ever feeling \nthe joy of a mother's kiss. But those North Carolina hills keep her in \ntheir bosom today, as they keep my father.\n  The motto of the State of North Carolina is: ``To be rather than to \nseem.'' What a motto: ``To be rather than to seem.''\n  I believe, based on my relationship with Jesse Helms, that he \ntypifies that motto: ``To be rather than to seem.''\n  I have always found him to be a gentleman. During the years in which \nI was majority leader, minority leader, and majority whip, I always \nfound Jesse Helms to be someone with whom I could work. There were \ndifferences and there were difficulties at times--for instance, \ndifficulties in breaking through a filibuster--but this man was always \nwhat he was, not what he seemed. He was what he was. He was not a man \nto be intimidated. He took a stand. He was willing to take a stand even \nthough he might stand alone. And I have seen times when he stood alone, \nbut it was without a tremor, without any indication that he would cut \nhis sail.\n  He had that sterling character that so many of the people of his \ngeneration displayed throughout their lifetimes. And the people of \nNorth Carolina are a naturally warm and gracious people, just like \nJesse Helms.\n  As I say, no matter what his position on an issue, no matter what his \npolitical feelings might be, he was always\n\n[[Page S9796]]\n\none with whom I could approach and sit down and talk. And he was a man \nwith whom I could reason when I was the leader of this body. It is not \nan easy job. But being the man that Jesse Helms is, and standing for \nwhat he believes, standing against the odds--no matter what the press \nsaid, no matter what the pundits were saying, no matter, should I say, \neven what his colleagues were saying--he took his position and he never \nwavered, never wavered.\n  I shall always treasure my work here with Jesse Helms. I think when \nJesse Helms goes, something goes out of this Senate that we will not \nsee again.\n  I saw a lot of men like Jesse Helms when I came to this body 44 years \nago--a lot of men and one woman like Jesse Helms. They were strong in \ntheir beliefs. They believed in the Constitution. They believed in this \ninstitution. They weren't looking for another political office. They \nwanted to be Senators. They were Senators. And they served their people \nthe institution, and the Constitution well.\n\n  In all these situations--and I remember Members like Jesse Helms--\nthere has been a wife who sacrificed, who stood there shoulder to \nshoulder with that Senator and who, like him, was always a gracious \nperson, one who loved the Senate, one who served the Senate, just as \nthe elected entity served it.\n  I have great respect for Jesse Helms and his wife Dorothy. My wife \nand I today join in saying we will always remember their friendship. I \nwill always remember this man from the mountains of North Carolina.\n  I remember Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina. Here was a true \ngentleman of the Old South. A true gentleman of the Old South will \nleave this Senate. He won't leave my memory. He won't leave my \naffections. They will follow him. As Tennyson said, ``I am a part of \nall that I have been.'' And wherever I go, Jesse Helms will always be a \npart of me. He will go with my fondest affections.\n  I thank Mr. Enzi for yielding to me at this moment. I am about to \nyield the floor.\n  Let me, if I may, repeat the words of a short verse that are very \nappropriate in talking about Jesse Helms:\n\n       Reputation--he raised its shaft\n       In the crowded market place;\n       He built it out of his glorious deeds,\n       And carved them upon its face;\n       He crowned its towering top with bays\n       That a worshiping world supplied;\n       Then he passed--his monument decayed,\n       And his laurels drooped and died.\n       Character--he built its shaft\n       With no thought of the pillar to be;\n       He wrought intangible things like love\n       And truth and humanity.\n       Inseparable things like sacrifice\n       And sympathy and trust;\n       Yet, steadfast as the eternal hills\n       It stood when he was dust\n\n  North Carolina sent to the Senate one of its favorite sons, and this \nson of North Carolina will never forget Jesse Helms and will never \ncease to respect him. Even when I differed with him perhaps on an issue \nnow and then, there was always great respect, knowing that here was a \nman who believed in serving his people and standing for what his people \nexpected him to stand for.\n  May God always be with you, Senator Helms, and with your charming \nwife Dorothy. May God always bless her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for allowing us to \nextend this period. It is not every day we get the opportunity to pay \ntribute to one of our heroes. I am sure Senator Helms would object to \nthat wording, of being a hero, but if the definition is ordinary people \ndoing extraordinary things, he might agree with it. But he goes well \nbeyond that.\n  For most of my life, I had read about Jesse Helms. And then I got \nelected to this body and got the awesome opportunity to meet him and to \ntalk to him and to learn from him. It has been a delightful journey, \none I will always remember and appreciate.\n  In reading a little of his background, I learned that the Senator \ngrew up 15 miles from the birthplace of Andrew Jackson, which is a \nbreeding ground for true believers. With Jacksonian tenacity, he stuck \nto his early convictions--respect for elders and law and order, \ntraditional religious faith, moral principles, and patriotism. He is \nhere today with a lapel pin on that he has explained to me before. We \nare a part of the same organization. It is a Masonic pin he has been \nwearing since his first election. That is part of the great tradition \nand background of the Senator, an organization of individuals for self-\nimprovement, and it is something he has worked on all his life and is \nstill working on and is passing on to others.\n  As Senator Helms was coming to this body, the Senator from Wyoming \nwho had been another role model of mine, Senator Hansen, was here \nbriefly and then left. From my mother and from Senator Hansen and \nSenator Helms, I have fashioned a mission statement that is in all of \nthe rooms of my offices where my staff and I work. It says: Do what is \nright. Do your best. And treat others as you want to be treated.\n  That is a motto Senator Helms exemplifies in great detail. He is one \nof those people who never gives the impression that a Senator is \nspecial. He knows that we really are people who had special \nopportunities and special responsibilities. He epitomizes that.\n  He has had a considerable effect on events over the years. While he \nhasn't gotten to restore America to the state of the Monroe of his \nyouth, he has made great strides at it, probably ones he never \nenvisioned.\n  I like a quote by Fred Barnes written in the Weekly Standard: He \ncan't be buffaloed or ignored. Helms has gained strange new respect, \nnot as many conservatives have--by moving to the left. Helms has earned \nit the hard way--by not moving at all.\n  He is a man of principle who knows where he is coming from and what \nneeds to be done and has made dramatic improvements in America while he \nhas followed that principle.\n  This year, I had the opportunity to join Senator Helms on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and hold a position on the International \nOperations and Terrorism Subcommittee. In this role I have seen and \nheard much of Senator Helms' work with the United Nations. Americans \nand all those involved with the United Nations look at Senator Helms as \none of the strongest supporters for reform of that organization. Many \nstill talk about the wonderful pictures of Senator Helms sitting in the \nUnited Nations Security Council during a historic visit by the Foreign \nRelations Committee in 2000.\n  Because of his efforts, the United States remains an active member, \nand the United Nations has become a more efficient organization. There \nis, however, still more work to do. I know Senator Helms will be sorely \nmissed in those discussions. He has had a tremendous effect.\n\n  I conclude by mentioning that as an Eagle Scout, I am proud of \nSenator Helms' efforts to protect the organization of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica. The organization makes a strong difference in the lives of \nmany of our Nation's young men. It teaches them leadership and values. \nSenator Helms should be commended for his actions and for all of the \nefforts he has put forth on behalf of youth, North Carolina, the \ncountry, and the education of people like me. I thank the Senator for \nall of his efforts at mentoring and teaching, and his long service.\n  This past year I had the opportunity to join Senator Helms on the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and hold a position on the \nInternational Operations and Terrorism subcommittee. In this role I \nhave seen and heard much about Senator Helms' work with the United \nNations. Americans and all those involved with the United Nations look \nat Senator Helms as one of the strongest supporters for reform of the \norganization. Many still talk about the wonderful pictures of Senator \nHelms sitting in the United Nations Security Council during a historic \nvisit by the Foreign Relations Committee in 2000. Because of his \nefforts, the United States remains an active member and the United \nNations has become a more efficient organization. There is, however, \nstill work to do and I know Senator Helms will be sorely missed in \ndiscussions on the next steps for reform.\n  I was also pleased this last year to support Senator Helms' efforts \nto expand the NATO Alliance. I agree that NATO enlargement should \ncontinue to be a focus and a priority of the United States. Senator \nHelms championed the effort in the Senate on the Freedom\n\n[[Page S9797]]\n\nConsolidation Act and made a meaningful statement that the Congress of \nthe United States supports the President and supports NATO enlargement. \nAs the NATO Ministerial meets to discuss the expansion of the alliance, \nI am confident Senator Helms' work will be appreciated.\n  Senator Helms has been able to balance supporting international \norganizations with strongly criticizing their actions when they go too \nfar. He has fought fiercely against treaties that are not in the best \ninterests of the United States, such as the International Criminal \nCourt. Senator Helms has been the lead objector to treaty that would \nput our American Servicemembers on trial for simply doing their work to \nprotect Americans. His efforts have encouraged this Administration to \nbe an active voice against the prosecution of American citizens with \ndisregard for our protected rights.\n  Senator Helms has been a leading proponent for conservative values \nand beliefs. He has lead floor debate to protect the lives and the \nfuture of all Americans. He has made it his personal duty to protect \nour rights from over-reaching laws and values not in line with the \nbeliefs of most Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I want to say a word or two, and ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for me to make my remarks from my \nseat, following the remarks of Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I believe that under the UC I am to be \nrecognized next. I understand other matters are to come before the body \nsoon.\n  I want to say how much I admire Senator Helms. He is and has been a \ngreat Senator. He came here with beliefs and concerns about America and \nhe stood up for them. He also came here with courage and convictions. \nHe stood for those throughout his career. He has shown us all what one \nman can do when he stands up for his beliefs. He is a man I admire, as \nso many others do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, for the youngster who is retiring from the \ngreater Carolina delegation, I bid a fond farewell. I am delighted for \nhim and his wife Dot, who after three decades in the Senate will get to \nspend some time for themselves and with their seven grandchildren.\n  The bad news is that there are a great number of others who will be \ndelighted with Senator Helms' departure. Foreign Communist officials, \nFidel Castro, and others will be delighted that he will not be on the \nSenate floor standing tall on behalf of U.S. values, U.S. security, and \nhuman rights. Over his many years of service, his strict observation to \nU.S. security interests never wavered. On matters of foreign policy and \nnational security, he never rested. He never allowed officials at the \nDepartment of State or the United Nations to rest either. When it came \nto the security of free people, his philosophy has always been, keep \nyour powder dry and keep lots of powder.\n  Despite his rigid reluctance to compromise, his legislative record \nhas been extraordinary. Understanding the rules of the Senate, being \nwilling to use the rules of the Senate, and being willing to wait as \nlong as it takes proved to be a formula for much legislative success. \nTo reorganize the State Department, Senator Helms had to hold up 18 \nnominations for ambassadors, halted almost all committee business for \nsix months as well as approval of two international treaties, and \novercome a Presidential veto.\n  A big supporter of President Reagan and his conservative agenda, \nSenator Helms was one of two Senators to vote against the nomination of \nSecretary Weinberg to be Secretary of Defense. Again, a protector of \nthe conservative agenda, he felt the nominee was not adequately \ncommitted to the President's agenda; always brave, seldom subtle.\n  Over his long career, Senator Helms has won praise and scorn for \ndoing what he came to Washington to do, which is speak his mind and \nvote his convictions. He didn't mind being the only one to vote against \na spending bill. He paid his constituents the courtesy of being candid. \nHe did not need to do a poll to have an opinion. It is not his habit to \n``flip-flop'' on political issues because with Jesse, he means what he \nsays and says what he means.\n  One political commentator described the senior Senator as follows: \n``Helms follows a simple formula; Implacability equals strength, It \nworks. He can't be buffaloed--or ignored. . . . The point here is Helms \nhas gained strange, new respect not as many conservatives have--by \nmoving left. Helms has earned it the hard way--by not moving at all.''\n  To ``official Washington,'' Senator Helms was referred to as \n``Senator No.'' But to his beloved constituents asking for help, he \nwas: ``Senator Yes.'' His first floor statement on January 11, 1973, \nwas on behalf of ``more than 182,000 families in my State [who] earn \ntheir living from the production of tobacco.''\n  In the Senate, we will miss this true gentleman with his gentle \nsmile, his great sense of humor, and his tireless commitment to our \nNation. We wish you, your wife Dot and your family well and thank you \nand the good citizens of North Carolina for your service.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President. Nearly 1,900 men and women have served in \nthis body since its inception in 1789. Yet only a couple dozen stand \nout in history as leaders who not only defined the times in which they \nlived, but changed the course of the future. I would include the man we \nhonor today--Senator Jesse Helms--in those select ranks. He will be \nmissed as a friend to us all and a leader for all America.\n  Although one might find it hard to believe, Senator Helms began his \ncareer in the media. After World War II, Jesse worked as city editor of \nthe Raleigh Times. Later he became director of news and programs for \nthe Tobacco Radio Network and radio station WRAL in Raleigh.\n  The media also provided Senator Helms' transition into politics and \npublic affairs. In 1952, he directed radio and television for the \npresidential campaign of Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. One year \nlater, Jesse became executive director of the North Carolina Bankers \nAssociation and editor of the Tarheel Banker, which he grew into the \nlargest state banking publication in America.\n  As a journalist, Senator Helms earned the respect of his readers and \nhis peers. From 1960 to 1972, Jesse delivered daily editorials on WRAL-\nTV, wrote columns that appeared regularly in more than 200 newspapers \nnationwide, and broadcast on more than 70 radio stations in North \nCarolina. Jesse received the Freedoms Foundation Award for the best \ntelevision editorial in America. He won the same award for the best \nnewspaper article.\n  Jesse Helms' arrival in this chamber nearly 30 years ago made \nhistory. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from North \nCarolina. His star immediately began to rise. At the 1976 Republican \nNational Convention, he was the only Senator to endorse Ronald Reagan \nfor President. And though he asked for his name to be removed from the \nballot, he won the support of 99 delegates for the nomination of Vice \nPresident of the United States.\n  While in the Senate, Jesse Helms has become one of those unique \nleaders who combine fierce conservatism with fierce populism. His love \nfor the principles upon which this country was founded is matched only \nby his love for the people he represents. He has always stood up for \nthe people of North Carolina--for the values they hold dear, for the \nbeauty of their land, and for the work that is their lifeblood.\n  Jesse has also stood up for those of the world who don't enjoy the \nfreedoms and rights that Americans are guaranteed. He stood side-by-\nside with President Reagan in the battle to win the Cold War. He \nbelieved in peace through strength and still does. He also believes in \nthe value and dignity of every human life. I know this first-hand. \nJesse and I have worked hard as members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to secure hundreds of millions of dollars to save young \nAfricans from the plague of HIV/AIDS.\n  Always one to practice what he preaches, Jesse Helms has served as a \ndeacon and Sunday School teacher and a director of Camp Willow--a \nChristian\n\n[[Page S9798]]\n\nyouth camp he helped found. He has generously given his time to combat \ncerebral palsy. And he has spent countless hours with the nearly \n100,000 children and young adults who have stopped by his office to \nshake his hand. Jesse has inspired them all to be better citizens; many \nhave even gone on to serve in public office.\n  I, and all of us in this chamber, will miss having Jesse Helms in the \nSenate. And America will miss an impassioned leader. But our loss is \nthe gain of his family and the great state of North Carolina to which \nhe will return. I think we all know that Jesse Helms won't just fade \naway. He'll continue spending time doing what he loves, and we'll \ncontinue loving him for it.\n  God bless you, Jesse.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am pleased to join with other Senators \nin honoring our distinguished colleague, Jesse Helms, who will be \nreturning to private life at the end of the 107th Congress.\n  For the past 26 years it has been my privilege to serve in the United \nStates Senate with Jesse Helms. During that time, we have shared \ncommittee assignments on the Foreign Relations and Agriculture \nCommittees. We have worked together on innumerable issues, and I have \nwitnessed with admiration his strong character and devotion to public \nservice.\n  Senator Helms has played an important role in the primary U.S. \nforeign policy accomplishment of the second half of the 20th Century--\nthe collapse of Soviet Communism and transition of most of the world's \nCommunist nations to democracy and market economics. In the Senate, \nSenator Helms was a steadfast supporter of policies that opposed the \nevils of the Soviet bloc. He looked forward with confidence to a future \nin which Russian foreign policy would not be predicated on empire, in \nwhich Russia would practice democracy, and in which Eastern Europe and \nother Soviet-dominated nations would be free.\n  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Senator Helms was an \nimportant advocate for embracing the new democracies of Eastern Europe. \nHe was and continues to be a vocal supporter of NATO enlargement within \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate as a whole. It is \nfitting that as we celebrate Senator Helms' career, we anticipate the \nentry of a new group of nations into the NATO fold that were once \ndenied their liberty.\n  Throughout his career in the Senate, Senator Helms' foreign policy \ninitiatives were grounded in a fundamental faith in the power of \nfreedom and democracy. Senator Helms' philosophy has been devoid of the \ncynicism that occasionally afflicts the practice of U.S. foreign \npolicy. Our friend never forgot that the achievement of freedom must \nstand as the basis for American actions in the world. He remained \ndevoted to core American values that have undergirded our Republic, \nincluding free and fair elections, freedom of religion, the rule of \nlaw, and market economic opportunities.\n  Senator Helms has had an equally large impact on domestic policy. He \nwill be remembered as a determined advocate for limited government. But \nno matter how passionately he advocated limits on government, he always \nunderstood that those limits should not reduce our human \nresponsibilities to each other as citizens and leaders of a great \nnation.\n  In my experience, few Senators have been as quick with a smile or as \ncertain to ask about a family member as Senator Helms. In fact, few \nSenators ever had a greater appreciation for the strength and love of \nfamily.\n  No remarks honoring Senator Helms would be complete without \nmentioning his beloved wife, Dot. A couple of years ago, I recall \nSenator Helms responding to a reporter's question about whether he \nintended to stay in the Senate. He said ``she has a vote; I have a \nvote; and if there is a tie, we will work it out together.'' All \nSenators know how important Dot has been to Jesse over the years. Even \nas we will miss seeing our friend every day, we know that Jesse will be \nblessed by the opportunity to spend more time with Dot and his family.\n  Senator Helms leaves the Senate after 30 years, having established a \nlegion of friendships and a memorable legacy. I am confident that he \nwill continue to serve the public, and I join the Senate in wishing \nJesse and Dot all the best as they move on to new adventures.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, as I indicated earlier, Senator Helms \nis a great Senator because he came to the Senate with beliefs and \nprinciples. He has personal integrity and a strong work ethic. He \nmastered the rules of the Senate, and fundamentally his greatness came \nfrom the fact he had the courage to act on those convictions and see \nthem through, even in the face of criticism. He stood for traditional \nAmerican values, for faith, for institutions important to our country, \nsuch as the Boy Scouts. I was an Eagle Scout, and I appreciate so much \nhis leadership for them.\n  He ran for the Senate because of his beliefs and concerns about \nAmerica. That is what made him choose to offer himself. He believed \nAmerica was a great bastion of freedom. He defended her without \napology. He was not a part of the ``blame America'' crowd. He would \nnever go to a foreign country which had demonstrated a history of bad \nbehavior throughout the world and blamed America. He would stand and \nsay, for all our faults, America has stood for right in the world, and \nwe ought to be proud of what we do.\n  He understood the history of America, its uniqueness as a Nation of \nfreedom. He understood the importance of the United States to the world \nas a whole, and he clearly saw, throughout his tenure, godless \ncommunism was incompatible with the faith and freedom that made America \ngreat. So he stood against it, without apology.\n  He had the great joy, I am sure, when his good friend Ronald Reagan \nwas President, to see the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the \nevil empire, and see freedom begin to spread around the world. What a \nwonderful feeling it must have been for this patriot, who stood so long \nfor strong national defense, who stood so long for the values of \nAmerica, and contrasted them with the totalitarian governments in the \ncommunist world. And it was a battle. It was a long struggle. There \nwere good times and bad times. People who stood with firmness, like \nSenator Helms, were often attacked most aggressively in the liberal \nmedia, but he put his beliefs and his love for America first. He was \nprepared to take the heat, and I believe history will record he stood \non the right side of that issue with consistency, integrity, and \ncourage, and played a major role in the victory of freedom over \ncommunism.\n  Senator Helms understood the necessity of American leadership in the \nworld. He understood our unique history. He therefore defended our \nsovereignty. He defended the ability of the United States to stand \nalone, if need be, as he had to do at various times politically, to \ndefend the interests we have. He was willing to work with the United \nNations, NATO, and other groups, but he was not prepared to cede our \nsovereignty to that group.\n  Some time ago, I made the reference to the treaties and agreements so \nmany would like to have us sign. They are much like, in my mind, the \nscene of Gulliver in the land of Lilliputians, being tied down by \nhundreds and hundreds of strings. Pretty soon the giant is not able to \nact and defend himself. We do not need to allow ourselves, through a \nrush to agreements and multilateral organizations, to be tied down from \nour freedom.\n  He provided a critical check against these trends through some \ndifficult times, and I think he sees today the world is better off for \nit.\n  As a matter of fact, with regard to the U.N., he was exceedingly \ncritical of the waste, fraud, and even corruption in the United \nNations. He knew there was a problem; so did almost everyone \nsophisticated in the world today. They knew money was being wasted and \nspent unwisely. They knew there was corruption in programs and within \nthe institution itself. Senator Helms simply said, and was unmovable on \nthe view, until there were reforms in the United Nations, he would \noppose American back payments, and he got that.\n  Oddly, this Senator, who was not emotionally invested in the United \nNations, probably has played as big a role as anyone in making that \norganization a better institution today. He had bipartisan support for \nthat position before it was over.\n  He helped form the steering committee of the Republican caucus in the\n\n[[Page S9799]]\n\nSenate, beginning as a small group of conservatives and has grown now \nto over 49 members of the Republican caucus. Of Members of that \nsteering committee I am honored to be a vice chairman and one of the \nleaders of it. Senator Gramm is here today and served as chairman. \nSenator Helms served as a chairman in the early days, 1981 to 1985. Now \nthat institution does have a great voice in the affairs of this Senate.\n  He is a great church man, a Baptist deacon, a Sunday school teacher. \nHe graduated from the Wake Forest University, a superb Baptist school, \nwith a superb Baptist heritage. He is a man of faith and belief for \nwhich he never apologized. There is in the tradition of the Baptist \nChurch a tremendous belief in the sanctity of individual human beings, \na sense of democracy that is unique. Senator Helms says that every \nindividual human being had the same creator and the same value in the \noverall scheme of life.\n  He is a man of graciousness. He is a southern gentleman and kind and \nwonderful to his friends. But he was strong and courageous and firm \nwhen he believed his principles called for that. He could be unmovable, \nbut he was also kind.\n  He told the story to me of his friendship with former Senator Jim \nAllen from Alabama. Like Senator Helms, he was an independent man who \nknew the rules of the Senate and had the courage to utilize and fight \nfor these values and use those rules effectively. He told the story \nabout coming to Alabama for Jim Allen's funeral. They got off the \nairplane. Senator Allen was extraordinarily well respected in the \nState, loved throughout the State. He recalled to me seeing a sign that \nsaid ``a giant has fallen,'' and tears came to his eyes as he told that \nstory to me.\n  That shows the extent of his affection for his fellow Senators, his \ndeep feelings of companionship. At the same time, our Senator Helms has \nbeen a giant for American values, for American principles, and for this \ncountry. I have been honored to know him. I have been honored to know \nhis wonderful wife, Dot, as has my wife, who so much admires her. We \ngive them our best wishes in their future endeavors. We wish them \nhealth and vitality and many years of service and enjoyment with their \nfamily and friends. They have been served with great distinction.\n  Senator Helms has been a giant in this body. It has been an honor to \nserve with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it is with mixed emotions that I rise today \nto pay tribute to my colleague, mentor and friend, Senator Jesse Helms, \nwho is leaving this body after 30 years of extraordinary service to our \ncountry. I want to honor him and convey to people around America who do \nnot know him, what a great person he is. Yet, I hate to see him go.\n  Many words come to mind when I think of Jesse Helms: principled, \nstalwart, kind, patriot, American. But, when I mull his retiring from \nthe Senate, one word keeps coming to mind: irreplaceable.\n  Jesse Helms will not be, he cannot be, replaced, and that is a sad \nthing. His presence here has been a constant for three decades. Like \nfew others in this body, Senator Helms' career has achieved near-\nmythical proportions; it is the stuff of legend.\n  Why is that? I believe it's because few, if any, others can match \nJesse Helms' deep and unshakable commitment to principle. Jesse's not \nmuch of a deal maker. His vote has never been up for grabs. You always, \nalways knew where he stood. Some agreed, others disagreed. But you \ndidn't have to guess.\n  You get a glimpse of this simple yet profound approach when you walk \ninto Jesse's office and see the large yes and no stamps on his desk. \nThat is what it has been like to deal with Jesse Helms. If your idea \nmet his high standards, you got an immediate and enthusiastic ``yes.'' \nIf it did not, you got an amiable but unmistakable ``no.'' And if it \nwas ``yes,'' he'd stick with you no matter what. Popularity was not a \nfactor. The best interests of this country were what mattered.\n  It has been a great honor for me to work with Senator Helms during my \n8 years in this body. We have endeavored together to promote \nconservative ideas, in particular the idea that America's security is \nbest preserved through the maintenance of our strength and the \npromotion of our values. But I was just following the trail that Jesse \nHelms blazed. In the 1970s and 1980s, Jesse Helms led the fight to put \nmorality and strength back into American foreign policy. People the \nworld over, from Louisiana to Lithuania, from Texas to Taiwan, are \nbetter off because of that.\n  Mark Twain said: ``Always do right. This will gratify some people, \nand astonish the rest.'' I was always among those gratified by Senator \nHelms' courageous stands on matters of high principle. He did right. \nAnd watching other people's astonishment at this was one of the great \nthings about the Helms era in American politics.\n  We will miss you, Senator.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms. Born in Monroe, NC on \nOctober 18, 1921, Senator Helms has served our country over several \ndecades and in many capacities. From 1942 through 1945, Sen. Helms \nproudly wore our country's military uniform as a member of the United \nStates Navy. After World War II, he helped generate public debate as \nboth journalist and editor.\n  Senator Helms took up the mantle of public service in 1957 when he \nwas elected to the Raleigh City Council. During his four years on the \ncouncil, he served as the chairman of the Council's Law and Finance \nCommittee. In 1961, Senator Helms returned to journalism, serving as \nthe executive vice president of the Capitol Broadcasting Company. He \nalso wrote daily editorials for television and radio on the most \npressing issues of the day. His writings were so popular that they were \nprinted in more than 200 newspapers throughout the United States.\n  Senator Helms was elected to his first term in the Senate in January \n1973. He has been reelected to the Senate five times and has served \nthis body for nearly thirty years. During that time, Senator Helms \nalways stood firm in his beliefs. Like a rock in the midst of a raging \nstorm, his commitment to principle has never wavered. He has been a \nfierce advocate for less government, reduced taxes, and greater \nindividual freedom. For the last decade, he has served as either \nchairman or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nwhere he has worked to secure our country from foreign threats, protect \nAmerican sovereignty in international institutions, and spread \ndemocracy to those oppressed by tyranny and injustice.\n  Margaret Thatcher once described the essence of accomplishment. She \nsaid, ``Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It's \nnot a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it's when you've had \neverything to do, and you've done it.''\n  Senator Helms has certainly had everything to do, and he has done it. \nHe has accomplished much and finished well. His decades of service to \nhis country and his beloved State of North Carolina have been an \nexample to us all. He is a man who deserves our tribute and our \ngratitude.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I join the chorus of Senators who \ntoday are saluting our good friend of 30 years, the distinguished \nSenior Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms.\n  For all 30 years the two of us, representing both Carolinas, have \nshared the fight to keep jobs in our respective states. If I can say \none thing about this man, it is that he has always, always looked out \nfor the interests of the little guy.\n  Too many in this town want to forget about the people who get up \nevery day, give an honest day's work at a textile plant, play by the \nrules, but lose out because of the unfair trade policies of this \ncountry. Senator Helms always looked out for the people Washington \ncould care less about; the people who Washington thinks we can re-train \ninto high-tech, high-tech, but who wants a 55-year old first time \ncomputer operator? For his voice on trade issues is how this Senator \nwill remember my friend, and it is for this voice that he has been such \na great asset to this institution.\n  Obviously, on many issues we disagreed; but he and I would cross any \nand every party line to help the people of our states. In the future, \nno trade\n\n[[Page S9800]]\n\ndebate in this body will ever be the same without the man who served as \nSenator from North Carolina longer than any other from that state.\n  My wife, Peatsy, and I congratulate Dot and Jesse, and we wish them \nonly health and happiness in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I begin by talking about our dear \ncolleague, Jesse Helms. It is hard to decide what to say about this \ngood man that virtually everybody in America knows. As expected with \nsomeone who has strong views as Jesse Helms, they either like him or \nthey don't like him. I like him. In fact, I am proud to say that I love \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina.\n  So much has been said about him, I don't want to be repetitive, but \nthere are a few points I want to make. It is important to look back at \nAmerica and what America was like and what the Senate was like and what \ndebate was being conducted when Jesse Helms came to the Senate. It is \nfair to say Jesse Helms was conservative before conservative was cool. \nWhen Jesse Helms came to the Senate it was conventional wisdom in the \nSenate to begin every foreign policy statement with a long list of \nindictments, not against our would-be adversaries, but against our own \ncountry. There was a guilt about America, this doubt about our purpose \nand our policy.\n  Jesse Helms, as a young member of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nstarted the process of changing that debate. Jesse Helms may have had \ndoubts about many things, but he didn't have any doubts about America. \nHe did not have any doubts about what we stood for and stand for. He \ndid not have any doubts about the fact there was an evil empire, that \nthere was a cold war. He was very actively involved in the fighting and \nwinning of that cold war.\n  Today, we just had a lesson on a bipartisan basis from our colleagues \nthat rejects all of this baloney that somehow we should turn over the \nprotection of Americans to the U.N., that unilateralism was the wave of \nthe future. On a bipartisan basis, our colleagues said when you come \ndown to American interests and American lives, those decisions have to \nbe made by the American President.\n  That is a dramatic change from what the Senate, America, and the \nworld were like when Jesse Helms came to the Senate. Probably no one \nhas done more to change that than he has.\n  Before Jesse Helms came to the Senate, social conservative was a \nsynonym for Neanderthal. People in the political arena were a little \nbit ashamed to talk about the role of religion in American history. \nTalking about religious values and God were so out of fashion that no \nup-and-coming Senator with big ambitions would do it. Jesse Helms was a \ncatalyst in changing all of that.\n  Whether you agree or disagree with Jesse Helms on the role of \nreligion in American life, whether you agree or disagree about the \nimportance of values in our schools, in our families, in our country, \nwhether you consider yourself in the worn political cliches of the era \nto be pro-life or pro-choice, there was no spokesman for traditional \nAmerican values when Jesse Helms came to the Senate. They may have been \nold-fashioned to everyone else, but Jesse Helms was comfortable \nespousing those values as he has always been comfortable in his own \nskin.\n  There are many stories I could relate about Jesse Helms. I am kind of \nsorry that many of my young colleagues did not know Jesse Helms in the \nold days. But knowing him now is a pretty good substitute for it. I \nwill relate one story which I think brings, in one encapsulated form, \nJesse Helms.\n  There was a debate in the Senate--I was in the House--about a \ngasoline tax, and there was a broad bipartisan consensus that we ought \nto raise taxes on gasoline. After all, people were riding up and down \nthe road in these pickup trucks--we didn't have SUVs to any significant \ndegree then--but Congress, knowing that people really needed smaller \ncars and needed to learn to live on less, and that we were going to \nhave to accept smaller ambitions and smaller dreams, they had it all \nfigured out, and so Congress was going to impose a new tax on gasoline.\n  Jesse Helms almost alone stood up against it. As we all know, they do \nnot call this the greatest deliberative body in history because those \nof us who are in it are such great deliberators. They call this the \ngreatest deliberative body in history because any individual Member has \ntremendous power. Any individual Member who feels very strongly about \nsomething can have a profound effect on it. So Jesse Helms, almost \nsinglehandedly, was holding up this gasoline tax. They wanted to \nadjourn, and everybody was unhappy.\n  We all are familiar with peer group pressure. It is something you are \nborn subject to, and it never goes away until they lower you in the \ngrave. We all want to be loved, we all want to be accepted, which is \nwhy so many of us bend with the wind.\n  But Helms was not doing any bending that day. So on the debate went \non. Finally, the Senate adjourned. No gasoline tax.\n  So, Jesse is feeling kind of down and unloved as he is driving back \nto North Carolina, and he goes into a restaurant and orders a sandwich, \nand he is sitting there, and this guy over in the corner says: That's \nJesse Helms.\n  And everybody in the restaurant stood up and applauded.\n  So his views were out of fashion in the Senate. However, he was a \npositive impediment. He was a throwback to the era when people did not \nunderstand that the Senate and the Government had all the wisdom. They \nknew what Americans needed, and he was just standing in the way; a man \nfrom another age, another era. But in that truck stop restaurant where \nreal people were eating, where people were there who were going to be \naffected, Jesse Helms was a hero.\n  What a great blessing it has been to the country that Jesse Helms \ncame to serve here. I am proud to call him my friend. I am proud of his \ngreat service. I will always remember serving with him.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, there are many traditions in the \nsouthland, where I am proud to have my roots. I represent the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. We have the saying ``a Virginia gentleman.'' \nTime will tell as to whether I will ever be able to earn that title. \nBut the great Senator to my right in this Chamber, Jesse Helms, has \nearned many times over the title ``a gentleman from North Carolina'' \nand a ``gentleman of the Senate.''\n  I have had the privilege of working with him throughout my 24 years \nin this Chamber. He has been a leader and an inspiration. He has helped \nme and other Senators as we have joined in this magnificent Chamber \ntime and time again to work our will, to represent our constituents, \nand he always reminds us that we are here for the whole Nation as \nUnited States Senators.\n  Jesse Helms is a man of unquestioned integrity, honesty, character, \nwit, and wisdom. And now with his lovely wife Dorothy, they seek other \nchallenges in life. I never think of my colleague as retiring. He is \ngoing on to other challenges, where he will apply the same passion, the \nsame vigor, the same energy, and the same insight into those issues \nabout which he feels so strongly.\n  We were never in doubt as to where the senior Senator from North \nCarolina stood on an issue. To his everlasting credit, he learned every \nday he was in the Senate. I have seen him on two major issues learn \nmore and then have the willingness and the courage to stand here and \nlook us in the eye and say, ``I am going to change my position.''\n  For years, he was concerned--and rightfully so--about the United \nNations. But then he decided that he would lead the effort in the \nSenate, with his Democrat colleagues on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, to see that this Nation lived up to its financial \nobligations and in other ways gave support to the United Nations. I \nnever thought I would witness Jesse Helms going to the United Nations. \nHe asked me to go with him. I said to myself this will be a moment in \nhistory, and off we went with several other colleagues. We had a series \nof meetings in which we freely discussed the issues and, step by step, \nsome of those financial problems have been resolved because of the \nleadership of this fine man.\n  On the subject of Africa, there was no prejudice in his heart. There \nwas concern about whether we could expend funds for that very troubled \ncontinent, that troubled population, afflicted by\n\n[[Page S9801]]\n\ndisproportionate levels of disease and poverty and AIDS. Senator Helms \ndecided he was going to do what he could to help those people, and that \nhe did, particularly with regard to AIDS. It takes a big man, a giant \nin the Senate, to do the things he has done.\n  I will close with this recollection. I remember one year being in \nsession up to the eve of Christmas. I cannot remember the exact day, \nbut Christmas was coming. Tempers in this Chamber were flaring. There \nwas Alan Simpson, a marvelous Senator from Wyoming. Suddenly, he and \nJesse Helms had a bit of a disagreement. As a younger Senator, I was \nway back there. The disagreement occurred somewhere right in here. I \nwatched Helms and I watched Simpson. Simpson was noted for his humor. \nBut those two went at it. But the bounds of dignity were always \nmaintained when those two Senators--this time of the same party--had \nsuch a strong disagreement. And many times I followed this great \nSenator as we were leaving the Chamber to go back to our offices, and I \nwatched him stop and talk to the pages, those who provide the \ninfrastructure in this institution, who work with their hands, who do \nother jobs. He would always find time for those to share with him a \nthought and he would share with them kind words and kind gestures. My \ndear friend and his lovely wife and family have many wonderful years \nahead of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to express, as have many of my \ncolleagues today who joined the tribute to Senator Jesse Helms, my \nappreciation of working with Senator Helms. Particularly, I have \nenjoyed working with him, and the people of Louisiana have truly \nbenefitted and have been truly grateful for this man's work, in the \narea of child welfare and adoption.\n  As you might know, when Senator Helms chaired the Foreign Relations \nCommittee several years ago, he had many grave matters under his \njurisdiction including several important treaties. Many people asked \nfor his support to call up a number of issues, but, of course, he could \nnot champion them all.\n  Again, so many things competed for his attention, yet he managed to \nput the treaty for the international adoption of children on the table \nand to a vote. This is the first treaty of its kind in the world. Every \ntreaty is important, and everybody who is interested, particularly the \ngroups affected, thinks theirs is the most important. I would be \npressed to find a group more vulnerable in the world than orphans. \nConsider this--orphans really have no one. They do not have any \nparents. They do not have immediate relatives to look after them to \nprotect, feed, clothe, and educate them. Orphaned minors are a class \nwith no vote. They might live in countries where, even if they are \nadults, they have no voice or vote. They are often just lost wanderers \ntrying to raise themselves.\n  Senator Helms, with all he could have done, took the time of his \ncommittee to push forward a resolution that was not without \ncontroversy. The treaty said something profoundly beautiful: That we \nbelieve a child deserves at least one caring, responsible, and loving \nparent; that the governments of the world should break down barriers, \nshould do more to see that children are attached to grownups, that \nchildren should not raise themselves on the street or should not have \nto sell themselves into prostitution; that kids should not be abused by \nadults, and they should be protected by parents.\n  Mr. President, there are too many orphans in this world. One is too \nmany. Unfortunately, the number is growing astronomically every day, \nand these children face an AIDS epidemic, war, and famine. In our own \ncountry, we have thousands of orphans. People do not believe we have \norphans in the United States of America, but we do. We have \napproximately 500,000 children in foster care, and about 100,000 of \nthem, enough to fill up the Super Dome--every seat and the aisles in \nthe Super Dome stadium--have no parents at all. They think no one wants \nthem. They are all ages, shapes, colors, and creeds. They are all \nloveable kids. They just do not have anybody to love them and to call \ntheir own.\n  This Senator worked hard with many other Senators to pass this \ntreaty. We did. It is a big deal to a lot of people in the world. It is \nhelping pave the way for the possibility that we could establish laws \nand rules that would help connect orphans to parents.\n  If you have ever seen a child who has been adopted--I know hundreds \nof people who have been affected positively by adoption, including my \nown family, who have had wonderful outcomes. It is not what we read \nabout in the press, the one or two adoptions that go wrong. But \nthroughout the world, there are parents grateful for the blessing to \nraise children and children grateful that they have been attached to a \nfamily. As you know, that is the building block of our society. Our \nsociety cannot be strong if our families are not strong, and families \ncan be built to be strong physically, emotionally, and spiritually \nthrough adoption. Senator Helms knows that.\n  I wanted to say on this special day that we honor him, he can be \nhonored for a lot of his work, but I think that his contributions to \nchildren and his consistent belief in children with special needs \ndeserve to be recognized. I join my colleagues honoring him, and I am \nglad he is back with us in the Senate to end his long career.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I join my colleagues in honoring the \nsenior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, who will be retiring at \nthe end of this Congress. In his five terms in the U.S. Senate, Senator \nHelms has been a distinguished leader on behalf of his home State of \nNorth Carolina and freedom-loving people throughout the world.\n  When I arrived in the Senate at the beginning of this Congress, \nSenator Helms had already served a remarkable 28 years. It has been an \nhonor to serve under the strong leadership of this gentleman on the \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Helms has been a strong advocate for those rights that Thomas \nJefferson proclaimed in our Declaration of Independence are \n``inalienable''--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  He has led the initiative to promote a peaceful transition to \ndemocracy and respect for human rights in Cuba. Fidel Castro oppresses \nhis people, violates workers' rights, falsely imprisons them, and \ndenies them the freedom of religion. Castro intentionally violates \ninternationally accepted standards of basic human rights to maintain \npower over the Cuban people.\n  In response, Senator Helms sponsored a bill to help the people of \nCuba regain their freedom and prepare themselves for the transition to \ndemocracy. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of that bill.\n  Senator Helms has been a leader in reminding us to put the needs of \nthe Cuban people before the tyrannical agenda of the dictator, Fidel \nCastro. Castro seeks to retain his monopoly on political power by any \nmeans possible. Under his rule, Cuba is one of seven states designated \nby the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism, and Senator \nHelms has not been fooled into propping up this regime with U.S. \ntaxpayer money.\n  Not just with respect to Cuba, but around the world, Senator Helms \nhas been a champion of freedom and democracy. Senator Helms and I have \nalso worked together to support the people of Taiwan through the Senate \nTaiwan Caucus.\n  All the while Senator Helms has been tackling international abuses \nand supporting democracy around the world, never once has he forgotten \nthe people of North Carolina and the sovereignty of the United States.\n  The Senator has been a strong, dedicated advocate for farmers and \npeople who live and work in small towns, especially when he was \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee.\n  Senator Helms and I are working together to lift the Japanese ban on \nU.S. poultry. We have also worked together on the Farm Bill, ensuring \nthat peanut farmers get the highest target price possible for their \npeanuts. With Senator Helms' key help, the IRS has just announced that \nit will treat peanut quota buyouts as capital gains, not ordinary \nincome. This is good news for devastated peanut farmers in southeast \nVirginia and northeast North Carolina.\n  Regrettably, I have had only a couple of years to work with Senator \nHelms. But it has been a true honor and wonderful pleasure. On behalf \nof all the good people of Virginia, I offer my best wishes to Senator \nHelms and his family. And, I especially thank him for his\n\n[[Page S9802]]\n\nguidance, encouragement and friendship that I shall cherish forever.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, for nearly 30 years now, my good friend \nand fellow colleague Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina has been a \nstalwart of conservative thinking and values for this legislative body. \nHe has represented the very best of what the Republican party has to \noffer and I would personally like to thank Senator Helms for his vigor \nand grit. Now more than ever, it is important that this Senate and this \nnation realize and appreciate the work Senator Helms has done for the \npeople of North Carolina and the citizens of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Throughout his tenure in the United States Senate, Senator Helms has \nbeen a true fighter, a heavy weight champion for America's values. He \nfought against communism throughout the entirety of the Cold War. He \nfought for and still fights for the protection of the American people \nagainst foreign and domestic threats. For 30 years, he has battled and \nfought against liberalism in an attempt to bring conservative values \nand ideas back to this nation and to this congress.\n  ``Senator No,'' as he has come to be known, has developed a long list \nof enemies on the other side of the aisle and in certain media outlets. \nBut let's not forget what Winston Churchill said about having enemies. \n``You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, \nsometime in your life.'' Whether or not you have agreed with one word \nor action Senator Helms has said or taken in his 30 years as a Senator \nin the United States Congress, you have to agree with and admire his \ndetermination and strength. Once again, I thank Senator Helms for being \na guiding light in a sometimes dark world.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague, \nSenator Jesse Helms, and to thank him for his service to his country \nand the U.S. Senate. Senator Helms is retiring after 30 years in the \nSenate and I wish him and his wife, Dot, all the best.\n  Senator Helms and I have not always agreed on the issues. But any \ndisagreements we may have had has never gotten in the way of a \nconstructive and cordial working relationship. We served together on \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee for several years and currently \nserve together on the Rules and Administration Committee.\n  I have admired his dedication to his views, though I may strongly \ndisagree with them, and his commitment to his constituents in North \nCarolina. There were certainly several occasions when I wished I had \nSenator Helms fighting on my side.\n  When the battle was done, there were no hard feelings. As several of \nmy colleagues here today have mentioned, you would be hard pressed to \nfind a nicer man in the U.S. Senate. Whether you are a page, \nmaintenance worker, staffer, Senator, President, Republican or \nDemocrat, Senator Helms treats you with the same amount of respect and \ncourtesy. That is a fitting tribute to a man who has dedicated himself \nto a life of public service.\n  Again, I thank Senator Helms for his time in the Senate. This body \nwill certainly not be the same without him.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, allow me to add my voice to the chorus of \nregard for the distinguished senior Senator from North Carolina, Jesse \nHelms.\n  There is a word we use a lot around here the word ``gentleman.'' \nPerhaps as a result of the demands of Senate protocol, our colleagues \nfrequently use the word in addressing one another. It is thrown around \nso regularly that it has almost become as meaningless as ``mister'' in \nmodern Congressional parlance.\n  However, ``gentleman'' is more than a meaningless title in the case \nof Jesse Helms. I am not alone in referring to him as ``the \nconservative gentleman of the Senate'' because that is precisely what \nhe is: an unfailingly gentle, kind, and courteous man. Even in the heat \nof battle, slicing through the opposition as he so often does, he \nmaintains not just the integrity of his principles, but the integrity \nof his performance. Even when he establishes himself as the immovable \nobject to block bad policy, as he also has done so often, he does it \ngraciously.\n  Senator Helms' restraint is all the more significant in view of the \nturbulence of the debates he has waded into. This is a man who does not \nback away from challenges but confronts them. His dedication to \nprinciple is unshakeable, and he is an invaluable ally in stormy \npolitical passages. As fellow skeptics of the United Nations and \nparticularly, of the International Criminal Court, I appreciated having \nhis support last year in preventing the United States' endorsement of \nthat institution. Surely one of Jesse Helms' lasting legacies will be \nhis mark on our country's foreign policy. But that is only one small \npart of the profound impact he has had on our laws and our culture.\n  Senator Helms' leadership and articulate championship of conservative \nideals have inspired countless admirers of many generations. I can \nattest to the fact that the ``Jesse Helms fan club'' extends to my own \nSenate staff, who proudly display the photos they have had taken with \nSenator Helms, and talk about his generosity in taking time to visit \nwith them--visits they will remember for the rest of their lives. For \nmy part, I consider it a privilege to have served with, and learned \nfrom, a man of his caliber.\n  Senator Helms has been an extraordinary advocate for the people of \nNorth Carolina and, indeed, this Nation. His clear vision and steady \nguidance will be sorely missed when he leaves the Senate in the coming \nmonths. I join my colleagues today in congratulating Jesse Helms on his \ndistinguished career, thanking him for the contributions he has made to \nthe Senate and the United States, and wishing him all the best in the \nnext chapter of his remarkable life.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, It is always a sad day in the U.S. Senate \nwhen we prepare to bid good-bye to a dear friend and fellow Senator. \nBut when you have been here as long as I have, and you are saying good-\nbye to a gentleman who was here when I arrived, and whom I first \nconsidered a senior Senator and now can also call a friend, it is \nparticularly bittersweet.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken eloquently already about the senior \nsenator from North Carolina, my friend Jesse Helms. I would like to \nassociate myself with these remarks of tribute and respect. If we spent \nthe rest of the year praising Jesse, we would still not do justice to \nthis man.\n  So I would like to take a moment here to comment on the leadership \nJesse Helms assumed in his pivotal role as ranking member and chairman \nof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Oh, the wags worried, Mr. President, when the Republicans retook the \nSenate in 1994. What would this mean for the country that Jesse Helms \nwould chair the committee that conducts the oversight over this \nnation's foreign policies and institutions of diplomacy? There was one \ncartoon I found particularly amusing: There was Jesse, scowling at his \ndesk, on which sat a globe cut in half, with only the United States \nshowing. The Jesse they portrayed was an isolationist, but the Jesse we \nknow is merely an unabashed defender of the U.S. national interest.\n  In this very chamber, Jesse has often argued that the State \nDepartment has lost the perspective of advancing our interests. Foreign \naid, the good senator from North Carolina is famous for saying, ``went \ndown rat holes.''\n  Jesse sees foreign policy from the perspective of preserving and \nadvancing the national interest. Call it ``parochial,'' if you will, \nbut Jesse is a traditional conservative: the sovereignty of the nation \nstate was at the core of the international system, and if order is to \nprevail, it would remain at the core. And no sovereignty was more \njealously protected than the sovereign of this country under our \nConstitution.\n  Of course, you can't be a traditional conservative without \nrecognizing the virtues of freedom and the threats of tyranny. You \ncan't believe in the United States and ignore that the world presents--\nand continues to present threats to these freedoms emanating from all \nforms of tyranny. And Jesse has fought against them all.\n  There is no stauncher anti-communist than Jesse Helms, and I admire \nhim for this. Whether it is Latin American communism under the Castro \ndictatorship or Sandinista state, or the Soviet managers of the Gulags \ninternal and external, Jesse has stood up to them and has outlived most \nof them.\n\n[[Page S9803]]\n\nNo man stands for freedom against communism more steadfastly than Jesse \nHelms. To do so was the fundamental attribute, in my opinion, of a \nconscientious internationalist.\n  The foes of Jesse Helms know that he is relentless. His friends know \nthat he devoted. Small democracies around the world and I think of \nIsrael and Taiwan have in Jesse Helms a stalwart defender.\n  Jesse's internationalism, doubted by many, has transformed the world. \nLet me give you but a few brief examples:\n  After years of frustration in Washington, Jesse could no longer \ntolerate the waste and ideological neglect emanating from the United \nNations. Building on policies of restricting funding to that body that \nbegan in this Senate in the 1980s, Jesse drafted legislation setting \ntargets of reform and reduced U.S. contributions that most people \nbelieved the U.N. would never comply with. Jesse was anti-U.N., many \ncharged, and wanted the U.S. to withdraw from that body into further \nisolationism.\n  This was nonsense, of course, Jesse, who was parodied as an \nanachronistic reactionary, is in fact an internationalist visionary. He \nknew that the American public would soon cease to tolerate inequitable \nfunding requests for a broken international bureaucracy. He knew that \nthe way to irrelevancy for the U.N. was the path it was on. Jesse cut \nanother path, in landmark legislation that gained, ultimately the vast \nmajority of the support of members on both sides of this aisle, to \ndemand that the U.N. reform its bureaucracy and reinvigorate its \nrelationship with the U.S. and the U.S. Congress.\n  The U.N. heard the message and responded. And it is a better \norganization for it. The fact that President Bush was able to address \nthat body two weeks ago from a position of mutual respect, and that we \nwill be able to work constructively with that body in the coming \ndifficult months ahead, has a great deal to do with the foresight of \nJesse Helms.\n\n  In recent years, Jesse has promoted the American Servicemembers \nProtection Act, which I have been proud to cosponsor, to defend U.S. \nmilitary from prosecution of an ill-focused United Nations \nInternational Criminal Court. Not a popular cause among the \nmultilateralists, abroad and in our own government, but Jesse Helms has \nalways been about doing what's right for America, not what's popular.\n  This legislation was recently signed into law. And guess what, Mr. \nPresident. The European Union, the professional advocate of all things \nmultilateral, is coming around to recognizing that the U.S. must have \nas a component of bilateral relations formally exclusions our \nservicemen who sacrifice so much for their country and should be \naccountable only to their country's laws and commander-in-chief. Once \nagain, Jesse Helms eschewed the conventional wisdom, saw over the \nhorizon, and strengthened America's position in the world.\n  And my friend Jesse Helms knows that, when America's position in the \nworld is strengthened, the security of the world is advanced. This is \nthe kind of internationalism that I admire.\n  Most people are not focusing now, among the debate over Iraq, on the \nfact that NATO is engaging in another expansion, bringing in seven \nnations of central and eastern Europe into this military organization \nof democracies. The alliance will be stronger for this, and U.S. \nnational security will be more secure.\n  This is the second enlargement after the end of the Cold War. The \nfirst was completed in 1999, when Poland, Hungary and the Czech \nRepublic became members. In 1998, this body, where we must ratify any \nNorth Atlantic Treaty amendments, had a historic debate on whether to \nallow these members. Jesse Helms shepherded that debate, and U.S. \nnational security interests were advanced.\n  All of us know that there is so much to Jesse Helms that we cannot do \nhim justice in our remarks of appreciation. Constituents, colleagues, \nforeign friends--all of these know this of this man.\n  A few years ago, I had a meeting with an impressive songwriter named \nBono, who came to my office seeking support for debt reduction in the \npoorest countries of the world. I was impressed with Bono and his work, \nand I was impressed that he wanted to work within the system, \nrespecting economics while advocating compassion. He had my support. As \nhe left his office, I asked where he was going. Bono told me, ``I'm \ngoing to meet Senator Helms.'' That will be interesting, I thought to \nmyself.\n  As is now well-known, Bono and Jesse hit it off. And today Jesse \nHelms is a leader in supporting the U.S. contribution to fighting that \nterrible pandemic in Africa.\n  Many have tried to define Jesse Helms by what he opposed. I will \nremember him for what he supported: Freedom, human rights, and strong \nand independent America, free to spread its good in the world.\n  I thank my good friend for his years of service, for his friendship \nto me, for his impeccable courtesy in debates whether we agreed or not. \nWe will never see the likes of a Senator Helms again.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, it was good today to hear the many \nheartfelt sentiments and compliments being expressed in the Senate \nabout our distinguished colleague from North Carolina. I want to be \ncounted among those who respect Jesse Helms for his conscientious and \ndiligent service in the Senate and for the generosity of spirit he \ndisplays and the affection he has for his fellow Senators and the staff \nand employees of the Senate.\n  If you could ask all of the Senate pages who have served here during \nthe time Senator Helms has been in the Senate who their favorite \nSenator was, I am sure they would tell you it was Jesse Helms. He takes \ntime to get to know them all and to greet them each day. He really \ncares about them and he wants them to know they are appreciated. That \nis the way Senator Helms has treated everyone in the Senate. He has a \nheart of gold.\n  When Senator Helms was Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I \nappreciated the fairness and respect he showed to all of the members of \nour committee. He was especially helpful to me and I will always be \ngrateful to him for his friendship.\n  I wish for him much happiness and satisfaction in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I thank all Senators who have been so \nkind this morning.\n  I have been sitting here at this desk wondering who on Earth is this \nHelms fellow whom my colleagues keep talking about. To be sure, there \nare newspaper editors in North Carolina who will tell you that any kind \nwords uttered about Jesse Helms are, at best, exaggerations.\n  So it goes without saying that I am grateful for the generosity of my \ncolleagues. It reminds me of the first time I came to Washington, DC to \nwork in this Capitol Building, back in 1950. I had come to Washington \nwith a remarkable Senator, Willis Smith, who had the highest and finest \ncredentials as one of the Nation's leading and most respected \nattorneys.\n  Senator Smith deserves a tribute all his own. He was, among other \ndistinctions, chairman of the Board of Trustees of Duke University, and \nformer president of the American Bar Association. I was honored that he \nhad shown the faith in me that led him to bring me with him to \nWashington as his administrative assistant.\n  The Senate was a far less hectic place during the 2\\1/2\\ years I \nworked for Senator Willis Smith, before his tragic and untimely death \nin 1952. All of us who worked in the Senate at that time had the \nprivilege to know some of the true pillars of the Senate, men who were \nthe cornerstone of America in the 20th century, among them, a special \nfriend of mine, Richard Russell of Georgia. Senator Russell was so kind \nto have taken an interest in me in those years, and I vividly remember \nmany conversations with this remarkable American. Once, he told me \nsomething, for example, that I never have forgotten. He commented: \n``Jesse, a Senator who goes onto the Senate floor without knowing the \nrules is only half prepared. And a man who walks onto the Senate floor \nwith command of the rules can cut Senators lacking such knowledge to \nribbons.''\n  I never imagined that more than 20 years later, in 1972, the turn of \nevents would lead me to be persuaded to become the Republican candidate \nfor U.S.\n\n[[Page S9804]]\n\nSenate from North Carolina. Nor did I ever expect to have the good \nfortune to win. But on election night 1972, at 9:17 p.m., Walter \nCronkite came on the television and said, ``Down in North Carolina, a \nfellow named Jesse Helms has got himself elected to the Senate.''\n  So, I went off by myself and prayed for guidance. Then, after \nspending some time with my family, I remembered that comment by Senator \nRussell. I determined that I would do the best I could to learn \nsomething about rules of the Senate.\n  It developed as soon as I was sworn into the Senate in January 1973 \nthat I had the great fortune to have a teacher like Senator Jim Allen \nof Alabama. Once a week, I would go to Senator Allen's office, and he \nwould conduct an impromptu classroom in Senate procedure. Then, as \noften as I could, I would come to this Chamber and preside over the \nSenate.\n  So as a freshman Senator, I had a wonderful opportunity to preside \nover the Senate. That enabled me, working with that great man Dr. Floyd \nRiddick, Chief Parliamentarian of the Senate, to learn the rules \nbackwards and forwards. True to Senator Russell's words, those rules \ncame in handy during some spirited battles around here. And as the \nyears went by, I won some and lost some, but I always had the comfort \nof knowing I had done what I thought was right in the best way I knew \nhow.\n  I recall the time that I mentioned the late Senator Dick Russell in \ndebate one afternoon. Later that evening, Majority Leader Mike \nMansfield thanked me for my reference to Senator Russell. Senator \nMansfield mentioned that former Senators who departed by reason of \ndeath or expiration of their tenures here were often quickly forgotten.\n  Senator Mansfield was right about this. As will be true in my case, \nmost Senators who have completed their service will be forgotten, just \nas surely as others have faded into history.\n  As I approach the end of my five terms in the Senate, I realize that \nbeing remembered isn't important. What is important is standing up for \nwhat you believe to be right, hoping that you have done everything you \ncan to preserve the moral and spiritual principles that made America \ngreat in the first place.\n  My father, rest his soul, was a good man who taught me many things. \nIn my office, there is an inscription of something he told me many \nyears ago. ``Son,'' he said, ``The Lord doesn't expect you to win. He \njust expects you to try.''\n  With the remarkable Dot Helms at my side, we have done our best to \nlive up to my father's admonition. And while we are certainly not \nperfect, and we certainly haven't always had all the answers, we have \nthe comfort of feeling that we have done the best we can. Nobody can \nclaim to have had a better life, or to be more blessed and honored by \nthe people of North Carolina than Dot Helms and me.\n  Every so often, a reporter will ask me what I consider to be my \nlegacy after 30 years in the Senate. Now ``legacy'' is a fancy word for \nthe son of a small town police and fire chief, so I never know how to \nanswer such a question.\n  But there is one thing I should mention that has given me particular \nsatisfaction during my Senate career. When I was first elected, it was, \nas I have mentioned, a genuine surprise. I never expected to win. And \none of the things I promised myself on that November night was that I \nwould never, ever, fail to see a young person, or a group of young \npeople, who wanted to see me.\n  Now the young lady who keeps track of such things in my office \nrecently told me that I have had the chance to visit with more than \n100,000 young people during my nearly 30 years in the Senate. I have \nbeen the beneficiary of the time I have spent with these young folks.\n  It is in them that I have seen the promise of what I regard as the \n``Miracle of America.'' They are bright, curious, throughly decent \nyoung folks who are committed to preserving the ideals of America as a \ncountry devoted to freedom and opportunity.\n  As Dot Helms and I prepare to go home--this time for good--we are \ngrateful to young people who have visited us. Dot and I are convinced \nthat America's future is in fine hands.\n  They are not my legacy; they are America's legacy, and I thank the \nLord for them every day.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues, and I thank the people of \nNorth Carolina for allowing me the honor of serving in the U.S. Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, along with my dear friends and \ncolleagues, Senators Warner, Bayh, and McCain, I am proud to introduce \nthis bipartisan resolution which would authorize the President of the \nUnited States to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \ndetermines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the \nnational security of the United States against the continuing threat \nposed by Iraq, and to enforce all relevant United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions regarding Iraq.\n  There is no more fateful or difficult decision that we as Senators \nare ever called upon to make than a decision as to whether and when and \nhow to authorize the President as Commander in Chief to put the men and \nwomen of the U.S. military into battle.\n  Each Member of the Senate must make this decision at this hour \naccording to their personal conscience and their sense of what is best \nfor the security of the people of the United States of America.\n  For my part, and that of my colleagues, I have made that decision. \nFor more than a decade now, Saddam Hussein has threatened the peace and \nsecurity of his region and the wider world. We went to war in 1991 to \nroll back his aggression--an invasion of Kuwait--because we determined \nacross party lines that Saddam Hussein had ambitions that were hostile \nto America's security and the peace of the world to become the dominant \npower in the Arab world which, if ever realized, would be bad for the \nArab world, bad for the peace and security of the broader region, and \nvery bad for the people of the United States. We won that war in \nKuwait--Operation Desert Storm--but Saddam Hussein has continued for \nthe decade since then, notwithstanding documents that Iraq signed to \nconclude the gulf war, to thwart the rule of law internationally, to \ndeceive and deny all that he had promised to do at the end of the gulf \nwar, and all that the United Nations called on him to do in the years \nsince then. He has continued, without question, to develop weapons of \nmass destruction and the means to deliver them on distant targets. He \nhas continued to earn a dubious place on that small list of countries \nthat the State Department considers state sponsors of terrorism.\n\n  Even today, Iraq has provided shelter for significant figures within \nal-Qaida who struck us on September 11, as they have fled from American \nmilitary forces in Afghanistan.\n  President Bush has said that the hour of truth has arrived. We can no \nlonger tolerate the intransigence and danger posed by Saddam Hussein. \nHe has gone to the U.N. and sought support from the international \ncommunity.\n  This resolution is our attempt to express our support of the \nPresident as Commander in Chief in seeking international backing for \naction against Saddam Hussein. It is also a way to strengthen the \nPresident's hand as Commander in Chief. If Saddam Hussein does not \ncomply, or if the United Nations is not willing to take action to\n\n[[Page S9805]]\n\nenforce its orders, in my opinion, this is the last chance for Saddam \nHussein but also the best chance for the international community to \ncome together to prove that resolutions of the United Nations mean more \nand have more weight than the paper on which they are written.\n  It is also the hour for Members of Congress to draw together across \nparty lines to support the national security of the United States. A \ndebate will follow in the days ahead. It is an important debate that \nshould not be rushed. It should be reflective. Ultimately, I am \nconfident the resolution that Senators Warner, Bayh, McCain, and I are \nintroducing will enjoy the broad, bipartisan support that our national \nsecurity demands at this time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend our distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Bayh, for joining my good friend, Senator \nMcCain, and myself as we introduce this resolution on behalf of the \nleadership in the Senate. Certainly, those leaders will join us on \nthis.\n  I remember in 1991, Senator Dole, Senator McCain, and I led the \neffort on this side of the aisle, and my good friend and colleague of \nthese many years joined us. There was a historic debate. We will now \nembark this great body of deliberation on a similar debate on this \nextremely important resolution.\n  I commend our President for the leadership he has shown. This issue \nwould not be in the forefront worldwide, the forefront in the U.N., and \nnow in the forefront of the U.S. Congress had not this very bold and \ncourageous President undertaken the difficult task of pointing out the \nperilous times in which we live with regard to terrorism and, most \nparticularly, the threats posed not by the people of Iraq, but by \nSaddam Hussein and his regime.\n  Madam President, I wish to commend Leader Lott. We met with him this \nmorning. We have been meeting with him through the day. Senator McCain \nand I and others have been a part of his working group to achieve the \nmaximum bipartisan support obtainable on this resolution. I am \nconfident that will be achieved. I am very confident, given the \nleadership of our two distinguished colleagues joining us here today, \nbecause it is important there be a solid phalanx of the House of \nRepresentatives, which will have an identical resolution, and the \nSenate joining together behind our President and speaking with one \nvoice, as our President and the Secretary of State, working through the \nUnited Nations, achieving, hopefully, a resolution which will comport \nwith the President's historic address to the United Nations, and also a \nresolution that will reflect the United Nations is going to stand up as \nan organization and live up to its charter and take on the \nresponsibility of bringing this question of weapons of mass destruction \nin Iraq to a conclusion so this world can be more peaceful.\n  I thank my colleagues, most particularly the four of us who are here \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair. Madam President, I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues today on a bipartisan basis to authorize the \nPresident of the United States to use appropriate force to defend the \nnational security interests of our country.\n  I join in this effort with a sense of regret that events have come to \nthis. No one can contemplate the use of military force with much \nsatisfaction, but I also approach this debate with the firm conviction \nthat the time has come to unite, to take those steps that are necessary \nto protect our country, including the use of force, because all other \navenues have been exhausted and seem unlikely to lead to the result of \nprotecting the American people.\n  Iraq presents a very significant potential threat to our country. \nSaddam Hussein possesses chemical, biological, and some day will \npossess, if events are allowed to run their course, nuclear weapons. If \nthere is one thing we can say with absolute certainty, it is he is \ndeveloping these weapons for no benign purpose. He does not need them \nto retain his power within Iraq, but in all likelihood will use these \nterrible weapons to project that power, to intimidate other states in \nthe region, and potentially one day for use against us as well.\n  If there is even a 10 or 15-percent chance of smallpox or anthrax or \na crude nuclear device could one day be placed in the hands of suicidal \nterrorists for use against the United States of America, this is a risk \nwe cannot afford to run. We have attempted diplomacy without effect. We \nhave attempted economic sanctions to no effect.\n  Regrettably, my colleagues and I have concluded the President needs \nthe authorization to use force to protect our country from this sort of \neventuality. Of course, we will continue to negotiate with the United \nNations. Of course, we will gather our allies. But the time has come to \nunite, to do what it takes to defend our country.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators Warner, McCain, and \nLieberman, in giving the President the authority he needs to do exactly \nthat.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise today to join my three \ncolleagues, Senator Warner, the distinguished ranking member and former \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Bayh, and Senator \nLieberman. I am always honored to have my name associated with these \nthree outstanding public servants.\n  This resolution, we should make very clear, is the text of the \nresolution agreed to this morning by the President of the United States \nand congressional leaders. This is the exact text of a resolution that \nwas agreed to in hopes the debate will take place on two exact \nresolutions in both Houses of the Congress. I believe with open, \nspirited debate and discussion, we will come to a consensus which is \nbroad based, and following a debate which I think will be illuminating \nand educational to the American people, as well as our colleagues.\n  America is at war with terrorists who murdered our people one year \nago. We now contemplate carrying the battle to a new front--Iraq--where \na tyrant who has the capabilities and the intentions to do us harm is \nplotting, biding his time until his capabilities give him the means to \ncarry out his ambitions, perhaps through cooperation with terrorists--\nwhen confronting him will be much harder and impose a terrible cost.\n  Saddam Hussein is in patent violation of the terms of the Gulf war \nceasefire and 16 United Nations Security Council resolutions. He \npossesses weaponized chemical and biological weapons and is \naggressively developing nuclear weapons. He holds the perverse \ndistinction of having used weapons of mass destruction against both his \nown\n\n[[Page S9806]]\n\npeople and his enemies--the only dictator on Earth who has done so. As \nour President has said, Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a grave and gathering \ndanger, a clear threat to American security and the security of our \nfriends in the region.\n  As I just mentioned, Congress must debate the question of war with \nIraq. It is appropriate and right for the people of the United States \nto have their voices heard in this debate through their representatives \nin Congress. But as the President has said, the nation must speak with \none voice once we determine to take a course that will most likely send \nour nation's young men and women to war.\n  The President has patiently worked with Congressional leaders to \ncraft a resolution authorizing him to take necessary action in Iraq to \ndefend American national security and enforce all relevant U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions. The resolution is a product of compromise \nthat protects both congressional prerogatives and the authority of the \nCommander in Chief to use whatever means he determines necessary to \nprotect American security.\n  The President's authority is not absolute on these matters. But he is \nthe Commander in Chief, and he has made clear that congressional action \nto tie his hands, to limit the way he can respond to threats to the \nsecurity of the American people, will damage our country's ability to \nrespond to the clear and present danger posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq.\n  There is a reason why the Constitution vests shared power in the \nPresident and the Congress on matters of war. But there is also a \nreason why the Constitution recognizes the President of the United \nStates as Commander in Chief. Limiting the President's ability to \ndefend the United States, when Congress and the President agree on the \nnature of the threat posed to the United States by Iraq, is unwise.\n  No resolution tying the President's hands or limiting the President's \nability to respond to a clearly defined threat can anticipate the \ndecisions the President will have to make in coming weeks and months, \nwith American forces deployed overseas on his orders, to defend \nAmerican security. We cannot foresee the course or end of this \nconflict, even though to most of us the threat is abundantly clear, and \nthe course of action we must pursue is apparent. That's why there is \none Commander in Chief, not 535 of them. Restricting the President's \nflexibility to conduct military action against a threat that has been \ndefined and identified makes the United States less capable of \nresponding to that threat.\n  Supporting the President in his role as Commander in Chief does not \nnecessarily mean supporting the President's policy on matters of \nnational security. In 1995, President Clinton determined to deploy \nAmerican forces to Bosnia to uphold a fragile peace in a land where \nmany said peace was not possible. Until that time, I had serious \nconcerns about the administration's policy in the Balkans. But once the \nPresident made his decision, I worked with Senator Bob Dole, Senator \nWarner and many of my colleagues to make sure the President--a \nPresident from the other party whom we had criticized harshly for his \nconduct of national security policy--had the support he needed to \nenforce the peace in Bosnia. I think my friend Senator Dole would agree \nwith me that it was one of the high points of our service in the \nSenate.\n  Thanks to the President's leadership over the past few months, the \nCongress has been moving steadily to support the President's \ndetermination to hold Saddam Hussein accountable to the world. I urge \nall my colleagues to renew their efforts to come together on one \nresolution--to show the world we are united with the President to \nenforce the terms of the gulf war ceasefire and prevent Saddam Hussein \nfrom threatening our and the world's security ever again.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Lieberman, Senator Bayh, and Senator \nWarner, and I especially would like to mention Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Bayh have shown some courage on the floor of the Senate, as \nSenator Warner and I have had to do in the past, when perhaps the \nmajority of our party may not have been in complete agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this concludes the introduction of this \nmatter to the Senate. I thank my friend John McCain for his leadership \non this issue from the very beginning, as he consulted in the process \nwith Senator Lott and others with regard to this resolution.\n  If those who wish to join us would kindly indicate their expressions \nof support to the leaders, myself, Senator McCain, and Senator Lott. \nBefore leaving the floor, Senator Helms indicated his strong support, \nand in due course we will constitute the cosponsors of this resolution \nas we move forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me also say that I put a statement in the Record today \nabout Strom Thurmond. I was busy trying to deal with homeland security \nwhen we had the time to speak on Strom Thurmond. But I do want to \nrelate one story about Strom, which is in my statement in the Record. \nWhen I was elected, like many new Senators do, before we went into \nsession I brought my two sons to the Senate. I guess one of them was \nabout 8 and one of them was about 10--or maybe 10 and 12, I lose track.\n  Anyway, we found my desk. So I said to my sons: Do you all want to \nsit in my chair? By this time they had looked around at all of the \ndesks, and they decided they didn't want to sit in my chair. They \nwanted to sit in Barry Goldwater's chair and Strom Thurmond's chair.\n  I guess at the time, my feelings were a little hurt. But looking \nback, when I am sitting on the front porch of a nursing home somewhere \nand nobody remembers who I am or what I ever did, I am going to be able \nto say to myself: I knew and I served with the great Strom Thurmond. An \nabsolutely remarkable man, not because he is 100 years old, in the \nSenate, but because he is forever young--not in a physical sense. My \nGod, his physical capacities are amazing.\n  I remember one night, it was about 2 in the morning, we were in \nsession. Senator Byrd was keeping us here to debate something. I was \ndog tired. I was talking to Strom, and he was lamenting that his \nbrother had died because he hadn't taken care of himself and burned the \ncandle at both ends.\n  I said to Strom: How old was your brother? He was 89 years old. But \nto Strom, that was not taking care of yourself.\n\n[[Page S9807]]\n\n  The amazing thing about Strom Thurmond's eternal youth is not \nphysical, it is mental. This is a man in his long career who could \nlearn new lessons. This is a man who is not ashamed to say: I am not as \nignorant as I used to be. This is a man who could admit to changing his \nmind.\n  We are in the only profession where people look down on you if you \nlearn something; that somehow you are inconsistent if you thought one \nway one day and you acquire more information and you change your mind.\n  The most amazing thing about Strom Thurmond to me is that through all \nof his public service, from supreme court justice in South Carolina, \nfrom superintendent of schools, to general in the Army on D-Day--we all \nknow the story about one of our colleagues going over with President \nReagan and saying to Strom he should have been there at Normandy, and \nStrom said he was there. And he was there when it counted, on June 6, \n1944--is that eternal youth, that ability to learn something new, to \nhave a new perspective and to change that makes Strom Thurmond the most \nremarkable person with whom I have served.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9807-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HOMELAND SECURITY AND TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Finally, seeing I have another colleague come to the \nfloor, I want to say something about two issues that are before us that \nI am frustrated with, as, I am sure, are many of my colleagues. But in \nboth cases, our problem is the power of special interests as pitted \nagainst the public interest. We are trying to do a homeland security \nbill, and it is not easy because to change the way Government does \nbusiness is to take on a powerful political constituency, the \nGovernment employee labor unions. They are organized and they are \nactive. We are all aware that we are having an election next month. \nMembers are being forced to choose between national security and \npolitical security, to choose whether we are putting business as usual \nand work rules negotiated between the Government and unions above \nprotecting the lives of our citizens.\n  It is frustrating to me that even when people's lives are on the \nline, powerful special interests can wield the kind of power that the \nGovernment employee labor unions have been able to bring to bear on \nthis issue.\n  I had always thought when we started this debate that when we were \ntalking about protecting the lives of Americans, we were going to give \nthe President the benefit of the doubt. But at least to this point we \nhave not.\n  A second issue is terrorism insurance. I was with the President \nyesterday. Many of our colleagues were there. He was talking about $16 \nbillion of projects, 300,000 construction hard-hat jobs that we were \nnot creating because people were afraid to build high-profile projects \nbecause they cannot buy terrorism insurance. The President has asked us \nto move forward on a bill.\n  In October, the House had already acted on the bill and, on a \nbipartisan basis, Senator Dodd, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Enzi, and I \nworked out a compromise which was agreed to by the Treasury that had a \ncompromise on the issue of: Can you sue somebody who is a victim of \nterrorism for punitive damages?\n  The President's view is very strong on the subject; that is, when \nsomebody has been the victim of terrorism, it is like someone coming \nonto a hospital ship to prey on them by filing lawsuits against them. \nLawsuits against terrorists is fine, but for victims of terrorism there \nshouldn't be punitive damages.\n  We worked out a compromise on a bipartisan basis. But the plaintiff's \nbar came out against that compromise, and, as a result, we have never \nbeen able to do anything from that point on.\n  Again, it is the case where there is a powerful special interest that \nis preventing us from promoting the public interest.\n  I am hopeful in the remaining days of this session--and I believe \nunless the end point is changed, today is Wednesday, so tomorrow is \nThursday; we are probably not going to do a lot of work on Friday or \nMonday. Then we are planning to adjourn Thursday, or Friday, or \nSaturday at the latest--if we are ever going to do something on \nhomeland security and terrorism insurance, we had better get on with \nit.\n  The amazing thing is that it is apparently going to be very easy for \nus to pass a resolution giving the President the power to go to war. I \nsupport that because I think American security interests are at stake. \nWe can do that because there is no well-organized, powerful political \nspecial interest group that supports Saddam Hussein. But we can't do \nhomeland security and we can't do terrorism insurance because there are \norganized, effective, powerful special interest groups that oppose what \nwe are trying to do. I hope we can overcome that hurdle. I hope in the \nprocess we can pass these two important bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Mr. President, I am sorry I could not get the floor \nearlier. But I assume we are still in morning business, and that I may \nproceed with reference to a couple of our colleagues who are leaving. I \nwas unavoidably detained in a conference meeting with the House of \nRepresentatives on the status of the energy bill.\n  First, I think it is important as we see our friends depart from this \nbody to talk about what is outstanding in our own minds relative to \ntheir contributions. One could go on at great length relative to the \ncontributions of Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator Jesse Helms. But \none of the things outstanding in my mind is the tours that Senator \nThurmond used to give when we had a social event here in the Capitol. \nUpon the conclusion of the event, he would offer to take at least some \nof the guests on a night tour of the Capitol, and he would recite \ninstances that occurred 30, 40, 50, and almost 200 years ago relative \nto the sacred surroundings and the Old Chamber where the Supreme Court \noriginally was here in the Capitol, and reflect humorous stories of who \nsat where and what their personal traits might be.\n  Looking back on my 22 years in the Senate, I treasure those moments. \nMy wife Nancy and I often have talked about them. Unfortunately, his \nhealth does not allow him to conduct those tours anymore, but for those \nwho were fortunate enough to share a few moments of his humor on those \ntours, the historical references, his magnificent memory, and the \nreference to the uniqueness of the Senate, and the outstanding \nhighlights of the various careers of those who have come and gone, it \nwas truly a memorable experience.\n  Today, we set aside time for Members to comment on Senator Helms who \nis also leaving us. Again, it is a matter of individual impressions \nthat Members leave you with.\n  Without exception, Senator Helms' comments on this floor back in 1983 \nstand out in my memory as certainly the most significant, most timely, \nand most on target references to a frightening situation that occurred. \nThat was the shooting down of the Korean Airlines flight 007, which was \nshot down by a Soviet Sukhoi 15 fighter jet on September 1, 1983. That \nflight was on its way from Anchorage, AK, to Seoul, Korea. There were \n269 lives lost, including a Congressman, Larry McDonald.\n  At that time, Senator Helms and Senator Symms, the former Senator \nfrom Idaho, were on another Korean Airlines flight that was in transit \nin Anchorage the same time as the Korean Airlines flight 007.\n  I was in the Senate Chamber when Senator Helms delivered his floor \nstatement on September 15, 1983. There were many who were commenting \nand making statements, but by far the most moving statement was Senator \nHelms'. I am going to take the liberty of quoting a bit of his \nstatement at that time. Let me quote the statement of Senator Helms as \nfollows:\n\n       Mr. Helms. I was on the Korean airplane that landed in \n     Anchorage for refueling 20 minutes after the ill-fated plane. \n     Both planes were on the ground for more than an hour, meaning \n     that both planes were there together for the better part of \n     an hour. Most of the passengers on both planes went into the \n     terminal.\n       It so happens that the distinguished Congressman from \n     Georgia, Representative Larry McDonald, did not, or I did not \n     see him. But in the lounge of the terminal I saw one of the \n     most delightful young families\n\n[[Page S9808]]\n\n     anybody could ever hope to see. A young man and his wife-the \n     young was going to Seoul, as I understand, to head up Eastman \n     Kodak's organization there. They had two little girls, aged 5 \n     and 3.\n       The mother was sitting reading Bible stories to those two \n     little girls when we entered. The little girl was sitting on \n     her mother's lap and the 5-year-old was sitting on the arm of \n     the chair. And when the mother had finished reading to the \n     children, I went over and introduced myself.\n\n  In the conversation, he offered to take the children and read them a \nstory while their mother went to refresh herself. They were on his lap. \nThey were playing games--the same games he played with his own \ngrandchildren. He said:\n\n       They were on my lap and we were playing little games that I \n     play with my grandchildren.\n       If I live to be 1,000, I say to the Senator, I will never \n     forget those two little girls, who had a right to live and \n     love and be loved, but who will never have that right because \n     of this criminal, brutal, premeditated, cowardly act by the \n     Soviet Union.\n       I will forever remember the giggles and the laughter-they \n     hugged my neck and they kissed me on the cheek. Finally, \n     their plane was called, and my last sight of them as they \n     scampered out the door was their waving ``bye-bye'' to this \n     fellow and blowing kisses to me.\n\n  I tell you that you could have heard a pin drop in this body when he \ndelivered that message. It was a tough message. But he was right on \ntarget. Those children had a right to live, a right to be loved, and it \nwas finished--snuffed out in that premeditated act by the Soviet Union \nby the shooting down of Korean Airlines flight 007.\n  Senator Helms is certainly known for calling a spade a spade. But \nthat day I thought he was right on target in calling the atrocity what \nit was--a cold-blooded murder. I will never forget the comments the \nSenator made at that time, and they will live with me always.\n\n  I admire Senator Helms, what he stands for, and the contribution he \nhas made to this body.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9808-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTES TO STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate \nSenator Strom Thurmond on his remarkable tenure as a U.S. Senator.\n  As a history teacher, I taught my students about Senator Thurmond. As \na Congressman, I always admired Senator Thurmond's leadership, and his \nwillingness to speak out for his beliefs. As a Senator, it has been an \nhonor to serve with Senator Thurmond.\n  He is a true patriot, a true civil servant. He has served his country \nin countless ways, and in every case, he has pursued this service with \nvigor.\n  He showed his dedication to the United States by serving in the army \nduring World War II. Senator Thurmond originally signed up for an \nadministrative position, but he eventually went to both the European \nand Pacific theaters.\n  He served with the storied 82d Airborne Division and landed in \nNormandy on D-Day. His combat service earned him eighteen citations, \nincluding the Bronze Star for Valor, a Purple Heart, the Belgian Order \nof the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre. He continued his military \ncareer as a Major General of the U.S. Army Reserve. He also acted as \nNational President of the Reserve Officers Association.\n  It is easy to forget this heroism, because it was so long ago and he \nhas accomplished so much since them, But, for me, as a Veteran, and as \nsomeone who lost his father in service to his country, I believe we \neach owe Senator Thurmond our gratitude for his courage in his military \nservice.\n  Senator Thurmond was first elected to the Senate 48 years ago. It was \nthen, in 1954, that the people of South Carolina elected Senator \nThurmond by a write-in vote, the only time in history that this has \never happened.\n  However, Senator Thurmond had made his mark well before he was \nelected to the Senate. He showed his dedication to South Carolina by \nserving as city and county attorney, State senator, circuit judge, and \nGovernor.\n  As a former teacher, coach, and school board chairman, I believe \nthere is no more noble public service than teaching. Between heroic \nmilitary service and a half century of political service, Strom \nThurmond managed to set aside time to teach future generations.\n  He was a teacher in South Carolina. He was also an athletic coach. He \nlater went on to serve as the Superintendent of Education for Edgefield \nCounty, SC.\n  As a U.S. Senator, Strom Thurmond has accomplished numerous \nachievements. As you all may know, in 1996 Senator Thurmond became the \noldest serving Senator in history. A few months later, he became the \nlongest serving Senator in United States history.\n  In 1998 Senator Thurmond cast his 15,000th vote on the Senate floor. \nWhile these milestones are significant, it is what he did with this \ntime that makes these records important.\n  Senator Thurmond well remembers the great baseball Hall of Famer Lou \nGehrig. They used to call him the Iron Horse. He never missed a game. \nHe always gave 100 percent. He was the essence of sportsmanship.\n  Strom Thurmond is the Iron Horse of the Senate. He is the essence of \nstatesman, of public servant. He has given 100 percent for his entire \ncareer, and those of us who are privileged to know him draw energy and \ninspiration from his example.\n  I will always remember any time I came in early in the morning to \nopen the Senate. It was always Senator Thurmond presiding. As President \npro-tempore, he did not have to do that. He could appoint someone else \nto do it. But, that's just how Strom Thurmond is. It is part of his \ncharacter.\n  Of course, I have always admired his dedication to his conservative \nvalues. Throughout his life Senator Thurmond was a Democrat, a \nDixiecrat, and a Republican, but most importantly he was always a \npatriot.\n  His unflinching devotion to his country manifested itself in his \nservice and chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nMoreover, his unflagging dedication to justice was represented by \nanother chairmanship, that of the Senate Judiciary Committee. As a \nSenator who has served with Senator Thurmond on both of these \ncommittees, I have had the privilege of seeing a great legislator in \naction.\n  As a veteran, I am thankful for all that Senator Thurmond has done, \nsuch as serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee for over 30 years. \nAs a former teacher, I commend his work with the youth of South \nCarolina when he was an educator. As a Senator, I admire his \nforthrightness and dedication to his principles. As an American, he \nmakes me proud.\n  Senator Thurmond, thank you for your many years of devotion to this \ncountry and the ideals that make it strong.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, like many \nmembers, I took my two sons onto the floor of the Senate before the \nsession started and found my desk. I asked them if they wanted to sit \nin my chair. One son chose Barry Goldwater's seat to sit in, and the \nother son chose Strom Thurmond's seat. Looking back, that is easy for \nme to understand.\n  There are so many things you could say about Strom, but there is one \nthing I can say about Strom Thurmond that I am certain of and that is, \nsomeday I will proudly tell my grandchildren that I served in the U.S. \nSenate with Strom Thurmond. Like those happy band of brothers who \nfought with King Harry on St. Crispin's Day, I will tell my \ngrandchildren how I fought with a great man, a great leader, to \naccomplish great deeds.\n  He has had a profound and lasting impact on our country. But there is \nsomething more remarkable. He is eternally young. Not just in being a \n100-year-old Senator, but young in the ability to adopt new ideas, to \nchange as circumstances change, and in the process to grow, even during \nthe longest tenure in the Senate in history. I love Strom Thurmond. I \nadmire him, and for my whole life, I will be proud that I was able to \ncall him colleague and friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9808-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9808-S9809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONFERENCE ON ENERGY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues an \nupdate on the conference on energy.\n  As we all know, our President has asked for an energy bill. The bill \nwas reported out of the House and the Senate, H.R. 4. We have been in \nconference for several days, off and on. Today we took up one of the \nmore controversial provisions; that is, the disposition of ANWR.\n\n[[Page S9809]]\n\n  The House, in its offer to the Senate, proposed adding 10.2 million \nacres of wildernesses as an addition to the Nation's wilderness \nproposal. That would constitute about 72 million acres of wilderness in \nmy State of Alaska.\n  Without going into a lot of detail, I think we have to ask ourselves, \nindeed, if the Democratic leadership really wants an energy bill. From \nthe beginning of this process, the committee of jurisdiction, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, was not allowed to develop a \nbill out of the committee but, rather, it was developed out of the \nleader's office.\n  Since that time, we have seen an effort to try to develop \ncompromises, but clearly the presence of the majority leader has not \nbeen very evident. So I think we have to ask ourselves, on the issues \nin contention--whether it be climate, whether it be ethanol, whether it \nbe electricity, whether it be the tax aspects, or the renewable \nportfolio standards--all of it suggests that a compromise is, indeed, \npossible in the sense of discussing what is certainly one of the \nlightning rod issues, and that is the opening of ANWR.\n  With the offer by the House to create an additional 10.2 million \nacres, as a proposal to the Senate, it causes us concern relative to a \nprovision when the State of Alaska accepted statehood. In the terms of \nstatehood, there was a provision that there would be a ``no more'' \nclause; that means no more land designated without the concurrence of \nAlaskans. Nevertheless, this offer has been made.\n  I hope the issue of the disposition of the energy bill does not \nbecome a political issue. We are nearing, of course, the elections. I \nrecognize the temptation to suggest that the environmental groups, \nwhich are opposed to ANWR, are a force to be reckoned with in the \ncoming election or the criticism of the Republicans, that they might be \ntoo close to the energy industry. I hope these arguments are not used \nas excuses for not getting a bill.\n  Our President has asked for our bill. Our constituents have asked \nthat we pass an energy bill. We have an obligation to do what is right \nfor America, and that is to come to grips with the reality that we are, \nat this time, clearly in a conflict, the nature of which we can only \nhope will not result in outright war with Iraq.\n  But the irony of that can best be associated with a quick overview of \nwhat we have been doing since 1992. We have been enforcing a no-fly \nzone over Iraq. In enforcing that no-fly zone, we have taken out \ntargets in Iraq. We have endangered our young men and women in uniform \nwho have been enforcing the no-fly zone.\n  We have, in turn, imported anywhere from 600,000 to 900,000 barrels \nof oil a day from Iraq. It is almost as if we take his oil, put it in \nour airplanes, and go bomb him and enforce the no-fly zone. And he \ntakes the money we pay for the oil and develops weapons of mass \ndestruction, whether it be biological, chemical, or developing a \nnuclear capability. He develops a delivery system and aims it at our \nally, Israel.\n  So unless we lessen our dependence on imported oil by developing more \noil here at home, why, clearly, we are going to continue to have to \ndepend on foreign sources, such as Saddam Hussein in Iraq.\n  For those who wonder about the merits of opening this area, I remind \nmy colleagues that in 1995 the Senate passed an authorization to open \nANWR. It was in the omnibus bill. President Clinton vetoed it. Had that \nbeen done, we would have that oil on line now, and we certainly would \nhave an idea of the magnitude of the fields that exist in that area.\n  The last point I want to make is its contribution to jobs and the \neconomy. It is estimated there would be some 750,000 new jobs \nassociated with opening this area, including development of 19 new U.S. \nflag-built tankers that would be built in U.S. yards.\n  So I urge my colleagues to come together and recognize, in the spirit \nof compromise, we should resolve the issues remaining in the energy \nbill. We should report out the bill containing ANWR, which will reduce \nour dependence on imported oil, and move on with what is good for \nAmerica, and that is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, follow \nthe recommendations of the President, and pass an energy bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9809-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9809-S9810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every morning I get up and I read the local \npaper, the Washington Post. There is always breaking news in the \nnewspaper, of course. I try to go to the sports page first because \nthere is always some good news there, at least. I was terribly \ndisappointed today in looking at the front section of the Washington \nPost. There is an ad here. If this ad were a product and not an issue, \nthere would certainly be some type of legal action for false \nadvertising.\n  I just am so disappointed in the Business Roundtable and American \nInsurance Association. I am not disappointed in the Chamber of Commerce \nbecause they have never done anything my entire political career to \nmake me feel good in the first place, so this just adds to what they \nnormally do. But I personally have worked on terrorism insurance for a \nyear now. To have them, the Business Roundtable and the American \nInsurance Association, run an ad blaming the Democrats for not having \nterrorism insurance is despicable. They should be ashamed of \nthemselves. They know it is a lie, a falsehood, a travesty. President \nBush gave this speech, and he is quoted here in Pennsylvania with a \nbunch of labor people, saying:\n\n       We need an insurance bill to cover potential terrorist \n     acts, so that hard hats in America can get back to work. And \n     I want a bill on my desk that says we care more about working \n     people and less about trial lawyers.\n\n  That is wrong. If the Federal Election Commission did what they \nshould do, they should charge this as a contribution in kind for the \nBush reelection campaign. Blaming the trial bar is something that goes \nback to biblical times, Shakespearean times. When things don't go \nright, blame the lawyers.\n  The chronology of delay over this important legislation is well \ndocumented. That is why I am so terribly disappointed. The people who \nmake up this Business Roundtable are from hotels, some of whom are in \nNevada, and all over this country. They know this is a lie. I cannot \nsay it any other way. It is a lie. It is false advertising.\n  I know the chronology. I was here trying to move this legislation \nforward. We asked, on many occasions, unanimous consent to go to the \nlegislation. Finally, after months--not days or weeks but months--we \ngot to go to the bill. Then the delay was in full view to everyone. \nAfter weeks, we forced legislation out here. We, the Democrats, tried \nto get it on the floor. We finally got it on the floor. This was \nbipartisan. Some Republicans, after it got to the floor, helped us. But \nthey held it up; we did not hold it up. After it passed, with lots of \nprocedural delays and efforts to slow it down, we thought, oh, boy, it \nis over with. Everybody wants it going to conference. But, oh, no. It \ntook months to get a conference. They would not agree to the \nappointment of conferees. You know, there were a few problems. Senator \nDaschle said we will have three Democrats and two Republicans. After \nall, we are in the majority. No, they don't want that. We are in charge \nof the Senate. That is a prerogative we have. After months, Senator \nDaschle said, OK, I will make it 4 to 3. They still did not agree to \nit. We gave them what they wanted and they still didn't agree because \nit was all a big stall.\n  Now, finally, they agreed to a conference, but nothing happened in \nconference. Months have gone by. I hear on the floor: Please do \nsomething. I have a staff person assigned--not full-time but he spends \na great deal of time on this legislation. Senator Daschle has someone \nwho spends the same amount of time on this piece of legislation.\n  Meetings have been held. The person Senator Daschle has working is an \noutstanding lawyer. He was in the counsel's office in the White House. \nHe\n\n[[Page S9810]]\n\nwas the one who did all the judges for us. He is someone who knows what \nis going on.\n  We have made presentation after presentation to no avail. Senator \nDodd has spent weeks of his time on this issue. This is not a tort \nreform issue. It is an issue to allow insurance companies to sell \nterrorism insurance to allow construction projects to go forward in Las \nVegas and other places in the country.\n  The insurance companies, as they are good at doing, have jacked up \nthe prices so it is hard to get insurance. This legislation is an \neffort to allow them to receive some help if, in fact, there is an act \nof terrorism.\n  My office spoke with people when they complained about this: We had \ntremendous pressure from the White House to sign on to this \nadvertisement. What is this all about, pressure to sign on to something \nthat is false, misleading, untrue?\n  When President George Bush was campaigning, he said he was going to \nchange the tone in Washington. I have been in Washington a long time \nnow. I have never seen the tone this way. During the Reagan years, \nthere were some disagreements, but what a fine person to get along \nwith. He and his people were easy to get along with. Here we cannot get \nalong--it is very tough. The atmosphere is extremely difficult. Change \nthe tone? He has changed the tone, there is no question about that, but \nit is for the worse. I guess he just did not complete his sentence in \nall the debates and other statements he made. This is a very venomous \nenvironment.\n  Legislation is the art of compromise. I personally do not think this \nlegislation dealing with terrorism insurance should have anything to do \nwith tort reform, but they have forced the issue. The compromise has \nsome tort reform in it. Legislation is a compromise. The White House \nhas been unwilling to compromise, unwilling to meet. They are now \nputting pressure on lobbyists to fund full-page ads, pro-Bush ads in \nthe Post and more pressure on congressional Republicans to do anything \nthey can to stop this legislation.\n  I know, I have had friends on the other side tell me they do not want \nthis legislation; they do not think it is necessary. But why not do it \nlike adults? Stand up and say this is bad legislation, not have this \ncharade.\n  If anyone is truly interested in the real White House strategy, read \nthe story in the New York Times today about this legislation:\n\n       Mr. Bush's push for the measure reflects a no-lose \n     political strategy. If Congress reaches an agreement on the \n     measure, he can rightly claim credit for it. If it fails, he \n     can blame Congressional Democrats, and in particular the \n     Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, for the failure.\n\n  That is what it is all about. I believe people of the State of Nevada \ndeserve more; the people of this country deserve more. I have no \nproblem when there are honest disagreements on legislation, but I have \nbeen on the ground, so to speak. I have watched this; I have been right \nhere; I have been making the unanimous consent requests. Over the \nmonth, I bet I have offered 25 unanimous consent requests right from \nhere. There were objections to appointment of conferees and getting the \nbill to the floor. But to have this:\n\n       We agree, Mr. President, there's too much at stake. . . .\n       Congress, why the delay?\n       The time is now. Pass Terrorism Insurance Legislation.\n\n  Six months ago, the President in 30 seconds could have had the \nlegislation on his desk, but this has been a big stall to make the \ntrial lawyers look like the enemy of the American people, and that \nsimply is wrong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9810-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to a colleague of ours whose \ncareer of public service may never be matched again in the history of \nour country. My friend Strom Thurmond sits on the other side of the \naisle of the Senate Chamber, but I consider him a friend with whom I \nhave worked closely, and I will miss him.\n  I remember when I was first sworn into the Senate in January of 1975. \nBecause of a tied vote in the State of New Hampshire that election \nyear, it was a matter that did not get resolved until we actually went \nback and did the election over in the middle of the year. I was the \nmost junior Member of a 99-Member Senate. We did not have the Hart \nBuilding at the time. We had the Russell Building and the Dirksen \nBuilding, and a couple of us very junior Members were in basement \noffices. Senator Garn of Utah, Senator Laxalt of Nevada, and I were \ndown in the dungeons. When we were sworn in, I had a small reception \ndown there. I invited Members of the Senate to come, not thinking that \nanybody would actually show up. There were far more noteworthy people \nbeing sworn in that day, some to begin subsequent terms, others newly \nelected.\n  I remember standing there with my mother and father, and one of the \nvery first people to come through that door was Strom Thurmond, walking \narm in arm with John Stennis of Mississippi. I remember Strom welcoming \nme to the Senate and telling my mother and father I seemed like a nice \nyoung man, and that I might actually have a career ahead of me.\n  I note that has been the routine of Strom Thurmond, to welcome new \nSenators from either party. He has done it with hundreds of Senators. \nThis one remembers it well.\n  We often worked in the field of antitrust laws. We worked together on \nthe National Cooperative Production amendments of 1993, the very first \nhigh-technology bill signed by President Clinton, and to improve the \nprotections against anticompetitive conduct in the Digital Performance \nRight in Sound Recordings Act.\n  Senator Thurmond has been a legislator. I must admit, when Senator \nThurmond and I have worked together, it has raised some eyebrows, and \nwhen we have introduced legislation together, some have remarked that \neither it is brilliant legislation or one of us has not gotten around \nto reading it. But there are so many issues that we did join together. \nOf course, there have been occasions when he and I have sat on opposite \nsides of an issue, but even though there were issues about which we \nfelt deeply, Senator Thurmond always conducted himself with the utmost \nintegrity. He has always told the Senate how he felt. He has done so \nwith the people of South Carolina first and foremost in his mind.\n  I recall him inviting me down to talk to the Strom Thurmond Institute \nat Clemson. He wanted to put on a debate on economic matters. He had an \nimpartial moderator from the Heritage Foundation. When I walked in, I \nsaw half the Republican party of South Carolina and the Heritage \nFoundation. I knew I was to be the sacrificial lamb, and I was loving \nevery minute of it. When they stated how much time would be allotted, \nhe stated he should have twice as much time as I because I spoke twice \nas fast as he did.\n  We had a very good meeting. I am sure I did not change his mind, or \nmost of the minds of the audience, on a couple of issues. We walked out \nof there arm in arm, laughing, having a good time. I remember a couple \nof days later Strom coming on the floor and slapping me on the back and \nsaying, I want to thank the king of Vermont, as he said, for going down \nwith him.\n  One of the strangest meetings during that time was when we were in \nthe Senate dining room and I introduced\n\n[[Page S9811]]\n\nhim to Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. It was a meeting of cultures, \nvery different cultures.\n\n  I share with Senator Thurmond the distinction of being from a State \nthat has provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with three chairmen \nover the history of the committee. South Carolina and the State of \nVermont have each had three different people who have shared the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. With that in mind, I have always asked what I call \nthe Strom Thurmond question at judicial hearings. He has always \nreminded nominees that the people and lawyers who appear before them, \nwhatever their position in the case, whether rich or poor, white or \nblack, man or woman, whatever their religious or political affiliation, \ndeserve respect and fairness. He has reminded everyone of that.\n  I will miss my friend Strom. He has been named President pro tempore \nemeritus for a very good reason.\n  I have learned much from the senior Senator from South Carolina. Let \nme share one additional aspect of Senator Thurmond's legacy to the \nSenate as he completes this term and retires from office. In addition \nto all his longevity records and legislative achievements and buildings \nnamed for him, there is something else about him I will always \nremember.\n  When we hold hearings for Federal judges--and we have held a number \nthis year--I am always careful to carry on a tradition that Senator \nThurmond started. Senator Thurmond always reminded nominees for high \noffice that it is essential to treat others with courtesy and respect. \nHe always reminded nominees that the people and lawyers who appeared \nbefore them, whatever their position in the case, whether rich or poor, \nwhite or black, man or woman, whatever their religious or political \naffiliation, they are each and every one deserving of respect and \nfairness.\n  Senator Thurmond was right to remind judges--and even Senators--of \nthat simple rule. It is another contribution he has made to all of us \nthat will continue to serve us well. As I said earlier, I will miss \nStrom Thurmond. He has been named President-Pro-Tempore Emeritus for \ngood reason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9811-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9811-S9812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  21st CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves the \nfloor, on a totally different matter, I direct some questions to the \nSenator.\n  It is 2 p.m.. Twenty-four hours ago we were fortunate to get this \nconference report on H.R. 2215. I assumed this matter would be out of \nhere in a matter of 4 or 5 minutes. I thought maybe Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hatch would talk about what a great piece of work was done in \nconference. It is 24 hours later and this legislation has gone nowhere. \nIn fact, the majority last night learned there would not be even a vote \nallowed, and we had to file cloture.\n  This legislation deals with combating terrorism. It is entitled: 21st \nCentury Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act. The \ntitle says it all. It is true, is it not, this deals with fortifying \nthe national border security by authorizing more than $4 billion?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my friend, the deputy majority leader, it does.\n  We realize, as the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, we have \nproblems with our borders. We have to enhance our ability to monitor \nthe borders and still keep the open borders of this country. But it \nwill be expensive. We put this in.\n  Incidentally, we put this in with the strong support of the \nadministration.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true, I ask my friend, we have funding for Centers \nfor Domestic Preparedness throughout the country? Is it true we have \nlegislation to improve implementation of a treaty banning terrorist \nfinancing? Does it deal with FBI, allow FBI agents who are in duty \nstations that are perilous to receive extra money? We have heard \nreports a better job needs to be done with the communications, and it \ncovers that. It covers penalties for the criminals who use body armor.\n  I could go on literally for 15 minutes talking about what is in this \nconference report. There are other Senators who wish to speak. Can the \nSenator give me any reason why this most important piece of legislation \nfor the people of Nevada, Vermont, and the rest of the country is not \npassing?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know one reason. It passed the other body 400 to 4. It \ncame over here. I was asked if we had any objection to moving it \nquickly. I said, absolutely not. We checked every single member on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, and they said they would vote for it, \nevery man and woman. But we had a hold put on it from the Republican \nside of the aisle. They have held it up. They have delayed it. I cannot \nunderstand why.\n  Money laundering by terrorists is covered. President Bush, shortly \nafter the attack of September 11 last year, took extraordinary steps to \ntry to choke off some of the sources of financing of these terrorist \ngroups. I applauded the President for doing that. I thought it was the \nright thing.\n  However, there are some major areas we could not pursue without \nfurther legislation, which the administration strongly supports, and \nwhich Republicans and Democrats strongly support.\n  That is part of this bill. I would like to turn the spigot off for \nterrorists' money. That is in this bill.\n  The President of the United States would sign this bill immediately \nonce it got onto his desk. Why the Republicans are holding it up, \nfrankly, I don't know. I know they are holding it up, but I don't know \nwhy, especially when the President of the United States would sign \nthis. There is much antiterrorism in here, everything from the \nauthorization of Boys and Girls Clubs to hazardous duty pay for Federal \nlaw enforcement officers.\n\n  This is sort of like voting to acknowledge the sun rises in the east. \nI don't know what the controversy is.\n  Mr. REID. The reason it is being held up is the same reason our 13 \nappropriations bills are being held up, the same reason the election \nreform, conference reports, bankruptcy, terrorism, Patients' Bill of \nRights, generic drugs, all these most important pieces of legislation \nare held up. It appears clearly they want to be able to say the Senate, \ncontrolled by the Democrats, has been unable to accomplish anything. \nHowever, we cannot accomplish anything unless we get help from the 49 \non the other side. They are trying to show their strength in not \nallowing us to do anything.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is right. Unfortunately, in holding this up, \nthey are taking from the President of the United States tools needed to \nfight international terrorism. They are turning their back on the law \nenforcement people of this country.\n  We have an authorization for a charter change for the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, something they have all supported, we have all supported, \nDemocrats are all for. Republicans are holding that up. There was a \ncharter change in here for the American Legion. All 51 on this side of \nthe aisle have supported it. It is being held up on the Republican \nside. AMVETS, a charter change for American Veterans. That is being \nheld up by the other side. We support it.\n  This may be the kind of political posturing people think they have to \nhave in an election year. I think it is a crying shame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I make a few comments about the \nstate of the economy, let me talk about the state of business in the \nSenate. I concur completely with the Senator from Vermont, chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I am proud to serve. I cannot \nimagine what is holding up this legislation. This legislation is \ndesigned to restore law and order in this country. It is designed to \nfight terrorism. There are elements that are absolutely common sense.\n  It is the first time, I believe, in over 20 years we are \nreauthorizing the Department of Justice. We are establishing the \nViolence Against Women Act, to protect areas of domestic abuse. We are \ntalking about drug abuse education, prevention, and treatment. We have \na provision in here to provide resources to the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica, which in the city of Chicago and across my State of Illinois \nare so successful in reaching out to young people.\n  Time and time again, this bill addresses things the Department of \nJustice needs. It is quite a commentary on\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\nthe Senate that the Republican minority has held this bill up. They \nwill not let us bring it to a vote. They won't let us bring it to the \nfloor. I think it is unfortunate. I think we should have a vote on it, \nand I think if we do it will pass overwhelmingly and the President will \ngladly sign it. But we are caught up in a last-minute hurry to try to \nfinish the session, and unfortunately some of the most commonsense \npriorities are victims of some political agenda. I hope this does not \nhold up this bill any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9812-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9812-S9813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STATE OF THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to speak to the \nstate of the economy and to call to the attention of the Senate what \nhas transpired in America in the 2 weeks since the majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, brought to the attention of this country how sadly our \neconomy is performing.\n  Earlier I came to the floor and one of my Republican colleagues came \nto the floor and greeted me and said: Durbin, you have it all wrong. \nThe economy is better. Can't you feel it? The economy is much better. I \nhave the facts to prove it.\n  I am anxious to see his presentation, and I am anxious to see how \nmany people across America would agree with him because let me tell you \nwhat has happened in news reports in the last 2 weeks. These are news \nreports.\n  First, our stock market has had its worst quarter since 1987--15 \nyears. It is the worst month of September in the stock market since \n1937, 65 years ago. It has also been reported that the number of \nAmericans without health insurance increased by 1.4 million last year, \nto 41.2 million.\n  The trend line, which had been moving in the opposite direction with \nmore people having health insurance, is moving in the wrong direction \nnow--fewer and fewer Americans with the protection of health insurance. \nMay I add for a moment, have you asked anybody about the cost of health \ninsurance lately? Small businesses, large businesses, labor unions, \nworkers alike, the cost of health insurance is breaking the bank at \nbusinesses across America. It is breaking the bank when it comes to \nlabor unions that try to take care of their retirees. It is something \nthat has not been addressed by this Congress or this President.\n  The poverty rate rose last year for the first time in 10 years, from \n11.3 percent to 11.7 percent. The prosperity of the previous \nadministration has finally run out. More and more people are falling \ninto poverty.\n\n  Real median household income fell last year by $934. The spending \npower of American families in real terms dropped by over $900. That is \nthe first drop in 9 years.\n  Housing starts fell 2.2 percent in August. Unemployment insurance \nclaims remain high, the 4-week average stays above 400,000, and the \nU.S. manufacturing jobs shrank in September for the first time since \nJanuary.\n  My colleague on the Republican side says I just don't get it; things \nare really getting better out there. I don't think they are. I think, \nfrankly, we are not yet into recovery. When I talk to people who are \nleaders in business and keep an eye on the economy, they don't think we \nare either. They look at numbers and the numbers are pretty compelling.\n  Take a look at this economic report. This is the average annual \npercentage change in the Standard & Poor's 500. We went all the way \nback to the Harding administration--Warren G. Harding, the former \nPresident--to see what had happened in the stock market. Here is what \nwe learned.\n  There has only been one other time in history when we have seen such \na dramatic, precipitous decline in the value of the stock market. \nSadly, that was during the Great Depression under Herbert Hoover when \nthe stock market declined some 30 percent. We are talking about the S \n500 declining 30 percent in value. Under President Bush's current \nadministration that same percentage has gone down 21 percent. I don't \nhave to tell that to anybody listening to this speech because more than \nhalf of Americans own some stocks, whether it is their personal savings \nor college savings accounts for their kids or grandkids or their \npension plans. They know what has happened here. The nest egg you put \naside and counted on for the future has been diminishing over the last \nyear and a half. The economy is not strong. Yet you wouldn't believe it \nwhen you listen to the comments that are made.\n  Here is a comment from the President, September 5, just a few weeks \nago.\n\n       I'm optimistic about our economy. I'm optimistic about job \n     growth.\n\n  That is the President. Vice President Cheney, on August 7:\n\n       . . . there is no doubt of our nation's (economic) \n     strength.\n\n  Paul O'Neill, Secretary of the Treasury, September 25, just a few \ndays ago:\n\n       The latest indicators look good.\n\n  That is our Secretary of the Treasury. What is he reading? Who is he \nlistening to? This is a man who is supposed to be charting the course \nof economic policy in our country and he thinks things are looking \ngood, a chicken in every pot. I don't think so.\n  Take a look at the economic record of this administration. We went \nback to President Eisenhower to take a look at the annual growth rate \nof private sector jobs. Incidentally, the President said he is \noptimistic about job growth. Look at job growth under this \nadministration. Every single President has had positive job growth in \nthe private sector except one, President George W. Bush. He is \noptimistic. Well, he may be optimistic about the future, but a \nrealistic view of his administration is it has been disastrous. We have \nlost jobs across America and people know this. They understand the \nuncertainty they face.\n  Take a look as well at the average rate of change in the real gross \ndomestic product. This is the sum total of the value of goods and \nservices produced in America. We went back to President Eisenhower. \nEvery year you see a pretty substantial growth but one--look at this. \nUnder President George W. Bush we have the lowest economic growth in 50 \nyears in America. The President has said, ``I'm optimistic about the \neconomy.'' But look at the economy. It is weak. It is an economy that \nhas taken its toll on workers and families and businesses and on the \nsavings of retirees.\n  Take a look at these jobs we have lost. More than 2 million jobs have \nbeen lost under the Bush administration. We have had 111.7 million \nprivate sector jobs when the President took office. Today we are down \nto 109.6 million. In the words of Secretary of the Treasury Paul \nO'Neill, ``The latest indicators look good.'' I don't see it. It \ndoesn't look good for 2 million people who have lost their jobs since \nthis President took office.\n  Now take a look at what has happened when it comes to Government \nspending. The debt held by the public--I am almost afraid to bring up \nthe issue of national debt and deficit with Senator Hollings on the \nfloor. This is his passion. But he knows as well as I do, the debt held \nby the public in 2008 had been projected, when the President took \noffice, at $36 billion. That projection has gone from $36 billion to \nnow $3.8 trillion. We are swimming in this red ink under this \nadministration. It wasn't the case when he came to office.\n  This has all transpired under this President and his watch. What does \nit mean in terms of our Federal interest costs? Look at this. When the \nPresident came to office, they estimated the total Federal net interest \nspending for 10 years would be $620 billion. That is when President \nBush took office. Today the estimate is up to $1.9 trillion--interest \npaid on national debt created by deficits with which we are presently \nliving.\n  We left an administration that was in surplus. We left an \nadministration that was paying down the national debt. We are now in an \nadministration adding to the national debt, creating deficits, causing \nproblems across our economy.\n  The reason? You can look at the recession which continues. You can \ncertainly look to the war on terrorism, which has cost us dearly. None \nof us will shortchange the men and women who are fighting for our \nNation, and that is going to cause some spending which will come out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. But there is a third element. The third \nelement was President Bush's tax policy. He came forward and said to \nAmerica: With this fantastic surplus that I can see for 10 straight \nyears, it is time to give the money\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\nback to the American people. So the average family got the $300 check \nor the $600 check and said: That is fine. I will find something to do \nwith that.\n  But the net result of all of it is we are in a situation now where we \nare dealing with debt and deficit which we did not anticipate. The \nguesses and forecasts and speculation of President Bush's best advisers \nwere just plain wrong. The surplus that was projected for 10 years has \ndisappeared. It is totally gone. We were not prudent. We were not \ncautious. We were not careful. We put in tax cuts that will be in place \nfor 10 years and we cannot pay for them and we are going in debt. No, \nlet me take it back. We are taking money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund to pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point we are making is that we are dealing with a tax \ncut that frankly has brought us back down into a deficit situation and \nincreased our national debt and increased the interest on which future \ngenerations will pay. That tax cut, when you look at benefits of it--\ntake a look. If you happen to be down making $9,300 a year, the \nPresident's tax cut is worth $66.\n  Average annual tax cut by income range: If you are making $20,000 a \nyear, it is worth $375. If you are up to $39,000 a year, it is $600. If \nyou are making $56,000 a year, it is $1,000. If you are making $97,000 \na year, it is about $2,200. If you are making $220,000, it is worth \n$3,000 to you. But hold on tight. If you are in the top 1 percent of \nwage earners in America making an average of $1.1 million a year, the \nPresident's tax cut is worth $53,000. It is small change down here for \nmost working families. But it is $53,000 for people who are already \nmaking $1 million a year.\n  You say, of course; they pay all the taxes; they should get the tax \nbreak. That isn't how it works. Under the President's plan, it doesn't \ndirectly track the taxes we are paying. So the people who are getting \nthe biggest tax cut are not proportionately paying the most in terms of \ntaxes to the Federal Government.\n  The Bush economic record and what it means to you is, in effect, a \n10-year surplus has disappeared from $5.6 trillion, which was projected \nby the President just last year. Now we are down into a deficit \nsituation over the same 10-year period of time.\n  I mentioned earlier the impact of the stock market. Everybody, I \nthink, knows this. You see what is happening to our stock market. The \nvalue of all the stocks in the stock market when the President took \noffice was $16.4 trillion. The value today is $11.9 trillion, and going \ndown. We have lost $4.5 trillion in value--about 25 percent of the \nvalue of the stock market. Forget about the value of the stock market. \nIt is the value of savings, the value of pension plans, and the value \nof college savings accounts. Those are the things that have taken a \nbeating.\n  I think the point is clear. This administration wants to talk about \nevery issue they can think of except economic security, except the \nstate of the economy, and except the fact that average families, \naverage businesses, and average individuals in this country are \nstruggling with an economy that is flat on its back.\n  The best the President had to offer was a meeting in August down in \nTexas where he called some close friends and corporate leaders and \nasked, What do you think? A lot of them said, Stay the course; couldn't \nbe doing better.\n  We can do a lot better. We can do better with leadership--not just \nfrom the White House, but from Congress. Sadly, this Congress will not \nproduce legislation that will address these problems. What could we do? \nWe believe on this side the first thing we ought to do is extend \nunemployment insurance benefits to the people across America who are \nabout to run out of unemployment insurance. We should extend the \nbenefits for another 13 to 26 weeks. We did that five times under \nPresident Bush's father, the last time we had a recession. This \nPresident has refused to do it one time. That is not fair to these \npeople or their families.\n  Second, we believe we need pension protection for families across \nAmerica who are vulnerable; for people who are 62 years old and wanting \nto take their retirement, and watched their pension disappear before \ntheir eyes, and no health care. We need protection for those employees \nwho are in that circumstance.\n  What about the millions of Americans on minimum wage? It has been 5 \nyears since we raised the minimum wage. It is stuck at $5.15 an hour. \nThat is not going to make America stronger.\n  Let me also tell you when it comes to the cost of health, we should \nunderstand it is absolutely essential that we accept this as a highest \npriority. We heard this morning from a major union working with a major \ncompany. The people who ran the company came before them and said, \nListen, we don't know what we are going to do next year. We have a $1 \nbillion health insurance bill. We don't know how we are going to do it.\n\n  I have heard the same thing from labor unions and small businesses. \nThis government ignores it.\n  We talk about tax cuts for the wealthiest instead of tax credits for \nbusinesses that offer health insurance. We talk about tax cuts for the \nwealthiest instead of helping average families struggling to pay to get \ntheir kids through college. Why in the world don't we make the cost of \ncollege tax-deductible for working families before we award these great \ntax breaks for families making over $1 million a year?\n  This is the agenda Americans face every day. After they turn off the \nnews, they talk about a variety of other issues. They sit down and try \nto figure out how to grapple with these issues. I think this is the \nagenda which the American people want this Congress to work on. Sadly, \nbecause of lack of leadership downtown, and because of lack of \nleadership here on the Hill, we have done precious little to address \nthe real issues facing American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will wait until the Senator from New Mexico shows up and \ntry to work something out. Is that OK?\n  Mr. BOND. That works for me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa be recognized. I don't know if Senator Kennedy is still here. \nHe had been waiting. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin, \nSenator Hollings, and Senator Kennedy be recognized in that order. \nFollowing that, we would be happy to work out whatever we can with the \nSenator from Missouri.

Mr. President, on behalf of the minority leader, we object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the leader and the assistant \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for attempting to bring forward this \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill. I am disappointed \nsome in this body don't want us to move forward with this vital piece \nof legislation for the American people.\n  I invite my colleagues to take a hard look at the bill. It is a good \none. It is a bipartisan bill. I invite my colleagues, especially on the \nRepublican side, who objected to bringing this up to take a look at the \ncost of our inaction and what it will mean for America's school \nchildren this year.\n  As I have said, this is a bipartisan bill. It passed both the \nsubcommittee and the full committee unanimously. One reason for that is \nthe good allocation my subcommittee was provided by our chairman, \nSenator Byrd, and the ranking Member, Senator Stevens. Another reason \nis the bipartisan partnership Senator Specter and I have enjoyed for \nmany years. I thank each for their efforts.\n  Why can't we move forward now? Nothing is happening here. Look at the \nSenate. Nothing is happening. Nothing is happening, and we want to \nbring up our education bill to fund America's schools, and the \nRepublicans won't let us. I ask why? Why is there an objection today to \nbringing up the funding bill for education?\n  I have heard the President pounding on the podium in cities and towns \nall across the country saying the U.S. Senate needs to act. I agree. It \nis time to act. It is time to live up to the promises the President and \nthis Congress made on education. We are ready to act. We didn't object. \nThe Republicans objected to bringing up our education bill.\n  Not incidentally, it is time to live up to the promise we made on a \nbipartisan basis to double the funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth. With this bill, we would have completed that 5-year goal. Now \nthat has been put on the back burner. With this bill, we could have \ncompleted that 5-year goal. And that is put on the back burner. It is \nall in jeopardy, as is the promise of the Leave No Child Behind Act.\n\n  Last year we came together on a bipartisan basis to demand more of \nour public schools. We said the status quo was not good enough; we had \nto do better. Now, by not acting on this bill, we have passed mandates \non our public schools, mandates about leaving no child behind, and now \nwe are not coming forward with the funding to help them.\n  Now we are going to do a continuing resolution. That is what they \ntell me. What does passing a long-term continuing resolution mean? I \ntalk about that with my constituents. I talk about a CR, a continuing \nresolution, and their eyes glaze over. What does that mean?\n  In real terms, the objection by the minority side today means $3.2 \nbillion less for education overall for this year, the one we are in \nnow, and $1.5 billion less for title I, which is most important for \nimplementing Leave No Child Behind.\n  Since the objection was made on behalf of the minority leader, the \nSenator from Mississippi, I point out that in Mississippi that would be \n$5.3 million less this year for title I if we do not get this bill \nthrough.\n  The ink isn't even dry on the Leave No Child Behind bill and already \nwe are undercutting the schools. I have talked with a lot of my \nprincipals in Iowa and they are deeply concerned about what is going to \nhappen when they have to meet their annual yearly progress standards \nand yet we have not given them the tools by which they can do so. It \nwill be a cruel joke on them to have passed Leave No Child Behind and \nnot pass the funding.\n  How about special education? A long-term continuing resolution, \nwithout this bill, means $1 billion less for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. Again, since this objection was made on \nbehalf of the Senator from Mississippi, I will point out that for \nMississippi it means they will get $10.7 million less this year for \nspecial education because the minority leader objected to moving to the \neducation appropriations bill.\n  It is time we pass the money for special education. Last year Senator \nHagel and I came together on a bipartisan amendment to do it, but the \nPresident and the House punted and said no. And they are doing it \nagain.\n  I say to colleagues, ask your principals and your school boards about \ntheir need for special education funding and you will find out how much \nit is needed. Because this objection was made today, $1 billion less \nwill be made available to our public schools in America.\n  For student financial aid--for those going to college--a long-term CR \nmeans $100 less for the maximum Pell grant, and not a single dollar \nmore for student loans and other college aid.\n  In my own State of Iowa, because of the downturn in the economy, we \nhave seen a 20-percent tuition increase at our public universities. \nThese schools are critical to helping middle-class kids climb the \nladder of opportunity. Yet today the minority leader says no to helping \nthese middle-class kids get a college education.\n  The world has changed a lot from a year ago. There is no denying \nthat. We have different priorities, as well we should. But if we cannot \nensure that every child in America has the best public education, then \nwhat kind of a nation are we fighting for?\n  President Kennedy once said of education:\n\n       Let us think of education as the means of developing our \n     greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private \n     hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into \n     benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation.\n       It is the private hopes and the private dreams of the \n     families of these kids in public schools--in elementary \n     school and high school, and now wanting to go to college--it \n     is their private hopes and dreams that are being stunted by \n     the objection by the minority leader today in not going to \n     the education funding bill.\n\n  We are here in the Senate. We are not doing a cotton-picking thing. \nWe are just sitting around. Why? Because the minority leader will not \nlet us do anything. They may think it is good politics. Maybe they can \ngo out there and now argue: Well, we can't get anything done in the \nSenate. We can't get anything done in the Senate. Well, not because of \nwhat the Democrats are doing. We want to bring up the education funding \nbill. It is the minority leader who is objecting. The Republican leader \nis objecting.\n  We could bring it up. As I say one more time, this education funding \nbill passed the subcommittee and the full committee unanimously--\nunanimously. So for what possible reason would the minority leader \nobject to bringing up the education funding bill when we are not doing \nanything anyway? It would seem to me we could bring it up, debate it \nthis afternoon, and probably get it passed tomorrow, since it was \nsupported unanimously on both sides of the aisle.\n  It is time for us to act to get the money out for special education, \ntitle I, for elementary and secondary education, help for our middle-\nclass kids going to college. The minority leader today has said no. He \nsaid that politics comes first. I think our kids should come first.\n  Well, they have objected today, Mr. Leader. I will attempt again \ntomorrow to bring up the education funding bill, and every day that we \nare here, to bring it up to let the American people know that we, on \nthis side, and I, as chairman of the subcommittee that funds education, \nwant to bring it up. We want to get it through. I am just sorry that \nthe minority leader has objected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on one point I agree with my colleague from\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\nIowa: This Senate is dysfunctional. We have not done our work. It is a \nnew year. It has already begun. We have not passed and sent to the \nPresident a single appropriations bill.\n  But I have to differ very strongly with his accusation, which is \ntotally unfounded, that the objection I raised was for political \npurposes. The objection is raised because this body has before it an \nappropriations bill. We have the Interior appropriations bill before \nus, and it has been stalled by my colleagues on the other side. We need \nto vote on that bill.\n  One of the reasons we are in this problem is because we have not \npassed a budget, the first time since 1974 we have not passed a budget. \nI serve on the Budget Committee. I happen to believe that the budget \nthat was reported out by the majority, on a party-line vote, was and is \nindefensible. The fact that the majority leader has not brought it up \ntends to confirm my suspicion.\n  But when you do not have a budget, you have a great difficulty trying \nto pass appropriations bills. We have passed good bills out of the \nAppropriations Committee. And I happen to have not only a great \ninterest in the Labor, Health, and Human Services bill, but in the VA-\nHUD and independent agencies bill. We have to get those done. And we \nare going to get those done. It looks as if we are going to have to \nwait for a new Congress to do it. We are going to get those funds out \nthere because they are vitally needed. And we have, in all of these \nbills, incorporated many important projects and programs that need to \nbe funded.\n  But we are stuck. We have been almost, I guess it is, 5 weeks now on \nInterior. Why haven't we voted on and passed out an Interior bill? Why \nnot? Because Senators from the West--and I include myself in that; it \nis close; we are on the west side of the Mississippi River--want to \nhave the same protection for our forests, for the neighbors of the \nforests, for the people who work in the forests--the firefighters--for \nthe people who live by the forests, for the trees themselves, the \nwildlife in the forests, we want to have the same protection from \ndevastating catastrophic forest fires.\n  Senators Craig, Domenici, and Kyl offered an amendment which I was \nproud to support. Very simply, that amendment gave, with many more \nlimitations, the same kind of flexibility to the Forest Service in \nother States that it has in South Dakota, which is desperately needed.\n  The Senator from South Dakota included a provision nobody knew about \nin the Defense bill that said you could go in and clean out the high-\ndensity fuel and the volatile compounds lining the floors of the \nforests in South Dakota, but he made it just for South Dakota.\n  Fires are raging in the West, in California, Arizona, Colorado, Utah. \nThey are threatened in Missouri. We said: We want the same protection \nfor our forests. We want to be able to use sound forest management, \nwhich means getting the dead, diseased logs out of the forest before a \nspark from lightning or a manmade spark or some kind of machine sets \nthem on fire and causes a catastrophic fire that outraces the wildlife, \nthat burns old-growth trees, that kills people. Over 20 firefighters \nare dead in the West from these catastrophic fires. It is burning up \nproperty.\n  Do you know what the result is? The environment suffers tremendously \nbecause wildlife cannot escape from these fast-moving fires. The forest \nfloor is baked so hard that nothing will grow for decades. What we are \nsaying is, sound forestry management demands that you clean out the \nhigh-fuel areas to prevent catastrophic fires. It makes common sense. \nExcept there are special interest groups, specifically the Sierra Club \nand others, that say you cannot vote for that bill. They have too much \npolitical clout.\n  If we are talking about politics, holding up the appropriations, \nlet's look at the politics holding up the Interior appropriations bill. \nThat is where the politics are being played. That is why people \nthroughout the West and anywhere where there are national forests are \nin danger of catastrophic forest fires, because the majority refuses to \nmake their Members vote between cleaning up the forests, preventing the \nfires, protecting their people, and the Sierra Club. They don't want to \nmake that choice.\n  That choice is easy. If we can get a vote on it, one way or the \nother, you may beat us. You may have enough votes to say, no, we don't \nwant to give you that protection. But at least we want to have a vote. \nThen we can pass the Interior bill. We could get to Labor-HHS. We could \nget to the CJS bill on which my colleague from South Carolina has \nworked so hard. We can get to the VA-HUD-independent agencies bill on \nwhich I have worked with my colleague from Maryland.\n  There is politics in the holding up of the appropriations. The \npolitics are not on this side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9815-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9815-S9819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, earlier this morning I heard a \ndistinguished colleague on this side of the aisle refer to ending the \nfiscal year with a $150 to $160 billion deficit.\n  Thereafter, I was astounded to hear a colleague from the other side \nof the aisle say tax cuts increase revenues. If that latter statement \nwere true, we would just come here and cut taxes every day because that \nis what we need, revenues. Ever since this President took office, we \nhave run the most astounding debt of a free country. Instead of paying \ndown the debt, there isn't any question, when he came here he started \ncutting taxes. He put in an economic team headed by Larry Lindsey--the \nonly fellow in America who thinks the economy is good.\n  Until you get rid of that economic team and stop this singsong about \ncutting taxes, and instead start paying down the debt, the economy is \nnot going to recover.\n  Let me go right to what the debt is because today is October 2, two \ndays since the end of fiscal year 2002. Under law, the Treasurer of the \nUnited States is required to publish the public debt every day. We \nended the fiscal year 2002 on September 30, with a deficit of $421 \nbillion, and a debt of $6.2 trillion, up from $5.8 trillion last year.\n  I have been up here 36 years. This is the biggest deficit we have \never had. George the first gave us a $402 billion deficit. He exceeded \nthe $400 billion mark. Now George the second, topped it with $421 \nbillion. The Senator from Oklahoma said that if you cut the taxes, you \nincrease the revenues. George the first called that voodoo. This is \nvoodoo two.\n  Here is how we got into this particular dilemma, because we all are \nguilty on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol. It \nwas Mark Twain who said that the truth is such a precious thing, it \nshould be used very sparingly.\n  Well, not really kidding about the truth, going to the seriousness of \nthe truth, it was never better stated than by my friend James Fallows, \nin his book ``Breaking the News'' back in 1996, when he related the \ndebate over how you constitute and maintain a strong democratic \ngovernment.\n  The debate was between Walter Lippmann and John Dewey, the famous \neducator. It was Lippmann's contention that what you really need to do \nis get the best of minds in the particular disciplines--the best fellow \non education, the best on forestry and fires, the best fellow on health \ncare, the best fellow on defense, and whatever it is, the experts in \nthe fields--to sit around the table and agree on the needs of the \ncountry and their expert solution to the problem of those needs.\n  John Dewey, the famous educator, said: No, all we need to do is have \nthe free press tell the truth to the American people. And out of those \ntruths, emanating through their representatives, their Senators in \nGovernment in Washington, would come the proper programs to strengthen \nand maintain that democracy.\n  That for the first time ever gave me the understanding of Jefferson's \nobservation that as between a free government and a free press, he \nwould choose the latter. Obviously, of course, with that free press \ntelling the truth, we would always maintain a strong democracy. But we \nhaven't been telling the truth.\n  I have been trying for a good 20-some years now, since I was chairman \nof the Budget Committee, to get us to tell the\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\ntruth: Simply, how much in revenues the Government took in, and how \nmany expenditures there were. We need to find out what the net is, so \nwe know whether we ended up with a surplus or with a deficit. Using \nthis technique, the fiscal year 2002 deficit, that ended just two days \nago, was $421 billion.\n  How many Senators, time and time again, say: We have to hold the \ndeficit to $165 billion, but we are not going to touch Social Security? \nHow many Senators have said we have a $5.6 trillion surplus, but we are \nnot going to touch Social Security?\n  Let me go to the Social Security story. In 1935, under Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, we passed the most formative of governmental \nprograms. Between 1930 and 1969, we never used Social Security moneys \nto pay the Government's debt. However, in 1971, I was here when we had \nthe famous expert on government finance, Congressman Wilbur Mills, and \nhe started up into New Hampshire running for the Presidency, promising \na 10-percent increase in the cost of living adjustment to the Social \nSecurity recipient.\n  He said that we have such a surplus in the Social Security trust \nfund, he would give them a full 10 percent. Of course, President Nixon \ncame back and said in the campaign: If he gives you 10 percent, I will \ngive you 15 percent. With that one-upmanship during the 1970s, we were \ndrained, and the Social Security trust fund almost went into the red by \n1980.\n  We appointed the famous Greenspan Commission, which came out with a \nreport in January 1983 called the ``National Commission on Social \nSecurity Reform.'' You will see under section 21--and I read from it:\n\n       A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the Social Security trust \n     funds should be removed from the unified budget.\n\n  It took this Senator from 1983 until 1990--7 years--to get a vote on \nthis. I finally got it out of the Budget Committee, but not \nunanimously. There was one vote by someone who said they would ``chase \nme down like a dog in the streets'' when I was recommending an increase \nin taxes in 1993. There was one Senator on that Budget Committee, who \nwould surprise everybody, who said, no, he didn't want to put Social \nSecurity off budget. But when we came to a vote on the floor, 98 \nSenators voted for it. President George Herbert Walker Bush, on \nNovember 5, 1990, signed section 13.301 of the Budget Act into law, \nwhich states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Social Security trust fund shall not \n     be counted in any budget of the United States Government.\n\n  There it is. That is the law of the land. Unfortunately, there is no \npenalty if you don't follow it. I tried to get a penalty saying you \nwould forfeit your own Social Security if ever you quoted a budget \nincluding the Social Security trust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this section be printed in the \nCongressional Record at this time, along with section 31 of the report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in 1993, that same Alan Greenspan went \ndown to Arkansas. To meet with President-Elect Bill Clinton at an \neconomic conference. He said what we really needed to do is pay down \nthe debt; then President Clinton came to town, and without a single \nRepublican vote, we cut spending and we increased taxes. That is when \nthe Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, said: If you increase taxes on \nSocial Security, they will be hunting you Democrats down like dogs in \nthe street and shooting you.\n  Well, I voted to increase taxes on Social Security. I voted to \nincrease taxes on gasoline. I voted to increase taxes on whom? The \nstock crowd in New York. And the stock crowd in New York rejoiced. They \nturned around and said: The Government in Washington finally has gotten \nserious and is going to pay down the bill--that huge debt--and we are \ngoing to start investing. Then we had an 8-year economic boom.\n  Along comes candidate George W. Bush. When candidate Bush came on \nthat campaign trail, I will never forget it. It was about this time, \nthe year before last. He said he was going to cut taxes. I was watching \nit, being an old Budget Committee chairman and thinking, How in the \nworld are they going to do this? They didn't have any taxes to cut. We \ngot right into the black under President Clinton's economic plan. We \nwere hearing about going in the absolute opposite direction and arguing \nnow why. Everybody knows why.\n  Immediately after his election in November, on the Friday of that \nparticular week, Vice President Cheney said we were going to cut taxes. \nEverybody started taking him seriously. This was not just a campaign \nstatement. Then I can tell you who pulled the plug on the economy--\nirrationally exuberant Alan Greenspan himself. He appeared on January \n25--I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Testimony of Chairman Alan Greenspan\n\n  (Before the Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, January 25, 2001)\n\n\n   outlook for the federal budget and implications for fiscal policy\n\n       I am pleased to appear here today to discuss some of the \n     important issues surrounding the outlook for the federal \n     budget and the attendant implications for the formulation of \n     fiscal policy. In doing so, I want to emphasize that I speak \n     for myself and not necessarily for the Federal Reserve.\n       The challenges you face both in shaping a budget for the \n     coming year and in designing a longer-run strategy for fiscal \n     policy were brought into sharp focus by the release last week \n     of the Clinton Administration's final budget projections, \n     which showed further upward revisions of on-budget surpluses \n     for the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office also is \n     expected to again raise its projections when it issues its \n     report next week.\n       The key factor driving the cumulative upward revisions in \n     the budget picture in recent years has been the extraordinary \n     pickup in the growth of labor productivity experienced in \n     this country since the mid-1990s. Between the early 1970s and \n     1995, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose \n     about 1\\1/2\\ percent per year, on average. Since 1995, \n     however, productivity growth has accelerated markedly, about \n     doubling the earlier pace, even after taking account of the \n     impetus from cyclical forces. Though hardly definitive, the \n     apparent sustained growth in measured productivity in the \n     face of a pronounced slowing in the growth of aggregate \n     demand during the second half of last year was an important \n     test of the extent of the improvement in structural \n     productivity. These most recent indications have added to the \n     accumulating evidence that the apparent increases in the \n     growth of output per hour are more than transitory.\n       It is these observations that appear to be causing \n     economists, including those who contributed to the OMB and \n     the CBO budget projections, to raise their forecasts of the \n     economy's long-term growth rates and budget surpluses. This \n     increased optimism receives support from the forward-looking \n     indicators of technical innovation and structural \n     productivity growth, which have shown few signs of weakening \n     despite the marked curtailment in recent months of capital \n     investment plans for equipment and software.\n       To be sure, these impressive upward revisions to the growth \n     of structural productivity and economic potential are based \n     on inferences drawn from economic relationships that are \n     different from anything we have considered in recent decades. \n     The resulting budget projections, therefore, are necessarily \n     subject to a relatively wide range of error. Reflecting the \n     uncertainties of forecasting well into the future, neither \n     the OMB nor the CBO projects productivity to continue to \n     improve at the stepped-up pace of the past few years. Both \n     expect productivity growth rates through the next decade to \n     average roughly 2\\1/4\\ to 2\\1/2\\ percent per year--far above \n     the average pace from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, but \n     still below that of the past five years.\n       Had the innovations of recent decades, especially in \n     information technologies, not come to fruition, productivity \n     growth during the past five to seven years, arguably, would \n     have continued to languish at the rate of the preceding \n     twenty years. The sharp increase in prospective long-term \n     rates of return on high-tech investments would not have \n     emerged as it did in the early 1990s, and the associated \n     surge in stock prices would surely have been largely absent. \n     The accompanying wealth effect, so evidently critical to the \n     growth of economic activity since the mid-1990s, would never \n     have materialized.\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\n       In contrast, the experience of the past five to seven years \n     has been truly without recent precedent. The doubling of the \n     growth rate of output per hour has caused individuals' real \n     taxable income to grow nearly 2\\1/2\\ times as fast as it did \n     over the preceding ten years and resulted in the substantial \n     surplus of receipts over outlays that we are now \n     experiencing. Not only did taxable income rise with the \n     faster growth of GDP, but the associated large increase in \n     asset prices and capital gains created additional tax \n     liabilities not directly related to income from current \n     production.\n       The most recent projections from the OMB indicate that, if \n     current policies remain in place, the total unified surplus \n     will reach $800 billion in fiscal year 2011, including an on-\n     budget surplus of $500 billion. The CBO reportedly will be \n     showing even larger surpluses. Moreover, the admittedly quite \n     uncertain long-term budget exercises released by the CBO last \n     October maintain an implicit on-budget surplus under baseline \n     assumptions well past 2030 despite the budgetary pressures \n     from the aging of the baby-boom generation, especially on the \n     major health programs.\n       The most recent projections, granted their tentativeness, \n     nonetheless make clear that the highly desirable goal of \n     paying off the federal debt is in reach before the end of the \n     decade. This is in marked contrast to the perspective of a \n     year ago when the elimination of the debt did not appear \n     likely until the next decade.\n       But continuing to run surpluses beyond the point at which \n     we reach zero or near-zero federal debt brings to center \n     stage the critical longer-term fiscal policy issue of whether \n     the federal government should accumulate large quantities of \n     private (more technically nonfederal) assets. At zero debt, \n     the continuing unified budget surpluses currently projected \n     imply a major accumulation of private assets by the federal \n     government. This development should factor materially into \n     the policies you and the Administration choose to pursue.\n       I believe, as I have noted in the past, that the federal \n     government should eschew private asset accumulation because \n     it would be exceptionally difficult to insulate the \n     government's investment decisions from political pressures. \n     Thus, over time, having the federal government hold \n     significant amounts of private assets would risk sub-optimal \n     performance by our capital markets, diminished economic \n     efficiency, and lower overall standards of living than would \n     be achieved otherwise.\n       Short of an extraordinarily rapid and highly undesirable \n     short-term dissipation of unified surpluses or a transferring \n     of assets to individual privatized accounts, it appears \n     difficult to avoid at least some accumulation of private \n     assets by the government.\n       Private asset accumulation may be forced upon us well short \n     of reaching zero debt. Obviously, savings bonds and state and \n     local government series bonds are not readily redeemable \n     before maturity. But the more important issue is the \n     potentially rising cost of retiring marketable Treasury \n     debt. While shorter-term marketable securities could be \n     allowed to run off as they mature, longer-term issues \n     would have to be retired before maturity through debt \n     buybacks. The magnitudes are large: As of January 1, for \n     example, there was in excess of three quarters of a \n     trillion dollars in outstanding nonmarketable securities, \n     such as savings bonds and state and local series issues, \n     and marketable securities (excluding those held by the \n     Federal Reserve) that do not mature and could not be \n     called before 2011. Some holders of long-term Treasury \n     securities may be reluctant to give them up, especially \n     those who highly value the risk-free status of those \n     issues. Inducing such holders, including foreign holders, \n     to willingly offer to sell their securities prior to \n     maturity could require paying premiums that far exceed any \n     realistic value of retiring the debt before maturity.\n       Decisions about what type of private assets to acquire and \n     to which federal accounts they should be directed must be \n     made well before the policy is actually implemented, which \n     could occur in as little as five to seven years from now. \n     These choices have important implications for the balance of \n     saving and, hence, investment in our economy. For example, \n     transferring government savings to individual private \n     accounts as a means of avoiding the accumulation of private \n     assets in the government accounts could significantly affect \n     how social security will be funded in the future.\n       Short of some privatization, it would be preferable in my \n     judgment to allocate the required private assets to the \n     social security trust funds, rather than to on-budget \n     accounts. To be sure, such trust fund investments are subject \n     to the same concerns about political pressures as on-budget \n     investments would be. The expectation that the retirement of \n     the baby-boom generation will eventually require a drawdown \n     of these fund balances does, however, provide some mitigation \n     of these concerns.\n       Returning to the broader picture, I continue to believe, as \n     I have testified previously, that all else being equal, a \n     declining level of federal debt is desirable because it holds \n     down long-term real interest rates, thereby lowering the cost \n     of capital and elevating private investment. The rapid \n     capital deepening that has occurred in the U.S. economy in \n     recent years is a testament to these benefits. But the \n     sequence of upward revisions to the budget surplus \n     projections for several years now has reshaped the choices \n     and opportunities before us. Indeed, in almost any credible \n     baseline scenario, short of a major and prolonged economic \n     contraction, the full benefits of debt reduction are now \n     achieved before the end of this decade--a prospect that did \n     not seem likely only a year or even six months ago.\n       The most recent data significantly raise the probability \n     that sufficient resources will be available to undertake both \n     debt reduction and surplus lowering policy initiatives. \n     Accordingly, the tradeoff faced earlier appears no longer an \n     issue. The emerging key fiscal policy need is to address the \n     implications of maintaining surpluses beyond the point at \n     which publicly held debt is effectively eliminated.\n       The time has come, in my judgement, to consider a budgetary \n     strategy that is consistent with a preemptive smoothing of \n     the glide path to zero federal debt or, more realistically, \n     to the level of federal debt that is an effective irreducible \n     minimum. Certainly, we should make sure that social security \n     surpluses are large enough to meet our long-term needs and \n     seriously consider explicit mechanisms that will help ensure \n     that outcome. Special care must be taken not to conclude that \n     wraps on fiscal discipline are no longer necessary. At \n     the same time, we must avoid a situation in which we come \n     upon the level of irreducible debt so abruptly that the \n     only alternative to the accumulation of private assets \n     would be a sharp reduction in taxes and/or increase in \n     expenditures, because these actions might occur at a time \n     when sizable economic stimulus would be inappropriate. In \n     other words, budget policy should strive to limit \n     potential disruptions by making the on-budget surplus \n     economically inconsequential when the debt is effectively \n     paid off.\n       In general, as I have testified previously, if long-term \n     fiscal stability is the criterion, it is far better, in my \n     judgment, that the surpluses be lowered by tax reductions \n     than by spending increases. The flurry of increases in \n     outlays that occurred near the conclusion of last fall's \n     budget deliberations is troubling because it makes the \n     previous year's lack of discipline less likely to have been \n     an aberration.\n       To be sure, with the burgeoning federal surpluses, fiscal \n     policy has not yet been unduly compromised by such actions. \n     But history illustrates the difficulty of keeping spending in \n     check, especially in programs that are open-ended \n     commitments, which too often have led to much larger outlays \n     than initially envisioned. It is important to recognize that \n     government expenditures are claims against real resources and \n     that, while those claims may be unlimited, our capacity to \n     meet them is ultimately constrained by the growth in \n     productivity. Moreover, the greater the drain of resources \n     from the private sector, arguably, the lower the growth \n     potential of the economy. In contrast to most spending \n     programs, tax reductions have downside limits. They cannot be \n     open-ended.\n       Lately there has been much discussion of cutting taxes to \n     confront the evident pronounced weakening in recent economic \n     performance. Such tax initiatives, however, historically have \n     proved difficult to implement in the time frame in which \n     recessions have developed and ended. For example, although \n     President Ford proposed in January of 1975 that withholding \n     rates be reduced, this easiest of tax changes was not \n     implemented until May, when the recession was officially over \n     and the recovery was gathering force. Of course, had that \n     recession lingered through the rest of 1975 and beyond, the \n     tax cuts would certainly have been helpful. In today's \n     context, where tax reduction appears required in any event \n     over the next several years to assist in forestalling the \n     accumulation of private assets, starting that process sooner \n     rather than later likely would help smooth the transition to \n     longer-term fiscal balance. And should current economic \n     weakness spread beyond what now appears likely, having a tax \n     cut in place may, in fact, do noticeably good.\n       As for tax policy over the longer run, most economists \n     believe that it should be directed at setting rates at the \n     levels required to meet spending commitments, while doing so \n     in a manner that minimizes distortions, increases efficiency, \n     and enhances incentives for saving, investment, and work.\n       In recognition of the uncertainties in the economic and \n     budget outlook, it is important that any long-term tax plan, \n     or spending initiative for that matter, be phased in. \n     Conceivably, it could include provisions that, in some way, \n     would limit surplus-reducing actions if specified targets for \n     the budget surplus and federal debt were not satisfied. Only \n     if the probability was very low that prospective tax cuts or \n     new outlay initiatives would send the on-budget accounts into \n     deficit, would unconditional initiatives appear prudent.\n       The reason for caution, of course, rests on the \n     tentativeness of our projections. What if, for example, the \n     forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years \n     begin to dissipate or reverse in ways that we do not foresee? \n     Indeed, we still do not have a full understanding of the \n     exceptional strength in individual income tax receipts \n     during the latter 1990s. To the extent that some of the \n     surprise has been indirectly associated with the surge in \n     asset values in the 1990s, the softness in equity prices \n     over the past year has highlighted some of the risks going \n     forward.\n       Indeed, the current economic weakness may reveal a less \n     favorable relationship between tax receipts, income, and \n     asset prices than has been assumed in recent projections.\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\n     Until we receive full detail on the distribution by income of \n     individual tax liabilities for 1999, 2000, and perhaps 2001, \n     we are making little more than informed guesses of certain \n     key relationships between income and tax receipts.\n       To be sure, unless later sources do reveal major changes in \n     tax liability determination, receipts should be reasonably \n     well-maintained in the near term, as the effects of earlier \n     gains in asset values continue to feed through with a lag \n     into tax liabilities. But the longer-run effects of movements \n     in asset values are much more difficult to assess, and those \n     uncertainties would intensify should equity prices remain \n     significantly off their peaks. Of course, the uncertainties \n     in the receipts outlook do seem less troubling in view of the \n     cushion provided by the recent sizable upward revisions to \n     the ten-year surplus projections. But the risk of adverse \n     movements in receipt is still real, and the probability of \n     dropping back into deficit as a consequence of imprudent \n     fiscal policies is not negligible.\n       In the end, the outlook for federal budget surpluses rests \n     fundamentally on expectations of longer-term trends in \n     productivity, fashioned by judgments about the technologies \n     that underlie these trends. Economists have long noted that \n     the diffusion of technology starts slowly, accelerates, and \n     then slows with maturity. But knowing where we now stand in \n     that sequence is difficult--if not impossible--in real time. \n     As the CBO and the OMB acknowledge, they have been cautious \n     in their interpretation of recent productivity developments \n     and in their assumptions going forward. That seems \n     appropriate given the uncertainties that surround even these \n     relatively moderate estimates for productivity growth. Faced \n     with these uncertainties, it is crucial that we develop \n     budgetary strategies that deal with any disappointments that \n     could occur.\n       That said, as I have argued for some time, there is a \n     distinct possibility that much of the development and \n     diffusion of new technologies in the current wave of \n     innovation still lies ahead, and we cannot rule out \n     productivity growth rates greater than is assumed in the \n     official budget projections. Obviously, if that turns out to \n     be the case, the existing level of tax rates would have to be \n     reduced to remain consistent with currently projected budget \n     outlays.\n       The changes in the budget outlook over the past several \n     years are truly remarkable. Little more than a decade ago, \n     the Congress established budget controls that were considered \n     successful because they were instrumental in squeezing the \n     burgeoning budget deficit to tolerable dimensions. \n     Nevertheless, despite the sharp curtailment of defense \n     expenditures under way during those years, few believed that \n     a surplus was anywhere on the horizon. And the notion that \n     the rapidly mounting federal debt could be paid off would not \n     have been taken seriously.\n       But let me end on a cautionary note. With today's euphoria \n     surrounding the surpluses, it is not difficult to imagine in \n     the hard-earned fiscal restraint developed in recent years \n     rapidly . . .\n\n  He said that ``by continuing to run surpluses beyond the point of \nwhich we reach zero, Federal debt brings to center stage the critical \nlonger term fiscal policy issue of whether the Federal Government \nshould accumulate large quantities of private assets. I believe that \nthe Federal Government should eschew private assets accumulation. Of \ncourse, having the Federal Government hold the significant amounts of \nprivate assets would risk sub-optimal performance of our capital \nmarkets, diminish economic efficiency, and lower overall standards of \nliving.''\n  He talked of ``burgeoning Federal surpluses.'' That was just last \nyear, in January. He said that surpluses should be lowered by tax \nreductions rather than by spending increases.\n  He said:\n\n       The most recent data significantly raised the probability \n     that sufficient resources will be available to undertake both \n     debt reduction and surplus lowering.\n\n  Does anybody here need better permission than that, than to have Alan \nGreenspan give you the stamp of approval for cutting taxes?\n  Mr. President, the President talked a month later, in February, in \nhis State of the Union, and he said:\n\n       To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors \n     are not diverted in any other program, my budget projects all \n     $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social \n     Security, and for Social Security alone. At the end of these \n     10 years, we will have paid down all of the debt. That is \n     more debt repaid more quickly than has ever been repaid by \n     any nation in history.\n\n  He says, going further:\n\n       My budget sets aside almost a trillion dollars over 10 \n     years for additional needs.\n\n  I could read more. But don't come now and say we have huge deficits \nbecause of 9/11. The cost of 9/11 is under $32 billion. The terrorism \nwar didn't cause this huge deficit. If it did, the President said just \na year ago, he had a trillion dollars ready to take care of anything \nunexpected.\n  So there you are, Mr. President. What we did is to give out some \nrebates. I had an amendment on the floor on this. We passed it in June \nand paid it out around September. It was too late; it wasn't enough. \nMore than anything else, it didn't give the payroll taxpayers--the ones \nwho would spend the money, the people who were pulling the wagon, \npaying the taxes, keeping the schools going, and everything else of \nthat kind, working around the clock--they didn't get any particular tax \ncut.\n  So then this August I moved finally on the budget with respect to the \nSEC certification. If the SEC was busy asking the CEOs of America's \nlargest companies to swear that their financial reports were in order, \nI thought that Mitch Daniels should do the same for the Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  Here on this chart we have listed more than 600 CEOs who complied. On \nAugust 14, the deadline day, there were only two exceptions--the CEO of \nthe IT Group, Mitch Daniels of the United States of America. Let me \nscratch out the IT Group because they have since been heard from.\n  I wrote Mitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, and I said: Are you going to also certify on August 14? The \nnext day, the New York Times reported that Mr. Daniels said he would \nhave a reply to Mr. Hollings ready in a day or two.\n  That was on August 15. I still do not have a reply. I guess he wants \nan extension.\n  How are we going to get truth in budgeting? It is very interesting \nthat we passed, in 1994, the Pension Reform Act whereby companies are \nnot allowed to use pension money of corporations to pay off company \ndebt. We had Carl Icahn and all of those quick artists who took money \nfrom these corporations and ran.\n  Unfortunately, our friend, the famous pitcher, Denny McLain in \nDetroit, when he headed up a corporation and took money, was convicted \nof a felony. I said: If you can find the jail where he is serving--I am \nconfident he is out by now--tell him next time to run for the U.S. \nSenate. Instead of a jail term, you get the Good Government Award. That \nis what we have going on.\n  You cannot treat expenditures as revenues. That is exactly Kenny Boy \nLay's Enron program, but Kenny Boy did not invent it. We invented it up \nhere under voodoo Reagan and now with voodoo Bush 2, George W. He broke \nthe Government. He has the sorriest economic team you have ever seen. \nHe still naively does not understand the economy, asking for tax cuts. \nHe is continuing to wreck us, and until he gets rid of that team and \nquits talking tax cuts and starts talking economic sense, the market \nwill never turn around, I can tell you that right now.\n  Mr. President, let's please tell the truth.

I thank the Chair. I also extend my thanks to the \ndistinguished Democratic whip for his help in arranging for me to speak \nat this moment.\n  Mr. President, today is October 2. In 2 days, the continuing \nresolution that Congress approved last week will expire. While the days \nflip by on the calendar, the work on appropriations bills remains at an \nimpasse, a standstill.\n  As a result of White House efforts to slow down the appropriations \nprocess--and those efforts have been successful--not 1 of the 13 \nappropriations bills has been sent to the President as of October 1, \nthe beginning of the new fiscal year. This is the worst record for \nprogress in the appropriations process since 1987.\n  In 1987, my wife and I celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary. Here \nit is 15 years later, so we are now 65 years along on our journey, but \nhow much further along are we in the appropriations process? Let me say \nagain, this is the worst record for progress in the appropriations \nprocess since 1987.\n  I would be very unhappy to say this with respect to my wife's and my \njourney of wedding anniversaries. Fifteen of them have passed since we \nhad our worst year in 1987 in the appropriations process. So today, 15 \nyears later, we are as bad as we were then.\n  As a result of White House intransigence on total discretionary \nspending for this fiscal year, the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, has not taken up a single appropriations bill on the \nHouse floor for 10 weeks--10 weeks. God created the Earth and all of \nthe universe and created man in 1 week--6 days and rested on the 7th. \nHere we are, the House has not taken up an appropriations bill on the \nfloor for 10 weeks--10 weeks. Rather than working with the House \nAppropriations Committee and moderates in their own party on a level of \nspending that could be approved on the House floor, the House \nRepublican leadership, at the request of the White House, simply shut \nthe appropriations process down. That is it.\n  As a result, one of the most fundamental duties of the President and \nthe Congress--namely, to make careful and responsible choices about how \nto spend the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars--has been put on automatic \npilot.\n  While the days slip away, the 4 million veterans in this country who \nrely on the Veterans Administration for their health care will have to \nworry as to whether or not that care is going to be available for them.\n  While the days slip away, the 11,420 FBI agents who are supposed to \nbe combating the war on terrorism will have to wonder whether they have \nthe necessary resources to continue to fight that war. Why? Because of \nthis administration's do-nothing policy when it comes to the \nappropriations process. Slow down the process. Stall.\n  While the days slip away, the Government's effort to root out \ncorporate fraud would be put on hold.\n  While the days slip away, the President appears to be satisfied to \nforget his ``no child left behind'' promise and turn the commitment to \neducating America's children into another unfunded mandate, another \nunfulfilled promise.\n  The President is quick to champion homeland security on the political \nspeech tour. Yes, he will stand out there with a backdrop of marines, a \nbackdrop of soldiers, a backdrop of sailors, a backdrop of the National \nGuard, and he will say: Congress, pass my homeland security bill.\n  The President is quick to champion homeland security on the hustings \nwhen he is making fundraising trips, raising big dollars for the \ncampaign. He is quick to champion homeland security, but his budget \npriorities reflect an entirely different agenda. The administration's \nadamant refusal to move off the dime in these appropriations \ndiscussions could jeopardize homeland security--and already has \njeopardized homeland security.\n  No matter when or how or whether any new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is created, by jeopardizing the appropriations bills, the \nWhite House jeopardizes critical funds for the new Transportation \nSecurity Administration. Many of the requirements of the Transportation \nSecurity Act require large expenditures in the first quarter of fiscal \nyear 2003. Are they going to flow?\n  Local airports are required to purchase explosive detection equipment \nto keep bombs from being placed on airliners. To do that, the airports \nneed help. But the administration's refusal to be more flexible in its \nappropriations approach means that help is not on the way.\n  Federal funds are also needed to hire new Federal screeners to make \nour Nation's seaports more secure. Is help on the way?\n  Help is not on the way.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service is at a critical juncture \nin developing a comprehensive entry and exit system to protect our \nNation's borders. The Senate bill provides $362 million for this \ninitiative. Is help on the way? No. The administration's inflexibility \nmeans that help is not on the way.\n  The Customs Service is scheduled to hire more than 620 agents and \ninspectors to serve at the Nation's high-risk land and seaports of \nentry. Homeland security? The Senate provides the funding for the \nCustoms Service. But is help on the way? No. The administration is \nbeing inflexible. Help is not on the way.\n  Thousands of FEMA fire grants, grants for interoperable \ncommunications equipment, grants to upgrade emergency operations \ncenters, grants to upgrade search and rescue teams, grants for \nemergency responder training, and grants to improve State and local \nplanning would be funded under the Senate's appropriations bill. Is \nhelp on the way? No. The administration is inflexible.\n  These are the special interests, I suppose, that the President was \ntalking about, these firemen, policemen, and emergency health personnel \nwho appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee last spring in \nsupport of more money for homeland security.\n  So here are these special interests--the firemen, the policemen, the \nemergency help personnel, the people from the hospitals, and the nurses \nwho came before our Senate Appropriations Committee and pleaded for \nmore money for homeland security. Are these the special interests the \nPresident is talking about?\n  Help is not on the way.\n  Talk is cheap. Homeland security is not cheap. By forcing the \nGovernment to operate on autopilot, the administration wants the Nation \nto fight terrorism at home with one hand tied behind our backs. The \nPresident needs to come out of the White House war room long enough to \nfocus on the situation at home. There is no need to go to Iraq, no need \nto go to the Middle East. The war on terrorism is being waged at home.\n  Is help on the way? No.\n  By December 31, 2.3 million unemployed Americans will be cut off from \nemployment assistance. As the days slip away, our Nation's farmers and \nranchers are left with no assistance in the face of the worst drought \nsince the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s. I remember those Dust Bowl days \nof the 1930s.\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\nI was beginning my last 4 years in high school in the 1930s. That is \nwhen mechanically sliced bread first came along. ``The greatest thing \nsince sliced bread,'' we hear. That goes back to the 1930s.\n  The promise made to America's senior citizens for an effective \nprescription drug benefit is left for another day. Help is not on the \nway.\n  A weakened economy and rising health care costs are the main reasons \nfor the growth in the number of the uninsured. When people lose their \njobs, they often lose their health coverage.\n  The number of unemployed men and women has increased by about 2 \nmillion since January 2001, so it should come as no surprise that the \nnumber of uninsured is also going up, up, up. Health insurance premiums \nalso increased by 12.7 percent during the past year, making coverage \nless affordable for employers and workers.\n  According to the Census Bureau, the number of people with employment-\nbased health coverage dropped in 2001 for the first time since 1993. \nWhat is the response to this situation from the Bush administration? \nWhat is the response?\n  What? I can't hear you. A deafening silence.\n  In 2001, the 30 top earning corporate executives took home $3.1 \nbillion, an average of $104 million. We are talking about the 30 top \nearning corporate executives. What did they do to earn their money?\n  They bilked shareholders. The 30 top-earning corporate executives \ntook home $3.123 billion, an average of $104 million.\n  Why be a U.S. Senator? Why be a Senator? Why be anything else? Become \na corporate executive. Not all of them are like that, but there are \nsome bad apples there.\n  Compared to the national median income in 2001, these 30 corporate \nexecutives earned the equivalent of 73,955 households. I would never \nbelieve it, but these 30 corporate executives earned the equivalent of \n73,955 households.\n  What is the response to this inequity from the Bush administration? \nWhat? A deafening silence. Have I lost my hearing? What has happened? \nHere I am, 85 years old, and I have no ear plugs in all these years. \nWhat? A deafening silence. Deafening.\n  Unfortunately for the American people, it is not a record on which to \nlook back with pride. It is a record that rejects compromise in favor \nof obstinance. It is a record that rejects progress in favor of \npartisanship. It is a record that puts politics ahead of the American \npeople.\n  As for the appropriations bills, the ranking member of the full \ncommittee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and I have \nurged the administration and the House Republican leadership to move \ncloser to the Senate levels in these bills. The 13 bills approved by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee total $768.1 billion. These bills \nare consistent with the committee allocation approved by a vote of 29-0 \nin June. The bills are consistent with the $768.1 billion allocation \nthat was approved by the Senate Budget Committee when it reported its \nbudget resolution last March. The bills are consistent with the $768.1 \nbillion allocation that was supported by 59 Members of the Senate when \nthe allocation was voted on during floor debate on the Defense \nAuthorization bill on June 20.\n  The Senate bills do not promote an explosive growth in spending. The \nbig growth in the bills is for the 13-percent hike proposed by the \nPresident for Defense and the 25-percent increase proposed by the \nPresident for homeland defense. The fight with the President is over \nthe Senate's desire to provide a 2.6 percent increase for domestic \nprograms, barely enough to cover inflation.\n  Clearly, a bipartisan effort in the Senate has produced good pieces \nof legislation. But progress on these bills is at an impasse because \nthe House leadership, under direction from the administration, will not \nmove beyond its arbitrary funding level of $759 billion. Just $9 \nbillion between us, $9 billion. Yet the administration will not move. \nOn the other hand, someone asked Larry Lindsey, the President's top \neconomic adviser, at the White House the other day: How much will the \nwar cost? Maybe $100 billion, maybe $200 billion. That is nothing.\n\n  That was his response. That is nothing.\n  Yet we have come to a standstill because of $9 billion that the \nAppropriations Committee in the House and the Appropriations Committee \nin the Senate believe is needed for domestic programs that benefit the \nNation's families, children, and veterans.\n  By its calculated machinations, the administration is turning its \nback to the needs of the American people at the exact moment where \nthose needs are reaching the breaking point.\n  This should not be about political winners or losers. This year, of \nall years, we should not play political games with the appropriations \nbills. But it seems as if the administration is more than willing to \nroll the dice with these important bills. And I fear that their gamble \nwill come up snake eyes.\n  Time and again, the President called on Congress to pass the Defense \nappropriations bill before the break for the election. I agree with the \nPresident. We should pass that bill. The Senate's bipartisan Defense \npackage is $1.2 billion above the House-passed level. The Senate, which \nsome claim is uninterested in defense and in the security of the \nNation, provided significantly more resources for our soldiers, \nsailors, and airmen than the House. This Senate has answered the call \nand responded to the needs of the military. Congress should not pinch \npennies at this time for the men and women in our Armed Forces, and I \ncontinue to urge the House to move closer to the Senate level.\n  We are making progress on the Defense package, and I hope that we can \nconference those bills soon. But, in order to do that, we need the \nHouse Republican leadership and the administration to be more flexible \nin their approach. Taking such a hard line on these appropriations \nbills threatens the security of the country forces Congress to gut \nvital domestic initiatives.\n  The atmosphere of the White House is a heady one. It can cause even \nthe most level-headed occupant to focus on what is important inside the \nWashington beltway and to forget what is important in the rest of the \nNation. I, for one, do not forget what is important to America. I \nrecognize, as do many Members of this body, the importance of these \nappropriations bills to the future progress and security of this \nNation. I recognize the importance of these appropriations bills to the \nfarmers, to the teachers and their students, and to the veterans. I \nrecognize the importance of these bills to future breakthroughs in \nmedical research and cancer treatments. I recognize the importance of \nthese bills to our Nation's energy independence and to our \ntransportation network. Without these bills, promises will remain \nunfulfilled, problems will remain unattended, and progress will be \nstalled.\n  Tomorrow, the House is expected to debate a second continuing \nresolution that would simply extend the first continuing resolution \nthrough Friday, October 11, and I will recommend that the Senate \napprove that resolution without controversy. But we should not continue \nto place the Government on autopilot. We should complete work on our \nappropriations bills.\n  I urge the administration and the House Republican leadership to join \nthis Senate in passing 13 responsible pieces of legislation that \nrespond to the needs of the Nation, at home and abroad. I urge that \narbitrary budget figures be left at the door and we complete our work \nbefore adjourning this session of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9820-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9820-S9823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPLETING THE SENATE'S BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as people can probably tell, we are getting \ndown to the end of this session. As such, there is a lot of business \nthat still needs to be completed. Many of my colleague have expressed \ntheir concerns that the Senate has not completed its business for this \nsession. We all have similar concerns. Every once in a while, I am \ncompelled to come to the floor and explain what is going on. There is \nnot a scorecard around here. There is not a program that anyone can \nfollow. So sometimes it is a little difficult to know what is really \nhappening in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\n  I know there is a little confusion among the American public about \nour progress because I go back to Wyoming almost every weekend. I go \nout on Friday because we usually do not have votes on Fridays. I travel \nto a different part of Wyoming each weekend and I return to Washington \non Sunday. One of the things I have learned in my 5\\1/2\\ years of being \na Senator from Wyoming is that it is really a big State with numerous \ncommunities. Each side of Wyoming is approximately 400 miles on a side, \none of those two big square States in the West. If they had not \ninvented the square, we would not be able to exist.\n  Wyoming has 267 towns and one-third of those towns do not have any \npopulation. I go to those towns, too, because there actually are people \nwho congregate at those places. There is a post office or a school or \nsome other public facility, or a ranch that people go to discuss \nissues.\n  For example, two weeks ago, I was invited to a pork barbecue--very \nunusual in Wyoming. We usually have beef barbecues, but this was a pork \nbarbecue at three ranches north of Lusk, Wyoming in Niobrara County. \nThe population of the entire county--and it is bigger than most eastern \nStates--is a little over 3,000 people. Most of the population lives in \none town, Lusk. The ranch where the barbecue was hosted is just three \nranches north near Lusk. It turned out that three ranches north is 61 \nmiles and then you are still not there. After driving 61 miles, you \nturn off the highway and drive back another 25 miles on dirt roads to \nget to the ranch where the barbecue was being held. During the last 25 \nmiles, I forded a crick to get to the house.\n  I do not know how many of my colleagues have recently forded a crick \nto get to some of their constituents. But when I got to the ranch, \nthere were approximately 200 people sitting on hay bales, listening to \na band, eating the barbecue, and talking about what was going to happen \nin their State legislative district.\n  Some of our State legislative districts in Wyoming are pretty long \nand wind around so they have enough people within the borders to \nqualify as a legislative district. Previously, the record for people \ntraveling to attend one of my meetings was no more 40 or 50 miles. That \nis how close neighbors live next to one another out in that part of the \ncountry. At this particular meeting, we set a new record. One of the \nfamilies had traveled to over 180 miles to attend my meeting. \nSurprisingly enough, they still live in that same house State \nlegislative district, which gives you an idea about the number of miles \nthat we have travel out in the West.\n  One of the things I have discovered during my weekly trips to Wyoming \nis what the people in my home State are really thinking and worrying \nabout. I am here to tell you they have two main worries right now.\n  One of my constituents' worries is the drought. Wyomingites are \nexperiencing the third year of a tragic drought. People have had to \nsell off their livestock. When all areas affected by this drought start \nto sell off livestock, it drives the prices down. It particularly \ndrives the prices down if there is a packer concentration that sets \nthose prices.\n  Packer concentration is another little problem we have in Wyoming, \nwhich coincides with our State's current drought. I am sure people in \nAmerica have not noticed their beef prices going down. No, their beef \nprices have been increasing. But the ranchers' prices have been \ndecreasing. It is an effect of the drought--with some phony economics \nbuilt in. Nevertheless, Wyomingites are very interested in the drought. \nMy constituents also are very interested in what is going to happen in \nIraq.\n\n  I was able to travel to New York on the floor of the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly when the President delivered his speech to the General \nAssembly. Each session, the President is allowed to appoint two people \nfrom the Congress to be United Nations delegates. President Bush \nappointed Senator Sarbanes and me to represent the Congress at the \nGeneral Assembly, giving us diplomatic status and rank. It is actually \nvery exciting. If the Ambassador is not there, we have the right to sit \nin the U.S. Ambassador's seat and cast votes on United Nations \nresolutions. We also have the opportunity to address the United \nNations.\n  It was interesting attending the session in which President Bush \ndelivered his speech to the United Nations General Assembly. When the \nPresident was first introduced, the people who applauded were primarily \nfrom the United States. It was a strange situation for the President of \nthe United States because they are used to having people stand and \napplaud. For the General Assembly attendees, it was not a big shock \nabout the lack of applause because we had just heard the Brazilian head \nof state's speech and he did not receive applause at the beginning or \nend of his speech.\n  President Bush gave his speech, giving an outstanding delivery. It \nwas fascinating to watch the delegates around the floor as their body \nlanguage demonstrated that they were loosening up. As all of you who \nwatched the speech know, when President Bush finished, he received \napplause--pretty unanimous applause. He made a point, and I have to \ntell you that after he finished, the other heads of state, as they gave \ntheir speeches, used the theme that the President used. They took Iraq \nto task and Iraq heard it. Because the heads of state have talked about \nIraq--and it is still talk--Iraqi officials have talked about allowing \ninspectors in the country.\n  However, we still have a long way to go. There is more important work \nthat we have to accomplish to show the resolve of the United States and \nthat we are going to disarm Saddam Hussein. If we cannot disarm \nHussein, we are going to replace him. In the next week, the Congress \nwill be debating a resolution concerning Iraq. It was introduced in a \nbipartisan manner in the Senate earlier today, and it is going to be \none of the really important debates of this body. It will take us at \nleast a few days to complete.\n  I have to tell you that after the President's speech was over, the \ndelegates had a little time to talk among themselves. We wandered \naround and met other delegates, and also overheard their conversations. \nI was very pleased at how well the delegates accepted the President's \ncomments about Iraq. Again, if the United Nations does its job, sticks \ntogether and does what all of the heads of states have been saying, we \ncan solve the Iraq problem and we can solve it within the realm of the \nUnited Nations. I am sure that would be everyone's preference.\n  While I am explaining what is going on in the Congress, I have to \nbacktrack a little bit because the Congress has had a little different \nsituation this year and we have numerous loose ends that remain out \nthere. We have heard about why the appropriations bills are stalled \nout. I want to take time to explain why that has happened. Homeland \nsecurity is stalled out, and I want to explain why that has happened. \nWe also have an energy conference that is out. We have the military \nconstruction and defense appropriations, that have already passed this \nbody and passed the House and are now being conferenced. We have \nterrorism insurance, which has passed both bodies and is being \nconferenced. We have the Patients' Bill of Rights, and other bills, for \nwhich conference committees have been selected.\n\n  We work through a committee process in the Congress. The committee \nprocess allows a select group of people who are intensely interested in \na particular policy area get together as a committee and they review a \nbill from all of the perspectives of all committee members. It is the \neasiest place to work a bill because groups can drop off where they \nhave common interests in a particular section of that bill and work out \ncompromises easier than can be done on the floor. So I would say about \n80 percent of the work that we do get done is during the committee \nprocess.\n  One of the reasons that people sometimes think the Senate is a \ndivisive body is that this is the room in which we debate the other 20 \npercent--the 20 percent that we did not work out in the committee.\n  One of the things you will notice is when we complete a bill, we \nagree on about 80 percent, which we had originally agreed upon during \nthe committee process. It makes us look a little divisive, but it is \npart of the philosophy that keeps the legislative process moving. The \ncommittee process gets things done in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\n  This year, we debated the energy bill for approximately 8 weeks. It \ndid not go through committee. You were able to see the entire bill \ncrafted and debated on the Senate floor without the flexibility found \nduring the committee process. This occurred because the Senate Energy \nCommittee was stopped from working on its version of the energy bill. \nThere was some bipartisan agreement on the energy bill during the \ncommittee process, and then the committee was told to stop working on \nit. Consequently, it took us a long time to work through the energy \nbill on the Senate floor, and I do not think it is a bill that, because \nof the complexities of doing it with 100 votes, really reflected what \ncould have been accomplished in committee.\n  We worked on prescription drugs, which is one of the most critical \nneeds for seniors in this country. What happened on prescription drugs? \nIt did not come out of committee. Normally the Senate Finance \nCommittee, which has an extensive expertise on health care, Medicare, \nand Social Security, handles those issues. But the committee was not \nable to handle it. The Senate voted on three different prescription \ndrug bills this year, which took many weeks of debate and time to \ndiscuss each one. None of them had enough votes to pass the \nparliamentary requirements to move forward in the Senate, even though \none of them was a tripartisan bill.\n  There is another unique thing that has happened this year in the \nSenate. We are not operating with a budget. The last budget agreement \nended yesterday. It presents some real complications for us to be able \nto get our work done. It presents even bigger complications for \nmaintaining any kind of a balanced budget--or as close as possible--\nwhen the economy is down and a war is occurring. We need a budget, but \nwe do not currently have a budget.\n  Another thing that has happened is when bills come to the Senate \nfloor, usually each side gets to introduce some amendments. Each side \nis allowed to introduce and vote on their own amendments. Lately, what \nwe have been having is a full tree. You will hear that comment around \nhere. I need to better explain this terminology. The full tree means \nthat one side puts in all the amendments that can be debated, so the \nother side is blocked from being able to offer any amendments. There \nwere some promises in June that was not going to happen. Promises have \nnot been kept. Once we finally were given the opportunity to put in an \namendment, we have not had an opportunity to vote on it.\n  I mentioned earlier the extreme drought that is occurring in Wyoming. \nThroughout the West, we are having forest fires. The fiscal year 2003 \nInterior appropriations bill has an amendment that would provide for a \ndemonstration project to show what a healthy forest could be. It does \nnot do much, but it would allow for some demonstrations to show what \ncould be done in our forests to have the kind of forests everyone \nenvisions. There needs to be a good debate on what we envision as a \nhealthy forest. In the meantime, of course, the fires rage on and we \nare not allowed to vote on the healthy forest demonstration project.\n  The fire demonstration project is extremely critical to the West. \nAbout 8 million acres have burned out thus far. For people who do not \ndeal a lot with acres, it really does not mean much to them. An acre is \nabout the size of a football field. But that is hard to relate to 8 \nmillion acres. It is the equivalent of a four-mile-wide strip from \nWashington, DC, to Los Angeles that has been burned off this year. This \nyear's fires have caused in excess of 25 deaths, and untold houses \nbeing burned to the ground. Those people who did not have their homes \nburned to the ground are now facing blackened stubble.\n  Something needs to be done about it. There are some preventive \nactions we can take. Outside Yellowstone Park, there is a pine beetle \nforest, which means pine beetles have gotten into the trees and girdled \nthem. The beetles cut off all the nutrition to trees, and the trees \ndie. The first year they are dead, they have rusty pine needles. Pine \nneedles burn extremely well. After the first year, you have a dead \nstanding tree. Dead trees burn pretty well, too. After that, the trees \nfall over, deteriorate, and become part of the undergrowth and create \nfurther problems.\n  There are things we could be doing to prevent these fires. Good \nstewardship of our forests would increase habitat for animals and \nprovide more safety. We cannot do much, but we could do the worst first \nby being allowed to vote on an amendment to address wildfire \nsuppression. The FY 2003 Interior appropriations bill has languished \nhere for approximately five weeks. During the past month, we have \ndebated the Interior appropriations bill in the mornings. In the \nafternoon, we have debated the homeland security bill. Again, after \ngetting through a loaded amendment tree, we wind up in a situation \nwhere we cannot get a vote on the President's version of the homeland \nsecurity bill. I think it is very discourteous to the President to not \nbe allowed an opportunity to have a vote on his version of the homeland \nsecurity bill. Why not? I suspect it would pass the same as the fire \namendment.\n  It is a definite dilemma. Do we let the President's homeland security \nversion of the bill pass, or do we just stifle it? If it gets stifled, \nnothing can happen on this policy issue. We have some work to do. It is \ntime we did it. It could be done by allowing some votes on some key \npolicy issues.\n  There has always been cooperation in the Senate for the 5\\1/2\\ years \nI have been here in allowing people to have a vote on their amendments. \nSometimes we did some really unique parliamentary procedures in that we \nlet two versions be voted on side by side, even though one was an \namendment to the other. During the time the Republicans were in the \nmajority, the minority was allowed votes on their bills, but we are now \nnot getting votes on our bills. There is some point at which you have \nto say: if we cannot vote on it, we will stop the process until we do \nget a vote. The easy way to solve that is to let us have a vote on this \nimportant healthy forest demonstration project and the President's \nversion of the homeland security bill.\n  Also, let us have a vote on the President's homeland security. The \nsignificant difference in the versions is whether we are going to take \naway the right of the President to address ceratin personnel issues and \nmake him subject, during emergencies, to stacks of regulations. Should \nthe President have to go by huge stacks of regulations to make \nmanagement decisions in a time of crisis while maintaining a secure \nhomeland?\n  There is going to be a lot of frustration in the next few days \nbecause there is a great need to get the Senate's work done. We are the \nones charged with getting the appropriations bills done. We need to \ncomplete the FY 2003 appropriations process. We should start that \nprocess with the budget so that we have a road map of what we are \ndoing, and then fill in the blanks on the appropriations while staying \nwithin a balanced budget.\n  When I first arrived here in the Senate, we had a huge controversy. \nThe very first thing I debated was the balanced budget constitutional \namendment. People who remember 5\\1/2\\ years ago will remember that a \nconstitutional amendment has a much higher criteria for passing than \nany other bill. It was defeated by one vote. The reason was defeated by \none vote was because everybody here said we can balance the budget, and \nthose who opposed the amendment said we can balance the budget without \na balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  We did balance the budget for a while. We did it. I am very proud of \nit. While we were balancing the budget, the economy went up. When we \nstopped balancing the budget, the Congress said there were surpluses \navailable to spend beyond what was allocated for before, then economy \nstarted down. Having a balanced budget gives importance to the economy \nof this country. It gives people more reliance on what we are doing, \nand more confidence in what we are doing. At the moment, we are not \ninstilling a lot of confidence.\n  Granted, there is a war going on, and a war affects the budget. And \nit should.\n  Earlier, Senator Hollings had some charts when he was describing the \namount of the national debt. I knew a fellow named Steve Tarver who \nused to live in Gillette. He used to get a hold of me on a regular \nbasis and ask: How much is the national debt? If we are paying down the \nnational debt, how come the interest isn't going down? It is because of \nphony accounting.\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\n  We have gotten on the corporations for their accounting standards. \nNow it is time for us to get on our own selves for our accounting \nmethods. For example, the Social Security trust fund, it neither funds \nnor trusts, and we should be taking care of it.\n  We could pay the debt down to nothing over a 30-year period. I have \nhad charts on the floor to show how that could be done. There are \nemergencies that come up. The 30 years, incidentally, corresponds with \nthe time of a house mortgage. We buy houses, and sometimes we pass \nthose on to our descendants. Sometimes that has a remaining bill with \nit, and they keep paying them down.\n  That is what we are doing with the country. We could take the \nnational debt and pay it off over a 30-year period, where if we did not \nspend the difference on the interest payment, when we reduced it, on \nother things, we could pay off more of the principal. So then it would \nbe a relatively small payment. It is a huge payment, using the interest \nwe are paying now, which we are not able to spend on anything else at a \nfuture date. As far as the war is concerned, that would be a second \nmortgage on the house with a much shorter term.\n  So there is not any excuse for us not to be paying down the national \ndebt in good times, and taking out second mortgages in bad times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair in \nletting me expound on this a little bit. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been interesting, today, to listen \nto some of the discussion on the floor of the Senate about the economy. \nThe reason it has been interesting is there is not a great deal of \ndiscussion these days about the economy. Most of the discussion here in \nCongress especially, and on the front pages of America's newspapers, \nhas been about the subject of Iraq and national security.\n  That is important. There is no question about that. The issues of \nservice, duty, honor, patriotism, national security--all of those \nissues are deadly serious business for our country. When we talk about \nsending America's sons and daughters to war, that is deadly serious \nbusiness, and the Constitution has something to say about it. The \nConstitution provides that the Congress shall make that decision.\n  Let me just say, on these issues--I am going to speak about the \neconomy, but I have been troubled lately by some of the things I have \nread about national security, especially about a new doctrine that is \nbeing developed, or has been developed, and announced by some, talking \nabout preemptive strikes--that our country has a right to preemptively \nstrike a potential adversary. That has never been this country's \napproach to dealing with international affairs.\n  I think about this notion of preemptive strikes, and I think about \nhow we might feel, as a country, if some other countries in the world \nsaid to us: Oh, by the way, we have a new policy. Our policy is: \npreemptive strikes on neighboring countries that we worry might very \nwell threaten our national security interests.\n  We need to have a long, thoughtful, and sober discussion about that \nkind of policy change. And I expect we will do that.\n  First, however, we will debate a resolution on Iraq here in the \nSenate beginning this week. Again, as I indicated, that is a very \nserious business. My hope is that our country will speak with one voice \non these issues, we will work through it, and then speak with one \nvoice. And my hope is that voice will be a voice that says: It is best \nalways, to the extent we can, especially dealing with a problem like \nthis, to confront the country of Iraq with, if necessary, coercive and \nby-force inspections in Iraq, to rid that country of any weapons of \nmass destruction they have, and do so with coalition partners, other \ncountries around the world, that are willing to, and that should, \nassume that burden with us. But that is for another time, and I will \nspeak another day on that subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9823-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9823-S9825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me talk, just for a moment, about the \neconomy.\n  I have listened to some of the discussion, and I know there is a \ntendency to talk about the economy and to talk about, the other side is \nto blame. It is always the other side that is to blame. It does not \nmatter which side you are on, you are just pointing in the opposite \ndirection. And I suppose there is some blame that can be availed to \nvirtually everyone in Government for our problems with respect to the \nAmerican economy.\n  I worry, however, there is not very much attention being paid to the \neconomy. Today's speeches in the Senate represent a departure because \nin most cases nobody wants to talk about the economy these days.\n  We have very serious, relentless, difficult problems in the American \neconomy. Just take a look at what is going on in the economy. More \npeople are out of work. More people are losing their jobs. More people \nare losing money in their 401(k) accounts. The stock market is behaving \nlike a yo-yo.\n  The big budget surpluses that we were told last year would last \nforever--most of us did not believe that, but that is what we were \ntold: These budget surpluses will last for as long as you can count, so \nplan on the next 10 years of having consistent surpluses, and let's \nspend it now in the form of tax cuts--well, those surpluses have now \nturned into deficits, and big deficits. Big surpluses have turned into \nbig deficits.\n  On top of all that, we have corporate scandals that have developed \nand been unearthed in recent months in this country that shake the \nconfidence of the American people in this economy of ours. I will talk \njust a bit more about that in a while.\n  But I am not here to say the President is solely to blame for what is \ngoing on. I do wish he would provide more leadership at this moment and \nsay, yes, the economy is in trouble, instead of having Larry Lindsey \ntrot out here and say: The fundamentals are sound. Let's hang in here. \nDon't worry about it.\n  This economy is in significant difficulty. I think it is time for us \nto recognize that. It is time for us to have an economic summit with \nthe President, invite the best minds in this country to come together, \nhave the executive branch, the President, and the legislative branch \nsit down together and evaluate: What do we do about a fiscal policy \nthat does not add up?\n  It is true, as my friend from Wyoming just said, we do not have a \nbudget this year. Why don't we have a budget? We have a fiscal policy \nthat does not add up. There isn't anybody in this Chamber who can make \nsense of this fiscal policy, and they know it. It does not add up. This \nfiscal policy was a policy developed a year and a half ago, in which we \nwere told: We will have surpluses as far as the eye can see, so let's \nhave a $1.7 trillion tax cut over 10 years, and then hold our hands \nover our eyes and think things will turn out just fine. Well, they have \nnot turned out just fine.\n  I think it is incumbent on us, on behalf of the interests of the \nAmerican people, to sit at the same table and decide we are all \nconstituents of the same interest, and that interest is the long-term \neconomic progress and opportunity here in the United States.\n  We need an economy that grows. There is no social program we have \nworked on in this country--none--that is as important as a good job \nthat pays well. There is no program we work on that is as important to \nthe American people as a good job that pays well because that makes \nvirtually everything else possible. If we do not have an economy that \ngrows and expands and provides opportunity, then we have some \nsignificant future trouble.\n\n  Let me talk, just a little, about what it means when our economy \nisn't doing well. I spent time this morning at a hearing. The airline \nindustry came in. We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee. The \nairline industry lost $7 billion last year--$7 billion.\n  We have carriers that have filed for bankruptcy; more probably will. \nAnd they say: Look, we have a huge problem. Fewer people are flying. \nSome\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nworry about safety. Some are concerned about the hassle factor at \nairports. The economy is in trouble, so fewer people get on airplanes.\n  So you have an industry in trouble. That is just one industry. And \nthat was just this morning. Nonetheless, it is indicative of what is \nhappening in our economy. And the result is, when you have a soft \neconomy, and the kind of trouble we are heading towards, and that we \nhave already experienced, it means things, such as health care--the \nkind of health care that families need and expect--is not affordable, \nnot available. It means we do not deal with the education problems we \nare supposed to be dealing with.\n  Leave No Child Behind--that was a slogan last year, and a piece of \nlegislation passed last year. But then the proposal comes out of the \nbudget, and it leaves all kinds of kids behind because the money does \nnot exist to do it because the fiscal policy is out of whack.\n  We have talked about the corporate scandals that undermine confidence \nin this economy, and we passed a piece of legislation dealing with it. \nBut it is just one piece of legislation, and it falls short of what is \nnecessary.\n  Also, if you are not disgusted about these corporate scandals, then \nthere is something fundamentally wrong.\n  Tyco Corporation. The CEO of Tyco has since been arrested. He has a \n$6,000 gold and burgundy, floral patterned shower curtain, paid for by \nhis company--a $6,000 shower curtain.\n  Did anybody in this Chamber ever see a $6,000 shower curtain? How \nabout a $17,000 toilet kit, a traveling toilet kit, or a $445 pin \ncushion; has anybody ever seen that in their life?\n  There are stories about Tyco having paid $15,000 in corporate money \nfor an umbrella stand. People ask: How could you spend $15,000 for an \numbrella stand? The decorator said this was an 1840s antique stand in \nthe shape of a 3-foot high poodle. That is how you spend that kind of \nmoney for an umbrella stand.\n  Staying with Tyco one more time: A birthday party paid for with \ncorporate funds, it cost $1 million. They are fleecing investors. The \nguests come into the pool area--this is related by the person who \narranged the birthday party. They actually transported people to Europe \nfor the birthday party of the wife of the CEO of the corporation using \ncorporate funds. The band was playing. There was a big ice sculpture of \nDavid, lots of shellfish and caviar at his feet; a waiter pouring Stoli \nvodka into the statue's back so that it came out his private parts into \na crystal glass.\n  I don't know. I grew up in a small town. Maybe it is just me that \ndoesn't understand this, or maybe this is nuts. Maybe it is just nuts. \nBut there is story after story after story of avarice and greed in \nboard rooms, in executive suites.\n  Here is a story about the Securities and Exchange Commission. It says \nthe SEC now says it is unlikely they will pursue Enron's board of \ndirectors.\n  The board of directors of Enron had a professor do a study of what \nwas going on inside the company. The board of directors' own study said \nwhat was happening inside Enron ``is appalling.'' Here is the SEC \nsaying: We are not going to worry about these board of directors of \nEnron. We are not doing an inquiry into their responsibility. That is a \nlow priority.\n  A former SEC chief accountant says this:\n\n       If you don't go after this board, you are telling the \n     public you ain't ever going after any board.\n\n  What is the SEC doing? Are they not reading this stuff? Are they just \nmissing what is going on in this country? What about the corporate \nresponsibility bill we passed some while ago? I tried to offer an \namendment. A couple people here blocked it for 3 days so the bill \npassed without it. Let me describe it and why there is unfinished \nbusiness dealing with the economy with respect to corporate scandals.\n  Of the 25 largest bankruptcies in America, 208 corporate executives \ntook out $3.3 billion prior to the bankruptcies. As the corporations \nwere run into the ground, the people at the top filled their pockets \nwith gold, and the investors lost their shirts. We couldn't do a thing \nabout it because I couldn't offer the amendment.\n  There was unfinished business, and we should address it here in this \nCongress.\n  Here is a story about the Treasury Department, the IRS. It says they \nare seeking now quick settlements in pending tax shelter probes. The \nIRS is seeking quick settlements in many of its tax shelter cases \nraising questions about how effective its crackdown on tax avoidance \nschemes will be. What does this mean? It means that Treasury has been \nconcerned--and I have been, certainly--about these aggressive tax \nschemes to avoid paying taxes.\n\n  Instead of going after them, what are they going to do? They will do \nquick settlements. They are going to move to settle these cases very \nquickly. And what is that going to do to discourage additional \naggressive tax schemes? Nothing, unfortunately.\n  We have serious problems. I am talking about corporate \nresponsibility, but I talked about our fiscal policy that doesn't add \nup. I know we could just stand here and point fingers back and forth. \nThat doesn't make any sense. We all serve the same interests.\n  Ogden Nash wrote a poem talking about a guy who drank too much and a \nwoman who nagged.\n  She scolds because he drinks, she thinks. He drinks because she \nscolds, he thinks. And neither will admit what is true: He is a drunk; \nshe is a shrew.\n  Well, the fact is, we both have some responsibility on this area of \nthe American economy and what to do about it. I say to the President--\nnot in the way of pointing fingers--we have to start dealing with this. \nWe can't ignore it. We can't pretend a fiscal policy that added up to, \nor we thought added up 18 months ago, is a fiscal policy that works \ntoday. We have been through a recession. Now we are in a weak economy. \nBig budget surpluses have now become big budget deficits. We were hit \nwith terrible terrorist attacks on 9/11. We went through corporate \nscandals which undermined confidence in the American economy.\n  Let's not pretend that things are fine. They are not fine. A week \nfrom this Friday, we will do an economic forum in the Russell Building \nCaucus Room. I am hoping we can get a debate going. I will invite both \nsides. We will do it through the Democratic Policy Committee. I want to \nhear from every side. If somebody thinks this fiscal policy is great, \ngood, come and defend it.\n  I happen to think we need some significant changes. I will be there \nto talk about it. But let's get some people together to talk about what \nis happening and think through what we can do about it.\n  There is an old saying when everybody in the room is thinking the \nsame thing, nobody is thinking very much. That is true here. It is true \nat the White House. If they think this economy is great, they are \nwrong. They are not thinking very much.\n  We need a fiscal policy that relates to these days. When we were \nattacked on September 11, the President said we will embark on a war on \nterrorism. I supported that. Then he said we need $45 billion more for \ndefense this year. I supported that. We need nearly $30 billion more \nfor homeland security this year. I supported that.\n  The question is, Where is the money coming from? Who is going to pay \nfor it, when and how? My point is we had better decide, the President \nand the Congress, to pay attention to this economy and fix the problems \nthat exist and do it now. We don't have a choice.\n  Our responsibility is to fix what is wrong. This deals with virtually \neverything we have talked about all of this year: Health care, \neducation, pensions, corporate governance, all of it.\n  My colleague said we haven't even passed a budget. He is right about \nthat. It is because none of it adds up. Everybody knows it doesn't add \nup.\n\n  John Adams used to write letters to Abigail. In the book McCullough \nwrote about John Adams, he chronicled the discussions John had with \nAbigail in those letters. He would ask his wife: Where is the \nleadership? Where will the leadership come from as we try to put this \ncountry together? There is only us: Washington, Jefferson, Madison, \nMason, Franklin, myself.\n  Of course, ``only us'' in restrospect is some of the greatest talent \never gathered in the history of the earth. They put a country together.\n  But it is fair to ask again now, especially given the problems and \nchallenges we face, where is the leadership? I hope next Friday we can \nbegin a discussion and a debate that leads to an\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\neconomic summit in which we try to put together an economic policy that \nmoves the country forward. Ignoring the problems is not in our best \ninterest. It is not going to solve the country's problems.\n  We face some significant challenges in national security dealing with \nthe war on terrorism, dealing with Iraq, and a range of other issues. I \nrespect that. But that ought not allow us to take a pass on the \neconomy. It ought not allow the President to not want to talk about the \neconomy. We have very serious problems with the economy, and it is long \npast time that we get about the business of working together to solve \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise with the purpose of making a \nunanimous consent request, which I will make at the end of my remarks, \nthe remarks of my colleague from Missouri, and the remarks of my \ncolleague from Arkansas. The unanimous consent request will be to take \nup and pass S. 1724, the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of \n2001. This bill was reported by the Senate Finance Committee. This \nlegislation, introduced by Senator Bond and Senator Breaux, would give \nStates the option of covering pregnant women in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program--the CHIP program--for the full range of pre \nand postpartum care.\n  This legislation, which as I indicated, was passed by the Finance \nCommittee, was passed by unanimous consent. It was included in S. 1016, \nwhich was the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2001, which I \nintroduced earlier with Senators Lugar, McCain, Corzine, Lincoln, \nChafee, Miller, and Landrieu. It provides continuous health care for \nchildren throughout the first and the most fragile year of their life.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. is 21st in the \nworld in infant mortality. We are 26th in the world in maternal \nmortality. For a nation as wealthy as ours, this is an unacceptable \ncircumstance.\n  The sad thing is that we know exactly how to fix this problem. \nNumerous studies over the years indicate that prenatal care reduces \ninfant mortality and maternal mortality and reduces the number of low-\nbirthweight babies. According to the American Medical Association:\n\n       Babies born to women who do not receive prenatal care are 4 \n     times more likely to die before their first birthday.\n\n  Current law creates some unintended consequences that this bill tries \nto correct. Under the Children's Health Insurance Program, women under \nthe age of 19--that is, until they complete their 18th year--are \ncovered for pregnancy-related services, but once they reach the age of \n19, they are no longer covered. This legislation will eliminate that \nproblem by allowing States to cover pregnant women through CHIP, \nregardless of their age.\n  This also eliminates the unfortunate separation between pregnant \nwomen and infants that has been created as a result of the CHIP \nprogram, as it currently is administered.\n  This is, of course, contrary to longstanding Federal and medical \npolicy through programs such as Medicaid and the WIC Program. There is \na report by the Council of Economic Advisors entitled ``The First Three \nYears: Investments That Pay.'' That report states:\n\n       Poor habits or inefficient health care during pregnancy can \n     inhibit a child's growth, development, and well-being. Many \n     of these effects last a lifetime. . . .\n\n  The Washington Business Group on Health has found in its report \nentitled ``Business, Babies, and the Bottom Line'' that more than $6 in \nneonatal intensive care costs could be saved for every single dollar \nspent on prenatal care and low-birthweight babies.\n  Furthermore, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality report \nhas found that 4 of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the \nhospital are related to the care of infants with complications, such as \nrespiratory distress, prematurity, heart defects, and lack of oxygen. \nAll of these conditions can be improved--not totally eliminated but \nimproved--through quality prenatal care.\n  Some might argue this legislation is unnecessary because the \nadministration is proceeding with a regulation that goes into effect \ntoday, in fact, to allow States to cover some prenatal care through \nCHIP by allowing the insurance of the unborn child.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about the administration's plan \nto cover the fetus and not to cover women through pregnancy.\n  Leaving the woman out of this equation is completely contrary to the \nclinical guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which say the \nwoman and the unborn child need to be treated together. You cannot \nperform fetal surgery without thinking about the consequences for the \nmother. You cannot prescribe unlimited prescription drugs to a pregnant \nwoman without considering the consequences to the development of the \nfetus.\n  Moreover, if you only are covering the fetus, as this rule would, \nthis eliminates important aspects of coverage for women during all the \nstages of birth; that is pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care.\n  This is exactly what the administration rule proposes to do. \nAccording to today's published rule, pregnant women would not be \ncovered during their pregnancy for cancer, medical emergencies, broken \nbones, or mental illness. Even lifesaving surgery for a mother would \nappear to be denied coverage.\n  Further, during delivery, coverage for epidurals is a State option \nand is justified only if the health of the child is affected. On the \nother hand, anesthesia is covered for C-sections. The rule would \nwrongly push women and providers toward providing C-sections to ensure \ncoverage.\n  Finally, during the postpartum period, women would be denied all \nhealth coverage from the moment the child is born. Important care and \ntreatment that includes, but is not limited to, the treatment for \nhemorrhage, infection, episiotomy repair, C-section repair, family \nplanning counseling, treatment of complications after delivery, and \npostpartum depression would not be covered under the rule proposed by \nthe administration.\n  I repeat, our country ranks 26th in the world in maternal mortality. \nWe need to do better than this. We can do better than this for our \nNation's mothers. However, let there be no mistake, this bill is also \nabout children's health. Senator Bond's bill is appropriately named the \nMothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act for a reason. We all know the \nimportance of an infant's first year of life. Senator Bond's \nlegislation, as amended by the Finance Committee, provides 12-month \ncontinuous coverage for children after they are born. Again, the United \nStates ranks 21st in the world in infant mortality, and this provision \nwill help solve that problem.\n  In sharp contrast, the rule that has been issued today provides an \noption for 12 months continuous enrollment to States, but makes the \ntime retroactive to the period in the womb. Therefore, if 9 months of \npregnancy are covered, the child would lose coverage in the third month \nafter birth. Potentially lost would be a number of important well-baby \nvisits, immunizations, and access to the pediatric caregiver.\n  This legislation, which was introduced by Senator Bond, has a large \nnumber of bipartisan cosponsors, including Senators Daschle and Lott. \nIt should be passed into law as soon as possible. It did pass the \nFinance Committee unanimously.\n  Finally, Secretary Thompson is in very strong support of the passage \nof S. 724, and he has said so publicly. Also in a letter to me that is \ndated April 12 of this year, he wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\n\n       Prenatal care for women and their babies is a crucial part \n     of medical care. These services can be a vital, lifelong \n     determinant of health, and we should do everything we can to \n     make this care available for all pregnant women. It is one of \n     the most important investments we can make for the long-term \n     good health of our Nation. . . .I also support legislation to \n     expand CHIP to cover pregnant women.\n\n  That is exactly what we have. In addition, Secretary Thompson was \nquoted in the Washington Post on September 28 as saying in relation to \ntoday's ``unborn child'' coverage rule:\n\n       There is no abortion issue as far as I'm concerned.\n\n  If this is the case, then we should pass this legislation immediately \nto ensure States have the option of covering pregnant women with the \nfull range of care. It is a much simpler and better way to go, both for \nthe health of mothers and the health of children. It is also free from \nthe very real problem in this Congress of abortion politics.\n  Once again, this legislation has strong bipartisan support. I will, \nafter my colleagues speak, ask to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Thompson be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       The Secretary of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for sharing your views on \n     our new proposal to expand health care coverage for low-\n     income pregnant women under the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP). I believe it is not only \n     appropriate, but indeed, medically necessary that our \n     approach to child health care include the prenatal stage.\n       Prenatal care for women and their babies is a crucial part \n     of medical care. These services can be a vital, life-long \n     determinant of health, and we should do everything we can to \n     make this care available for all pregnant women. It is one of \n     the most important investments we can make for the long-term \n     good health of our nation.\n       Our regulation would enable states to make use of funding \n     already available under SCHIP to provide prenatal care for \n     more low-income pregnant women and their babies. The proposed \n     regulation, published in the Federal Register March 5, would \n     clarify the definition of ``child'' under the SCHIP program. \n     At present, SCHIP allows states to provide health care \n     coverage to targeted low-income children under age 19. States \n     may further limit their coverage to age groups within that \n     range. The new regulation would clarify that states may \n     include coverage for children from conception to age 19, \n     enabling SCHIP coverage to include prenatal and delivery care \n     to ensure the birth of healthy infants.\n       Although Medicaid currently provides coverage for prenatal \n     care for some women with low incomes, implementing this new \n     regulation will allow states to offer such coverage to \n     additional women. States would not be required to go through \n     the section 1115 waiver process to expand coverage for \n     prenatal care.\n       By explicitly recognizing in our SCHIP regulations the \n     health needs of children before birth, we can help states \n     provide vital prenatal health care. I believe our approach is \n     entirely appropriate to serve these health purposes. It has \n     been an option for states in their Medicaid programs in the \n     past and it should be made an option for states in their \n     SCHIP program now. As I testified recently at a hearing held \n     by the Health Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee, I also support legislation to expand SCHIP to \n     cover pregnant women. However, because legislation has not \n     moved and because of the importance of prenatal care, I felt \n     it was important to take this action.\n       I know we share the same commitment to achieving the goal \n     of expanding health insurance coverage in order to reduce the \n     number of uninsured.\n       A similar letter is being sent to the cosigners of your \n     letter. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions \n     or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I apologized \nto him earlier today. We tried to get him in the lineup so we could \nmove on this important measure, and we did not get it done.\n  I rise today in very strong support of the request he is going to \nmake because I share with him and my other colleagues on the floor the \nfact that S. 724, the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of \n2001, is vitally important for the health care of children and pregnant \nwomen in America.\n  As one who spent a good deal of time concerned about the care of \nchildren, particularly health care in the very earliest years, I \nbelieve this is one of the most important steps we can take. I was one \nof the original sponsors of S. 724. The legislation's simple goal is to \nmake sure more pregnant women and more children are covered by health \ninsurance so they get a good start for the child and have access to \nhealth care services they need to make sure they are healthy.\n  This simply gives the States the option and flexibility to cover low-\nincome pregnant women in the States Children Health Insurance Program, \nor S-CHIP, as I call it, for the full range of prenatal, delivery, and \npostpartum care. This bill would complement the administration's final \nrule that allows States to expand S-CHIP coverage to fetuses by \ncovering additional vital health care services for the pregnant mother \nthe rule would not cover.\n  Under current law, S-CHIP currently permits States to cover eligible \nbabies once they are born, but coverage is not available to women when \nthey are pregnant. This creates the perverse situation in which a State \ncan provide health care for a child the day she is born, but cannot \nprovide the critical prenatal care, both to the child and the mother's \nhealth, during the prior 9-month period. It just absolutely makes no \nsense. Prenatal care is essential for both the mother's health and the \nbaby's health. No health care program that ignores this fact can fully \naddress the issue of children's health care.\n  This bill will eliminate the illogical disconnect that currently \nexists between pregnant women and babies in the S-CHIP program.\n  This bill, as I believe has already been indicated by my colleague, \nhas strong bipartisan support in the Senate and the House. It has the \nendorsement of the National Governors' Association and 25 other \nnational organizations, including the March of Dimes, the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, and the Catholic Health Association. One normally \nspeaks of the usual suspects backing a bill. In this case, the usual \nstrong proponents are backing the bill. I can think of no stronger \ngroup to have behind this measure. I also note, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, Secretary Thompson, strongly supports passage of \nthe legislation.\n  The need is great. On any given day, almost 9 million children and \n400,000 pregnant women do not have health insurance coverage. For many \nof these women and children, they or their families simply cannot \nafford insurance. Many others are actually eligible for a public \nprogram like Medicaid or S-CHIP, but they do not know they are eligible \nand are not signed up.\n  Lack of health insurance can lead to numerous health problems, both \nfor children and for pregnant women.\n  A pregnant mother without health coverage is much less likely to \nreceive the health care services she needs to ensure the child is \nhealthy, happy, and fully able to learn and grow. All women need \nprenatal care. Young and old, first baby or fifth, all mothers benefit \nfrom regular care during pregnancy.\n  Studies have shown that an uninsured pregnant woman is much less \nlikely to get critical prenatal care that reduces the risk of health \nproblems for both the woman and the child. Babies whose mothers receive \nno prenatal care or late prenatal care are at risk for many of the \nhealth problems, including birth defects, premature births, and low \nbirth rate, a tragedy that we ought to devote every effort to \neliminate.\n  We know prenatal care improves both birth outcomes and can save \nmoney. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, infants \nborn to mothers who receive no prenatal care or late prenatal care are \nnearly twice as likely to be low birth weight, and low birth weight in \npre-term births is one of the most expensive reasons for a hospital \nstay in the United States, with hospital charges averaging $50,000, an \nespecially serious issue for families without health insurance.\n  A report by the IOM entitled ``Health Is A Family Matter'' notes:\n\n       Infants of uninsured women are more likely to die than are \n     those of insured women.\n\n  In one region of West Virginia, the fetal death rate dropped 35.4 to \n7 for\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\n1,000 live births after the introduction of the prenatal care for the \nuninsured. Let me reemphasize that--35 fetal deaths for 1,000 live \nbirths. When they gave insurance and prenatal care, it dropped to 7, a \nreduction of 80 percent.\n  In addition to ensuring better health outcomes, research and State \nexperience suggest that covering pregnant women is a highly successful \noutreach mechanism for enrolling children. I thank Senator Bingaman \nfrom New Mexico for his leadership in the Finance Committee on this \nvital health care issue. This bill passed the Finance Committee in the \nbeginning of August by unanimous consent, with additional language to \nprovide children continuous coverage through the first and most \ncritical year of life. I commend him for that provision. It makes a \nstrong bill even stronger.\n  The studies have shown time and again that babies born to mothers \nreceiving late or no prenatal care are more likely to face \ncomplications which result in hospitalization, expensive medical \ntreatment, and ultimately increased costs to public programs. We must \nclose the gap in coverage between pregnant mothers and their children \nto improve the health of both and to address more fully the issue of \nchildren's health care.\n  It can be said this is a sound matter of economics, to reduce the \ncosts, but none of us would deny that the far greater benefits are the \nbenefits of healthy children. Numbers cannot be put on them. In this \ninstance, this is a saving: Less money to care for needy children. But \nthe most important benefit is less needy children, less harm to the \nchildren, less serious conditions for the children, and better \nfamilies, better citizens in the future.\n  This is crucial legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to join in \nsupport so we can pass this bill. I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor his leadership, and I hope we will be able to get this bill done \nbefore we leave.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, today I proudly rise with my Senate \ncolleagues from New Mexico and Missouri, Senator Bingaman and Senator \nBond, to speak about the importance of passing S. 724, the Mothers and \nNewborns Health Insurance Act.\n  I say to both Senators, I am extremely proud of the enthusiasm and \ncompassion with which they come to this issue, neither one of them \nhaving experienced pregnancy themselves, but more importantly I am \nproud of the fact they have recognized the importance of this issue for \nmothers and children across our great Nation.\n  As Senator Bond has mentioned, we must pass this bill as soon as \npossible, and certainly before we adjourn this Senate.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which we passed unanimously in the \nFinance Committee this summer, gives States the option of covering \npregnant women in the State children's health insurance program, their \nCHIP program. Most importantly, the bill allows coverage for postpartum \ncare and treatment of any complications that might arise for women due \nto pregnancy.\n  It is absolutely inexcusable the numbers that Senator Bingaman \npresents to us about infant mortality and maternal mortality of women \nin this great country of ours, at a time when we are ahead of every \nother nation in every other arena and yet we look at those numbers. To \nme, I am ashamed of that. I am ashamed we have not taken the course of \naction that could help us prove to the rest of the world that we truly \ndo value life in this country, and that we want to do all we possibly \ncan to ensure the healthy delivery of children in this country, as well \nas the health of their mothers.\n  Myself having given birth to twins 6 years ago, I can personally \nattest to the importance of prenatal care. Because I did have good \nprenatal care, I was able to work up until several weeks before I \ndelivered my children. I was blessed with two healthy boys and a \nrelatively trouble-free pregnancy and delivery. Both the boys and I \nwere able to come from the hospital within 2 days to a healthy \nbeginning for our entire family.\n  Not only is prenatal care essential for quality of life, it is also \ncost-effective. If we do not want to do it because we value families \nand the importance that children play in our future, we should at least \nwant to do it because it is cost-effective. For every dollar we spend \non prenatal care, we still save more than $6 in neonatal intensive care \ncosts; not to mention the cost to the woman who is giving birth.\n  It comes as no surprise that preterm births are one of the most \nexpensive reasons for a hospital stay in the United States.\n  If S. 724 was law and all States elected the option, some 41,000 \nuninsured pregnant women could be covered. Arkansas currently covers \npregnant women up to the minimum Federal requirement of 133 percent of \npoverty. If the State chose to implement this option, it could raise \neligibility levels under S-CHIP to as much as 200 percent of poverty \nand receive an enhanced Federal payment for doing so. We in Arkansas \ncould receive extra dollars enhanced payment for doing the right thing, \nboth economically and for our families and our children.\n  This policy simply makes sense. It seeks to improve health care for \nlow-income mothers and their babies while reducing costs for everyone, \nparticularly the taxpayer. No wonder it has the support of Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott. Let's not delay any longer. Let's pass this \nlegislation today.\n  There is no excuse for us not passing this legislation today, \ntomorrow, or certainly before we adjourn the Senate.\n  Some might wonder why this legislation is needed since the \nadministration has just announced a final regulation on providing CHIP \ncoverage of unborn children. The reason is simple. The administration's \nregulation covers the fetus but not the woman. It is beyond me that \nanyone could imagine when a child who was being carried by a pregnant \nwoman, that in some way these two were separable. They are not.\n  This is completely contrary to the clinical standards of care \nestablished by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nand the American Academy of Pediatrics. Why on Earth would we want a \npolicy that fails to cover the health issues that may arise for a woman \nduring her pregnancy--issues such as diabetes and hypertension?\n  What happens to that young mother who is pregnant and all of a sudden \nhas a reaction to diabetes or hypertension, who is in an automobile \naccident and goes to the hospital?\n  This covers the medical care for the unborn child but not for the \nmother who is carrying that child? It makes no sense. Mother and baby \nare undeniably connected during pregnancy. They must be treated \ntogether.\n  Why would we want a policy that fails to cover post partum care, the \n60 days of care following delivery, which can often involve serious \nclinical complications for the mother? This care is covered by Medicaid \nand most private insurance. Why wouldn't we cover it under S-CHIP if we \nare going to cover the unborn child? What if the new mother has a \nhemorrhage, an infection? She may need some episiotomy repair or have \npost partum depression. The administration's regulation would not cover \nsuch services because, in their words, they are not services for an \neligible child. But what about the mother carrying that child?\n  The March of Dimes mission is to improve the health of babies \nworldwide; it has expressed serious concern and opposition to the \nPresident's regulation. This regulation is needlessly controversial and \nwill therefore prevent many States from even taking up the option. Why \nfurther complicate and politicize an issue that is so important to the \nhealth of poor mothers and their babies?\n  Even Secretary Tommy Thompson has indicated publicly his support for \nS. 724 as a way to expand prenatal care to low-income women. On behalf \nof our Nation's mothers, fathers, and their babies, we in the Senate \nhave the serious obligation to pass this legislation as soon as \npossible. It is unconscionable that we have waited this long to pass a \nbill that would drastically improve the lives of our most vulnerable \ncitizens. It is beyond me why we would even wait or what opposition \nthere might be to this sensible legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we continue to muddle through all of what we \nare trying to accomplish in the final days, to help us ground ourselves \nin some of the issues that can actually make an enormous difference, \nnot only economically but, more importantly, that will\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\nactually affect the lives of some of our most vulnerable constituents.\n  I plead with my colleagues, let us pass this bill today or certainly \nbefore we adjourn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas and \nalso my colleague from Missouri for their eloquent statements in \nsupport of moving ahead and passing this legislation. The Senator from \nArkansas speaks with more authority and conviction than any male Member \nof this body can muster in connection with this subject and this \nlegislation. Of course, the Senator from Missouri is the prime sponsor \nof the very bill on which I am asking that we move ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 541, which is S. 724; that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read the third time and passed; \nthat the title amendment be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; and that any \nstatements related to the bill be placed in the Record at the \nappropriate place as if read.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, I ask my colleague a \ncouple of questions. I have not looked at this issue for some time.\n  There is a committee substitute to S. 724?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, yes, there is a committee substitute \nthat is essentially the bill. It is the bill we passed through the \nFinance Committee by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the Senator remember how much that bill costs?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in answer to the question, the bill \ncosts right at $600 million over a 5-year period, and the cost is fully \noffset in the legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Could my colleague tell me how it was offset?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response, the offset was the increased scrutiny on \nthe Social Security payments which we discussed in the Finance \nCommittee as an appropriate offset. I think all Members agree that \nwould at least raise as much money as this bill will cost the Treasury.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. I believe I heard one or two Senators \nsay Secretary Thompson supports this bill. It is my understanding that \nthat is not the case. Secretary Thompson may support the thrust of it. \nI understand he supports the regulation that goes into effect today and \nthis bill somewhat counteracts the regulation that he is primarily \nresponsible for promulgating. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I did not hear the second part of the \nquestion.\n  On the question as to whether he actually supports passage of this \nbill, he issued a press release indicating he supports passage of S. \n724, the bill we are trying to move ahead right now. This was March 6, \n2002, in his testimony before the House Labor-HHS Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It is my understanding that Secretary Thompson has \npromulgated a regulation which I believe he thinks satisfies a lot of \nthe unmet health care needs of children, including unborn children, and \nhe supports the regulation that he promulgated and is now effective, \nand does not support the legislation which goes far beyond the \nregulation he has promulgated.\n  I am very particular on making sure we are accurate in our \nstatements. I believe that is accurate. I have asked my staff to check \nwith HHS. I have a note that says he supports the regulation but not \nthe legislation. Maybe he did make a statement that was supportive in \nMarch, but he may well believe that was accomplished in the regulation. \nI have not talked to him personally. I am stating my belief.\n\n  I need to learn more about the bill. It has been months since we have \nlooked at it. We have been doing a few other things. I object at this \npoint. At this point I will further my contacts with those in the \nadministration who know more about the regulation just promulgated. I \ncompliment the Secretary on the regulation. I also wish to do a little \nmore homework. I will check with the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n  I will check with the States. I believe this is an expansion of \nMedicaid which I know my State is struggling to pay. As a matter of \nfact, the State was reducing cases, in some cases in Medicaid because \nthey do not have the budget. Our State Medicaid director told us, do \nnot increase any new expansions on Medicaid because we cannot afford \nit.\n  Correct me if I am wrong: I think pregnant women who have incomes \nless than 150 percent of poverty are now eligible for Medicaid and \nStates have the option to take that up to 185 percent. Pregnant women \nwith incomes of less than 185 percent of poverty are eligible for \nMedicaid, and I believe the legislation takes that up to 300 percent. \nIt makes many more people eligible for Medicaid, which increases the \ncosts to the States, which some States cannot afford.\n  I object at this point and will check with a couple of other people \nwho may have reservations, and perhaps those questions can be resolved, \nand I will get back to my friend and colleague from New Mexico.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me say for the information of my \ncolleague, I appreciate his willingness to look into this matter. My \nstrong impression--and not just impression, but information I have been \ngiven--is Secretary Thompson clearly supports the regulation which his \nDepartment issued today related to the fetus, the coverage of unborn \nchildren. However, he also supports passage of this bill to provide an \noption to States to cover pregnant women under the CHIP Program.\n  It is also my information that this does not involve any expansion of \nMedicaid, that this is strictly a change in law that provides the \noption to States to cover pregnant women under the CHIP Program if they \nso choose. That is not, as I see it, an additional burden on any State.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did the Senator say it is his belief that this bill does \nnot increase Medicaid coverage for pregnant women up to 300 percent of \npoverty?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is certainly my understanding of the bill. I know \nof no provision in this bill that changes the Medicaid coverage that \nway.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We will both do a little more homework and I will be \nhappy to talk to my friends and colleagues, both from Arkansas and from \nNew Mexico, and see where we go from there.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me add one other item, since the \nSenator referred to it, about States not favoring this. My other \ninformation is that the National Governors Association has issued a \npolicy or endorsement of this legislation and supports it.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Oklahoma to look \ninto this further. I will get all the information we have to him. If he \nhas any other information that we need to see, I am glad to look at it. \nI hope we can move ahead as soon as possible with this bill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9828-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9828-S9830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF HARRY KIZIRIAN\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Rhode Island has lost a valiant son, the \nNation has lost a heroic Marine and thousands of my neighbors have lost \na true and faithful friend.\n  On September 13, 2002, Harry Kizirian died. His name in Rhode Island \nis synonymous with selfless service, love of country, commitment to \nfamily and unshakeable loyalty to his faith and to his friends.\n  Harry was born on July 13, 1925 at 134 Chad Brown Street in \nProvidence, RI. He was the proud son of Armenian immigrants. His father \nand mother, Toros and Horopig Kizirian, came to America\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\nto seek a better life for themselves and their family. They had endured \nthe horror of the Armenian genocide, each losing their spouse and many \nin their families. In America, they hoped to find the opportunity and \nthe tolerance that is so rare in the world. In their son, Harry, they \nwould see the fulfillment of the great promise that America offers to \nthe brave and the noble of heart.\n  Harry's youth in the vibrant Armenian community of Chad Brown Street \nwas profoundly changed when, at the age of 15, his father died. Harry \nbecame the man of the house. While he continued his education at Mount \nPleasant High School, he worked lugging beef and unloading freight cars \nat a meat packing plant on Canal Street. Despite his long hours of \nwork, he still threw the hammer and put the shot for Mount Pleasant \nHigh School and captained the football team to boot.\n  A high school football referee, impressed with Harry's dedication and \ndemeanor, suggested that he seek work at the Providence post office. \nHarry secured a temporary position sweeping floors as he finished his \nlast two years of high school.\n  Harry Kizirian came of age as America faced the danger and challenge \nof World War II. Like so many of his generation, Harry did not hesitate \nto serve. He joined the United States Marine Corps the day after he \ngraduated from high school.\n  After his training, Harry found himself in the first assault wave \nattacking Okinawa. He was 19 years old. While leading a fire team in \nthe assault, he charged an enemy position that was pinning down a \nMarine platoon. He received multiple fragmentation wounds in the arms \nand shoulders but continued to press the attack. Eventually, he was \nevacuated for treatment. A month later, he returned to action.\n  And, he would see fearsome action in the climatic battles to secure \nOkinawa.\n  In June of 1945, Harry's unit moved to attack entrenched Japanese \nsoldiers along a ridgeline. Corporal Kizirian observed six Marine \nstretcher bearers pinned down by enemy fire as they were trying to \nevacuate a wounded Marine. With utter disregard for his own safety, \nHarry placed himself in the line of fire and single-handedly attacked \nthe enemy emplacement. Although wounded in the leg and groin, he \ncontinued the attack by dragging his body along by his elbows. He \noverwhelmed the position and killed the 12 enemy defenders.\n  For his service and sacrifice on Okinawa, Harry Kizirian was awarded \nthe Navy Cross, two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star with V device for \nValor, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Navy Unit Citation and the \nRhode Island Cross, the State's highest award for valor.\n  Harry was discharged from the Marine Corps in 1946 and returned to \nRhode Island and to the post office. But he still bore the scars of \nbattle. For 4 years after his discharge, Harry was in and out of \nVeteran's Hospitals for treatment of his wounds.\n  Harry's return to civilian ranks gave him a chance to meet the love \nof his life, Hazel Serabian. Hazel tells the story that, the first time \nshe saw Harry, he was staring at her from the cover of The New York \nTimes Sunday Magazine. He was featured as one of the young heroes of \nthe Pacific battles. She later met this handsome Marine as he stopped \nin her hometown en route to visit the family of a fellow Marine who had \ndied in combat. In my humble opinion, it was love at first sight and \nlove for evermore.\n  Their love produced a family of wonderful sons and daughters: Tom and \nRichard, Joanne, Shakay and Janice. They continue the proud tradition \nof Harry and Hazel as public-spirited citizens in their own right. And \nthe newest generation of Kizirians includes eight grandchildren who \ngrew under the watchful eye and enormous love of their grandfather.\n  Harry, with a young family to feed, applied himself with his \ncharacteristic sincerity and diligence at the post office. But he \nbrought something else and something special to his job: a joy of \nworking with the men and women of the Postal Service and of helping to \nserve the people of Rhode Island.\n  Harry became the Postmaster in Providence in 1961 and led the Postal \nService in Rhode Island at a time of great change. Rhode Island was one \nof the first postal districts in the country to build a central, \nautomated postal facility. Harry was the key individual in opening this \nfacility and making it work.\n  His leadership style was hands-on and personal. He knew the \nProvidence post office's thousand employees by their first names. He \npatrolled the facility in his customary attire of suit and running \nshoes as he made sure that the work was done and the workers were \nrecognized. His co-workers were a larger extension of his own family, \nand he followed their ups and downs with the same interest and \ninvolvement that he lavished on his own family. He established a bond \nof trust and love that still today is unique and enduring.\n  In 1986, the Postal Service announced that Harry would be \n``reorganized'' out of the job. The announcement led to a flurry of \nactivity by Senator John Chafee and Senator Claiborne Pell but to no \navail. The Postal Service did not relent. The announcement was greeted \nby his co-workers with weeping. They weren't losing just an admired \nboss; they were losing a friend.\n  In October of 1986, two thousand of his friends and co-workers \nhonored him at a testimonial.\n  One of his dearest friends, Senator John O. Pastore, paid him a \nspecial tribute. Forty years before, then Governor John O. Pastore \npinned the Rhode Island Cross on Harry Kizirian. In earlier remarks, \nSenator Postore said simply, ``I have never met in my life anyone who \nhas had a bad word to say about Harry Kizirian,'' And Senator Pastore's \nwords were and are beyond reproach.\n  I was honored to be appointed to West Point by Senator Pastore. Both \nHarry and I shared a profound respect for this great man who served \nwith extraordinary distinction in the Senate.\n  Harry's departure from the Postal Service merely redirected his great \npassion for public service to numerous other civic endeavors, including \nBig Brothers, the Veterans Home in Bristol, RI and the Heart \nAssociation.\n  When asked once about his extraordinary generosity and public \nservice, Harry said, ``You know, the track is short; when you can help \npeople, do it.''\n  I really got to know Harry in 1990 when I campaigned for my first \nterm in Congress.\n  I knew about the legendary Harry Kizirian; everyone in Rhode Island \nknew about and admired Harry. I met him several times at meetings of \npostal workers. He still stayed close to his co-workers. By this time, \nHarry's sight was impaired. He would sit at the table and you would \napproach him for a word. He grasped your hand with authority and his \nvoice was strong, but his whole demeanor was one of gentleness and \nconsideration.\n  I will never forget at one of these meetings days before the \nelection. As postal worker after postal worker approached him to thank \nhim for countless kindnesses and asked what they could do for him, \nHarry said, ``if you want to do something for me, vote for this kid, \nReed.''\n  I have never received a greater or more meaningful endorsement. His \nfaith in me gave me great faith in myself. But, after all, that is what \nHarry did all of his life. He made us stronger and better because he \nwas behind us and shared with us his strength and his decency.\n  In May of 1996, Rhode Islanders had a chance to honor Harry. On that \nday, the central Post Office in Providence, the ``house that Harry \nbuilt'', was dedicated as the ``Harry Kizirian Post Office Building.'' \nSenator John H. Chafee sponsored the legislation in the Senate, and I \nsponsored the legislation in the House.\n  We were honored to have General Chuck Krulak, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, as a principal speaker. General Krulak captured the \nessence of Harry Kizirian when he said ``Harry was motivated by a \nselfless desire to help his fellow countrymen.'' General Krulak added a \nsentiment that we all felt. ``It is impossible not to admire, to \nrespect and yes, coming from this tough Marine, to love Harry Kizirian. \nYou have made a difference.''\n  A few days after I learned of Harry's death, I was attending the Fall \nHarvest Festival in my hometown of Cranston, Rhode Island. I \nencountered a gentleman and we began to talk. He quickly told me that \nwe had both lost a good\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\nfriend, Harry Kizirian. The gentleman was a postal worker who had spent \nmany years working for Harry. With gestures more than words, he \nexpressed the sense of loss tempered by love and admiration that we all \nfelt; a fitting epitaph, the unadorned and heartfelt words and \nsentiments of one of his workers, more poignant and profound then any \nsermon or speech.\n  When our colleague John Chafee died, I recalled these lines from the \nIrish poet, William Butler Yeats, fitting words for another Marine who \ngoes to his rest.\n\n     The man is gone who guided ye, unweary, through the long \n           bitter way.\n     Ye by the waves that close in our sad nation,\n     Be full of sudden fears,\n     The man is gone for his lonely station . . .\n     Mourn--and then onward, there is no returning\n     He guides ye from the tomb;\n     His memory now is a tall pillar, burning\n     Before us in the gloom!\n\n  Harry's memory warms our heart and lights our way.\n  He was a man who saw hard times, but refused to allow them to \nextinguish his generous spirit. He was a man who saw war in all its \nhorror, but refused to surrender his soul to its brutality. He was a \nstrong man, not for the sake of intimidation, but because he knew that \ntrue strength allows a man to be truly compassionate. He was humble. \nHis greatest source of pride was the success of others, particularly \nhis family. His memory, his example, sustains us and inspires us.\n  I close with the words of a song that I am sure Harry knew.\n\n     If the Army and the Navy\n     Ever look on Heaven's scenes\n     They will find the streets are guarded by\n     United States Marines\n\n  Harry Kizirian, United States Marine Corps, has joined that Heavenly \nguard mount.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I did not know Senator Reed's friend, but \nafter listening to what he said, I feel as though I did know him. The \ndistinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island is fortunate to have had \nsuch a friend, but I think his friend was fortunate to know Senator \nReed. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from \nGeorgia, did not mind the reference to the U.S. Marine Corps. I saw the \nsmile on his face when that reference was made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9830-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9830-S9834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE 21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, the majority leader filed \ncloture on the bipartisan 21st Century Department of Justice \nAuthorization Act conference report. I commend him for doing that.\n  This is a conference report that passed 400 to 4 last week in the \nother body. We will be voting on that cloture motion tomorrow. I just \nwant to take a few moments to let Members of this body know what is in \nthe conference report.\n  It was signed by all conferees--Republican and Democrat--Senator \nOrrin Hatch, and Representatives Sensenbrenner, Henry Hyde, Lamar \nSmith, myself, and others.\n  I thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for coming to the floor \nyesterday to support this conference report. She has spoken to me many \ntimes about the need for more judgeships along the Texas border with \nMexico to handle immigration and criminal cases. Certainly, from what \nSenator Hutchison has said about that need, she has made a compelling \nrequest, and I have included in this conference report three new judges \nfor that part of Texas. Actually, the conference report has one more \njudge than we passed out of the Senate. We added another one in \nconference. I suspect technically one could say that was not a matter \nin conference, but the Senator from Texas made, I thought, a compelling \nreason for it.\n  I mention that because one of our Federal district judges from \nVermont has actually gone down to Texas a couple times to help out, and \nevery time he has gone down, he has called me up and said: They need \nmore judges here because of the load.\n  So I thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  I also want to thank Senator Sessions for his statement in support of \nthis conference report. I mentioned to him on the floor this morning--\nand I want to speak again to that--there is a piece of this legislation \nSenator Sessions originally opposed. If it were here as a freestanding \nbill, that particular part--a small part of the bill--I believe Senator \nSessions would vote against it. But he supports the overall bill and is \nvoting for the whole bill. I thank him for that.\n  I also thank him for his work and his aid on the provisions in the \nconference report on the Paul Coverdell Forensic Sciences Improvement \nGrants and the Centers for Domestic Preparedness in Alabama and other \nStates. He had a great deal of input, and I appreciate what he did. We \ntried throughout all of this effort to make this a bipartisan bill, and \nhe helped with that.\n  Senator Feinstein spoke on behalf of this conference report. She has \nbeen a tireless advocate for the needs of California, including the \nneeds of the Federal judiciary along the southern border. She has \nhelped to improve that situation.\n\n  I was glad to see we could work through that because we had tried for \n7 or 8 years to add these additional judges, and they had been blocked. \nBut I came back and said, even though it would be a different President \nappointing the judges--in this case, President Bush--I was in favor of \nadding the judges. They should be in there. Among other things, we \nincluded five judgeships for the southern district of California.\n  We have also included judges, as I said, for Texas, Arizona, New \nMexico, Ohio, North Carolina, Illinois, and Florida. The statistics \nshow all the judges are very much needed.\n  The senior Senator from California gave leadership on the James \nGuelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act, the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program reauthorization, and the anti-drug-abuse provisions \nin the conference report, and that has been extremely helpful.\n  I should tell my colleagues, this report will strengthen our Justice \nDepartment and the FBI, and increase our preparedness against terrorist \nattacks. It offers our children a safe place to go after school.\n  In this conference report, we put together years of work. Parts of \nabout 25 different bills have been combined in this report.\n  I thought President Bush did absolutely the right thing after the \nattacks of a year ago, on September 11, as he moved very aggressively \nto try to clamp off money going to terrorist organizations around the \nworld. As we know, al-Qaida received a lot of money from Saudi Arabia \nand other countries, and that money has floated all over.\n  The President moved very quickly to stop that. But then they find \nother ways to move it. We know they still have tens of millions--\nhundreds of millions of dollars perhaps--in these terrorist groups. But \nthere is a thing in this conference report called the Madrid Protocol. \nIf we agree to this protocol, this will greatly strengthen the hand of \nthe President to go after this money. The White House supports it. All \nthe antiterrorist groups and the Government support it. That is also in \nthis bill.\n  I mentioned this because I have been asked questions by several \nSenators exactly what is included. I want them to know. I also want to \nthank Senator Hatch for his work in this endeavor. We spent a lot of \nhours in the conference. That is why it passed so overwhelmingly, with \nthe support of both Republican and Democratic leadership in the other \nbody. I would be happy to have it pass unanimously. We could pass it \ntonight for that matter. I know the legislation is a priority.\n  We have not authorized the Department of Justice in more than two \ndecades. Some might ask: Why should we do it now? We have a far \ndifferent Department of Justice than we had before September 11. We \nhave a number of changes that had to be made, supported by Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, both sides of the aisle in the other body, the \nPresident of the United States, the Attorney General, and so on.\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\n  What we have done is tried to assure the administration of justice in \nour Nation. Our Nation has been radically changed from a year ago. It \ndoesn't have everything that I would have liked or everything everybody \nwould have liked. That is because it is a conference report. It is a \nconsensus document. We did it in a bipartisan way--Democratic chairman \nfrom this body and a Republican chairman from the other; a Republican \nranking member from this body, a Democratic ranking member of the other \nbody.\n  We know that it will strengthen our Justice Department and the FBI. \nWe will increase our preparedness against terrorist attacks. We will \nimprove our intellectual property and antitrust laws. I hope for the \nsake of the Justice Department and the Congress and the American people \nwe can pass it. It is remarkable, the number of provisions in here that \nwill help everything from an attack of terrorism, closing off money and \nso forth, to help with the growing drug problem that strikes not just \nin the big cities but our rural areas.\n  I come from largely a rural State. The difference between this and \nthe other body, every Senator has significant rural areas. When my son \nwas a student at Emory Law School, I remember going to the State of the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and traveling around with my son. I \ncome from a rural area. I must say, there are some pretty rural areas \nin Georgia. But there are in California and Texas and New York and \nevery other State. This helps those States, especially in small areas, \ndo something about the scourge of drugs hitting our youngsters, our \nfuture generation.\n  I wanted to give a short summary. There is a lot more. This was so \nother Members who had been asking me in both parties what is in it, I \nwanted them to see. It will be voted on tomorrow. I hope as a result of \nthis vote tomorrow we will then just pass it. The White House has \nindicated the President will be eager to sign it when it arrives.\n  This conference report will strengthen our Justice Department and the \nFBI, increase our preparedness against terrorist attacks, prevent crime \nand drug abuse, improve our intellectual property and antitrust laws, \nstrengthen and protect our judiciary, and offer our children a safe \nplace to go after school.\n  This conference report is the product of years of bipartisan work. \nThe conference report was unanimous. By my count, the conference report \nincludes significant portions of at least 25 legislative initiatives.\n  I had hoped that the conference report on H.R. 2215 would not take up \nmuch of the Senate's time. There are other matters we do need to \naddress. The majority leader tried to pass this legislation without \ntaking up any floor time last week, but was unable to do so because of \nan objection to proceeding by unanimous consent. Proceeding by \nunanimous consent would have ensured that we not take up the Senate's \ntime in debate on this bipartisan legislative package. Yesterday, I \ncame to the floor and sought to allow for two hours of debate before a \nvote on final passage at 4:30 p.m. We then could have moved on to other \nmatters. Again, that proposal would have taken up a limited amount of \nthe Senate's time. Yet, again, that limited time agreement proposal was \nrejected. As a result of the objection to proceeding more quickly, we \nare still considering this conference report and the majority leader \nwas forced to file a cloture petition to bring it to a vote.\n  This legislation is neither complicated nor controversial. It passed \nthe House 400 to 4 in short order. It was signed by every conferee, \nRepublican or Democrat, including Senator Hatch and Representatives \nSensenbrenner, Hyde, and Lamar Smith. Senators Sessions and Hutchison \ncame to the floor yesterday to support it. There is no need for \nextensive debate in the Senate--we can move on to consider other \nmatters as soon as the objection is lifted so we are able to have an up \nor down vote on the conference report.\n  This legislation is a priority. Congress has not authorized the \nDepartment of Justice in more than two decades. I know that Senator \nHatch and Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers share my view that \nit is long past time for the Judiciary Committees of the House and \nSenate and the Congress as a whole to restore their proper oversight \nrole over the Department of Justice. Through Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, we have allowed the Department of Justice to escape \nits accountability to the Senate and House of Representatives and \nthrough them to the American people. Congress, the people's \nrepresentative, has a strong institutional interest in restoring that \naccountability. The House has recognized this, and has done its job. We \nneed to do ours.\n  I agree with other Members who have spoken that we need to give anti-\nterrorism priority, but not lose sight of the other important missions \nof the Department of Justice. The conference report takes such a \nbalanced approach. Some have said that there is nothing new in this \nlegislation to fight terrorism. I think they missed some important \nprovisions in the legislation as well as my floor statements outlining \nwhat the conference report contains to help in the anti-terrorism \neffort.\n  Let me repeat those remarks and highlight what the conference report \ndoes on this important problem. The conference report fortifies our \nborder security by authorizing over $20 billion for the administration \nand enforcement of the laws relating to immigration, naturalization, \nand alien registration. It also authorizes funding for Centers for \nDomestic Preparedness in Alabama, Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Nevada, \nVermont and Pennsylvania, and adds additional uses for grants from the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness to support State and local law \nenforcement agencies. These provisions have strong bipartisan support, \nincluding that of Senator Sessions.\n\n  Another measure in the bill would correct a glitch in a new law that \nhelps prosecutors combat the international financing of terrorism. I \nworked closely with the White House to pass this provision in order to \nbring the United States into compliance with a treaty that bans \nterrorist financing, but without this technical, non-controversial \nchange, the provision may not be usable. This law is vital in stopping \nthe flow of money to those who seek to harm our citizens. Worse yet, at \na time when the President is going before the U.N. emphasizing that our \nenemies are not complying with international law, by blocking this \nminor fix, we leave ourselves open to a charge that we also are not in \ncompliance with an important anti-terrorism treaty.\n  I agree with other Members who have spoken that we should do more to \nhelp the FBI Director in transforming the FBI from a crime fighting to \na terrorism prevention agency and to help the FBI overcome its \ninformation technology, management and other problems to be the best \nthat it can be. The Judiciary Committee reported unanimously the Leahy-\nGrassley FBI Reform Act, S. 1974, over six months ago to reach those \ngoals, but an anonymous hold has stopped that legislation from moving \nforward. This conference report contains parts of that bipartisan \nlegislation, but not the whole bill, which continues to this day to be \nblocked from Senate consideration and passage.\n  Since the attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks last fall, \nwe have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic \nterrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the \ninstitutions of our country. Reform and improvement at the FBI was \nalready important, but the terrorist attacks suffered by this country \nlast year have imposed even greater urgency on improving the FBI. The \nBureau is our front line of domestic defense against terrorists. It \nneeds to be as great as it can.\n  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight \nhearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong \ncongressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in \nevaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information \nmanagement problems and communications breakdowns between field offices \nand Headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the \nOklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured money \ninto the FBI over the last five years, we heard that the FBI's computer \nsystems were in dire need of modernization.\n  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to \nsell\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\ncritical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever \ngetting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 \ndifferent areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.\n  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved \naccountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI, and \nrequired planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the \nmultitude of challenges we are facing. We are all indebted to Senator \nGrassley for his leadership in the area. Working with Republicans and \nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee we unanimously reported the \nFBI Reform Act more than 6 months ago only to be stymied in our \nbipartisan efforts by an anonymous hold.\n  Now, due to Republican objections, the conference report does not \ncontain some of the important provisions in the FBI Reform Act that \nSenator Grassley and I, and the other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, agreed were needed.\n  Among the items that are, unfortunately, not in the conference report \nand are being blocked from passing in the stand-alone FBI Reform bill \nby an anonymous hold are the following:\n\n       Title III of the FBI Reform bill that would institute a \n     career security officer program, which senior FBI officials \n     have testified before our Committee would be very helpful;\n       Title IV of the FBI Reform bill outlining the requirements \n     for a polygraph program along the lines of what the Webster \n     Commission recommended;\n       Title VII of the FBI Reform bill that takes important steps \n     to fix some of the double standard problems and support the \n     FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, which FBI Ethics \n     and OPR agents say is very important; and\n       Title VIII to push along implementation of secure \n     communications networks to help facilitate FISA processing \n     between Main Justice and the FBI. These hard-working agents \n     and prosecutors have to hand-carry top secret FISA documents \n     between their offices because they still lack send secure e-\n     mail systems.\n\n  This needs to be fixed and the FBI Reform bill would help.\n  These should not be controversial provisions and are designed to help \nthe FBI. Yet, passage is being blocked of both a stand-alone FBI Reform \nbill and those provisions we were able to include in this conference \nreport.\n  Some in this body have complained that we included provisions in this \nconference report that were not contained in either the Senate or \nHouse-passed bills. Now, each of the proposals we have included are \ndirectly related to improving the administration of justice in the \nUnited States.\n  We were asked to include many of them by Republican members of the \nHouse and Senate. I would like to point, in particular, to our \nreauthorization of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which \nPresident Bush has sought to eliminate. On March 4 of this year, \nSenator Kyl and Senator Feinstein sent me a letter asking me to include \nan authorization for SCAAP--which was not authorized in either the \nHouse- or Senate-passed bill--in the conference report.\n\n  I agreed with Senator Kyl and Senator Feinstein that we should \nauthorize SCAAP. I still believe that it is the right thing to do.\n  We took the arguments seriously that we needed more judges in certain \nparts of the country, particularly in border States. We added another \nnew judge for Arizona on top of the two that were added in 1998 and the \nthird that was added in 2000. We added a number of other judges as \nwell, as I have already detailed.\n  Some have criticized the conference report's authorization of funding \nfor DEA police training in South and Central Asia, and for the United \nStates-Thailand drug prosecutor exchange program. I believe that both \nof these are worthy programs that deserve the Senate's support.\n  I have listened to President Bush and others in his Administration \nand in Congress argue that terrorist organizations in Asia, including \nal-Qaida, have repeatedly used drug proceeds to fund their operations. \nThe conferees wanted to do whatever we could to break the link between \ndrug trafficking and terror, and we would all greatly appreciate the \nSenate's assistance in that effort.\n  Beyond the relationship between drug trafficking and terrorism, the \nproduction of drugs in Asia has a tremendous impact on America.\n  For example, more than a quarter of the heroin that is plaguing the \nnortheastern United States, including my State of Vermont, comes from \nSoutheast Asia. Many of the governments in that region want to work \nwith the United States to reduce the production of drugs, and these \nprograms will help. It is beyond me why any Senator would oppose them.\n  Some have complained that the conference report demands too many \nreports from the Department of Justice, and that these reporting \nrequirements would interfere with the Department's ongoing \ncounterterrorism efforts. It is true that our legislation requires a \nnumber of reports, as part of our oversight obligations over the \nDepartment of Justice. I assure the Senate, however, that if the \nDepartment of Justice comes to the House and Senate Judiciary \nCommittees and makes a convincing case that any reporting requirement \nin this legislation will hinder our national security, we will work out \na reasonable accommodation. I think, however, that such a turn of \nevents is exceedingly unlikely, as no one at the Department has \nmentioned any such concerns.\n  Some Members have complained that the conference report includes \npieces of legislation that had not received committee consideration. \nThe Law Enforcement Tribute Act has been mentioned as falling in this \ncategory. In reality, the Committee reported that bill favorably on May \n16.\n  Complaints have been raised about the motor vehicle franchise dispute \nresolution provision in the conference report and that this legislation \nwas not considered by the Judiciary Committee. That complaint is \nmisplaced. The Judiciary Committee fully considered this proposal and \nreported Senator Hatch's Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration \nFairness Act last October 31. It has been stalled from the Senate floor \nby anonymous holds. The same complaint was incorrectly leveled at the \nsection dealing with FBI danger pay. Yet, the Judiciary Committee did \nconsider and approve this proposal as part of the original DOJ \nAuthorization bill, S. 1319. The complaint that the Federal Judiciary \nProtection Act was not considered by the Committee is likewise \nmisplaced. On the contrary, this legislation, S. 1099, was passed the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate by unanimous consent last year and \nin the 106th Congress, as well. The provisions on the U.S. Parole \nCommission were included in the conference report without Committee \nconsideration but was included because the Bush Administration included \nit in its budget request and it makes sense.\n  Some have complained about the provision establishing the FBI police \nto provide protection for the FBI buildings and personnel in this time \nof heightened concerns about terrorist attacks. When this legislation \nwas considered by the Judiciary Committee as part of the FBI Reform \nAct, S. 1974, which was reported unanimously on a bipartisan basis, no \nmember on the Committee raised any objection at the time. Similarly, \nthe complaint about the lack of Committee consideration of the report \non information technology to keep the Congress better informed about \nhow the FBI is updating its obsolete computer systems, is misplaced. \nThis legislation was considered by the Judiciary Committee as part of \nthe FBI Reform Act, S. 1974, and no objection was raised.\n  This conference report is a comprehensive attempt to ensure the \nadministration of justice in our nation. It is not everything I would \nlike or that any individual Member of Congress might have authored. It \nis a conference report, a consensus document, a product of the give and \ntake with the House that is our legislative process. It will strengthen \nour Justice Department and the FBI, increase our preparedness against \nterrorist attacks, prevent crime and drug abuse, improve our \nintellectual property and antitrust laws, strengthen and protect our \njudiciary, and offer our children a safe place to go after school. I \nhope that it will merit the support of every Member of the U.S. Senate. \nAt the very least, it deserves an up-or-down vote. I was pleased to see \nsome Republicans come to the floor yesterday to support this conference \nreport, and I urge those who are blocking its consideration to relent \nand let the Senate vote up or down without further delay or tactics of \nobstruction. I hope that the critics will\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\nreconsider their opposition and their filibuster of this conference \nreport and permit the Senate to vote up or down on this bipartisan \nbill. For the sake of the Justice Department, the U.S. Congress, and \nthe American people, we should pass this legislation today.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, with the passage of the Judiciary \nreauthorization bill, this body will pass a provision to extend our \nprogram to allow states to recommend J-1 visa waiver for physicians \nwilling to practice in medically underserved areas.\n  It is one of the great privileges of my life to represent one of the \nmost rural States in the Nation. For many around the world, Kansas \nrepresents rural life in America. The image is quaint; and, somehow \ninsulated from the world by a field of wheat that arcs off into the \nhorizon. However, as my colleagues from the heartland know, that image \ndoes not represent modern rural life.\n  In the Beloit co-op, Kansans gather as often to talk about global \ncommodities futures as they do the weather. Our farmers are as likely \nto be reviewing GPS Satellite readings as they are next years model \nline of John Deeres. And, when they go to the doctor, rural Kansans are \nvery likely in the waiting room of an Indian or Canadian citizen.\n  Just as Kansas relies on the world as a market, we rely on the world \nas a source for our health professionals. Since 1993, ninety-eight (98) \nwaivers have been granted allowing foreign born physicians to remain in \nthe country to practice medicine in the state of Kansas. Over fifty \n(50) physicians currently practicing in Kansas are in the state as a \nresult of a J-1 visa waiver. Twenty (20) counties in the state of \nKansas are considered fully served as a result of foreign born \nphysicians who received J-1 visa waivers. Section 11018 of the \nJudiciary reauthorization bill before us represents a literal life-line \nfor rural America.\n  The Senate passage of the bill also represents the hard work of \nseveral very dedicated legislators, including my fellow Kansan, \nRepresentative Jerry Moran and our colleague from South Dakota Senator \nKent Conrad. It was their persistence and the hard work of several \ngroups including: The American Hospital Association; the American \nAcademy of Family Physicians; the Farm Bureau; the American College of \nPhysician; the National Association of Community Health Centers; the \nNational Rural Health Care Association; the American Immigration \nLawyers Association and others, that kept this issue moving throughout \nthis Congress.\n  Of course, there are many important provisions in this bill. However, \nfor Kansans in the vast rural areas of the State, ensuring access to a \ndoctor is one of the most significant. I thank the Chairman and Ranking \nmember for fighting to ensure that this provision made it into the \nconference report.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the conference report to H.R. \n2215, the Department of Justice Reauthorization bill. I congratulate \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for \ntheir work in completing this bill and guiding it through a long and \ndifficult conference.\n  I wanted to take a moment to set the record straight on the issue of \nthe inclusion in the conference report to H.R. 2215 of the Motor \nVehicle Contract Arbitration Fairness Act. The junior Senator from \nArizona complained yesterday on the floor that this bill had been added \nto the conference report, depriving him of the opportunity to hear a \ndebate and perhaps offer amendments to the bill. He implied that this \nwas some kind of secret and nefarious deal to try to bypass floor \ndiscussion of legislation that has not had adequate consideration by \nthis body. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  S. 1140, on which the provisions in the conference report are based, \nwas introduced by the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch, and now has 64 cosponsors. Almost exactly half of those \ncosponsors are Republicans and half are Democrats. A companion House \nmeasure has 225 cosponsors. The bill passed the House by voice vote in \nthe last Congress. The inclusion of these provisions in the conference \nreport was supported by all of the Senate conferees, including the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The House conferees, led by \nthe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, also supported including \nthese provision in the conference report.\n  Now why was this necessary? Well, let me point out that this bill was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee almost a year ago. The majority \nleader asked for consent to proceed to the bill and have a limited \ndebate with the opportunity for amendments no less than three times, on \nMay 17, June 27, and September 25. Each time, a Senator on the \nRepublican side objected and the Senate was prevented from having the \nseparate debate and vote that the Senator from Arizona says he wanted. \nSo if the Senator from Arizona has a beef here, it is not with the \nmajority leader or the conferees, but with the member of his own party \nwho exercised his right as a Senator to block the bill from \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  That Senator was exercising his right to object to a unanimous \nconsent request, but with time running out in this Congress, the rest \nof the Senate has rights too. And including this bill in the conference \nreport, with bipartisan support in the conference and in the Senate, \nwas a reasonable step to take so that the will of a supermajority of \nthe body would not be thwarted.\n  These provisions are very important to address a real unfairness that \nis being perpetrated on the auto dealers of this country. Franchise \nagreements for auto and truck dealerships are typically not negotiable \nbetween the manufacturer and the dealer. The dealer accepts the terms \noffered by the manufacturer, or the dealer loses the dealership, plain \nand simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the States \nto pass laws designed to balance the manufacturers' far greater \nbargaining power and to safeguard the rights of dealers.\n  The first State automobile statute was enacted in my home State of \nWisconsin in 1937 to protect citizens from injury caused when a \nmanufacturer or distributor induced a Wisconsin citizen to invest \nconsiderable sums of money in dealership facilities, and then canceled \nthe dealership without cause. Since then, all States except Alaska have \nenacted substantive law to balance the enormous bargaining power \nenjoyed by manufacturers over dealers and to safeguard small business \ndealers from unfair automobile and truck manufacturer practices.\n\n  A little known fact is that under the Federal Arbitration Act, FAA, \narbitrators are not required to apply the particular Federal or State \nlaw that would be applied by a court. That enables the stronger party, \nin this case the auto or truck manufacturer, to use arbitration to \ncircumvent laws specifically enacted to regulate the dealer/\nmanufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of these laws \ninequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited acts that \nState law provides.\n  A majority of States have created their own alternative dispute \nresolution mechanisms and forums with access to auto industry expertise \nthat provide inexpensive, efficient, and nonjudicial resolution of \ndisputes. For example, in Wisconsin, mandatory mediation is required \nbefore the start of an administrative hearing or court action. \nArbitration is also an option if both parties agree. These State \ndispute resolution forums, with years of experience and precedent, are \ngreatly responsible for the small number of manufacture-dealer \nlawsuits. When mandatory binding arbitration is included in dealer \nagreements, these specific State laws and forums established to resolve \nauto dealer and manufacturer disputes are effectively rendered null and \nvoid with respect to dealer agreements.\n  A strong bipartisan majority of this body, and of the House, has come \ntogether to say ``no'' to these unfair contract provisions. So I \ncommend the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for \ntheir work to include this important legislation in the DOJ \nauthorization bill conference report. As I said before, we could have \nhad a debate and voted on amendments to this bill if consent had been \ngranted. That was our preferred course as well. But one Senator did not \nwant to have that debate, and so it was necessary, in the interests of \njustice, to proceed in this manner.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on three important \nmatters. Let me begin with the most important matter to the people of \nLouisiana at this moment, which is the pending hurricane. Hurricane \nLili is in the Gulf of Mexico, and she is headed Louisiana's way. \nUnfortunately, this will be the second major storm in less than a week \nwe have had to protect ourselves against and prepare for the \nconsequences of the aftermath.\n  Let me begin by thanking the President and FEMA, and particularly all \nof the FEMA officials who are now down in Louisiana helping us prepare \nagain. FEMA Director Joe Albaugh was with us in Louisiana last week, as \nwe dodged a bullet with Isadore--a storm that was huge in its mass but \nshort in its intensity. As a result, while there was some sporadic \nflooding and some very damaging flooding to approximately 1,000, homes \nand businesses, including some that were ruined completely, it wasn't \nthe widespread damage we have become familiar with in the Gulf South \nfrom hurricanes.\n  Hurricane Lili is packing winds of 140 miles per hour; barreling \ntoward our coast and is likely to hit somewhere between New Orleans and \nGalveston. It could hit Lafayette or Lake Charles, somewhere on the \ncoast of Louisiana.\n  The reason I rise to speak about this storm is not because there is a \nwhole lot we can do in Washington, today. We will be down there this \nweekend. We will get to assess the damage. We can't do anything today. \nBut there is a great deal we can do from Washington in the future to \nhelp the Gulf Coast the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, \nAlabama, Georgia and Florida.\n  From Washington, we can begin to focus on the kind of investments we \nshould be making along the Gulf Coast that help protect us against the \nconsequences of such storms--particularly as it comes to protecting the \nenergy infrastructure in this Nation, which is so vital and crucial to \nthe economic stability and well-being of the Nation.\n  We produce about 80 percent of all of the offshore oil and gas in the \nNation off the coast of Louisiana. Right now, as I speak, the Gulf of \nMexico has been evacuated. I have been on the phone with officers of \nchemical companies, and oil and gas companies, and they are shutting \ndown refineries and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Why? Because you \ncannot keep them running when you have storms such as this, or you \ncould gravely endanger the lives of those working out in the Gulf. I \nwish I could paint a more vivid picture, but over 20,000 miles of \npipeline, many refineries, and thousands of platforms out in the gulf, \nall of which are critical to America's energy supply, will be directly \nthreatened by Hurricane Lili. We take a lot of taxes out of the gulf \nregion. There are a lot of taxes that the oil and gas industry pays, \nand that money leaves south Louisiana and Texas and goes right up to \nthe Federal Treasury. Then it funds various projects all over the \ncountry.\n  You would think some of that money might come back to Louisiana to \ninvest in Louisiana to elevate and improve our highways and provide \nbetter security to this infrastructure. After all, its through these \nhighways and this infrastructure that energy is carried and produced to \nsupport not just Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, but to turn the \nlights on in the entire country. Even when the winds are blowing down \nsouth, we keep the lights on up north. At the energy conference--my \nable partner, Senator Breaux, is going to be carrying this message as a \nmember of the energy conference. Of course, Congressman Tauzin from \nLouisiana is chairing the conference. We are going to carry this \nmessage directly into the energy conference to see if there is \nsomething we can get the Congress to do in a bipartisan way that says, \nyes, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas--the oil and gas-producing \nStates--should share in some of these revenues so we can invest on the \nfront end in terms of what the Gulf South needs to secure these energy \nresources. Congress must be fair to people in Louisiana, who are happy \nto serve as hosts to this offshore oil and gas industry. We are proud \nof the way we are doing it in a much more environmentally sensitive \nway. But we need help to ensure we receive a fair share of the \nroyalties that come from our rich natural resources.\n  The country does not also realize the great loss of wetlands and the \nerosion Louisiana has experienced. Think about this. There is a \nhurricane coming off the Gulf of Mexico. The only thing between it and \nthe cities or towns is the marsh. The bigger that marsh is, the greater \nthe buffer is from the storm. It will break the wind, break the tides. \nAs that marsh erodes away, there is nothing to break the wind or the \ntide, so the destruction becomes greater and greater, year after year \nafter year.\n  The reason the marsh is subsiding is that we have tamed the \nMississippi River. We have levied it. We levied it not just for the \npeople in Louisiana so we would not flood, but so the ships can take \ngrain from Kansas and Iowa. This commerce then comes down the \nMississippi and can go to any number of countries. Louisiana is an \nimporting and exporting station for so many of the goods coming into \nand out of this country. This benefits everyone. We are telling you and \nbegging this Senate and this Congress to recognize benefits Louisiana \nprovides to the Nation. Louisiana is proud of that, but we need extra \nFederal help to secure this marshland, to help rebuild it, and protect \nus. If Louisiana does not receive help the wetlands will disappear, and \nthe people of Louisiana will be sitting ducks for future floods and \nstorms.\n\n  I am sure Senator Breaux and I will be back on the Senate floor on \nMonday and Tuesday trying to explain to everybody the horrible damage \nthat has occurred because of Hurricane Lili and the importance of \ntrying to be smart and invest some of these monies on the front end in \nLouisiana. This is not only fair and the right thing to do, but for the \ntaxpayers, we would just as soon pay a little now or we are going to \npay a lot in claims when these homes and businesses are destroyed in \nthe Gulf South.\n  There is nothing we can do about keeping hurricanes from coming \nashore. We cannot prevent them. People say: Senator, can't you do \nsomething? I say: If I could pass a resolution, I would. But, of \ncourse, there is nothing we can do about that. But we can be more \nprepared than we are.\n  While we are making progress, we have a long way to go. So whether it \nis at the energy conference, where I hope we will have a positive \noutcome, or in the new transportation bill where we can talk about the \nhighways and evacuation routes in south Louisiana and the Gulf South \nneed our attention. Not only do they serve as economic highways that \nare really necessary for commerce to flourish, but, as you know, when \nthe hurricanes come, it is the only way for people to flee the storm. \nWe don't have trains, as people do in the Northeast, to get out of \nharm's way. All we have in Louisiana are highways dangerously crowded \nwith automobiles and pickup trucks. We need to make sure people can get \nnorth to higher ground. Hundreds of thousands of people in my state are \njamming the highways to escape Lili and head for higher ground in north \nLouisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas. Hotel rooms are scarce, \nand people will have trouble finding safe-haven from Lili.\n  So we will be back talking about it. There are opportunities in the \ntransportation bill, and when we debate the Corps of Engineers bill, to \ntry to make right this situation. The Senate will then debate whether \nto help Louisiana in a direct way--not just Louisiana, but the whole \ngulf coast region.\n  The final point I want to share is a figure I came across a couple \nyears ago\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\nthat was startling to me. I think I spend a lot of my time worrying and \nthinking about coastal communities because I represent a large number \nof people on the coast. Two-thirds of the American people live within \n50 miles of the coast. So our country is really a ring. So the coastal \ncommunities and their special needs and their special requirements \ndeserve some more attention from Congress.\n  I have to say that NOAA and the Department of Commerce are really \ndoing some very good work. I think we need a little bit more attention \nto our coastal communities in this country than we are giving. There \nare ways we can do that.\n  Let me turn my attention to another issue on a completely different \nsubject. But, this a grave threat facing our Nation, and that is our \npotential conflict with Iraq.\n  I support Joint Resolution No. 46, which was introduced this morning. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor with Senators Lieberman, Warner, McCain, \nand Bayh and to add my name to that resolution. I do so with the \ngreatest of seriousness. I do so because I am convinced that this is \nthe right course.\n  I commend the President and the Members of Congress who have worked \nin a bipartisan way to fashion a resolution that does the job, that \ngives us what we need, which is a tool, a weapon, in some ways, that \nwill try to force a regime that has been recalcitrant and reluctant to \nabide by international law and dismantle its weapons of mass \ndestruction. In the international community, Iraq is a regime that is \nquite dangerous to the people it purports to serve--and of course it \ndoes not serve--the people of Iraq. It is dangerous also to the people \nof the United States and to Iraq's neighbors in the Middle East.\n\n  I have the great privilege to serve on the Armed Services Committee \nand to chair the Emerging Threats Subcommittee. I want to stress that \nit is the Emerging Threats and Capabilities, because I don't want to \nmention only threats. We have so many great capabilities in this Nation \nthat we do not have to cower in fear. We have the strongest military, \nthe greatest brain power, and great technology. Most importantly, we \nare founded on freedom and liberty.\n  We have tremendous capabilities. But, we are in a great and historic \nprocess in this Nation of restructuring our Armed Forces, both in the \ntraditional sense that we know of our Navy, Army, Marines, and Air \nForce, and in a totally nontraditional way, which is standing up \nhomeland defense to fight these new threats. The new threats are people \njust like Saddam Hussein--rogue leaders with no decency, who play by no \nnormal rules, who govern by fear, and at the slightest provocation, for \nreasons we might not understand, could either themselves use weapons of \nmass destruction, or allow to be used by terrorists or nonstate actors. \nIt is clear for all to see that Saddam Hussein possesses biological and \nchemical weapons, and he has designs to increase his stockpile. To our \nknowledge, he does not have nuclear capabilities. However, evidence \nmost certainly suggests Saddam Hussein is actively trying to develop \nnuclear weapons. Weapons he could use against the United States and our \nallies. I think a resolution such as this is important for us to \nexpress our unity, as an elected institution, that we are prepared to \nuse force, if necessary, to dismantle weapons of mass destruction, to \ndisarm this regime, to change this regime and try to establish for the \nbenefit of the United States, our allies, the people of Iraq, and the \nworld, a more worthy regime for Iraq.\n\n  What I support specifically about the resolution, and helped in some \nways to craft with words, comments, and suggestions, is that this \nbipartisan resolution has stressed at least three important principles. \nThe resolution requires--and I think this is very important--all \ndiplomatic means be exhausted. This is critically important and \nnecessary because we never want to rush to war. We do not want to be \ntrigger happy. We want to use all diplomatic means to meet our ends.\n  For 10 years, we have tried many things with Iraq--economic \nsanctions, back channel diplomacy, meetings and conventions, and other \ndiplomatic means to compel Saddam Hussein to comply with international \nlaw. Nothing yet has worked. But let's hope that something will work, \nand let's exhaust those means. Once we reach that point, this \nresolution authorizes the President to use all necessary force to \nenforce what we know is right.\n  I am pleased we have the diplomatic requirement in the resolution. \nBut we know all too well that Saddam only respects force. With the \nthreat of force, diplomacy may yet win out.\n  The second principle outlined in this resolution, which I greatly \nsupport, is that it is limited in scope to Iraq. The original language \nI thought, and many of us expressed, was somewhat vague and called for \nlanguage to establish stability in the region. Such language created a \nlot of unanswered questions. This resolution is more clear in its \nlanguage that the scope is limited to Iraq and greatly strengthens this \nresolution.\n  This resolution thoroughly makes clear that our goal is not a war \nagainst the people of Iraq, but a war against a leader who has \ndiscredited himself, thumbing his nose at 16 resolutions, and not \nplaying by the rules of a civilized government. Should we go to war, \nthis war will be waged to disarm Saddam Hussein, to dismantle his \nweapons, and to use force to change his regime.\n  This is not without risk. I am mindful of the risks, and I am mindful \nof the price that may need to be paid in terms of treasure and lives. I \nam also confident that it is the right resolution at the right time in \nthe right spirit to give the President the authorization to use force \nto do what needs to be done, which is to dismantle this dictator's \nability to wreak havoc on the civilized world.\n  The timing of the attack, of course, and all the military strategies \nshould be carried out with great care and the consultation of our best \nmilitary minds. It could be this year, it could be next month, it could \nbe a year from now--whenever our military believes it is the time and \neverything is in place. We must be mindful not to second-guess or try \nto use any political influence to sway the military in terms of their \nstrategy to accomplish this end. What Congress can do is authorize the \nCommander in Chief to use force, if necessary, with this specific \nresolution which I think is a very good document for how we should \napproach this possible war.\n  Furthermore, this resolution places a necessary vital requirement on \nthe President to report to Congress on a periodic basis on the progress \nof the war. Because we, under the Constitution, of course, have a \nresponsibility to determine if this effort should receive funding. War \ncomes with so many great costs, and we must regularly re-evaluate the \nneed to pay those costs of war.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9835-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9835-S9837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE SENATE'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today is October 2, the second day of the \nnew fiscal year, and this Congress has not passed any appropriations \nbills. We have passed a continuing resolution that takes us to next \nFriday, and I guess we will pass another one that takes us into the \nfollowing Friday, October 11. This may be one of the poorest records we \nhave ever had.\n  We do only a few things in the Senate. We pass bills, changing some \nlaws. We may occasionally do something very important such as a war \nauthorization or resolution dealing with Iraq. Every once in a while we \nmight create a new Cabinet-level department. We have the Department of \nHomeland Defense that has been before this body for the last 4 or 5 \nweeks, but we have not been able to draw it to a conclusion.\n  Then we spend money and occasionally we change the tax laws. We spend \na lot of money. That is something we do every year, but we have not \ngotten it done this year. We have not passed our appropriations bills. \nAs a matter of fact, this year for the first time since 1974 we have \nnot passed a budget.\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n  The House has passed a budget. We did not pass a budget. Because we \ndid not pass a budget, we have had differences with the House. The \nHouse has passed a few more appropriations bills than we have. We have \nonly passed three. Three out of 13 is not a very good record, and none \nhave passed conference. I hope, and I would expect, that we would be \nsuccessful in passing the Department of Defense appropriations bill \nnext week. We certainly should. I think it would be grossly \nirresponsible of us to leave without passing the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, but we actually should have done a lot more. I \nbelieve the reason we did not is because we did not pass a budget, so \nwe did not get that done.\n  Something else we did not get done is we did not confirm enough \njudges. We now have the Department of Justice reauthorization bill. It \nis the first time we have reauthorized the Department of Justice in 20 \nyears. I have been in the Senate for 22 years, so I guess we did it \nback in 1982 or 1983. So maybe it is long overdue.\n  When I look at the conference report--and it is a fairly extensive \nconference report--it creates 20 new judge positions through permanent \nand temporary judgeships. Now, that is well and good, but we have a lot \nof judges who have been nominated for existing positions who have yet \nto be confirmed--in many cases yet to be considered. I notice we are \ngoing to set up several permanent and several temporary positions in \nthis bill.\n  I do not doubt that in many cases along the border, particularly in \nsouthern California, Texas, Arizona, and others, there is a demand for \nnew judges with the caseloads they have. So I am not disputing the fact \nthat either permanent or temporary judges who are called for in this \nbill are needed, but I find it ironic when I look at the current status \nof judges. There are 47 judges who are now pending, many of whom have \nbeen nominated for over a year, and we are in the process of creating \nan additional 20 new judgeships.\n  Some of these people I mentioned have been nominated for over a year, \nmany of whom were nominated on May 9, and they have yet to have a \nhearing. Several of these nominations are outstanding individuals, and \nI will mention a couple. John Roberts has been nominated for the DC \nCircuit. He has argued 37 cases before the United States Supreme Court. \nHe was nominated 510 days ago, on May 9. He has yet to have a hearing.\n\n  If this is an individual who has argued 37 cases before the Supreme \nCourt, somebody thinks he is well qualified. As a matter of fact, he \nhas been rated well qualified by the ABA. He was managing editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. He is a Harvard law graduate, magna cum laude; \nunanimously rated well qualified by the ABA; law clerk to Supreme Court \nJustice Rehnquist; principal Deputy Solicitor General between 1989 and \n1993.\n  I have requested that John Roberts have a hearing and be voted on in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I have not been successful. I think it is \nhardly fair to him, an outstanding attorney, more than well qualified, \nto not have even had as yet a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Miguel Estrada just had a hearing before the committee. I thank the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for finally having a hearing on \nMiguel Estrada. This is a young man who has argued 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court. He was unanimously rated well qualified by the ABA. He \nimmigrated from Honduras as a teenager, could hardly speak English, and \nhe graduated at the top of his class from Harvard Law School. He was a \nlaw clerk to Justice Kennedy. He is a former Solicitor General and \nassistant U.S. attorney.\n  He had a hearing. As of yet--maybe this will change and I hope it \nwill change--he has not had a vote in the Judiciary Committee. Some \npeople said they want more information from Mr. Estrada. Frankly, they \nare just running out the clock because they do not want to vote on him. \nMiguel Estrada is more than qualified. He should be confirmed. Even a \n``conservative newspaper'' such as the Washington Post says he should \nbe confirmed, and we have yet to get a vote on him in committee. I hope \nwe will.\n  Michael McConnell was nominated for the Tenth Circuit. He is a \nprofessor of law at the University of Utah, unanimously rated well \nqualified by the ABA. He is one of the country's leading constitutional \nlaw experts. He has argued 11 cases before the United States Supreme \nCourt. He graduated the top of his class from the Chicago Law School. \nHe was a law clerk for Justice Brennan. Prior to that, he was Assistant \nSolicitor General. Again, he is eminently well qualified.\n  The committee held a hearing on Mr. McConnell on September 18. I ask \nthe committee to please put him on the calendar and on the agenda for \nthe next business meeting, which is next Tuesday. I urge the committee \nto do so, and I hope vote affirmatively for Michael McConnell to be on \nthe Tenth Circuit Court.\n\n  Jeffrey Sutton was nominated for the sixth circuit, which is half \nvacant today. It needs judges to fill the vacancies. He is rated well-\nqualified by ABA and qualified by ABA majority. He graduated first in \nhis class at Ohio University College of Law. He law-clerked for \nJustices Powell and Scalia and argued nine cases and 50 merits amicus \nbriefs before the Supreme Court. Prior to that, he was State Solicitor \nin the State of Ohio, he clerked for Supreme Court Justices and is very \nwell qualified. Nominated 510 days ago, and has yet to get a hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee.\n  Deborah Cook, also from Ohio, also on the sixth circuit. Unanimously \nrated well-qualified by the ABA. She has been a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt of the State of Ohio since 1994. She sat on the Ohio District \nCourt of Appeals from 1991 to 1995 and chaired the Commission on Public \nLegal Education. She is a member of the Ohio Commission on Dispute \nResolution. Again, I remind Members, the sixth circuit is almost half \nvacant: Seven out of the 16 spots are vacant. I urge the committee to \nmove forward. Deborah Cook was nominated May 9, 2001, and has yet to \nhave a hearing.\n  Terrence Boyle was nominated for the fourth circuit. He presently is \na chief judge on the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of \nNorth Carolina. He has held that position since 1997. He was rated \nunanimously well-qualified by ABA. He went to American University, \nWashington College of Law; was minority counsel, House Banking \nsubcommittee; also legislative assistant to Senator Helms; and a \npartner in a North Carolina law firm, and a prior district court judge. \nHe has been a sitting judge on the U.S. District Court in North \nCarolina since 1997, and was nominated on May 9, 2001. He has yet to \nhave a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I mention these, and urge the committee--it is not too late to move \nforward with some of the well-qualified people. Hearings have been held \non Miguel Estrada and Michael McConnell. They can be voted on next \nweek. I urge them to do so. I plead with them to do so.\n  I like to cooperate with my colleagues, and I look at the conference \nreport on reauthorizing the Department of Justice. There are a lot of \nthings in this bill a lot of Members would favor, and some things \nperhaps some have reservations about. The majority of this bill never \npassed by either the House or the Senate. Now I mention that to let my \ncolleagues know there are rules against doing that in the Senate, rules \nto protect Members. You do not have the House pass a bill, the Senate \npass a bill, and have totally extraneous measures put in a bill in \nconference and say: Take it or leave it. It is called rule XXVIII.\n  I mention to my colleagues, this is a rule to protect Members of both \nparties in both bodies, to make sure we follow the proper legislative \nprocess. Usually in Politics 101, we learn you pass a bill, the bill \npasses the House or passes the Senate, you go to conference and work \nout the differences, but the bill has to pass one of the Houses to go \nto conference. The majority of this bill did not pass either House; the \nmajority of the bill--whole sections of the bill. I am not saying I \nhave objections to many pieces of the bill. I don't doubt I would not \nvote for a lot of it.\n  Included in this bill are intellectual property rights. Again, never \npassed the House or the Senate, but it is in this bill. There is a \njuvenile justice section, an entire new section, there is criminal \njustice, civil justice, and immigration changes, improvements of \ncriminal justice, intellectual property,\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\nall of which never passed the House or the Senate, and would be subject \nto rule XXVIII if the rule was invoked.\n\n  I bring this to my colleagues' attention, knowing this rule is there \nand that at least this Senator, for one, realizes we have an \nopportunity and an obligation to legislate correctly. This Senate is \nbecoming more and more willing to bypass committees, bypass legislative \nprocess, report bills, take up bills directly to the floor without ever \ngoing through committee, not giving committee Members the opportunity \nto have amendments, to have discussion, to have vetting, offer \nalternatives, or come up with bipartisan approaches.\n  I found this year very frustrating in both the Energy and Natural \nResources Committees on which I serve. We had the most significant \npiece of legislation in the energy bill since I have been a Member, and \nit was not even marked up in committee. Yet we spent 7 weeks on the \nfloor of the Senate marking it up. Not a good way to legislate. That \nbill is in conference. I hope we can come up with a conference report \nthat is a good piece of legislation. That remains questionable.\n  We had prescription drugs many wanted to mark up in the Finance \nCommittee. We did not do that. We bypassed the Finance Committee. The \nFinance Committee never had a markup on the most expensive expansion of \nMedicare since its creation in 1965. We had a debate on prescription \ndrugs with several alternatives, some of which, in my opinion, were \nfatally flawed. Part of that is because they were not vetted. We did \nnot have a thorough discussion in committee. If some of the obvious \nflaws were introduced on the floor, they would have been exposed and \nprobably corrected, and we probably would have passed a bipartisan bill \nthat would have had enough momentum to not only get through the Senate \nbut be a strong force in conference, and thereby provide prescription \nbenefits for Seniors. We did not do that because we did not go through \nthe committee. We are breaking the process.\n  I did homework on the Finance Committee. In every major expansion in \nMedicare for the last 22 years, almost every one except one went \nthrough the committee process and ended up with a bipartisan majority \non the floor of the Senate and helped become law. Usually, the Senate \nmarkup vehicle that came out of committee was strongly supported on the \nfloor and strongly supported in conference, and was close to being the \nvehicle to become law. Sometimes it is adjusted with our friends and \ncolleagues in the House.\n  When you take a bill directly to the floor, and I note now there are \na couple of other packages that some say, rule XIV--in other words, \ntake directly to the Calendar a provision dealing with give-backs, \nadditional money for Medicare, some for rural hospitals, some for \ndoctors, some for other providers. Let's bypass the committee and go \ndirectly to the floor and, yes, we will spend $40 or $50 billion in \ndoing so, most of which will be spent the first year or two.\n  What happened to the committee process? Shouldn't every member of the \nFinance Committee have a chance to say, I think we can do a better job? \nMaybe we can do it more efficiently or better. No, we bypass the \ncommittee and take it directly to the floor.\n  Now I understand we are going to bypass the Finance Committee on a \nsmall business package. I used to be a small businessman. I have ideas \nwhat should be in that package. I would like a say-so in the amendment. \nWe will not get a vote. No Finance Committee Member--maybe one or two \nthat are putting the package together, but the rest of us on that \ncommittee do not get to vote. We did not get to offer an amendment. We \ndid not get to say, we do not think that should be in, maybe something \nelse should be in.\n  Should we have ``pay-fors''? What should they be? Do we have tax cuts \nand tax increases? What should they be? How can we best stimulate the \neconomy? Some of us think we have something to offer in that debate, \nnot if you bypass the committee and go straight to the floor. I object \nto that process. That is a process at least this Senator is going to be \nvery reluctant to support. I don't like bypassing the committee \nprocess. I don't like introducing things that are totally extraneous to \nthe House bill or the Senate bill and putting them in conference. I may \nsupport those provisions, but I don't think that is a good way to \nlegislate.\n  I am bothered by the fact the Senate is not working. I am bothered by \nthe fact we did not pass a budget this year for the first time since \n1974. I am bothered by the fact that we are yet to pass and send to the \nPresident any appropriations bills other than a 1-week continuing \nresolution. I am bothered by the fact we didn't do the energy bill \nright. We didn't do prescription drugs right. We didn't get it done. \nAnd I am bothered by the fact I look at two-thirds of this bill and I \nsay: Wait a minute, where did this come from, even though they may be \nperfectly acceptable provisions.\n\n  Some might say we have done it before. That is true. But we also have \nrules against doing it. I believe the rule would be upheld. I believe \nthese were extraneous to the conference. So I think rule XXVIII would \nby upheld. We may find out. I haven't decided to make that point of \norder. I am letting my colleagues know the rule is on there for a \npurpose. We should follow legislative procedure. We should abide by the \nrules. Unfortunately, we have not done so.\n  I see we are going to create 20 new judgeships. I guess I am all for \nthat, but I look at several outstanding judges, 47 of whom are yet to \nbe voted on, 7 of whom--I just mention 7--have waited for a year and \nhaven't even had a hearing, 2 of whom have had a hearing, Miguel \nEstrada and Michael McConnell, and we don't know if they are going to \nget a vote in the committee or not.\n  I think every one of the 12, I believe--or the 11 that were nominated \non May 9 are entitled to a vote. People can vote up or they can vote \ndown, they have that right. But I think to deny them even a hearing \nafter 510 days is not fair, especially when you look at the \nqualifications of somebody like John Roberts, who has argued 37 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court, and he is yet to have a hearing; or Miguel \nEstrada, who has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court, yet to have \na hearing. Michael McConnell argued 10 cases--I take it back. Miguel \nEstrada has had a hearing, so has McConnell. They just have not been \nvoted on in the committee. It is not too late. We may only have a week \nand a half left in the session, so I urge the Judiciary Committee to \nmove forward on Mr. McConnell and Mr. Estrada and give these fine \nindividuals, who have very distinguished reputations, distinguished \nlegal careers, give them a vote in the Judiciary Committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I am confident both would be confirmed, both would be confirmed \noverwhelmingly and would make outstanding jurists for many years to \ncome. I urge the Judiciary Committee to do that. I hope it will happen \nin the next few days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9837-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9837-S9838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE NEW JERSEY ELECTION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise briefly to express my \ndisappointment and dismay at what is going on in the neighboring State \nto Pennsylvania--New Jersey. What we are seeing play out in New Jersey \nis not something that, as an elected official, I find particularly \nennobling for public officials. This is not something that gives people \na whole lot of confidence in the political process in which we are \nengaged.\n  It is obvious some are trying to change the rules right at the end of \nthe game, and in a way to advantage one political party. I find that \nvery disconcerting. I find it potentially--as the New Jersey Supreme \nCourt contemplates what they are going to do in this case, seeing the \nprecedent that could result, it could result in a lot of ridiculous \nthings happening at the end of a lot of elections. If you find a \ncandidate behind, you simply change horses right at the end. Instead of \nhaving the people decide, you have the courts decide.\n  Remember just 2 years ago a lot of people were gnashing their teeth \nsaying elections should not be decided in the courts. They should be \ndecided by the people on the ballot. Here we have a situation where \nthere are people on the ballot, and now we are having people go to \ncourt to change that ballot.\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n  That is very disconcerting. But I guess one of the things that \nbothers me the most is that there is a connection here in Washington, \nDC, to what is going on in New Jersey. The connection here in \nWashington, DC, as the Senator from New Jersey announced, is that it is \nhis intention, by trying to get his name removed from the ballot, to \nsave the Senate for the Democrats. It was not to give the people of New \nJersey a choice, as many of the pundits are arguing and many of the \npoliticos are arguing, that the people of New Jersey deserve a choice. \nNo, this was about potentially having a candidate who was going to lose \nthe election and that could result in the Democrats losing control of \nthe Senate.\n  So from the press reports, we see lots of pressure being brought to \nbear on the Senator from New Jersey, from a variety of different \nquarters, to take one for the party and step aside so the Democrats can \ncontinue to control the Senate. That is what this is about. This is not \nabout giving the people of New Jersey a choice. It is about trying to \nkeep power, whether breaking the rules or not, trying to keep power.\n  There are a lot of discussions in this Chamber about the rule of law, \nthat we have to respect the rule of law. We preach all over the world \nabout the importance of the rule of law. Yet we have a statute that is \nin place under the Constitution because the Constitution says the \nlegislature shall set the laws of elections within the States, not the \ncourts. The legislature clearly acted in New Jersey.\n  So what are people here trying to save the Democratic majority trying \nto do? Well, they are trying to change the law through the courts so \nthey have a better chance of winning the election.\n  Again, the disturbing part is from press reports that some of that is \nbeing orchestrated out of Washington, DC. We have a report from the \nWashington Post that says:\n\n       Senate majority leader Tom Daschle warned McGreevey, the \n     Governor of New Jersey, that substantial national party \n     funding for the race would be in jeopardy. ``It was \n     basically, `Not with my money,''' Democratic officials said.\n\n  --unless they picked a particular candidate to substitute for Senator \nTorricelli.\n  Again, I am hearing a lot of talk that the people of New Jersey \ndeserve a choice. Yet it sounds like the choice is being dictated here \nin Washington, DC.\n  Another quote from the Newark Star-Ledger:\n\n       In what may be the strangest twist yet in a bizarre \n     election year, New Jersey Democratic leaders last night chose \n     Lautenberg as their standard bearer on the insistence of \n     Senate majority leader Tom Daschle.\n\n  They quote a Democratic source saying:\n\n       ``Lautenberg or nothing.'' The nothing in this case was a \n     threat by the national Democrats to abandon New Jersey in \n     order to put stronger campaigns for incumbent Democrats in \n     other states where they stood a better chance of winning. . . \n     .\n\n  So let's put this in context, the highbrow comments that ``the people \nof New Jersey deserve a choice.'' Let the people of New Jersey \nunderstand whose choice it was. It was not their choice. It was a \nchoice dictated by the political operation here in Washington, DC, and \naccording to these reports, by the Senate majority leader, as to who \nthat choice would be for New Jerseyans to choose from.\n  That is deeply disturbing. That is deeply disturbing that we see this \nkind of interplay, in an attempt to change the outcome of an election \nthat did not seem to be going in a positive direction.\n  I find it very interesting we have another case that just occurred on \nthe unfortunate death of a Representative in Congress from Hawaii, \nsomeone who served this country through a long and distinguished \ncareer, a very popular Member of the House, and very popular in her \ndistrict. What I understand is that the Democratic Party in Hawaii is \nnot going to remove her name--is not going to remove her name from the \nelection ballot. Why? Because she is a very popular Member and there is \nthe suggestion that has been reported in the press that even though she \nis deceased, that she would probably still win the election.\n  Yet we have in New Jersey someone who is alive and well who they are \ninsisting must be removed from the ballot. This is the kind of crass \npolitical calculation that undermines people's faith in the electoral \nand political process in this country. The sad part is, in part, some \nof this is being orchestrated out of Washington, DC. This is a crude \nattempt by those who took power in the Senate, not through the \nelectoral process, to regain power in the Senate through the court \nprocess, not through the electoral process that has been established by \nthe State of New Jersey.\n  How far do we go to keep power? How important is power? What rules \nmust be broken? What principles must be set aside to keep power?\n  That is what is going on here. That is why the public is outraged and \ndeeply disturbed at what they are seeing in New Jersey.\n  I find it very troubling that we have Members from this body who are \nparticipating in orchestrating those developments. It is not something \nthat reflects positively on the Senate. It certainly does not reflect \npositively on the electoral system in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9838-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BLOCKING THE WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to comment on two subject matters \ntoday. The first is some of the statements made by my friend, my \ncounterpart, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, when he said he \nwas disturbed we were not doing anything in the Senate. He talked about \nwe had not passed any appropriations bills, and went through a list of \nthings we had not done.\n  But I say, with all due respect to my good friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma, we have not done these things because the minority won't let \nus do them. We have been here reporting for duty. Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens, on the appropriations bills, reported every one of \nthem out of committee before the August recess. But a decision has been \nmade by the minority not to let us move on any.\n  That is why we have been on the Interior appropriations bill. This \nhas been the fifth week. So I appreciate the efforts by the minority to \nmake this fact, that we have done nothing in the Senate, our fault, but \nthe American public knows.\n  We have stated here many times that we are willing to do terrorism \ninsurance, election reform, Patients' Bill of Rights, generic drugs, \nbankruptcy--all these things that are stuck in conference. We are \nwilling to do every one of the appropriations bills. But they won't let \nus.\n  Now, people say: What do you mean, ``they won't let us''? That is the \nway it is in the Senate, a simple majority does not do the trick in the \nSenate. You need 60 votes. They have 49. We cannot get up to 60. So you \ncan clearly see what the next 5 weeks are going to be like in the \nStates where there are serious Senate races. What you are going to see \nthere is: The Democrats control the Senate, and they have not been able \nto get anything accomplished.\n  But the American people know we may not have been able to accomplish \na lot because they would not let us, but we have been able to stop a \nlot of things that would have occurred had we not been here. And I \nthink when those chapters of history are written about this Congress, \nthat is what the big headlines will be: The stuff we were able to stop. \nWe were a check and balance on a ramrod, and we were able to stop \nthings from happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9838-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9838-S9839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE NEW JERSEY SENATE RACE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is another thing I want to talk about. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania talked about the terrible situation in \nNew Jersey. It is a very unique situation in New Jersey. A sitting \nSenator had a procedure before the Ethics Committee. It took a lot of \ntime, and the only focus of the election for the Senate seat in New \nJersey was that ethics procedure.\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\n  I said yesterday, on the Senate floor--and I say again today--Bob \nTorricelli is my friend. We came to Washington to serve in the House of \nRepresentatives together. We sat together in the same committee, the \nForeign Affairs Committee, in the House.\n  We developed a friendship then, 20 years ago, that has remained. I \nfeel so bad for my friend, Bob Torricelli. Mr. President, I cannot \ndetermine all he went through, but he went through enough that he \ndropped out of the Senate race. He did it because, for those of us who \nknow him, the emotional toll was tremendous.\n\n  Now, would it be better for the people of New Jersey to have no \nSenate race? The sitting Senator is out of the race. Would it be better \nthat the people of New Jersey have no election, no choice?\n  The paramount interest that the New Jersey Supreme Court determined \nwas that the people of New Jersey should have a choice. Now, they heard \nthat argument today, and they have already decided by a 7-to-0 vote. It \nwas, as they say in basketball, a slam dunk. This was not a difficult \nlegal proceeding. The people of New Jersey should have a choice as to \nwho is going to serve in the Senate.\n  I would hope people would drop all the litigation. I am sure some of \nmy friends in the minority are clamoring to get to the Supreme Court \nand have an election determined there like they did a couple years ago. \nBut I think it would be to everyone's best interest to let the people \nof New Jersey decide that, with a 7-to-0 determination by the New \nJersey Supreme Court, and let these two people--Lautenberg and his \nopponent--have a race where they have debates and public forums, run TV \nads, and have an election like we have in America. New Jersey deserves \nthat. That is what this is all about.\n  So I hope the election can go forward, as the New Jersey Supreme \nCourt, by a 7-to-0 vote, said it should. And I am sure it will. I \ncannot imagine even this Supreme Court would change that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in my capacity as Chairman \nof the Congressional Executive Commission on China. This commission was \ncreated in the China PNTR legislation two years ago and has the mandate \nto monitor human rights and developments in the rule of law in China. \nToday, we transmitted the first annual report to the Congress and to \nthe President.\n  With passage of PNTR the Congress, and the country, declared that \neconomic engagement was important--in terms of our own economic and \nstrategic interests and in terms of our ability to promote and \nencourage change inside China. The commission was created to ensure \nthat concerns about human rights and rule of law issues in China would \ncontinue to have a high priority in our government--in Congress and in \nthe administration. That is why it includes members from both branches \nnine Senators, nine House members, and five Administration \nrepresentatives appointed by the President.\n  The commission membership itself reflects the broad range of views of \nChina within the Congress. Yet we were able to develop a report that is \nsupported by an overwhelming majority of our members. The vote in the \ncommission was 18 to 5 in favor of the report.\n  Let me turn to the report itself. This is the most comprehensive \ndocument produced by Congress on human rights in China. It pulls no \npunches in describing current human rights conditions in China. And it \nrecommends actions to Congress and to the Administration that we \nbelieve will help promote change in China.\n  The underlying assumption of the report is that human rights cannot \nbe enjoyed without a legal structure to protect those rights. Although \nChina protects many rights on paper, this is often not the case in \npractice.\n  This is a time of uncertainty in China as they adjust to their WTO \nmembership, go through a political transition with the senior \nleadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, and face \nincreasing demands from their citizens for greater economic, social, \nreligious, and political freedom.\n  In fact, the last 20 years has seen a period of profound change \ninside China--economic reform and the development of a market economy, \ndecentralization of power, individual Chinese citizens gaining more \nindividual autonomy and personal freedom. Yet the government continues \nto resist political liberalization and suppresses any threat to the \nCommunist Party's grip on power. There are no free labor unions; all \nreligious groups must register with the government and submit to its \ncontrol; the media and Internet are restricted; there is tight control \nin minority ethnic regions.\n  The United States has limited means to influence change within China. \nThe Chinese people, ultimately, must determine how they want to be \ngoverned and under what conditions. But we can help contribute to \nimproving the situation inside China.\n  Let me stress that the commission is not seeking to impose American \nstandards on China. But, from the Universal Declaration on Human \nRights, to the International Labor Organizations' Declaration on \nFundamental Principles, China has agreed to respect internationally \nrecognized human rights for its citizens. Our desire is that the \nChinese government abide by the terms of these international \ncommitments, as well as the guarantees enshrined in China's \nConstitution and laws. That is the standard we, and others around the \nworld, need to encourage--constantly.\n  Our report stresses that the United States must take a dual approach.\n  First, we need to pursue high-level advocacy on core human rights \nissues and cases of individuals who are denied their fundamental \nrights. The President, senior Administration officials, and members of \nCongress, should raise these issues at every opportunity. It also means \nmultilateral advocacy. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights \nhas many tools at its disposal. The International Labor Organization is \nbecoming increasingly involved in labor rights issues in China. We need \nto work with other nations to pressure China in these areas.\n  Second, we need to provide increased technical and financial \nassistance to help build a legal system in China that protects human \nrights. Elements of this include training lawyers and judges to build a \nmore professional legal system; promoting grassroots legal aid so \nChinese women, workers, and farmers will understand their rights and \nhow they can try to assert them; assisting with the drafting of new \nlaws and regulations; teaching about experiences in other countries in \nthe West, in Asia, in the former Soviet states, regarding how they \ndealt in a non-authoritarian way with some of the economic, social, and \npolitical problems that confront China today; providing currently \nunavailable information to the average Chinese using radio, cable, and \nthe Internet; and working with nascent Chinese NGOs who are trying to \ndeal with the staggering social and economic challenges in China.\n  The range of issues is huge. This past year, our commission examined \nsome of the major areas of human rights and rule of law, including \nreligious freedom, labor rights, free press and the Internet, Tibet, \nand the criminal justice system. Next year, we will continue to pursue \nthese problems and address many others, including the role of foreign \ncompanies in Chinese society, women's rights which includes the one-\nchild policy, HIV/AIDs, and the 2008 Olympics and human rights, to name \njust a few.\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\n  I am pleased with the scope and quality of this report. It adds to \nour understanding of human rights and legal reform in China and \nprovides a useful action plan for the Congress and the administration. \nI am sending each of my colleagues a copy and urge you all to read it. \nFor others, you can find the report on the commission's website at \nwww.cecc.gov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9840-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 14, \n2001 in Jackson Heights, NY. Edgar Garzon, 35, was attacked after \nleaving a gay bar. The assailants, two men, exchanged hostile words \nwith Mr. Garzon outside the bar, followed the victim toward his home, \nthen beat the victim with a baseball bat or lead pipe. Mr. Garzon \nsuffered a skull fracture and died three weeks after the attack. Police \nare investigating the incident as a bias attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9840-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, over the past years I have spoken often on \nthe subject of population growth and the many problems it poses. Even \nin my own State of Vermont, one of the most rural states, it is \nimpossible to escape the fact that human population can leave a heavy \nfootprint.\n  In the past 50 years the world's population has doubled in size. The \nimplications of this exponential growth are impossible to fully grasp \nor predict. We do know however, that over 95 percent of new births are \noccurring in developing countries, many of which are unable to feed or \ncare for their people today. From sub-Saharan Africa to much of Asia, \nhundreds of thousands of children are born each day without adequate \nfood, medical care or shelter. In fact, of the 4.8 billion people \nliving in developing countries, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent \nlack basic sanitation. Almost a third do not have access to clean \nwater. A quarter do not have adequate housing, and a fifth, over 1 \nbillion people, have no access to modern health services.\n  In addition, we have all seen the burden the Earth's swelling \npopulation places on the environment. The world's rapidly growing \npopulation has resulted in severe water shortages, shrinking forests, \nsoil degradation, air and water pollution and the daily loss of animal \nand plant life.\n  However, there has been progress. Because of the availability of \neducation and modern contraceptives, the average number of births per \nwoman has declined from 6 to 3. Due in large part to the work of \norganizations like the US Agency for International Development, the UN \nPopulation Fund, and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, \nmany women across the globe are receiving the help they need. These \norganizations provide essential advice, counseling and information in \nmany countries where it otherwise would not exist. The reduction in \nfamily size that results has helped millions escape from poverty and, \nfor many women, enhanced the prospects for education and a better life.\n  Even with these steps forward, much more needs to be done. The \nworld's population is many hundreds of millions higher than it was \nseven years ago, yet the developing countries are still receiving US \nfamily planning assistance at 1995 levels. The inextricable link \nbetween world population growth and poverty, political instability, and \nenvironmental degradation is widely known. Over 600,000 women die from \npregnancy related causes. These programs are about modern \ncontraceptives, about reproductive health, about saving women's lives. \nNot one dime of US Government funds can be used for abortions, yet the \nWhite House and some Members of Congress continue to object to many of \nthese programs.\n  For the United States to be a leader in support of international \nfamily planning it is vital for the American people to be aware of the \nproblems posed by unchecked population growth. That is why I am pleased \nthat Governor Howard Dean has proclaimed the week of October 20-26 as \nWorld Population Awareness Week in Vermont. I want to support the \nGovernor in this effort, and I ask unanimous consent that his \nproclamation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 State of Vermont Executive Department\n\n                             A Proclamation\n\n     Whereas, more than one billion people--one sixth of the \n         world's population--are between the ages of 15 and 24, \n         the largest generation ever in this age bracket, and\n     Whereas, nearly half the world's population, and 63 percent \n         in the least developed countries, is under age 25; and\n     Whereas, 17 million young women between the ages of 15-19 \n         give birth every year, including some 13 million who live \n         in less developed countries; and\n     Whereas, early pregnancy and childbearing is associated with \n         serious health risks, as well as less education and lower \n         future income potential for young mothers; and\n     Whereas, risks of dying from complications of pregnancy or \n         childbirth are 25 times higher for girls under 15, and \n         two times higher for women between 15-19; and\n     Whereas, approximately half of the 5 million people infected \n         with HIV last year were young people aged 15-24; and\n     Whereas, almost 12 million young people now live with HIV, \n         and about 6,000 more become infected every day; and\n     Whereas, the choices young people make today regarding their \n         sexual and reproductive lives, including responsible male \n         behavior, will determine whether world population \n         stabilizes at 8 billion or less or 9 billion or more; and\n     Now, therefore, I, Howard Dean, Governor of the State of \n         Vermont, do hereby proclaim October 20-26, 2002 as World \n         Population Awareness Week in Vermont.\n           Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State of \n     Vermont this 25 day of August, A.D. 2002.\n                                                Howard Dean, M.D.,\n     Governor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9840-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9840-S9841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MEDICARE APPEALS, REGULATORY AND CONTRACTING IMPROVEMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss \na provision in the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act I \nintroduced yesterday with Senator Baucus.\n  The core of our bill, as the short title indicates, ensures \nbeneficiary access to care and improves equity in Medicare payments. \nBut the bill also makes important other improvements to the Medicare \nprogram that go beyond payment policy and beneficiary improvements.\n  Chief among those is regulatory relief for providers.\n  Every day, in cities and towns across Iowa, health care providers \ntreat the sick, restore them to health, and work to prevent further \nillness. Iowa's proportion of older adults in the population exceeds \nthat of the United States as a whole. In fact, we rank second in the \nNation in our percentage of persons aged 85 and older.\n  Simply put, the Medicare program means a great deal to Iowans, not \nonly from a beneficiary perspective but also from a provider \nperspective. Health care providers in Iowa rely on the Medicare program \nfor much of their business.\n  I have had extensive conversations with many Iowa health care \nproviders and workers, and a complaint I have heard over and over is \nthat the Medicare program is too bureaucratic. Too much time is spent \non paperwork instead of treating patients. Rules coming out of \nWashington are confusing and contradictory. Doctors and nurses receive \none answer to a question from their Medicare contractor and a different \nanswer from Medicare headquarters in Baltimore.\n  Now, don't get me wrong. My position on the sin of Medicare waste, \nfraud, and abuse has not changed. As a watchdog of the taxpayer dollar, \nI firmly believe in asking health care providers to account for the \nmoney they receive from the government. Taxpayer dollars must be spent \nresponsibly. However, when honest providers\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\nare unable to get straight answers from the government, frustration and \ninefficiency can result. The outcome is a health care program that is \nnot serving beneficiaries or taxpayers as well as it could. So I am \nproud that this legislation takes steps to treat some of these \nbureaucratic ills afflicting Medicare.\n  Based on provisions in a bill introduced last year by myself and \nSenator Baucus, along with Senators Murkowski and Kerry, the \nBeneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act offers additional \nappeal rights for providers, mandates enhanced provider education, and \nensures that providers receive straight answers from the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS.\n  Importantly, our legislation reforms the way Medicare contracts with \nthe private companies that process and pay claims. Today, CMS is \nstymied by outdated guidelines that fail to recognize efficiency and \nquality in contractor performance. Today's system is also not \ncompetitive. Our legislation brings competition into the program so \nthat the best available contractors, in terms of quality and \nefficiency, will serve it. The bill provides incentives for contractors \nto give timely and accurate information to beneficiaries and providers.\n  For Medicare contractor reform to succeed, however, contractors need \nprotection from unlimited civil liability in carrying out the payments, \nprovider services, and beneficiary services functions expected of them.\n  The bill I have just introduced would therefore continue the past \npolicy of limiting the liability of certifying and disbursing officers, \nand the Medicare administrative contractors for whom those officers \nserve, with respect to certain payments. In addition, the language \ncontained in Section 621 clarifies that Medicare administrative \ncontractors are not liable for inadvertent billing errors but, as in \nthe past, are liable for all damages resulting from reckless disregard \nor intent to defraud the United States.\n  Importantly, the reckless disregard standard is the same as the \nstandard under the False Claims Act, a 150-year-old Federal law that I \nupdated in 1986 and that has had unmatched success in fighting fraud \nand abuse in Federal programs like Medicare. The False Claims Act, 31 \nU.S.C. Sections 3729-3733, applies to Medicare fiscal intermediaries \nand carriers under current law and has been used effectively by \nwhistleblowers and the Department of Justice to uncover and penalize \nfraud against the program by some intermediaries and carriers.\n  This specially calibrated version of reckless disregard balances the \npractical need to shelter Medicare administrative contractors from \nfrivolous civil litigation, with the Medicare program's interest in \nprotecting itself from contractor fraud. This legislation makes it \nclear that the False Claims Act continues, as in the past, to remain \navailable as a remedy for fraud against Medicare by certifying \nofficers, disbursing officers, and Medicare administrative contractors \nalike and that, among other things, the remedy subjects Medicare \ncontractors to administrative as well as trust fund damages. I am \npleased that the Department of Justice and the HHS Office of Inspector \nGeneral believe this special liability standard serves taxpayers and \nthe Medicare program extremely well.\n  In closing, let me again say how proud I am that on this issue and on \nthe many other provider and beneficiary policies in this bill, Chairman \nBaucus and I were able to work together in a balanced, bipartisan \nfashion. Together, we carefully considered and came to agreement on \npayment, administration and benefit policies that make sense for \nMedicare. I urge the Senate Democrat leadership to call up our bill for \nfull consideration in short order before we adjourn next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9841-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               MAINE'S ANGEL IN ADOPTION, DAWN DEGENHARDT\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, each year, members of the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption nominate an individual or couple to \nreceive the ``Angels in Adoption'' award. This year, it was my pleasure \nto nominate Dawn C. Degenhardt of Houlton, ME to receive the 2002 \n``Angels in Adoption'' award for her efforts and dedication to this \ncause. Dawn's wonderful story is truly inspirational.\n  Born in Portland, ME, Dawn was a child advocate in Cleveland, OH, \nwhere she founded the State chapter of the Council on Adoptable \nChildren. Dawn and another parent also founded Spaulding of Beechbrook \nin Ohio, which helps to place special needs children and is still in \nexistence today.\n  When Dawn and her husband decided to start their own family, they \nbegan by adopting two infants. By the time their second child was a \nyear old, Dawn and Ed pursued an older child adoption. Over the next \ntwo years, they worked to encourage more people to adopt older \nchildren. They adopted four more children, one from a Native American \nadoption program in South Dakota and three from Vietnam. They then \nmoved to Maine and adopted three more older children, two through the \nMaine Department of Human Services and one from India. Dawn and Ed \nadopted nine children in total.\n  Though their own family was now complete, in 1977, Dawn's concern for \nthe children still waiting in the foster care system prompted her to \nfound the Maine Adoption Placement Service, MAPS, in Houlton, ME. Her \noriginal mission was to place special needs children and to educate and \ntrain their new adoptive families in a supportive environment. After \nten years, the program expanded its services to include a housing \ncomponent for pregnant teens and young women.\n  Today, there are MAPS offices and programs with housing for pregnant \nand parenting teens in Portland, Bangor, and Houlton. The program also \nhas licensed offices in Boston, Tampa, FL, and Silverthorne, CO. The \nColorado office has also a therapeutic foster care program.\n  The agency dawn founded is also licensed in Vermont, and has recently \nreceived accreditation by the Council on Accreditation of Children and \nFamily Services, COA. MAPS was the first adoption agency to propose \nplacement of children living in orphanages in the former Soviet Union, \nand that work continues to this day.\n  The program is also functioning in Cambodia, where it offers a strong \nprogram of adoption services and humanitarian aid. MAPS also has \ndeveloped programs in Kazakhstan, Romania, India, Guatemala, Sierra \nLeone, and Ecuador; offering families more international choices while \nnever losing sight of its original mission of placing special needs \nchildren from the foster care system. Dawn continues to serve as CEO of \nthe Maine Adoption Placement Service. This year she and her staff \ncelebrate their twenty-fifth anniversary of bringing children and \nfamilies together. Dawn and her team of dedicated professionals have \nhelped to place over 3,500 children in loving homes.\n  Dawm and Ed Degenhardt have built a family not only for themselves \nbut also for many others. Their home has been filled with love and \nhappiness. I am proud to know that Maine is home to a couple so full of \ncompassion and generosity, and who have inspired countless more \nfamilies, to show the same compassion and caring for children in our \nstate and around the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9841-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9841-S9842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 2002\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in honor of Hispanic \nHeritage Month. For the past 34 years we have formally celebrated the \nnumerous contributions the Hispanic community has made to our country. \nFrom September 15 to October 15, 2002, Hispanic Heritage Month will be \ncommemorated by millions of people across the United States.\n  Hispanic Americans make up 12.5 percent of the population and have \nhad a profound effect on our Nation's economic strength and stability. \nThey not only are the fastest growing population group in the Nation, \nthey are the fastest growing group among small business owners. \nHispanic Business Magazine estimates that by the year 2007, Hispanic \nbuying power will rise to $926.1 billion--due to a growth rate almost \nthree times that of non-Hispanics.\n  There are more than 1.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses. These \nfirms employed more than 1.4 million people and generated $183.3 \nbillion in revenues. These statistics are a testament\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\nto those Hispanic Americans who have overcome a myriad of obstacles to \nestablish themselves as a prominent force in our Nation's economy.\n  Hispanic Americans also have succeeded in the political arena. The \nnumber of Hispanic elected officials has increased, and many States \nacross the Nation have fielded Hispanic candidates at local and \nnational levels. For example, earlier this month Georgia voters elected \ntheir first Hispanic State senator, Sam Zamarripa, and New Mexico's \nnext Governor will undoubtedly be Hispanic.\n  In addition to recognizing the significant contributions Hispanics \nhave made in politics and to our economy, we honor those Hispanic \nAmericans who sacrificed their lives on September 11, 2001. Hispanic \nAmericans were among the very first to respond to the terror attacks \nagainst our Nation. Twelve Hispanic firefighters lost their lives \ntrying to save others.\n  As America continues to remember those Hispanic Americans who gave \ntheir lives on that tragic day, others in the Hispanic community have \nhelped bring our Nation together. For example, Daniel Rodriguez, a \nBrooklyn-born Latino policeman, captured America's hearts with his \nrendition of ``God Bless America'' at numerous September 11 memorial \nservices. Contributions like this from our fellow Americans have helped \nmany of us heal and have instilled a deeper, greater pride in our \nNation.\n  Other Hispanic Americans may not have received as much media \nattention but have equally contributed to every aspect of our American \nlife.\n  In my home State of Illinois, where over 1 million Hispanic Americans \nreside, numerous individuals have had a significant impact on the \nHispanic American community. Consider Theresa Gutierrez, a reporter for \nABC News in Chicago. She was one of the first Hispanic women to break \ninto television journalism, and since she began her media career in \n1971 she has been the recipient of numerous awards. In 1999, she was \nrecognized by Chicago Woman Magazine as one of 100 ``Women Making a \nDifference.'' She was also selected as one of the six outstanding \nbroadcasters in the country by Hispanic USA Magazine.\n  Another similar example is Anna Zotigh, a 16-year-old girl working on \na mural at the Instituto del Progresso Latino in Chicago. Anna, along \nwith other teams of students across the country, works 8- to 9-hour \ndays with local artists to help promote Latino culture, specifically \nthe pivotal role played by women in Hispanic culture. These are just \nsome of the extraordinary Hispanic American individuals who contribute \nto the vibrant life of our country.\n  The Hispanic American population has made significant strides in the \nlast decade to help strengthen America's ideals of democracy, freedom, \nand opportunity. We have seen their contributions time and time again, \nfrom their impact on our economy to their service in law enforcement.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to celebrate, experience, and honor \nthe Hispanic culture. I urge all Americans to actively participate in \nthe many festivities across our Nation, as we deepen our appreciation \nfor a community that has helped shape America today, and will continue \nto do so tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9842-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE MYRICK\n\n Mr. BOND.

The Lee Mace's Ozark Opry has \nentertained audiences for years and is a tribute to Lee's dream to \nshare country music with the public. Lee and his wife, Joyce Mace began \nthe Opry in an effort to preserve the real flavor of the Ozarks though \nmusic and dance. Giving talented young people from nearby towns the \nopportunity to perform was a dream of Lees and many performers have \nstood on stage as a result. The format developed for the show has been \nemulated in Branson, Missouri and over the years has spread to opry \nhouses across the country. Although, Lee Mace passed away several years \nago, the sounds of the Ozarks can still be heard at Lee Mace's Ozark \nOpry. Today, we honor Lee Mace's dream of preserving the tradition of \ncountry music in the Ozarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9842-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING STATE REPRESENTATIVE CLAIRE LEUCK\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow \nHoosier, Indiana State Representative, retired farmer, teacher, mother \nand loving wife, Claire Leuck, who will be retiring from the Indiana \nlegislature this year.\n  Representative Leuck, who was first elected to the Indiana House of \nRepresentatives in 1986, has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of \nHoosiers from all walks of life. As a representative of District 25, \nClaire was a voice for rural communities and worked in a bipartisan \nmanner. Prior to her service in the legislature, Claire served as the \nBenton County Clerk from 1974-1982.\n  As chair of the House Agriculture Committee, she advocated for the \ninterests and needs of the agricultural community, giving farmers a \nvoice and enabling family farms to retain a vital role in the Indiana \neconomy. Claire has worked to increase funding for rural schools and \nimprove the quality of rural life. She has devoted her energies to \nimprove health care by authoring legislation that created the CHOICE \nhome health care program for the elderly. Claire has continually worked \nto secure state funding for Lakes Shafer and Freeman, allowing these \nlakes to remain safe and friendly destinations for tourists. She has \nalso worked on behalf of veteran's interests to ensure that local \nveterans had the necessary means and equipment to pay tribute to their \nfallen friends.\n  Claire's outstanding work in the Indiana House of Representatives was \nacknowledged by House leadership when she was appointed to the powerful \nHouse Ways and Means Committee. During my time as Governor, I had the \nprivilege to work with Representative Leuck to balance Indiana's \nbudget, cut taxes for Hoosier families, increase funding for Indiana's \npublic schools and protect Indiana's natural resources.\n  Everyone that has ever encountered Representative Leuck knows she \nexemplifies her famous campaign slogan ``everybody likes Claire.''\n  Along with her husband Richard, Claire's strong dedication to the \nState of Indiana is evident in the work she accomplished during her \ntenure in the legislature. She is to be commended for her 16 years of \nservice to her community, her district and her State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9842-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9842-S9843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE WORLD WAR II MEN OF THE USS KIDD\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nWorld War II men of the USS Kidd, DD 661, a Fletcher-class destroyer \nwhich was named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Sr., who was killed \naboard his flagship, the USS Arizona, at Pearl Harbor on December 7, \n1941. Kidd was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New \nYork, on April 23, 1943. She was placed under the command of Lieutenant \nCommander, later Admiral, Allan B. Roby.\n  Kidd served with great distinction in the South Pacific during World \nWar II, earning eight battle stars while participating in such historic \nengagements as the air raids on Wake Island, the strikes against Rabaul \nand Bougainville, the Gilbert Islands invasion\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\nat Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, the occupation of Aitape and Hollandia \nin New Guinea, the occupation of Saipan, the bombardment of Guam, the \ninvasion of the Philippines, the raids against the Japanese home \nislands, and the invasion of Okinawa.\n  On April 11, 1945, Kidd, by then affectionately known as ``The Pirate \nof the Pacific'', was on patrol and picket duty off of Okinawa. During \na Japanese attack that day a Kamikaze struck Kidd amidship just above \nthe water line. Thirty-eight men were killed and another fifty-five \nwere wounded, and Kidd suffered extensive structural damage. \nNotwithstanding these circumstances, the crew managed to keep the ship \nafloat while returning fire and continuing to engage the enemy in the \nongoing attack. Kidd was saved and, following major repairs, continued \nto serve the Nation with distinction for another twenty years.\n  In the aftermath of World War II, the surviving men of Kidd did not \nforget their shipmates who perished during that epic conflict. In \nAugust of 1949, just a few years after the end of World War II, \nsurvivors of the Kamikaze attack on Kidd gathered in New York City for \nthe solemn purpose of remembering and honoring their lost shipmates. \nEver since that original gathering in 1949, for fifty-two straight \nyears, survivors of the World War II attack on Kidd have traveled from \nfar and wide and assembled together to pay homage to their friends and \nshipmates who died on April 11, 1945. This remarkable unbroken string \nof remembrances now extend over half a century.\n  This weekend, the remaining survivors of the World War II crew of the \nUSS Kidd are preparing to gather together for their 53rd consecutive \nannual reunion to be held here in the Washington Metropolitan Area from \nOctober 4--6, 2002. At that gathering, as in their past gatherings, \nthese men, accompanied by their families and friends, will honor the \nmemory of their departed shipmates. For the benefit of the historical \nrecord, the names of those men killed aboard Kidd, heroes all, were \nLieutenant George B. Grieshaber, Ensign Robert A. Berwick, Seaman 1st \nClass Dorsey C.

A young sailor myself in 1945, I proudly ask \nthe Senate to join me in saluting the World War II men of the USS Kidd. \nTheir deeds and sacrifices are an untold story that should serve as an \ninspiration to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9843-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING RICHARD ``DICK'' HAGEN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of South Dakota's most exceptional public leaders, \nRichard ``Dick'' Hagen.\n  Dick was a widely respected leader and representative in South \nDakota. He served in the State House from 1983 until 2000 and was \nelected to his first term in the State Senate in 2000. He was greatly \nadmired by his peers for his honesty and unwavering dedication to the \npeople he represented. A member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, Dick strived \nto promote a better understanding of Native American culture among his \ncolleagues in the state legislature. His tremendous contributions to \nthe community and public leadership set him apart from other \noutstanding public representatives, and lead to a Legislator of the \nYear award in 2001 and the West River Legislator of the Year award in \n2002.\n  Dick entered Coast Guard boot camp at Cape May, NJ in 1957. He was \nstationed in Morgan City, LA and later in Unimak Island, Alaska before \nbeing honorably discharged from Sheboygan, WI in 1961. After his \ndischarge from the Coast Guard, he returned to South Dakota and served \nwith the Bureau of Indian Affairs for one year, the Shannon County \nSchool Board for two terms, and the Tribal Council for two terms.\n  Dick lent his leadership and good nature to many activities and \nevents throughout the Pine Ridge Reservation. He announced countless \nball games, parades, and rodeos, and was a familiar face at numerous \nsporting events over the years. Through his outstanding community \ninvolvement in these, and many other activities, the lives of countless \nSouth Dakotans were enormously enhanced.\n  One of the most important pieces of legislation Dick initiated was \nhis bill to fund reservation nursing homes. Elderly Native Americans, \nliving on South Dakota's reservations, are often forced to leave their \nfamilies to find nursing home care far from home. Dick believed all \nSouth Dakotans deserve the right to convenient quality health care \nservice. Although he did not live to see his dream realized, his work \ncontinues to inspire all those who knew him.\n  Dick's legislative achievements were extraordinary, but it was his \ndedication to helping others that serves as his greatest legacy. I am \nproud to have been a friend of Dick and of Mona, his deceased wife. Our \nNation and South Dakota are far better places because of Dick's life, \nand while we miss him very much, the best way to honor his life is to \nemulate his commitment to public service and community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9843-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9843-S9844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE WEEK\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, October 6-12, 2002 is National \nOsteopathic Medicine, NOM, Week, a week when the nation's 49,000 \nosteopathic physicians, D.O.s are focused on increasing the public's \nawareness of access to care issues for patients across the nation.\n  For almost 25 years now, the American Osteopathic Association, AOA, \nand its members have celebrated the osteopathic medical community's \nunified effort to educate the nation about issues influencing the \nAmerican health care system. I am especially pleased the theme of this \nyear's NOM Week is ``Access to Care.''\n  When osteopathic physicians, medical students, interns, residents and \nsupporters of osteopathic medicine travel to Las Vegas, NV to attend \nthe AOA's 107th Annual Convention and Scientific Seminar, nearly 8,000 \nwill receive the latest information on issues impacting patients access \nto care quality and timely health care. The program covers such topics \nas professional liability insurance reform, rural health, the \nuninsured, SCHIP and other access to care programs for children, \nbioterrorism and mental health.\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\n  I applaud the osteopathic medical community for emphasizing patient \naccess issues, so important to my home state of Missouri and the \nnation.\n  Take for example, rural health. Many citizens of my home state face \nlimited availability of health care services in their communities. \nAccess to health care can be established only when medical \nprofessionals are available to provide quality health care. We must do \nmore to ensure that all Americans have access to timely health care and \npart of the solution is to place physicians in rural communities. Let's \nnot forget the access to care barriers facing minority populations, \nchildren and the elderly.\n  Over the past few years, medical liability premiums have escalated \nout of control causing health care quality, access, and cost problems. \nWhile some states have passed professional liability insurance (PLI) \nsystem reforms, not every state has effective laws in place. The \nosteopathic medical community recognizes many states face critical PLI \nsystem problems.\n  For more than a century, D.O.s have made a difference in the lives \nand health of my fellow citizens in Missouri. I am proud to say that \nthe birth of this profession took place in Northwest Missouri. Overall, \nmore than 100 million patient visits are made each year to osteopathic \nphysicians. D.O.s are committed to serving the needs of rural and \nunderserved communities and make up 15 percent of the total physician \npopulation in towns of 10,000 or less.\n  Similar to requirements set for M.D.s, D.O.s must successfully \ncomplete four years of medical education at one of the nation's 20 \nosteopathic medical schools; a one-year internship; and a multi-year \nresidency program. Throughout this education, D.O.s are trained to \nunderstand how the musculoskeletal system influences the condition of \nall other body systems. Many patients want this extra knowledge a part \nof their health care. Individuals may call (866) 346-3236 to find a \nD.O. in their community.\n  In recognition of NOM Week, I would like to congratulate the over \n1,700 D.O.s in Missouri, the 616 students at the Kirksville College of \nOsteopathic Medicine, 871 students at the University of Health Sciences \nCollege of Osteopathic Medicine and the 47,000 D.O.s represented by the \nAmerican Osteopathic Association for their contributions to the good \nhealth of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9844-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9844-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a sundry \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9844-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 556.

A bill to provide for a creditors' committee of employee and \nretiree representatives of a debtor in order to protect pensions of \nthose employees and retirees; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Employee \nPension Bankruptcy Protection Act of 2002. Today, when a company \ndeclares bankruptcy, it is often the employees and retirees who suffer. \nThey suffer because they often lose their hard earned pensions and \nretirement benefits during the bankruptcy process. This is simply not \nright. When Americans lose the pensions and benefits that they have \nworked a lifetime to earn, it is the responsibility of the members of \nthis body to act to protect them.\n  Under current law, the pension fund is technically the ``creditor'' \nof the corporation, not the employees and retirees. Thus, in court, \nemployees and retirees of a bankrupt corporation have their interests \nin their pensions represented by the pension plan trustee. If the \npension fund itself is threatened with insolvency, the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation, PBGC, can step in. While PBGC often covers most \nof the pension obligation, the statutory limits can sometimes leave a \nsignificant amount of pension benefits unpaid. If employees and \nretirees are not satisfied with how the pension plan trustee or PGGC is \nrepresenting their interests, current law provides no relief. There is \nno day in court for the people who earned the pensions in the first \nplace.\n  This problem has only recently been brought to my attention by Mr. \nJohn Nichols of Gadsden, AL, and his son, Phil, an attorney in \nBirmingham. The orderal faced by Mr. Nichols is a prime example of why \nemployees and retirees need more representation before the bankruptcy \ncourt. Mr. Nichols spent his entire career at a steel plant in Gadsden. \nHe began working for Republic Steel in 1956 and stayed with the \noperation through a buyout by LTV Steel and two subsequent ownership \nchanges.\n  When LTV bought out Mr. Nichols' employer, LTV Steel took over the\n\n[[Page S9848]]\n\nmonthly pension payments guaranteed to the former employees and \nretirees of Republic Steel, including Mr. Nichols. Soon after the \ntakeover, however, LTV filed for bankruptcy, claiming that it could no \nlonger make pension payments to Republic Steel's former employees. \nPBGC, initially stepped in to help make a small part of the pension \npayments, but LTV eventually stopped making payments at all.\n  Because all the payments LTV had been making were not guaranteed by \nthe PBGC, the long awaited pension payments earned by Mr. Nichols and \nby Republic Steel's other loyal employees were severely reduced. Mr. \nNichols' pension payments went from approximately $2,225 per month to \napproximately $675 per month--only 30 percent of what he had been \npromised. A third of this payment now covers Mr. Nichols' health \ninsurance premium that he can no longer purchase through LTV, leaving \nhim with only 20 percent of his promised pension each month.\n  Because PBGC could only pay the retirees the amount the statute \nallowed, and because no one had the responsibility of telling \nbankruptcy court what was happening to the retirees of Republic Steel, \nlarge portions of hard earned pensions were lost. PBGC itself \nrecognized that the claims of the pensioners against LTV, ``are among \nthe many claims that will probably never be paid, except perhaps in \ncents on the dollar'' and stated that PBGC's claims against LTV for the \npension plan underfunding were perhaps ``[t]he largest of these claims \n[that will go upaid].''\n  During LTV's bankruptcy case, various creditors were represented \nbefore the bankruptcy court, but not the employees and retirees. Thus, \nwhen the assets of LTV were divided among its creditors, employees and \nthe retirees were not at the table. If the employees and retirees had \nhad an opportunity to make their case before the bankruptcy judge, the \nresult could have been different for Mr. Nichols and for the other \nemployees of Republic Steel.\n  The bill I introduce today does one very simple thing, it gives \nemployees and retirees the right to be heard before the bankruptcy \ncourt with respect to their pensions. Under this bill, a representative \nof the employee and retirees can appear and be heard if it is likely \nthat the employee benefit pension plan of the bankrupt corporation will \nbe terminated or substantially underfunded and if it is possible that \nthe beneficiaries of the plan will be adversely affected.\n  By allowing employees and retirees to be hard before the bankruptcy \ncourt, we will ensure that the bankruptcy court hears from the people \nwho earned the pensions before it disposes of the assets that could pay \nthose pensions. Employees and retirees will be able to argue to the \ncourt that any division of assets or bankruptcy plan must be fair to \nthe pensioners. The needs of the corporation's employees and retirees \nshould be heard before the assets of a bankrupt corporation are split \nup among creditors and gone forever. They deserve to have their day in \ncourt.\n  The Employee Pension Bankruptcy Protection Act of 2002 seeks to make \nsure that what happened to the retirees of Republic Steel in Gadsden, \nAlabama, will never happen again. By passing this legislation we can \nensure that employees and retirees will never be deprived of their \npensions without having their day in court. While a company may still \nbe able to discharge its obligation to pay pensioners in bankruptcy, \nthis bill at least takes the first modest step to protection pensions \nby providing them the opportunity to be part of the bankruptcy \nbargaining process. Before the bankruptcy court sells assets or adopts \na plan of reorganization, the employees and retirees will be heard with \nrespect to their pensions. This is only fair.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill and \nto work with me to further ensure that employees and retirees of \ncorporations are fairly treated and protected under the United States \nBankruptcy Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 3029. A bill to amend title IX of the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for the improvement of patient safety and to reduce the \nincidence of accidental medical injury; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today ``The \nPatient Safety Improvement and Medical Injury Reduction Act.'' This \nlegislation will protect patients and save lives. It will do more for \npublic health than a breakthrough new drug or a new therapy for deadly \ndisease. The bill does this by providing a comprehensive plan to \ngreatly reduce medical errors, promote a culture of greater patient \nsafety and provider accountability, and improve the quality of medical \ncare in the United States.\n  As the Institute of Medicine, IOM, concluded in its landmark 1999 \nstudy, medical errors kill up to 98,000 people in U.S. hospitals every \nyear. That means that more Americans die from medical mistakes each \nyear than from AIDS, breast cancer or highway accidents. In fact, each \nday, more than 250 people die because of medical mistakes, the \nequivalent of a major airplane crash every day.\n  Other studies support the IOM's shocking conclusions.\n  A Commonwealth Fund survey this year found that 22 percent of \nrespondents reported that they or a family member had experienced a \nmedical error of some kind. About 10 percent reported that they or a \nfamily member grew sicker as a result of a mistake made at a doctor's \noffice or in a hospital, and 16 percent were given the wrong medication \nor wrong dose when filling a prescription at a pharmacy or while \nhospitalized.\n  A study published September 9 by the Archives of Internal Medicine \nalso concluded that medication errors occur in one of every five does \nadministered to hospital patients. The magnitude of these costly and \nlife-threatening mistakes is astonishing, and calls for immediate \nimprovement.\n  We can and should do better for our citizens. Americans deserve the \nhighest quality health care, yet these errors put everyone at risk of \nunnecessary harm. This legislation raises patient safety to the \nnational priority it deserves, and assures America's patients that they \ncan expect high quality health care when they are sick or injured.\n  To accomplish this goal, or legislation requires comprehensive \naction. The IOM concluded that improvements will require sweeping, \nsystemic changes in our health care system. IOM made numerous, sensible \nrecommendations, which are fully addressed by the Patient Safety \nImprovement and Medical Injury Reduction Act.\n  The overwhelming majority of errors are caused by flaws in the health \ncare system, not the outright negligence of individual doctors and \nnurses. Our hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other health care providers \nwant to do the right thing. The bill gives the health care community \nthe tools to identify the causes of medical errors, the resources to \ndevelop strategies to prevent them, and the encouragement to implement \nthose solutions.\n  A key concern addressed by this legislation is to allow doctors and \nother health professionals to share information regarding best \npractices and lessons learned from their mistakes without fear of \nwinding up in court. At the same time, medical professionals and \nhospitals that injure patients through their negligence should still be \nheld accountable in court, just as they are today.\n  To balance these competing concerns, our legislation allows reports \nand analyses created under a new system of information-sharing between \nproviders, patient safety organizations and a newly established \nNational Patient Safety Database, to be immune from legal discovery. \nHealth care professionals who submit reports to the programs would also \nbe protected against discrimination in the workplace for participating \nin the reporting systems.\n  By the same token, however, this new system will not become a shield \nto hide medical negligence. As a result, this legislation continues \ncurrent law when it comes to those elements of patients' medical \nrecords that have nothing to do with the patient safety improvements \ncontemplated by the Act. Nor would the privilege apply to such \ninformation merely because it is reported to a patient safety \norganization or the National Patient Safety Database. Just as \nimportantly, the new privilege would not affect compliance with State \naccountability systems.\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\n  Consistent with the IOM recommendations, the Act also creates a new \nCenter for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety in the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality to promote patient safety. The Center \nwould conduct and support research on medical errors, certify learning-\nbased patient safety organizations around the country, administer the \nvoluntary National Patient Safety Database, and disseminate evidence-\nbased practices and other error reduction and prevention strategies to \nhealth care providers, purchasers and the public. Reports submitted \nwould be analyzed to identify systemic faults that led to the errors \nand solutions to prevent future similar errors. The Act would also \ncreate a ``learning laboratory'' under the Center for focused study of \nerrors and their correction in select health care facilities.\n  The IOM also highlighted medication errors as a ``high priority area \nfor all health care organizations'' and recommended the use of \ncomputerized physician order entry systems and advanced prescribing \nsoftware to screen for inappropriate doses, allergies, and drug \ninteractions. The Act would provide funding and uniform standards for \nthe implementation of such systems, as well as grants for community \npartnerships for health care improvement.\n  As widespread and serious as the problem of medical errors is, it can \nbe solved by a national commitment of resolve and resources. \nImprovements are clearly possible. The field of anesthesia undertook \nsuch an effort almost twenty years ago. Today, the number of fatalities \nfrom errors in administering anesthesia has dropped 98 percent.\n  Our goal should be to achieve equal or even greater success in \nreducing other types of medical mistakes. This legislation lays the \nfoundation to achieve this goal. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and with interested Members of the House of Representatives \nin enacting the Patient Safety Improvement and Medical Injury Reduction \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWine (For himself and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 3030. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 200 West 2d Street in Dayton, Ohio, as the ``Tony \nHall Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, to introduce a bill to name the \nfederal building in Dayton, OH, after Congressman Tony Hall.\n  This bill is a fitting tribute to Tony Hall, a tireless and dedicated \npublic servant, who will be greatly missed in the United States \nCongress upon his retirement. I am confident that he will continue his \ncommitment to public service as our U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.'s food \nand agriculture agencies.\n  The people of Ohio and the American people can be proud of and \nthankful for the many years Tony Hall has served in the United States \nCongress. I've had the privilege of working closely with him since my \nearly days in the House nearly 20 years ago. He has been a valuable \nlegislator and a real statesman. Over the years, he has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of the people of Montgomery County and throughout \nOhio.\n  Tony Hall comes from a family rich in devotion to public service and \ndedication to Ohio. His father, in fact, once served as Dayton's \nRepublican mayor. A graduate of Fairmont High School in Kettering and \nDenison University in Granville, where he was an all-star tailback on \nthe football team, Tony served in the Ohio House from 1969-1972, in the \nOhio Senate from 1973-1978, and as Dayton's Congressman since January \n1979.\n  A devoted husband to his wife, Janet, and a dedicated father to Jyl \nand Matt, the entire Hall family struggled valiantly alongside Matt as \nhe fought an unsuccessful battle against leukemia that ended in 1996.\n  My wife, Fran, and I are proud to have worked over two decades with \nTony and Janet on humanitarian efforts and other causes that bridge \nacross the political aisle. Tony, who served in the Peace Corps in 1966 \nand 1967, has been an unmatched advocate for the needy, the poor, the \nhungry, and the oppressed across Ohio, our Nation, and the world.\n  Tony has been singularly responsible for much of the world's \ncontinued, focused attention on the serious hunger issues worldwide. \nHis involvement in a 22-day hunger strike in 1989, forced the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the World Bank to call conferences on \nhunger, which ultimately resulted in the creation of the Congressional \nHunger Center.\n  I'm proud to have worked with Tony on several humanitarian \ninitiatives through the years from Africa Seeds of Hope to the Global \nFood for Education Act to the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act to \nthe Clean Diamond Act of 2001.\n  We also share a commitment to the yet unborn. A staunch pro-life \nDemocrat, Congressman Hall was responsible for language in the \nDemocratic National Committee platform respecting the beliefs of those \nwithin his party who wished to protect the sanctity of life.\n  I also have had the pleasure of working with Tony Hall on several \nprojects important to the Miami Valley area of Ohio. We share a passion \nfor the aviation heritage of the Wright Brothers in Dayton and have \nworked together to protect and preserve the monuments to the Wright \nBrothers legacy. And, we've also worked together on issues to build the \nunique resources of Wright Patterson Air Force base, as well.\n  Today, it is a pleasure to take this opportunity to join Senator \nVoinovich to honor Tony Hall's many legislative efforts and \nachievements and to thank him for his commitment to the people of Ohio \nand this Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to honor our \ngood friend and statesman, Tony Hall.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to designate the \nFederal building and United States courthouse located at 200 West 2nd \nStreet in Dayton, Ohio, as the ``Tony Hall Federal Building and United \nStates Courthouse'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The Federal building and United States courthouse located \n     at 200 West 2d Street in Dayton, Ohio, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Tony Hall Federal Building and United \n     States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``Tony Hall Federal \n     Building and United States Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Craig):\n  S. 3031. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to reduce \ndelays in the development of highway and transit projects, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, I rise today to introduce the MEGA STREAM \nACT. Maximizing Economic Growth for America through Environmental \nStreamlining.\n  Moving goods and moving people is what this Nation's transportation \nsystem is all about. The backbone of our economy. But delays in \ncompleting transportation projects threaten our economy.\n  These delays add to the cost of projects and deny the public the \nbenefits of the projects. And those benefits are substantial, improving \nour economy, our competitiveness, and our quality of life. \nUnfortunately, there are delays for many projects, not only for \ncontroversial or complex projects, and those delays sometimes result \nfrom the environmental review process.\n  My goal is to advance a common sense approach that will both \nstrengthen our transportation system and support for our environmental \nlaws.\n  I doubt that there is a member in this chamber that has not heard \ncomplaints about delays in developing transportation projects.\n  I was privileged to be one of the authors of TEA 21 a revolutionary \ntransportation law. I helped write sections 1308 and 1309. These are \nthe sections that direct the Secretary of Transportation to find ways \nto expedite the\n\n[[Page S9850]]\n\nproject approval process and get construction underway faster.\n  I remember working with Senators Warner, Graham, Wyden and Chafee and \nwith the House members to come to a compromise on the environmental \nstreamlining provisions included in TEA 21.\n  At the time, I had heard from my Department of Transportation and \nfrom others about how cumbersome a process it is to come to completion \non a highway project. Everyone who worked on TEA 21 both the House and \nSenate, wanted to include a direction to the USDOT to streamline the \nplanning and project development processes for the states.\n  We were very clear, the environment and the environmental reviews \nshould NOT get short shrift! But, we needed to find a way to make it \neasier to get a project done, eliminate unnecessary delays, move faster \nand with as little paperwork as possible.\n  I cannot over-emphasize that the planning and environmental \nprovisions of TEA-21 need to be implemented in a way that will \nstreamline and expedite, not complicate, the process of delivering \ntransportation projects.\n  These projects that we're trying to expedite provide good paying jobs \nfor the folks in Montana and for every State. Contracts must be met in \na timely manner.\n  That is why Congress directed the USDOT to include certain elements \nin their regulations on streamlining.\n  We included concepts to be incorporated--like concurrent \nenvironmental reviews by agencies and reasonable deadlines for the \nagencies to follow when completing their reviews.\n  Certainly we did not legislate an easy task to the USDOT. Trying to \ncoordinate so many separate agencies is like trying to herd cats.\n  The whole concept of environmental streamlining, that is, to make the \npermit and approval process work more smoothly and effectively, while \nstill ensuring protection of the environment, is one of the more-\ndifficult challenges of TEA-21.\n  So I waited for the rules to come out. And waited. And two years \nafter the passage of TEA-21 I finally got them.\n  I have to tell you, I was very disappointed when those rules came out \nin May of 2000. I believe those regulations hit very far from the mark.\n  Those regulations were supposed to help the State DOTS get their jobs \ndone better and more efficiently--not make their jobs harder.\n  They were supposed to answer questions--but what is contained in \nthose documents raises even more questions than before because they \nwere vague where they needed to be precise.\n  Those proposed rules would make it even harder, if not impossible to \ncome to a decision.\n  It would have been even more difficult for States to deliver their \nprograms. Contracts wouldn't get met and jobs would be lost.\n  So the DOT solicited comments, which I understand were overwhelmingly \nnegative, and went back to the drawing board and we never heard from \nthem again. Even when a new President took over. New administration. No \nnew rules.\n  And today we have nothing. We're exactly where we were in 1998.\n  As for sections 1308 and 1309. Nothing has been done to implement \nthem. Its just as cumbersome today to bring a highway project to \ncompletion.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held 4 hearings on \nthe subject of environmental streamlining since the passage of TEA 21 \nin 1998.\n  A few weeks ago, on the eve of the fourth EPW hearing, the President \nsigned an Executive Order calling for a handful of projects to be \nsupervised by the heads of USDOT and CEQ. The highest levels would \npersonally make sure that there were timely environmental reviews.\n  That would have been a good start in 1998. But, its too little too \nlate now.\n  We are on the verge of reauthorization of TEA 21. This time, I would \nlike to see us specifically legislate environmental streamlining. No \nwaiting for regulations or more executive orders. Congress needs to be \nclear about what they want to see and put it into law.\n  To that end, along with Senator Crapo and others, I am introducing a \nproposal on environmental streamlining. It is part of a series of bills \nthat we are introducing on highway reauthorization.\n  This bill will address three issues.\n  First, the USDOT needs to be the lead agency on at least two \nrequirements, ``Purpose and Need'' for a project and ``Scope of \nAlternatives.'' This will make sure that any stalemates are resolved \nquickly.\n  Second, we should allow States to take over the role of the USDOT if \nthey can meet certain requirements and if they choose to take on that \nrole. This will eliminate another step of bureaucracy.\n  Last, we must ensure that resource agencies act in a timely manner. \nWhen it comes time for an agency like Fish and Wildlife to assess the \nextent of damage (if any) to a wetlands or the Army Corps of Engineers \nto issue a permit, these agencies shouldn't be able to take years to \nmake these decisions.\n  We need to legislate specific time limits for them to follow. No \nanswer at all is not acceptable. It is unacceptable for agencies to sit \non their decision for years. We can't make them issue the permit and we \ndon't want to, but we can make them make a decision in a timely manner.\n  The rest of the world works on deadlines. They can too.\n  These three things will help to expedite the planning and project \ndevelopment processes.\n  These three things are not meant to be comprehensive streamlining, \nbut I believe that they will be a big help and a great start. The bill \nwe will introduce will be a solid beginning to Congress setting some \nspecific guidelines for expediting the planning and environmental \nreview processes.\n  Once again, I want to reiterate that I want to make sure that \nenvironmental laws and policies are obeyed to the letter. But, there's \ngot to be a faster, easier way to do the work that needs to be done on \nour surface transportation system, while continuing to protect the \nenvironment.\n  I believe our bill will be a means to those ends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dodd, \n        and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3032. A bill to amend the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of \n2000 and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for \nthe poorest people in developing countries under microenterprise \nassistance programs under those Acts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to amend \nthe Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 and the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961 to increase assistance for poor people in \ndeveloping countries under microenterprise assistance programs. I am \njoined in this effort by my colleagues, Senator DeWine of Ohio, Senator \nClinton of New York, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, and Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts.\n  Microenterprises play a critical role in helping poor people the \nworld over raise their incomes, build assets, start new businesses, and \nimprove their lives. Access to microenterprise loans and services with \nthe attendant obligations allows poor people to establish good credit, \nengage in commerce, and begin to lift themselves out of poverty. The \nU.S. Government has been the leading donor for microenterprise \ndevelopment over the past two decades. In collaboration with diverse \npartner institutions like PVOs, private voluntary organizations, U.S. \nsupport, primarily through USAID, for microenterprise activities \nenables over 2 million people throughout the developing world to have \naccess to microfinance services.\n  The legislation I am introducing today authorizes $175 million in \nfiscal year 03 and $200 million in fiscal year 04 for microenterprise \nassistance, an increase over the $155 million authorization level in \nfiscal year 02.\n  The other provisions of this legislation include a reaffirmation of \nthe provision in the Microenterprise for Self-Reliance Act of 2000 \nstipulating that 50 percent of all microenterprise assistance shall be \ntargeted to the very poor. The term ``very poor'' has been defined in \nthe new legislation as those living in the bottom 50 percent below the \npoverty line established by their respective national governments, or \non less\n\n[[Page S9851]]\n\nthan $1 a day. The legislation also provides that the microenterprise \nprograms should target both rural and urban poor.\n  Ensuring that 50 percent of all microenterprise assistance is \ntargeted to the very poor has been problematic. This legislation calls \nfor the adoption of a monitoring system using proven effective poverty \nassessment tools to identify more precisely the very poor and ensure \nthat they receive microenterprise loans, savings, and assistance \nauthorized under this act. The legislation also stipulates that the \nUSAID Administrator, in consultation with microenterprise institutions \nand other appropriate organizations, shall develop no fewer than two \nlow-cost methods for partner institutions to use to assess the poverty \nlevels of their current or prospective clients. By October 1, 2004, \nUSAID shall certify that no fewer than two of such methods are being \nused for measuring poverty levels of current or prospective clients. \nAdditionally, the legislation says that USAID, beginning no later than \nOctober 1, 2005, shall require all microenterprise organizations \napplying for U.S. assistance to use one of these methods.\n  Finally, the legislation requires the USAID Administrator to submit a \nreport to Congress, no later than September 30, 2005, on the \ndevelopment and application of the poverty assessment procedures and, \nbeginning with fiscal year 2006, an annual report documenting the \npercentage of its resources allocated to the very poor, based on the \ncertified methods and the absolute number of the very poor that was \nreached.\n  The legislation, which builds on somewhat similar legislation that \npassed the House earlier this year (H.R. 4073), was the result of many \nweeks of hard work and negotiations between USAID and the \nMicroenterprise Coalition, a group that represents the microenterprise \ninstitutions. Both USAID and the Microenterprise Coalition strongly \nsupport this legislation. I commend them for their efforts and I urge \nthe Senate to pass this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3032\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate check truncation by authorizing \nsubstitute checks, to foster innovation in the check collection system \nwithout mandating receipt of checks in electronic form, and to improve \nthe overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the Check \nTruncation Act, which will be a significant step in improving the \nNation's check payment system.\n  The Act improves America's check payments system by allowing banks to \nexchange checks electronically. Current law requires banks to \nphysically present and return original checks, a tedious, antiquated \nand expensive process. This legislation will also reduce infrastructure \ncosts for banks, allowing for more flexibility and greater cost savings \nfor the consumer.\n  In the days following September 11, 2001, when planes across the \ncountry remained grounded, banks were forced to take drastic steps to \nensure the shipment of checks from bank to bank. Check payments across \nthe country were delayed, which opened up possibilities for processing \nerrors and fraud. Electronic payments, on the other hand, continued to \nbe processed in a safe and timely fashion during the crisis.\n  Processing challenges confront banks in my State of South Dakota \nevery winter. Deep snowfalls and vast distances between small-town \nbanks and processing centers add significant costs to physical \ntransportation of checks. These costs trickle down to consumers, and \neveryone ends up paying the price of our outdated system.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation, which would help to ensure \nthe financial stability of our system in the event of another attack, \nand would increase its efficiency day-to-day. It is the right time to \nchange our banking laws to give electronic versions of checks the same \nlegal validity as paper checks, so America's financial institutions can \nprovide customers with faster check clearing and better access to \nliquid funds in both good times and times of crisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 3035. A bill to prohibit the sale of tobacco products through the \nInternet or other indirect means to underage individuals, to ensure the \ncollection of all cigarette taxes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation to \nstop the illegal sales of cigarettes over the Internet, an escalating \nproblem which has had a particularly negative effect in my home State \nof Arkansas. While every State in the union has enacted laws \nprohibiting minors from purchasing or possessing tobacco products, this \nlaw is easily evaded when minors purchase cigarettes over the Internet. \nDisreputable websites flagrantly break the law, even advertising that \nthey do not check identification.\n  In the first quarter of 2002, the number of Internet site selling \ncigarettes had already increased by over 10 percent from 2001, and the \nnumber of those based overseas increased almost 20 percent. In addition \nto putting cigarettes in the hands of minors, these websites also fail \nto pay the sales and tobacco taxes many states levy on these products.\n  The Government Accounting Office released a study in August 2002 \nwhich reports that by 2005 states will be losing as much as $1.4 \nbillion annually due to this tax evasion. This is revenue states cannot \nafford to do without. Current federal laws must be updated and \nstrengthened to address this growing threat.\n  My bill, the Eliminating Profiteering through Illegal Cigarette \nSales, EPICS Act, addresses both aspects of the problem. It is designed \nto both strengthen domestic security by giving law enforcement agencies \nadditional tools they need to choke off this source of terrorist \nincome, and to ensure that legitimate Internet sites selling cigarettes \ntake significant steps to prevent their orders from falling into the \nhands of our kids.\n  The EPICS Act prohibits online sales of cigarettes to minors. It also \nensures that minors are not able to purchase cigarettes online using a \nfalse identification by enacting strict identification verification \nrequirements.\n  In order to assist states enforcement of age requirements and \ncollection of taxes, this bill will dramatically strengthen the Jenkins \nAct. This law requires anyone who ships or sells tobacco products over \nstate lines other than to licensed dealers to report those sales to the \nstate tax administrator. When this is done, states can ensure that \nsales are not being made to minors and that due taxes have been \ncollected.\n  Currently, there is very little enforcement of the Jenkins Act. This \nbill remedies this by establishing much harsher penalties for those who \ndo not comply and by allowing a State's Attorney General to enforce the \nFederal law. Following the recommendation of the GAO, the bill will \ngive the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms concurrent authority \nwith the Justice Department to enforce the amended Jenkins Act. It also \nupdates the law to make it clear that the Jenkins Act reporting \nrequirements apply to all sales by Internet, mail and phone.\n  Additionally, this bill will improve current laws to prohibit the \ntrafficking in contraband cigarettes. The EPICS Act lowers the number \nof unstamped cigarettes required to trigger the law from 60,000 to \n2,000, adds reporting requirements and allows a State's Attorney \nGeneral and Federal tobacco permit holders to bring causes of action to \nenforce the federal law. With numerous reports of terrorist \norganizations transporting contraband cigarettes across State lines to \nreap profits right here in the U.S., it is especially important that \nthis law be effective.\n  Terrorists and others who seek to profit by illegal means have \ndiscovered the goldmine of Internet sales. The number of Internet sites \nselling untaxed cigarettes or selling to minors is increasing almost \ndaily. Heightened media coverage has pointed out the problem, but also \nadvertised their availability to minors and tax-evaders. I hope my \ncolleagues will act quickly to prevent illegal tobacco profits, keep \ncigarettes out of the hands of minors and stop tobacco tax evasion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3035\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9853]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 46. A joint resolution to authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces against Iraq; read the first time.\n\n                              S.J. Res. 46\n\n       Whereas in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression \n     against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States \n     forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its \n     people in order to defend the national security of the United \n     States and enforce United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions relating to Iraq;\n       Whereas after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq \n     entered into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement \n     pursuant to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other \n     things, to eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical \n     weapons programs and the means to deliver and develop them, \n     and to end its support for international terrorism;\n       Whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors, \n     United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led \n     to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical \n     weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and \n     that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program \n     that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than \n     intelligence reporting had previously indicated;\n       Whereas Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the \n     cease-fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons \n     inspectors to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction stockpiles and development capabilities, which \n     finally resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on \n     October 31, 1998;\n       Whereas in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing \n     weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United \n     States interests and international peace and security, \n     declared Iraq to be in ``material and unacceptable breach of \n     its international obligations'' and urged the President ``to \n     take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution \n     and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into \n     compliance with its international obligations'' (Public Law \n     105-235);\n       Whereas Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national \n     security of the United States and international peace and \n     security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material \n     and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, \n     among other things, continuing to possess and develop a \n     significant chemical and biological weapons capability, \n     actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting \n     and harboring terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the \n     United Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in \n     brutal repression of its civilian population thereby \n     threatening international peace and security in the region, \n     by refusing to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi \n     citizens wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American \n     serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully \n     seized by Iraq from Kuwait;\n       Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction \n     against other nations and its own people;\n       Whereas the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the \n     United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate \n     former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of \n     occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged \n     in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Whereas members of al Qaida, an organization bearing \n     responsibility for attacks on the United States, its \n     citizens, and interests, including the attacks that occurred \n     on September 11, 2001, are known to be in Iraq;\n       Whereas Iraq continues to aid and harbor other \n     international terrorist organizations, including \n     organizations that threaten the lives and safety of American \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the attacks on the United States of September 11, \n     2001, underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the \n     acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international \n     terrorist organizations;\n       Whereas Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to \n     use weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current \n     Iraqi regime will either employ those weapons to launch a \n     surprise attack against the United States or its Armed Forces \n     or provide them to international terrorists who would do so, \n     and the extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the \n     United States and its citizens from such an attack, combine \n     to justify action by the United States to defend itself;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent \n     relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain \n     activities that threaten international peace and security, \n     including the development of weapons of mass destruction and \n     refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections \n     in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687, repression of its civilian population in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and \n     threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in \n     Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 949;\n       Whereas Congress in the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has \n     authorized the President ``to use United States Armed Forces \n     pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council \n     Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, \n     and 677'';\n       Whereas in December 1991, Congress expressed its sense that \n     it ``supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the \n     goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as \n     being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1),'' that \n     Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and ``constitutes a \n     continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of \n     the Persian Gulf region,'' and that Congress, ``supports the \n     use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688'';\n       Whereas the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) \n     expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy \n     of the United States to support efforts to remove from power \n     the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a \n     democratic government to replace that regime;\n       Whereas on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the \n     United States to ``work with the United Nations Security \n     Council to meet our common challenge'' posed by Iraq and to \n     ``work for the necessary resolutions,'' while also making \n     clear that ``the Security Council resolutions will be \n     enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be \n     met, or action will be unavoidable'';\n       Whereas the United States is determined to prosecute the \n     war on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international \n     terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of \n     mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under \n     the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions make clear that it is in the national security \n     interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war \n     on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of \n     force if necessary;\n       Whereas Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the \n     war on terrorism through the provision of authorities and \n     funding requested by the President to take the necessary \n     actions against international terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations, including those nations, organizations or \n     persons who planned, authorized, committed or aided the \n     terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or \n     harbored such persons or organizations;\n       Whereas the President and Congress are determined to \n     continue to take all appropriate actions against \n     international terrorists and terrorist organizations, \n     including those nations, organizations or persons who \n     planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons \n

Mr. President, it is my sincere pleasure to rise in \nsupport of the nomination of Lawrence Block to the United States Court \nof Federal Claims.\n  Larry hardly needs an introduction, since he has served on the staff \nof the Judiciary Committee for the past eight years. Those of us who \nhave worked with him know that he is an incredibly talented lawyer \nwhose broad legal experience spans private practice, all three branches \nof the Federal Government, and academia.\n  Larry earned a B.A. degree from New York University magna cum laude \nbefore earning his law degree from The John Marshall Law School in \n1981. He began his legal career as a clerk for the Honorable Roger J. \nMiner, who at the time was a U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of New York and who now sits on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. After his clerkship, Larry worked as an associate in the high-\npowered New York office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, \nwhere his practice included constitutional claims pertaining to \nCommerce Clause and commercial speech issues, as well as litigation \ninvolving financial services, mergers and acquisitions, securities, \nlabor law, and administrative law.\n  After several years in private practice, Larry returned to public \nservice, and served with distinction in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, \nand Clinton Administrations. From 1986 to 1990, he worked in the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, first in the Commercial Litigation Branch, then \nas Senior Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Policy and Policy \nDevelopment. From 1990 to 1994, Larry served as Acting General Counsel \nfor Legal Policy and Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Legal Policy \nat the U.S. Department of Energy, where he spearheaded a number of \ncomplex legal projects. Despite his demanding workload, he found time \nto teach as an adjunct professor at George Mason University School of \nLaw.\n  In 1994, I was able to persuade Larry to leave the executive branch \nto come work for me. I have first-hand knowledge of his legal talents, \nand have nothing but respect for his abilities, especially in light of \nthe significant health-related obstacles that he has overcome. Several \nyears ago, Larry suffered a debilitating stroke during heart surgery. \nAlthough his prognosis was grim, Larry defied the odds by making a full \nrecovery. He is now in excellent health. I know that Larry is proud of \nhaving overcome this temporary setback, and I have no doubt that he \nwill take to the federal bench the same perseverance that aided his \nrecovery.\n  During his tenure on my staff, Larry has amply demonstrated his keen \nlegal mind. But, just as importantly, he has shown repeatedly his \nfairness and willingness to listen to all sides of an issue before \nexercising his judgment. This is why he is a staffer admired and \nrespected on both sides of the aisle.\n  I will miss Larry's sage advice and counsel, but our loss will be the \ngain of the Court of Claims, where I am confident that Larry will serve \nas an impartial judge who will follow precedent to achieve uniformity \nand consistency in the law. I wish him all the best.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/02/senate-section/article/S9858-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9858]]\n                      NOMINATION OF JAMES GARDNER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my \nstrong support for Judge James Gardner who President Bush nominated for \nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. The American Bar Association has rated Judge Gardner \n``well-qualified'' to sit on the bench.\n  Judge Gardner graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. degree from Yale \nUniversity and received his J.D. degree from Harvard University Law \nSchool. After graduating from law school, Judge Gardner joined the law \nfirm of Duane, Morris & Hecksher as an Associate. After leaving that \nprestigious firm, he became a partner in the law firm of Gardner, \nGardner, & Racines in Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n  He began his career in public service as Solicitor to the Lehigh \nCounty Treasurer and later as an Assistant District Attorney in Lehigh \nCounty. Judge Gardner served his country on active duty with the United \nStates Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps and in the Navy Reserve. \nCurrently, Judge Gardner serves as a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas \nof Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. He has served in all divisions of that \ncourt and has presided over 265 jury trials and innumerable hearings. \nHe has also written over 1,000 legal opinions and adjudications, 138 of \nwhich have been published.\n  Judge Gardner is very active in his community.

Mr. President, birth defects are the leading cause of \ninfant mortality in the United States. They account for more than 20 \npercent of all infant deaths. Of the nearly 120,000 babies born in the \nUnited States each year with a birth defect, 8,000 will die during \ntheir first year of life. This tragic loss of life is unconscionable \nand unacceptable when so many birth defects are preventable.\n  This legislation will provide new hope for families across the \ncountry by\n\n[[Page S9860]]\n\ndeveloping better ways to identify the causes of birth defects, better \nways to prevent them, and better ways to apply what we already know.\n  The legislation gives strong new support to the National Center on \nBirth Defects and Developmental Disabilities in the ongoing effort to \nimprove the health of the nation's children. The Center's leadership in \nreducing birth defects by educating pregnant women about the benefits \nof folic acid and the dangers of alcohol and drugs, can save thousands \nof children from suffering the lifelong effects of preventable birth \ndefects.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this bipartisan legislation, and I \ncommend Senator Bond and Senator Dodd for their leadership and their \ncontinuing commitment to improving the health of children.\n  Mr. REID.
