Mr. President, Earth Day is today. Most of the celebrations \ntook place this weekend. People are interested in this program all over \nthe country. Gaylord Nelson, a Senator from Wisconsin, came up with \nthis idea. It has caught fire. People are more concerned about the \nenvironment than ever.\n  I indicated the other day the reason we have the Clean Water Act is \nthat for example, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio kept catching fire. Yes, \nthey had to put out the fire on the river on a number of occasions \nbecause it was so polluted. It was determined at that time that 80 \npercent of our rivers and streams in the United States were polluted; \nonly 20 percent were not.\n  As a result of that river catching fire, Congress, and then President \nNixon, decided something had to be done. The Clean Water Act was \npassed. It was imperfect legislation, but it has made great strides \ntoward improving the waterways of this country. Some say the numbers \nhave reversed, that now only 20 percent of the rivers and streams are \npolluted. That is probably inaccurate--it is probably more than that--\nbut progress has been made.\n  Fish are returning to rivers that were once so polluted they could \nnot survive in the water. There are rivers and streams now where people \ncan catch fish and actually eat them; they are not toxic to eat.\n  People realize Earth Day should apply not only to places in the \nmountains where it is greener but more fragile habitat such as the \ndesert, from where I come. The Mojave Desert is the driest and most \nunforgiving region in North America. Yet to most it is also one of the \nmost beautiful, awe-inspiring places in America. It is fragile because \nof the extreme climate. It is not unusual to see extremes of 40 degrees \nfrom morning to night.\n  I have learned the Earth heals very slowly from the impact of people. \nI didn't realize that as a boy. I don't think a lot of people realized \nhow fragile the desert was. I mentioned the\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nother day that I have seen the tracks made 50 years ago or more where \nPatton and his troops did war exercises in the desert. I was in that \npart of the desert a couple weeks ago. It was amazing to still see \nthose tank tracks in the desert. They will be there probably for \nanother 50 years, if not more.\n  More people each year understand how important it is to conserve our \nland and its rich resources. While this administration's environmental \nrollbacks are getting too numerous to count, they started with, of \ncourse, the infamous problem of arsenic in the water--saying there was \nno problem, regardless of how much arsenic was in the water.\n  While this administration's environmental rollbacks are too numerous \nto count, the one that stands out the most in my mind is the \ntransportation of nuclear waste. The reason this has been so difficult \nfor me to accept is the President came to Nevada on one occasion. He \ncame to northern Nevada, the Lake Tahoe area, and would not take \nquestions from the press during his campaign. He was afraid people \nwould ask questions about nuclear waste. His position had been contrary \nto the interests of residents of Nevada. As the campaign rolled on and \nit was determined that Nevada electoral votes might become very \nimportant in the Presidential race, he sent people to Nevada on his \nbehalf and explained: President Bush thinks nuclear waste is an \nimportant issue and he will not allow nuclear waste to come to Nevada \nunless there is sound science. Vice President Cheney came when he was \ncampaigning. President Bush issued a statement to that effect, \nunequivocally saying nuclear waste would not come to Nevada unless \nthere was sound science. He came to Nevada only on one occasion during \nthe campaign. But, since he came to Nevada, that science has gone \ndownhill from the perspective of the nuclear power industry. In fact, \nthere are 292 scientific investigative reports, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, that have not been completed. In addition to \nthat, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has stated that the \nscience is poor. In addition to that, the Winston & Strawn law firm, \nwhich was giving legal advice to the Secretary of Energy for the sum of \nmillions of dollars, was also getting millions of dollars from the \nNuclear Energy Institute. If there were ever a direct conflict of \ninterest, that was it, and the inspector general from the Department of \nEnergy said so in written form.\n\n  So we have the General Accounting Office, inspector general of the \nDepartment of Energy, and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \nsaying: Secretary Abraham, don't make this recommendation now. You \ndon't have the facts at your disposal to show there is good science. In \nspite of that, Secretary Abraham went ahead and did this anyway, and it \nwas confirmed 1 day later by President Bush.\n  The people of Nevada are extremely disappointed in how President Bush \nhandled this issue. So this is only one indication of how the President \nhas handled the environment.\n  We have to work together to protect our environment from threats for \nour children and for their children. All future generations deserve \nclean water to drink, safe air to breathe, and communities free of \ndangerous chemicals. That is for certain.\n  In Nevada, we have taken important steps to protect our Nation's \nthreatened and endangered species, even though, I repeat, Nevada is a \ndesert, mostly. We have been either third or fourth, sometimes fifth, \namong the States that have listings in that regard. But we have made \nprogress.\n  Construction came to a halt in Las Vegas because of the desert \ntortoise, and we have had problems in some of our rivers because of \nthreatened and endangered species, but we have met those challenges. We \nhave met them, especially in the southern Nevada area, a rapidly \ngrowing Las Vegas area, in a very inventive--I would say not only \ninventive way, but a way that will be used in future endangered species \nactions.\n  This was difficult to obtain, but we were able to get this with \nSecretary Babbitt, and I am convinced Secretary Norton will follow the \nsame routine that Secretary Babbitt established as relates to \nendangered species in the southern Nevada area.\n  We have done some things that are extremely important to preserve \nareas around Las Vegas, including the Red Rock National Recreation \narea. We have been able to do some good things for Lake Tahoe and \nPyramid Lake. We have done things with the Lake Mead area.\n  So we have a lot to celebrate in Nevada about our environmental \naccomplishments. But they are not secure. We believe there are other \nactions that need to be taken. One of the things we have been able to \ndo--and this Congress really needs to talk positively about--is the \nbrownfields legislation. That was legislation I authored. We were able \nto report that out of the Environment and Public Works Committee where \nI served during my entire time in the Senate.\n  I have been chairman of that committee on two separate occasions. \nDuring the time I have been there, we have had the opportunity to help \nimprove many of our bedrock environmental laws, including the Clean \nWater Act, the Clean Air Act, Food Quality Protection Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. But the \nBrownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, \nto clean up contaminated sites in rural areas and inner cities, has \nbeen very important. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and \ncreate millions and millions in revenues--actually over $2 billion in \nrevenue--for local government.\n\n  This took a piece of the Superfund legislation and improved upon \nthat. We could not totally rework the Superfund legislation as needed, \nbut we were able to take a small piece of it and do things of which all \ncities in America were supportive. It was supported by the National \nLeague of Cities and the National Council of Mayors. As a result, we \nwere able to pass this legislation.\n  It took a while to get it out of the House, but we were finally able \nto get it out. It took almost a year to get it out of the House.\n  We have made progress, in addition to that, toward reducing air \npollution. That is what some of these general laws have done in years \npast. As I have indicated, with drinking water threats such as arsenic \nand others, we need to do better.\n  We have worked to protect our Nation's threatened and endangered \nspecies, bringing back American symbols such as the bald eagle. I was \nable to go to the west front of the Capitol about a month ago. We had a \nbald eagle fly in. We were able to see that beautiful bird. I had never \nbeen that close to an eagle--really this close--with those piercing \neyes. Those eyes can see a fish in the water a mile away, I am told.\n  Mr. President, I know this administration has taken steps to erode \nsome of these accomplishments about which I have spoken, and on nearly \nevery front. On this Earth Day, I think we should recognize this \nadministration has denied the reality of global warming by walking away \nfrom the international negotiating table on climate change. This \nadministration has threatened to undermine a Clean Air Act program \nwhich would clean up pollution from our powerplants. This \nadministration has proposed to cut funding for enforcement of our \nlandmark environmental laws. This administration has opposed efforts to \ndevelop renewable energy and to make our vehicles more efficient. This \nadministration has tried to exploit the National Wildlife Refuge at the \nrequest of the big oil companies.\n  Today the President is in the Adirondack Mountains or someplace in \nNew York--I think that is where I heard in the news that he was--to \ncelebrate Earth Day. I am glad the administration recognizes the \nimportance of Earth Day. But I think we should look at some of the \nbasic laws that are being underfunded and undermined by the policies of \nthis administration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will speak in morning business. There \nare a couple of issues before us. First of all, I urge that we move \nback as soon as possible--I understand we will at 2 o'clock--to our \nenergy bill. Certainly, there is nothing more important before\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\nus now than the completion of that bill and being able to send it on to \nthe President. Certainly, it is not going to have everything in it that \neverybody wanted. That is not a new idea. This is a bill that has been \non the floor for 5 weeks. But it does have some good things in it. It \nhas some basic energy policy materials that we have not had for a very \nlong time. It has some of the things the President and Vice President \nhad put forth. Unfortunately, some of those it does not.\n  I was and am a supporter of ANWR. I think that could be done as a \nmultiple-use project. I certainly agree with protecting the \nenvironment, as the Senator from Nevada was talking about, but I am \nalso a great promoter of multiple use. Since 50 percent of my State \nbelongs to the Federal Government, we have to be very certain that we \nhave a chance to use it. So I hope we move forward with that.\n  Upon its completion, I hope we take a look at trade promotion \nauthority. There is probably nothing more important to us in terms of \nour economy and us being part of world trade. Billions of dollars move \naround this world every day. Yet for a number of years we have not \nauthorized the President to go ahead with negotiations and to bring \nthose negotiations back to the Congress, which is what this trade \nauthority bill provides.\n  We had a meeting this morning, and a press conference, talking about \nthe agricultural aspect of foreign trade. Some are concerned about \ncertain crops. But the bottom line is about more than a third, nearly \n40 percent, of our agricultural production goes overseas. Our market \nhere only consumes about 60 percent of what we produce, and that leaves \n40 percent that has to go somewhere else, to new markets. To do that, \nwe need a trade bill. That is where I think we really ought to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S2995-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX DAY\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, recently we had a day called Tax Day. I \nthink most of us thought a lot about taxes. We talked a lot about the \nprocess of filling in our tax forms and paying our taxes. I do not know \nabout everyone else, but I came out of that with the renewed notion \nthat we certainly need to take a look at making taxes more simple and \nthat we need to simplify the Tax Code. The problem is, of course, that \nwe are moving just exactly in the opposite way. We spent 7 or 8 years \ntalking about simplification of the Tax Code, and every year it becomes \nless so. I hope we can address making the Tax Code simpler. The purpose \nof the Tax Code is to raise money in a fair way.\n  The definition of a tax is a charge of money imposed by authority \nupon persons or property for public purposes. You have to have taxes. \nNo one argues with that. But it is not a voluntary act. It is an \nimposition of authority upon people, and the imposition--in many cases, \nbecause of the process--is unreasonable.\n  I am persuaded that the current Tax Code remains overly complicated, \nburdensome, and frustrating to the American taxpayer. I believe we find \nourselves often more in the business of trying to manage behavior \nthrough taxes than we are of fairly raising money. If we have something \nwe want done, and if someone wants to wear a red shirt and part their \nhair in the middle, we say: We will give you a tax deduction for doing \nthat. All of that makes it much more complicated than in the past. It \nis now inefficient. It is inefficient in the allocation of financial \nresources for communities. Certainly, we are not able to supervise it \nand audit it very easily because it is so complicated.\n  I am proud to have supported President Bush's tax relief bill last \nyear. We made some effort to reduce the burden of taxes. Certainly, \nthat doesn't help in terms of the complication that goes into filling \nout tax forms.\n  One hundred and four million individuals and families will receive a \ntax reduction of about $1,000 from that action. That is good. Nearly 43 \nmillion married couples will receive an average deduction of $1,700. \nThat is very good. Thirty-eight million filers with children will \nreceive an average deduction of about $1,460.\n  However, we certainly have not finished our work. Obviously, there \nneeds to be an effort made to make permanent the inheritance tax, or \nthe death tax. That has to be done. I think we need to simplify the Tax \nCode. We need to continue to do that. I know that is easy to say and \nmuch more difficult to do. We need incentives to make that happen.\n  But the other side of that is that taxpayers spend, according to a \nreport, over 6 billion hours filling out IRS forms. The estimated cost \nof compliance is close to $200 billion annually. That is a drain on \nresources. That should not happen.\n  I hope we can take a basic look at where we want to be in terms of \nthis issue. It is too complicated, it is too expensive, and it is \nhopeless to figure out how much we owe. That shouldn't have to be the \ncase. We have worked on it and talked about it at least for a number of \nyears, but we have not done much.\n  Another important area in which we need to make substantive changes \nis health care. We talk about cost and who is going to pay for it. We \nneed to give more thought to how to make substantive changes. The same \nis true with taxes. We ought to go back to the basics: Here is the \namount of money that has to be raised. What is the fair way to do it? \nWe need to do it in a simple way, and we need to sit down in a \nreasonable time and do it.\n\n  Some have said Paul O'Neill, Secretary of the Treasury, said the tax \nlaws are abominably full of absurdities. He is exactly right about \nthat. We have about 17,000 pages in the code. Most of it, of course, \ncomes from the Congress. Each day practically, we try to do something \nmore with taxes to affect behavior.\n  I think it is time we take a clean look at that and say the purpose \nof Tax Day is to support the necessary functions of government. It \nshould be simpler for people to comply, and we ought to start with that \npremise and do it.\n  I hope we can move forward to do that. I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in reviewing my press clips this \nmorning, I saw an interview between Brit Hume on ``FOX News Sunday'' \nand Dennis Ross, President Clinton's Middle East envoy. Many of us have \nfollowed closely the negotiations at Camp David, and also at Taba, but \nnever before have we really heard Dennis Ross comment on these \nnegotiations.\n  For the first time this past Sunday, we did. I was really quite \nsurprised by these comments. I thought they were of such significance \nthat I ask unanimous consent to have the entire interview printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Transcript: Dennis Ross, Former U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East\n\n       Following is a transcripted excerpt from FOX News Sunday, \n     April 21, 2002.\n       Brit Hume (host). Former Middle East envoy Dennis Ross has \n     worked to achieve Middle East peace throughout President \n     Clinton's final days in office. In the months following \n     Clinton's failed peace summit at Camp David, U.S. negotiators \n     continued behind-the-scenes peace talks with the Palestinians \n     and Israelis up until January 2001, and that followed \n     Clinton's presentation of ideas at the end of December 2000.\n       Dennis Ross joins us now with more details on all that, and \n     Fred Barnes joins the questioning.\n       So, Dennis, talk to us a little bit, if you can--I might \n     note that we're proud to able to say that you're a Fox News \n     contributing analyst.\n       Dennis Ross (Fmr. U.S. special envoy to the Middle East). \n     Thank you.\n       Hume. Talk to us about the sequence of events. The Camp \n     David talks, there was an offer. That was rejected. Talks \n     continued. You come now to December, and the president has a \n     new set of ideas. What unfolded?\n       Ross. Let me give you the sequence, because I think it puts \n     all this in perspective.\n       Number one, at Camp David we did not put a comprehensive \n     set of ideas on the table. We put ideas on the table that \n     would have affected the borders and would have affected \n     Jerusalem.\n       Arafat could not accept any of that. In fact, during the 15 \n     days there, he never himself raised a single idea. His \n     negotiators did, to be fair to them, but he didn't. The only \n     new idea he raised at Camp David was that the temple didn't \n     exist in Jerusalem, it existed in Nablus.\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\n       Hume. This is the temple where Ariel Sharon paid a visit, \n     which was used as a kind of pre-text for the beginning of the \n     new intifada, correct?\n       Ross. This is the core of the Jewish faith.\n       Hume. Right.\n       Ross. So he was denying the core of the Jewish faith there. \n     After the summit, he immediately came back to us and he said, \n     ``We need to have another summit,'' to which we said, ``We \n     just shot our wad. We got a no from you. You're prepared \n     actually to do a deal before we go back to something like \n     that.''\n       He agreed to set up a private channel between his people \n     and the Israelis, which I joined at the end of August. And \n     there were serious discussions that went on, and we were \n     poised to present out ideas the end of September, which is \n     when the intifada erupted. He knew we were poised to present \n     the ideas. His own people were telling him they looked good. \n     And we asked him to intervene to ensure there wouldn't be \n     violence after the Sharon visit, the day after. He said he \n     would. He didn't lift a finger.\n       Now, eventually we were able to get back to a point where \n     private channels between the two sides led each of them to \n     again ask us to present the ideas. This was in early \n     December. We brought the negotiators here.\n       Hume. Now, this was a request to the Clinton \n     administration----\n       Ross. Yes.\n       Hume [continuing]. To formulate a plan. Both sides wanted \n     this?\n       Ross. Absolutely.\n       Hume. All right.\n       Ross. Both sides asked us to present these ideas.\n       Hume. All right. And they were?\n       Ross. The ideas were presented on December 23 by the \n     president, and they basically said the following: On borders, \n     there would be about a 5 percent annexation in the West Bank \n     for the Israelis and a 2 percent swap. So there would be a \n     net 97 percent of the territory that would go to the \n     Palestinians.\n       On Jerusalem, the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem \n     would become the capitol of the Palestinian state.\n       On the issue of refuges, there would be a right of return \n     for the refugees to their own state, not to Israel, but there \n     would also be a fund of $30 billion internationally that \n     would be put together for either compensation or to cover \n     repatriation, resettlement, rehabilitation costs.\n       And when it came to security, there would be a \n     international presence, in place of the Israelis, in the \n     Jordan Valley.\n       These were ideas that were comprehensive, unprecedented, \n     stretched very far, represented a culmination of an effort in \n     our best judgment as to what each side could accept after \n     thousands of hours of debate, discussion with each side.\n       Barnes. Now, Palestinian officials say to this day that \n     Arafat said yes.\n       Ross. Arafat came to the White House on January 2. Met with \n     the president, and I was there in the Oval Office. He said \n     yes, and then he added reservations that basically meant he \n     rejected every single one of the things he was supposed to \n     give.\n       Hume. What was he supposed to give?\n       Ross. He was supposed to give, on Jerusalem, the idea that \n     there would be for the Israelis sovereignty over the Western \n     Wall, which would cover the areas that are of religious \n     significance to Israel. He rejected that.\n       Hume. He rejected their being able to have that?\n       Ross. He rejected that.\n       He rejected the idea on the refugees. He said we need a \n     whole new formula, as if what we had presented was non-\n     existent.\n       He rejected the basic ideas on security. He wouldn't even \n     countenance the idea that the Israelis would be able to \n     operate in Palestinian airspace.\n       You know when you fly into Israel today you go to Ben \n     Gurion. You fly in over the West Bank because you can't--\n     there's no space through otherwise. He rejected that.\n       So every single one of the ideas that was asked of him he \n     rejected.\n       Hume. Now, let's take a look at the map. Now, this is \n     what--how the Israelis had created a map based on the \n     president's ideas. And----\n       Ross. Right.\n       Hume. [continuing]. What can we--that situation shows that \n     the territory at least is contiguous. What about Gaza on that \n     map?\n       Ross. The Israelis would have gotten completely out of \n     Gaza. And what you see also in this line, they show an area \n     of temporary Israelis control along the border.\n       Hume. Right.\n       Ross. Now, that was an Israeli desire. That was not what we \n     presented. But we presented something that did point out that \n     it would take six years before the Israelis would be totally \n     out of the Jordan Valley.\n       So that map there that you see, which shows a very narrow \n     green space along the border, would become part of the \n     orange. So the Palestinians would have in the West Bank an \n     area that was contiguous. Those who say there were cantons, \n     completely untrue. It was contiguous.\n       Hume. Cantons being ghettos, in effect----\n       Ross. Right.\n       Hume [continuing]. That would be cut off from other parts \n     of the Palestinian state.\n       Ross. Completely untrue.\n       And to connect Gaza with the West Bank, there would have \n     been an elevated highway, an elevated railroad, to ensure \n     that there would be not just safe passage for the \n     Palestinians, but free passage.\n       Barnes. I have two other questions. One, the Palestinians \n     point out that this was never put on paper, this offer. Why \n     not?\n       Ross. We presented this to them so that they could record \n     it. When the president presented it, he went over it at \n     dictation speed. He then left the cabinet room. I stayed \n     behind. I sat with them to be sure, and checked to be sure \n     that every single word.\n       The reason we did it this way was to be sure they had it \n     and they could record it. But we told the Palestinians and \n     Israelis, if you cannot accept these ideas, this is the \n     culmination of the effort, we withdraw them. We did not want \n     to formalize it. We wanted them to understand we meant what \n     we said. You don't accept it, it's not for negotiation, this \n     is the end of it, we withdraw it.\n       So that's why they have it themselves recorded. And to this \n     day, the Palestinians have not presented to their own people \n     what was available.\n       Barnes. In other words, Arafat might use it as a basis for \n     further negotiations so he'd get more?\n       Ross. Well, exactly.\n       Hume. Which is what, in fact, he tried to do, according to \n     your account.\n       Ross. We treated it as not only a culmination. We wanted to \n     be sure it couldn't be a floor for negotiations.\n       Hume. Right.\n       Ross. It couldn't be a ceiling. It was the roof.\n       Hume. This was a final offer?\n       Ross. Exactly. Exactly right.\n       Hume. This was the solution.\n       Barnes. Was Arafat alone in rejecting it? I mean, what \n     about his negotiators?\n       Ross. It's very clear to me that his negotiators understood \n     this was the best they were ever going to get. They wanted \n     him to accept it. He was not prepared to accept it.\n       Hume. Now, it is often said that this whole sequence of \n     talks here sort of fell apart or ended or broke down or \n     whatever because of the intervention of the Israeli \n     elections. What about that?\n       Ross. The real issue you have to understand was not the \n     Israeli elections. It was the end of the Clinton \n     administration. The reason we would come with what was a \n     culminating offer was because we were out of time.\n       They asked us to present the ideas, both sides. We were \n     governed by the fact that the Clinton administration was \n     going to end, and both sides said we understand this is the \n     point of decision.\n       Hume. What, in your view, was the reason that Arafat, in \n     effect, said no?\n       Ross. Because fundamentally I do not believe he can end the \n     conflict. We had one critical clause in this agreement, and \n     that clause was, this is the end of the conflict.\n       Arafat's whole life has been governed by struggle and a \n     cause. Everything he has done as leader of the Palestinians \n     is to always leave his options open, never close a door. He \n     was being asked here, you've got to close the door. For him \n     to end the conflict is to end himself.\n       Hume. Might it not also have been true, though, Dennis, \n     that, because the intifada had already begun--so you had the \n     Camp David offer rejected, the violence begins anew, a new \n     offer from the Clinton administration comes along, the \n     Israelis agree to it, Barak agrees to it----\n       Ross. Yes.\n       Hume [continuing]. Might he not have concluded that the \n     violence was working?\n       Ross. It is possible he concluded that. It is possible he \n     thought he could do and get more with the violence. There's \n     no doubt in my mind that he thought the violence would create \n     pressure on the Israelis and on us and maybe the rest of the \n     world.\n       And I think there's one other factor. You have to \n     understand that Barak was able to reposition Israel \n     internationally. Israel was seen as having demonstrated \n     unmistakably it wanted peace, and the reason it wasn't \n     available, achievable was because Arafat wouldn't accept it.\n       Arafat needed to re-establish the Palestinians as a victim, \n     and unfortunately they are a victim, and we see it now in a \n     terrible way.\n       Hume. Dennis Ross, thank you so much.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on Camp David, let me quote Dennis \nRoss, President Clinton's Middle East envoy and a person who literally \ncarried out thousands of hours of negotiation. He said:\n\n       Let me give you the sequence [of events], because I think \n     it puts all this in perspective. Number one, at Camp David we \n     did not put a comprehensive set of ideas on the table. We put \n     ideas on the table that would have affected borders and would \n     have affected Jerusalem.\n       Arafat could not accept any of that. In fact, during the 15 \n     days there he never himself raised a single idea. His \n     negotiators did, to be fair to them, but he didn't. The only \n     new ideas he raised at Camp David was that the temple didn't \n     exist in Jerusalem, it existed in Nablus . . . So he was \n     denying the core of the Jewish faith there.\n\n  On the eruption of the Intifada:\n\n       After the summit, he immediately came back to us and he \n     said, ``We need to have another summit,'' to which we said, \n     ``We just shot our wad. We got a no from you. You're prepared \n     actually to do a deal before we go back to something like \n     that.''\n       He agreed to set up a private channel between his people \n     and the Israelis, which I joined at the end of August. And \n     there were serious discussions that went on, and we\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\n     were poised to present our ideas the end of September, which \n     is when the intifada erupted.\n       He knew we were poised to present the ideas. His own people \n     were telling him they looked good. And we asked him to \n     intervene to ensure there wouldn't be violence after the \n     Sharon visit, the day after. He said he would. He didn't lift \n     a finger.\n\n  On a final plan in December:\n\n       Now, eventually we were able to get back to a point where \n     private channels between the two sides led each of them to \n     again ask us to present the ideas. This was in early \n     December. We brought the negotiators here.\n       The ideas were presented on December 23 by the President, \n     and they basically said the following:\n       On borders, there would be about a 5 percent annexation in \n     the West Bank for the Israelis and a 2 percent swap. So there \n     would be a net 97 percent of the territory that would go to \n     the Palestinians.\n       On Jerusalem, the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem \n     would become the capitol of the Palestinian state.\n       On the issue of refugees, there would be a right of return \n     for the refugees to their own state, not to Israel, but there \n     would also be a fund of $30 billion internationally that \n     would be put together for either compensation or to cover \n     repatriation, resettlement, rehabilitation costs.\n       And when it came to security, there would be an \n     international presence, in place of the Israelis, in the \n     Jordan Valley.\n       These were ideas that were comprehensive, unprecedented, \n     stretched very far, represented a culmination of an effort in \n     our best judgment as to what each side could accept after \n     thousands of hours of debate, discussion with each side.\n       Arafat came to the White House on January 2.\n\n  Mr. President, it was January 2, just before President Clinton left \noffice.\n\n       Met with the president, and I was there--\n\n  ``I'' being Dennis Ross--\n\n     in the Oval Office. He said yes, and then he added \n     reservations that basically meant he rejected every single \n     one of the things he was supposed to give.\n       He [was] supposed to give, on Jerusalem, the idea that \n     there would be for the Israelis sovereignty over the Western \n     Wall, which would cover the areas that are of religious \n     significance to Israel. He rejected that.\n       He rejected the idea on the refugees. He said we need a \n     whole new formula, as if what we had presented was non-\n     existent.\n       He rejected the basic ideas on security. He wouldn't even \n     countenance the idea that the Israelis would be able to \n     operate in Palestinian airspace.\n\n  This is commercial aviation.\n\n       You know when you fly into Israel today you go to Ben \n     Gurion. You fly in over the West Bank because you can't--\n     there's no space through otherwise. He rejected that.\n       So every single one of the ideas that was asked of him he \n     rejected.\n\n  Dennis Ross then went on to say:\n\n       It's very clear to me that his negotiators understood this \n     was the best they were ever going to get. They wanted him to \n     accept it. He was not prepared to accept it.\n\n  Then on why Arafat said no. Dennis Ross said:\n\n       Because fundamentally I do not believe he can end the \n     conflict. We had one critical clause in this agreement, and \n     that clause was, this is the end of the conflict.\n       Arafat's whole life has been governed by struggle and a \n     cause. Everything he has done as leader of the Palestinians \n     is to always leave his options open, never close a door. He \n     was being asked here, you've got to close the door. For him \n     to end the conflict is to end himself.\n\n  Now, he was asked the question on whether Arafat believed he could \nget more through violence. This is how Dennis Ross responded. And I \nquote:\n\n       It is possible he concluded that. It is possible he thought \n     he could do and get more with the violence. There's no doubt \n     in my mind that he thought the violence would create pressure \n     on the Israelis and on us and maybe the rest of the world.\n       And I think there's one other factor. You have to \n     understand that Barak was able to reposition Israel \n     internationally. Israel was seen as having demonstrated \n     unmistakably it wanted peace, and the reason it wasn't \n     available, achievable was because Arafat wouldn't accept it.\n       Arafat needed to re-establish the Palestinians as a victim, \n     and unfortunately they are a victim, and we see it now in a \n     terrible way.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. REID. I did not see this interview on television over the \nweekend, so I appreciate very much the Senator from California bringing \nit to my attention and the attention of the Senate and the American \npeople.\n  But it appears to me that what he has said--``he,'' meaning Dennis \nRoss--is that Yasser Arafat could not take yes for an answer. It \nappears that he and his people got everything they asked for, and that \nstill was not good enough.\n  Is that how the Senator sees that?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I think that is exactly correct.\n  What Dennis Ross said, essentially, was the final negotiations, that \nhad been gone over prior to this meeting in the White House, had been \ngone over with the negotiators--that the implication is, that there was \nan assent to it by the negotiators, and then when the meeting was held \nin the White House, Arafat said, yes, but then he presented so many \nreservations that that clearly countermanded the ``yes.''\n  So the implication that is drawn from that, I say to the Senator, is \nthat you are absolutely right. When push came to shove, Yasser Arafat \nsaid no.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I appreciate very much the Senator from California \nbringing this to our attention. And I have a clear picture that what \nhas taken place in the Middle East since August a year ago is the \ndirect result of the inability of Yasser Arafat to accept what he had \nasked for in the first place; that is, all the violence, all the \ndeaths, all the destruction, I personally place at his footsteps.\n  I want the Senator from California to know how I personally feel, \nthat this man, to whom I tried to give every benefit of the doubt, has \nnone of my doubt any more. I think Yasser Arafat is responsible for the \nproblems in the Middle East totally.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I say to Senator Reid, thank you very much. I \nappreciate those comments. I think there are many in the Senate who \nshare those comments. What is so significant to me because I know \nDennis Ross--and Dennis Ross was really an excellent Middle East envoy, \nan excellent negotiator, fully knowledgeable about all of the points of \nconvention--and I thought if anybody had a chance of achieving a \nsettlement, it really was Dennis Ross and President Clinton. And, \nclearly, that did not happen. I think on this ``FOX News Sunday,'' \nDennis Ross clearly said why it did not happen.\n  So I appreciate those comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S2997-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE ARAFAT ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, today is the 32nd anniversary of Earth \nDay. I think it is fitting, then, to say a few words about the world's \nNo. 1 environmental problem; and that is clearly global warming. It is \nalso fitting because last week the east coast of our country \nexperienced its first April heat wave in more than a quarter of a \ncentury. Even more disturbing, in February, an iceberg, the size of \nRhode Island, collapsed from the Antarctic ice shelf.\n  The Earth's average temperature has risen 1.3 degrees in the last 100 \nyears. Computer models predict an increase of 2 to 6 degrees over the \nnext century.\n  The 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1986. What \ndoes that mean? Today the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide--\nthat is our No. 1 greenhouse gas--is 30 percent higher than \npreindustrial levels. This may seem to be a small change, but just a \nfew upticks in temperature can produce catastrophic conditions in \nweather. So the window of time to do something to curb global warming \nis closing fast.\n  One of my disappointments with the energy bill is the fact that there \nis no substantive action taken to reduce our Nation's profligate carbon \ndioxide pollution.\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\n  California is in a unique and precarious position. With a population \nof 34 million people today and an expected population of 50 million by \n2020, the State is particularly vulnerable to global climate change. \nGlobal warming could make California's water even more scarce, create \nfurther flooding, destroy certain agricultural crops, and lead to more \nfrequent and intense Sierra forest fires. Because global warming will \nlikely increase sea levels and since most of the population lives just \na stone's throw from the coast, the result could be flooding for \nmillions of Californians.\n  Actually, there has already been a significant rise in sea level \nalong the U.S. coast of about a tenth of an inch per year, which \ntranslates into about 11 inches per century.\n  The global sea level is rising about three times faster over the past \n100 years compared to the previous 3,000 years. The melting of polar \nice and land-based glaciers is expected to contribute a projected one-\nhalf to 3-foot sea level rise for the 21st century. That is enormous. \nJust a 20-inch rise in sea level from climate change could inundate \n3,200 to 7,300 square miles of dry land.\n  The Presiding Officer, coming from the State of Hawaii, knows how \nthat could impact his State.\n  This could eliminate as much as 50 percent of North America's coastal \nwetlands. In northern California, increased winter flows into San \nFrancisco Bay could increase the flooding risk and shift saltwater \nupstream from the bay. This is already happening. Saltwater levels are \nrising in the delta areas. This increased saltwater penetration into \nthe delta, which is the source of two-thirds of the drinking water for \nthe State, could affect water quality for millions of Californians.\n  The underlying cause of flooding is also very concerning. Mountain \nglaciers throughout the world seem to be receding. Glacier National \nPark may be glacier free by 2070, and the Sierra Nevada mountains may \nbe glacier free soon after. The Greenland ice sheet has already lost \nroughly 40 percent of its thickness over the past four decades. And \nshrinking ice caps may very well alter ocean circulation and storm \ntracks.\n  Rising sea level is not our only concern. Precipitation, rain, has \nincreased by 5 to 10 percent during the last century. Much of this was \nattributed to heavy and very heavy rainfall events which reaffirm the \nimportance of developing ways of storing this water during wet periods \nand having it available during times of drought, because global warming \nmeans more turbulent weather patterns; it means more hurricanes, more \ntornadoes. When it rains, the drops of rain are bigger, the rainfall is \nmore intense; ergo, the destruction is greater.\n  The report also pointed out that rising temperatures are likely to \nresult in less snow and more rain, quicker melting of the existing \nsnowpack, particularly at lower elevations, and a shift in runoff to \nearlier in the year.\n  While total runoff amounts haven't changed, the timing of that runoff \nis shifting to winter. In fact, the amount of runoff in the spring \nsnowmelt period--that is, April through July--in northern California \nhas actually dropped over the past century from 45 percent to 35 \npercent.\n\n  In normal winters, California's water gets stored in snowpacks until \nspring, and that is when the spring runoff fuels our reservoirs and is \nthere for drinking as well as farming.\n  Drought conditions may worsen, thereby destroying water-dependent \ncrops such as rice, cotton, and alfalfa. For many parts of the western \nUnited States, the shifting weather patterns brought on by global \nwarming could mean a greater risk of damage, life-threatening floods. \nAnd, of course, southwestern States worry that a 10-percent drop in \nflows in the Colorado River could lead to a 30-percent drop in water \nstorage behind the reservoirs along the Colorado, not to mention a 30-\npercent drop in hydroelectric generation on the Colorado itself. The \nstakes are very high.\n  Unfortunately, our country lags behind when it comes to providing the \nleadership necessary to stem this growing problem. Amazingly, some of \nus in Congress even question whether we have a problem in this regard. \nI believe if we don't act soon, our State, our Nation, and our planet \nwill pay a heavy price.\n  What should we do? The first thing, and the largest way of reducing \nthe No. 1 greenhouse gas, the No. 1 contributor to global warming, is \nto do something about carbon dioxide emissions in automobiles. That is \nfuel efficiency for automobiles.\n  We had this debate in the Senate earlier, and a bill presented by the \nSenator from Massachusetts to increase mileage standards to 35 miles \nper gallon went down to crashing defeat. There still is another item \nthat I am giving serious consideration to presenting as an amendment, \nand that is closure of the SUV/light truck loopholes. If SUVs were \nsimply required to meet the same fuel economy standards as automobiles, \nwe would prevent the emission of more than 200 million tons of carbon \ndioxide each year. This is 3 percent of the country's entire \nCO2 emissions. This in itself would be the largest single \nstep we could take at this time to reduce global warming.\n  The big three auto manufacturers continue to fight for the status \nquo. They oppose all increases in fuel efficiency. Last year, Senator \nSnowe and I and about 13 of our colleagues introduced the SUV/light \ntruck loophole closing legislation. What we said we wanted to do was, \nover the next 10-year period, bring SUVs and light trucks to the same \nlevel as other passenger vehicles. A study has been done by the \nNational Academy of Sciences. Senators Slade Gorton, Dick Bryan, and I \nbegan this effort some 3 years ago. I believe the technology is \navailable to make those changes. Instead, our automobile companies have \nchosen to make SUVs more like tanks than fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Consequently, we continue to pump out large amounts of carbon \ndioxide. I believe increased fuel economy standards represent the \nlogical first step in reducing mobile sources of carbon dioxide.\n  We also have to work to expand California's zero emission vehicle \nprogram and examine ways to promote cleaner and more efficient battery, \nelectric, fuel cell, or hybrid vehicles. We should also look toward \nreducing urban sprawl and our dependence on gas-guzzling vehicles.\n  The second action we should take is to increase the use of renewable \nenergy. Energy use by buildings and appliances accounts for a quarter \nof California's carbon dioxide emissions. We can solve this problem by \nproviding necessary tax credits and other incentives for energy-\nefficient buildings and appliances.\n  By operating more efficiently, we not only reduce waste and pollution \nthat contribute to global warming, we also save consumers and \nbusinesses money in the process.\n  Finally, I deeply believe that the President of the United States \nshould submit the Kyoto Protocol on climate change to the Senate and \nthat the Senate should take up the treaty and ratify it. This historic \nUnited Nations framework--established in 1997--aims to reduce \ngreenhouse gases by setting emissions targets and timetables for \nindustrialized nations.\n  To enter into force, the Kyoto Protocol must be ratified by at least \n55 countries, accounting for at least 55 percent of the total 1990 \ncarbon dioxide emissions of developed countries.\n  Even though we are only 4 percent of the world's population, we \naccount for 20 percent of the world's energy use. No other country is \nnearly as profligate.\n  Opponents of the treaty say there is no reason for the United States \nto do anything to combat global warming unless developing countries, \nsuch as China and India, also participate. In my view, this is simply \nshortsighted. As the most economically advanced nation, what we do sets \nthe standard for the rest of the world--like it or not. So if we want \nto reduce global warming, if we take this position, I believe other \nnations will follow.\n  President Clinton signed the treaty in 1998, but it was never \nsubmitted to the Senate, in part because the 67 votes needed to pass it \nwere simply not there. If the United States will not ratify this \ntreaty, at an absolute minimum, we need to come up with a way to \nsubstantially reduce our emissions on our own.\n  The bottom line is that this energy bill does not, in any way, shape, \nor form, actually reduce any of these emissions.\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\n  As the No. 1 contributor of greenhouse gases worldwide, I believe it \nis our responsibility to show leadership; and every day we wait, we \nlose an opportunity to reduce the threat of global warming. It is not \ntoo much to ask the world's economic and political superpower to \nprovide the necessary leadership to address global warming and, one \nday, to celebrate an Earth Day in which the United States has truly \ntaken the lead.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, Monday was April 15. That is the day \nAmericans file their income tax return with the IRS.\n  April 15 was also the deadline for Congress to complete its work on \nthe budget resolution for the Federal government. But, the deadline has \ncome and gone and we still don't have a budget.\n  It seems the Democratic leadership is reluctant to bring their \nproposed budget to the floor of the Senate for a vote. According to \nrecent press reports, they don't know if they have the votes to pass \ntheir budget.\n  What is interesting about the Democratic leadership's inability to \nfind enough votes to pass a budget is that the makeup of the Senate \nthis year is exactly the same as last year. With this same membership, \nRepublicans last year produced a bipartisan budget supported by 65 \nSenators, including 15 Democrats.\n  After taking a closer look at their budget, I am not surprised they \ndo not have the votes. The Democratic budget is a case study in \ncontradictions.\n  They claim to support the war on terrorism, but they don't fund the \nPresidents' request for defense. They say the President's tax cut was \ntoo big, but they don't delay or repeal it. They claim to protect \nSocial Security and Medicare, but they spend trust fund money on other \nprograms for the rest of the decade. In short, the Democratic budget \nsays one thing and does another.\n  Take a closer look at these contradictions.\n  First, according to the Democratic Budget Committee Report, ``the \nbudget resolution provides all of the resources requested by the \nPresident for the Department of Defense for the next 2 years. It \nincludes a reserve fund that will provide all of the defense funding \nrequested by the President in 2005 through 2012 if it becomes clear \nthat the funds are needed.''\n  In other words, the Democratic budget funds the President's request \nfor 2 years and then cuts it by $160 billion the next 8 years.\n  Their so called defense ``reserve fund'' is fraud. Unlike the other \nreserve funds in their budget--for Medicare, health care, and the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act--no money is actually being set aside \nfor defense.\n  Admittedly, the war on terrorism may not cost as much as the \nPresident has requested, but instead of honestly setting aside the \nextra money until we know for sure, the Democratic budget spends the \nmoney on other programs.\n  According to the Democratic Budget Committee Report, ``The \nPresident's budget does represent an appropriate response to the \nSeptember 11 attacks--it provides the resources that will allow our \narmed forces, homeland security personnel, and citizens to respond to \nthe challenge posed by terrorists. But--just as last year--the \nPresident's budget does not respond adequately to the other major \nchallenges facing this nation.''\n  In other words, the Democratic budget recognizes the potential need \nto fund the President's defense request, but insists other programs \nmust come first. Compared to the President's budget, the Democratic \nbudget spends $160 billion less on defense and $348 billion more on \neverything else.\n  The second contradiction in the Democratic budget is the issue of tax \ncuts.\n  The Democratic Budget Committee Report says, ``Last year our national \nleaders were presented with a golden opportunity to set this Nation on \na course to deal with the challenges facing it . . . But the President \nand Republicans in Congress instead pushed through a plan that had only \none priority--tax cuts . . . Becuase of the huge tax cut, there were \nnot enough resources left to address other challenges . . . The effects \nof this squandered opportunity are being felt this year.''\n  So how does the Democratic budget propose to deal with this so called \nsquandered opportunity. The Democratic Budget Committee Report states \n``the budget resolution assumes no repeal or delay of tax rate \nreductions that are scheduled to occur in future years under the law \nenacted last year.''\n  So if last year's tax cut was such a ``squandered opportunity,'' why \ndoesn't the Democratic budget do something about it?\n  The reason is simple. They know the American people are overtaxed. \nThey know twelve Democratic Senators vote for the tax cut signed into \nlaw by President Bush last year. They know their Senate colleagues will \nnot vote to delay or repeal the tax cut.\n  But instead of admitting these facts, the Democratic leadership \ncontinues its partisan attacks on Republicans for ``squandering'' the \nsurplus and ``raiding'' Social Security.\n  That brings us to the third and most outrageous contradiction of them \nall.\n  The Democratic Budget Committee Report states, ``The budget \nresolution recognizes that it is crucial to return the budget to \nbalance without Social Security as soon as possible . . .''\n  So how does the Democratic budget propose to do this? It contains a \nso called ``circuit breaker'' that would create a budget point-of-order \nagainst the consideration of next year's budget if it does not get to \nbalance--excluding Social Security--by 2008.\n  In other words, the Democratic budget believes it is so ``crucial'' \nto balance the budget without Social Security that it proposes to wait \nuntil next year. Apparently, ``as soon as possible'' doesn't apply to \nthis year.\n  During the Budget Committee markup, the chairman explained that he \nwas not requiring a plan to protect Social Security this year because \nthe economy was still weak and that it is unwise to engage in further \ndeficit reduction during our recovery.\n  One might be tempted to accept this explanation. But consider what \nthe chairman had to say when OMB Director Mitch Daniels testified \nbefore the Budget Committee.\n  The Budget Committee chairman stated, ``I'd be quick to acknowledge I \ncould live with [a deficit] in a year of economic downturn and at a \ntime of war. But you're not forecasting economic downturn for even \nlater this year--you're forecasting economic recovery. And for the rest \nof the decade, you're forecasting rather strong economic growth and yet \nyear after year you propose taking money from Social Security, taking \nmoney from Medicare . . . How do you justify it?''\n  Blaming the economy for their failure to make any effort to protect \nSocial Security is especially ironic given the Budget Committee \nchairman's view of how the economy works.\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\n  According to the chairman, the tax cuts reduced the surplus, thereby \ndriving up long-term interest rates which have a negative impact on the \neconomy.\n  If one accepts the chairman's view of the economy, the sooner \nCongress enacts a deficit reduction package, the sooner we can bring \ndown long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy.\n  But instead of having the courage of his economic convictions, the \nDemocratic budget fails to make any effort to reduce the deficit. \nInstead, it just digs the hole deeper.\n  The Democratic budget resolution dips into the Social Security trust \nfund and spends $1.3 trillion of the Social Security surplus on other \nprograms.\n  What is even more ironic about the Democratic budget ``circuit \nbreaker'' is that it only applies to Social Security. Last year, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee insisted that it was equally important \nto protect the Medicare trust fund as well.\n  Last year during the debate over the Social Security lockbox, the \nchairman stated, ``Some of us believe it is critically important that \nwe protect both the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare trust \nfund so they are not used for other spending in the Federal budget.'' \nApparently, that was then and this is now.\n  Now, the Democratic budget proposes to dip into the Medicare trust \nfund and spend $360 billion of the Medicare surplus on other programs.\n  The Democratic leadership would like the American public to believe \ntheir opposition to tax cuts is based on their desire to protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But the budget they have produced this year \nshows that is simply not true.\n  Despite what the Democratic leadership might say, their opposition to \ntax cuts has nothing to do with protecting Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  If they were so committed to protecting Social Security and Medicare, \nthey could have proposed to delay or repeal the tax cut. If they were \nso committed to protecting Social Security and Medicare, they could \nhave proposed to reduce other spending. But they chose to do none of \nthe above.\n  Instead, the Democratic leadership chose to produce a budget that \nincreases Federal spending and thereby spends $1.7 trillion of the \nSocial Security and Medicare surplus on other programs. That is the \ndirty little secret of the Democratic budget.\n  After spending all of last year and the first part of this year \nengaged in partisan attacks on a so called Republican tax cut--that \npassed with the votes of twelve Democrats--they have decided they would \nrather increase spending than protect Social Security and Medicare.\n  Now, I believe we all know why the Democratic leadership doesn't want \nto bring their budget resolution to the floor of the Senate for a \nvote--they are too embarrassed. I have to admit, I would be \nembarrassed, too.\n  Based on CBO latest projections, including the economic stimulus \nbill, the Federal budget will not have a surplus--excluding Social \nSecurity and Medicare--until 2011.\n  Instead of addressing these long-term deficits, the Democratic budget \nproposes to increase spending by $1.1 trillion.\n  ``New Spending'' shows how the Democratic budget would dig the \ndeficit hole even deeper.\n  The Democratic budget only achieves balance in 2012 by assuming the \ntax cut will expire.\n  Between now and 2011, the Democratic budget would spend $1.7 trillion \nfrom the Social Security and Medicare trust funds--$362 billion from \nMedicare and $1.32 trillion from Social Security.\n  The Democratic budget ``circuit breaker'' would require next year's \nbudget to get the balance--excluding Social Security--by 2008.\n  But this year's Democratic budget proposes to spend an additional \n$428 billion between 2004 and 2008.\n  In order to comply with the ``circuit breaker,'' next year's budget \nwould have to reduce spending or increase taxes by $424 billion.\n  In other words, next year's budget would have to repeal virtually \nevery dollar of additional spending provided by this year's budget.\n  If the ``circuit breaker'' were expanded to include Medicare, then \nnext year's budget would have to reduce spending or increase by $536 \nbillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is one thing to shoot yourself in the \nfoot, it is quite another thing to take aim before you shoot. That is \nwhat has happened in the last couple of weeks with respect to the State \nDepartment deciding to revoke the visas they previously granted to \nPedro Alvarez and other officials from a group called Alimport, which \nis a Cuban state-run purchaser of foreign goods.\n  Mr. Alvarez and others were invited to come from Cuba to the United \nStates, to come to North Dakota, to Iowa, and to other parts of farm \ncountry in the United States because they need food. The Cuban economy \nhas been injured, of course, by the hurricane, and they need food. As a \nresult of that, they have been purchasing food from the United States. \nWhy have they been purchasing food from the United States? Because I \nand some others took the lead in Congress to end the embargo with \nrespect to the shipment of food from the United States to Cuba.\n  That embargo has existed for decades. We ended that in the year 2000. \nThe result is that Cubans have bought $70 million-plus worth of food \nfrom us in the last few months.\n  It is kind of byzantine, because in order to buy food from us, they \nare required to pay cash and do it through a French bank. They work the \ntransaction through a French bank. Nonetheless, that is what they have \ndone.\n  Mr. Alvarez and the organization Alimport applied for visas to come \nto this country at the invitation of U.S. farm groups to buy additional \nwheat, eggs, dried beans, and other commodities. So they were given the \nvisas. Just a couple days later, the visas were yanked. The passports \nwere asked to be returned, and the visas were revoked. When I learned \nof that, I called the State Department.\n  Here is what the State Department told my staff. My staff asked: What \nis going on? Why did you revoke the visas of the people who were going \nto come from Cuba to purchase some additional United States food from \nour farmers?\n\n       It is the policy of this administration not to encourage \n     agricultural sales to Cuba.\n\n  Let me read that again. That is a most byzantine position.\n\n       It is the policy of this administration not to encourage \n     agricultural sales to Cuba.\n\n  We sell it to Communist China. Yes. That is a Communist government. \nWe sell food to Vietnam. Yes. That is a Communist government. We sell \nfood virtually all around the world. We fought for years to lift this \nembargo on food sales to Cuba. We are now selling food to Cuba, and we \nhave some people taking a brainless position down at the Department of \nState that it is not our position to encourage food sales to Cuba; \ntherefore, we will revoke the visas we previously granted to the head \nof Alimport to come into this country, to visit farm States, to \npurchase some dried beans, wheat, eggs, and other food products.\n  I am writing a letter today to Mr. Alvarez inviting him to come to \nthe United States. It is not from farm organizations. It is from me. I \nam sending a copy of that letter to the State Department saying: You \nhave an obligation to play straight.\n  When this country has the opportunity for family farmers to sell food \nto those in Cuba who need it and who are hungry and want access to that \nfood, we have a responsibility to our farmers, and the State Department \nhas a responsibility to the Congress to help make that happen.\n  Our farmers are facing really tough times. Prices have collapsed. \nThey have remained down for a long while. Then we have this embargo on \nfood sales and shipments to Cuba. We opened it just a bit and sold them \n$70 million worth of food. Now we have folks down in the State \nDepartment trying to play games with it once again.\n  I have asked the State Department: Who made these decisions? How did \nyou make the decision? Who demanded that the visas be revoked? I want \nto know who has their foot on the brake. I want to know who has one of \nthese hardheaded embargoes still going on\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nwith respect to Cuba. I want to know who is asking family farmers to be \npawns in this struggle they have with Cuba.\n  Let me say that Mr. Otto Reich, the administration's top Latin \nAmerican official, told a group of farmers: We are not going to be \n``economic suckers'' to Fidel Castro. That attitude is an insult to \nAmerican farmers. Our farmers produce food. They ought not be pawns in \nsome soft-headed foreign policy by which someone wants to prevent that \nfood from going to hungry people.\n  Does anyone here think Fidel Castro has ever missed a meal because we \nhave for 35 or 40 years not allowed farmers to send food to Cuba? Does \nanyone here think Fidel Castro has ever missed breakfast, lunch, or \ndinner? You know better than that.\n  This country is shooting itself in the foot. Mr. Reich and others are \ntaking aim before they do it. It is unforgivable. They have an \nobligation to play straight on this issue.\n  We have already debated this issue and made a decision on this issue. \nThe decision was that it is immoral to use food as a weapon, and we are \nnot going to do it anymore--not with Cuba, and not with other \ncountries.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter I sent to Mr. Colin Powell, Secretary of State, asking the \nquestions: Who made these decisions? How did they make these decisions? \nWhen did they make them?\n  I would also like to have printed in the Record a letter from two \ndozen agricultural organizations protesting the same decision to revoke \nthis visa. It includes the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nAmerican Meat Institute, Farmland Industries, the National Association \nof Wheat Growers, the U.S. Canola Association, the U.S. Dry Pea & \nLentil Council, U.S. Wheat Associates, and the list goes on and on.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Colin L. Powell,\n     Secretary of State, the State Department,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Powell: My office has been informed that the \n     State Department recently approved--then rescinded--a visit \n     for Pedro Alvarez, Chief of Alimport and other Cuban \n     officials, who wished to come here to buy U.S. farm products.\n       Their trip to the United States would have included a visit \n     to my state, North Dakota, where they had been invited by a \n     North Dakota farm organization which hoped to interest them \n     in buying some of North Dakota's excellent farm products. It \n     was to be a customary visit foreign purchasing agents make to \n     meet with U.S. suppliers, inspect facilities, and verify U.S. \n     procedures and standards before making major purchases.\n       This was an important visit, filled with economic \n     opportunity for North Dakota farmers who continue to suffer \n     under commodity prices that collapsed six years ago and that \n     have remained collapsed ever since.\n       Alimport is a very significant customer for U.S. farm \n     products. Since November 2001, when legislation I helped \n     enact into law finally made it possible for U.S. \n     organizations and companies to sell food and medicines to \n     Cuba, Alimport has purchased approximately 450,000 metric \n     tons of agricultural commodities--corn, rice, wheat, soy, \n     poultry, vegetable oil, apples, peas, eggs and pork lard--\n     worth about $75 million.\n       I want a complete investigation into why these visas were \n     cancelled. When my staff inquired about it, State Department \n     officials told them, ``It is the policy of this \n     Administration not to encourage agricultural sales to Cuba.'' \n     That is unacceptable to me.\n       If that is the basis for which the visas were cancelled, it \n     is an insult to American farmers and puts at risk \n     agricultural sales to Cuba. At a time when grain prices \n     remain collapsed, it is just plain wrong for the \n     Administration to try to impede the sale of grain to Cuba.\n       This is a brainless policy to be saying that we don't want \n     to sell grain to the Cubans. We sell grain to communist \n     China, communist Viet Nam, and it's just absurd to tell our \n     farmers that our government doesn't want to sell grain to \n     Cuba.\n       I want a complete investigation to find out who is running \n     things in the State Department. Who ordered the visas \n     cancelled? Did political operatives in the Administration \n     communicate with the State Department about these visas?\n       I also want to request that you personally intervene in \n     this matter. Our country needs to use some common sense. We \n     must stop using our family farmers as pawns in foreign \n     policy. That is the mandate from Congress and, specifically, \n     when it comes to Cuba that is the law. It ought to be obeyed.\n       Pleased intervene and make the right decision with respect \n     to these issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Colin L. Powell,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Powell: As export dependent food and \n     agricultural industries, we wish to express our \n     disappointment with the recent action taken by the Department \n     of State to deny visas to Cuban trade officials. The planned \n     meetings between U.S. agricultural representatives and Cuban \n     officials to review U.S. standards and procedures in \n     conjunction with contracted and potential agricultural sales \n     to Cuba will no longer be possible. Maintaining access to the \n     Cuban market for our products is an important goal for our \n     industry.\n       The purpose of the Cuban travel, that has now been denied, \n     was for Cuban officials to meet with U.S. suppliers, inspect \n     facilities, discuss sanitary and phytosanitary issues and \n     verify U.S. procedures and standards associated with the sale \n     of U.S. food and agricultural exports to Cuba. Visits of this \n     type are routinely conducted by U.S. officials and U.S. \n     importers in markets that sell to the United States. It is \n     also customary practice for foreign purchasing agents and \n     government technical teams to travel to the U.S. to meet with \n     U.S. suppliers and tour facilities.\n       Two years ago, Congress, backed by the strong support of \n     the U.S. food and agricultural community, opened the Cuban \n     market for our goods by partially lifting nearly 40 years of \n     unilateral sanctions against Cuba. Cuba continues to pay cash \n     in full for its purchases and has signaled intent to expand \n     its imports of U.S. food and agricultural commodities.\n       Mr. Secretary, we ask your help in keeping this small but \n     viable market open for export sales of U.S. food and \n     agricultural commodities. This recent action by the \n     Department of State puts all future Cuban food and \n     agricultural purchases at risk at a time when American \n     farmers and ranchers are under extreme economic stress from \n     low prices and decreasing world market share.\n       We hope that the administration will look favorable upon \n     future purchasing and technical visits from Cuban officials.\n     Sincerely,\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       Archer Daniels Midland Company.\n       Cargill Incorporated.\n       Farmland Industries, Inc.\n       Grocery Manufacturers of America.\n       Louis Dreyfus Corporation.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Chicken Council.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Oilseed Processors Association.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Renderers Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       North American Export Grain Association.\n       North American Millers' Association.\n       Rice Millers' Association.\n       U.S. Canola Association.\n       U.S. Dry Pea & Lentil Council.\n       U.S. Rice Producers Association.\n       U.S. Rice Producers' Group.\n       U.S. Wheat Associates.\n       Wheat Export Trade Education Committee.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this policy is wrong. This policy injures \nAmerican farmers. This policy continues an embargo. We know embargoes \nhurt us. They hurt our farmers. Those kinds of activities hurt poor, \nsick and hungry people in countries like Cuba. They do not hurt Fidel \nCastro. They hurt our farmers. And they hurt the poor, sick, and hungry \npeople abroad.\n  When someone wants to come to this country to buy American grain, \neggs, dried beans, and other products our farmers produce, the State \nDepartment has no right, in my judgment, to revoke those visas for \npolitical purposes. That is what I think has happened in this regard.\n\n       It is the policy of this administration not to encourage \n     agricultural sales to Cuba.\n\n  I say to those in this administration who have said that and who \nbelieve that: You have a responsibility to stop this nonsense. You are \nhurting American family farmers. And it is an abrogation of the \npolicies we have already developed here in the Congress.\n  I am going to send a letter today to the State Department saying I \nhave invited the head of Alimport into this country. I have invited \nthem to North Dakota. I want them to come here and buy American farm \nproducts.

Mr. President, I would be very happy to have my remarks in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3002-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3002-S3005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when we resume consideration of the energy \nbill later today, we will be on a revenue measure. As all of my \ncolleagues know, the Constitution gives a special privilege to the \nHouse of Representatives by requiring all money bills to originate in \nthe House. This represents a constraint on the Senate in terms of \nvoting on tax issues because in order to have a vote on a tax issue \nthat could actually become law, you have to have a vote on a bill that \nis already a revenue measure and has been passed by the House. So this \nmeans the bill before us, in addition to being an energy bill, becomes \na very important bill because it will contain energy tax provisions, \nand therefore will be a revenue bill.\n  I have now about 15 Members of the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, who \nare determined to have a vote on making the death tax repeal permanent. \nI will not repeat the whole debate because we will have plenty of \nopportunity to talk about it--we have in the past and will have in the \nfuture. But we have the anomaly that the tax cut passed last year will \nexpire in 10 years because of a budget technicality that was in place \nwhen it was adopted. And this creates the incredible anomaly that while \nwe are phasing out the death tax now, 9 years from now it will spring \nback in full force and will ensure that families that worked to build \nup a business or a family farm would end up having to sell that \nbusiness or sell that farm to give the Government 55 cents out of every \ndollar of its value upon the death of the people who created it before \nit can be passed on to their children.\n  We have every right, on any revenue measure, to offer any amendment \nwe wish. That is how the rules of the Senate work. On Thursday, I had \ncalled for regular order--which brought up Senator Kerry's amendment \nwith Senator McCain--and I offered my amendment to it. I was unaware at \nthe time that discussions were going on as to how we were going to \nproceed from there. As it turned out, Senator Kerry came over and \nwithdrew his amendment. At that point, the distinguished Democrat floor \nleader filled up the amendment tree by offering a second-degree \namendment to the next amendment under regular order. I think there were \nabout nine amendments that had been set aside as we went on to consider \nother measures.\n  In working with our leadership and, through their discussions, with \nthe leadership on the Democrat side, I have now proposed in writing an \nagreement whereby we would agree to forgo the ability to offer an \namendment on this bill to make death tax repeal permanent, if we could \nhave a guarantee that at some point in the future we would get such a \nvote. The proposal I have made is that we pull up H.R. 8, which is on \nthe Senate Calendar. It, in fact, is a bill to repeal the death tax. I \nhope it will be looked at.\n  We feel very strongly we ought to have the right to offer this \namendment. This is a revenue measure. We have no guarantee there will \nbe another revenue measure considered by the Senate this year. I know \nthere are people in the Finance Committee--and I am privileged to serve \non that committee--who hope we will have other opportunities. But it \nmay well be that this is the only opportunity we have this year.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the House of Representatives has voted to \nmake the whole tax cut permanent. We want to have a vote on making the \ndeath tax repeal permanent. I am hoping that something can be done to \naccommodate us in terms of our right.\n  I know there are many people who want to finish this bill. There are \nthings in the bill I am for, but I don't know of anything that is more \nimportant than making the repeal of the death tax permanent.\n  I wanted my colleagues to know that we do have a growing number of \npeople who are working to achieve this goal. It would be our objective. \nI think there are two amendments the managers of the bill wanted to do \nthis afternoon that we have agreed to step aside and allow them to do. \nBut beyond that point, it would be our intent to object to bringing up \nnew amendments or to setting aside the pending amendment until we get \nsome agreement. We don't have to do our amendment now, but we want to \nbe guaranteed that at some point we will have our right as Senators to \noffer an amendment related to making the repeal of the death tax \npermanent.\n  I came over today to simply outline that there is the beginning of a \ndiscussion on how to accommodate Senators who wish to offer this \namendment. I have talked to our leader, and nothing would make me \nhappier than to get a guarantee that we will get a vote on making \nrepeal of the death tax permanent. In that case, we would get out of \nthe way and allow consideration of the energy tax amendment and adopt \nit, perhaps on a voice vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader and the Republican leader have spoken \nabout this issue. The Senator has submitted to us in writing his \nproposal which has now been reviewed. We will do everything we can to \nmove this bill along. We hope as to the written proposal for the \nunanimous consent agreement, that we can work something out on that \nbefore the end of the day.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I appreciate the Democrat floor leader's willingness to \ntry to work on this. I am very grateful. It would break a major impasse \nand virtually guarantee that the bill will be adopted. What we would \nlike to do is have a vote on permanently repealing the death tax. We \nrealize the vote might come on cloture or it might come on a point of \norder. But we would like to have a vote nonetheless.\n  I thank the Senator for his help.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield, but I am getting ready to give \nup the floor. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is fine, if he is going to yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might respond very briefly to what \nthe Senator from Texas has said, the Senator from Texas is very honest \nand forthright in his position. He stated in the Chamber, and it will \nbe reflected in the Record, that he believes the elimination of the \nestate tax, the death tax, is the most important priority for this \nCongress when it comes to tax legislation.\n  I disagree. Right now, fewer than 2 percent of the estates in America \npay any estate tax whatsoever. We have changed the law so even fewer \nwill pay it in the future. What the Senator from Texas and those in \nsupport of his position are arguing for is to eliminate this estate tax \nfor the very few remaining wealthiest people in America, and it is his \nbelief that this is the highest tax priority for Congress. I would like \nto take that question to his State of Texas, let alone my State of \nIllinois.\n  I just finished a tour of Illinois, and I went to small business \nafter small business. I asked: What is the biggest problem you are \nfacing?\n  They answered: The cost of health insurance. We can't pay for health \ninsurance for our employees, let alone for the owners of the business.\n  A labor union, the plumbers and pipefitters, came from Chicago last \nweek. I asked: What is your agenda in Congress?\n  They said: The cost of health insurance. We can't get a penny more in \nour paychecks when we negotiate a contract each year with our union \nbecause all the money is going into health insurance.\n  So if you want to know where my highest priority is in terms of tax \nbreaks for businesses and families across America, it doesn't start at \nthe top with people who are worth megamillions. It starts with working \nfamilies who cannot afford their health insurance.\n\n  I will say to the Senator from Texas and those supporting his \nposition, please bring a tax bill to the floor. There are those of us \nwho want to try some other issues that we think are much more \nimportant.\n  Do you know what this means if we make President Bush's tax cut \npermanent? It means 65 percent of all of the\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\ntax breaks will go to people making over $500,000 a year. That is their \nhighest priority--people with incomes of $500,000 a year or more.\n  Do you know how much of a tax break they will get if we go ahead with \ntheir proposal to make the President's tax cut permanent? It turns out \nto be $39,000 a year on average for people making over a half million a \nyear.\n  If you are making a half million a year, let's assume that is about \n$10,000 a week, and times are tough. You are going to get $39,000 more \nto deal with it. Meanwhile, the small business in southern Illinois, \nthe small business in Humboldt Park in Chicago that can't afford to pay \nits health insurance premiums brings the employees in and says: We are \nsorry, we can't do it anymore. We can't offer you health insurance for \nyou and your family.\n  Which is the greater priority in America? The people making over a \nhalf million a year who get $39,000 more in tax cuts to put in some \ninvestment or another vacation home or a boat or a luxury car or is it \nmore important that families across America have health insurance so \nthey can protect themselves and their children?\n  While we are on the subject of children, ask those same families \nabout the importance of the deductibility of college expenses. If you \nwant to know a tax break people across America want, talk to any family \nwith a new baby. They will show you the child and say: Doesn't he look \nlike his dad or doesn't she look like her mom?\n  The next thing they will tell you is they better open a savings \naccount for their college right now. Otherwise, they won't be able to \npay for college education.\n  So if we are going to talk about priorities in tax cuts, wouldn't it \nbe good for the first time in America to allow people to deduct the \ncost of college education from their taxes? Isn't that a good \ninvestment for America? I think it is a far better investment than the \nsame people who make over a half million a year, guess what, getting \nanother windfall check of $39,000 from President Bush's permanent tax \ncut.\n  Incidentally, so the record is clear, that permanent tax cut of \nPresident Bush's that gives $39,000 to the wealthiest people, for all \nthe rest of the folks in America it is less than $1,000 a year.\n  So you look at it and say, well, everything is upside down in this \nworld if the most important thing in Congress, when it comes to taxes, \nhappens to be the wealthiest people in America. The people I represent \nin Illinois--some are wealthy, but the vast majority are not--are hard \nworking, low- and middle-income families struggling to pay for health \ninsurance, for education, and for college expenses. Those are the \npeople who deserve a break.\n  In my State, we are facing a health care crisis, and it has to do \nwith more than just the cost of health insurance. That is a major \nproblem, but we are also seeing a crisis that is reaching in many \ndifferent directions. Talk to folks with parents and grandparents on \nMedicare. Ask them what they are facing when it comes to paying for \nprescription drugs. The Senator from Texas wants to take what limited \namount of money we might spend for tax relief and give it to people \nmaking over $500,000 a year.\n  Frankly, I would like to see us also consider--in addition to the \ncost of health insurance--the deductibility of education expenses and \nprescription drug costs for the elderly in America. Do you know how \nmuch prescription drug costs went up last year in our country? It was \n16 percent. Put yourself on a fixed income and in a position with a \nserious illness. You go to the doctor and he says: Durbin, if you want \nto stay out of the hospital, here is a prescription that I think will \ndo the trick. Then you go down to the pharmacy and they say: Well, I am \nsorry to tell you that it will cost you $300 to fill the prescription. \nWell, if you are living on $800 or $900 a month--and that is not \nuncommon if you are on Social Security--what are you going to do? Many \npeople have to make a hard choice: Am I going to fill the prescription \nand figure out how to pay the rent and utilities and the other bills, \nor am I going to walk away from it? Which is the higher priority in \nAmerica, the seniors who have to walk away from the medicine they need \ntoo survive, or people making over $500,000 a year and to give them \n$39,000 a year in tax breaks? That is what it comes down to; that is \nthe choice we face.\n  You have heard the Senator from Texas make his choice very clear: The \nhighest priority, when it comes to taxes, from his point of view, is to \nsay that the estate tax is going to be eliminated for everybody \nforever. I see it differently. We can reform the estate tax and do it \nin a sensible way. We can protect family farmers and family-owned \nbusinesses. I will sign up for that any day. But to say we are going to \ngive a windfall in tax breaks to the wealthiest, at the expense of the \npeople I have described, is unfair. It is the reason there are two \ndifferent political parties in this Chamber, why we need political \ndebate. It is the reason, when we disagree, sometimes it gets to the \nheart of issues that make a difference to families in America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There was a discussion earlier on the estate tax. They \ncall it the ``death tax'' because the pollsters figured that \npolitically it sounded better, but it is the estate tax. Also, the \ndiscussion about estate taxes always comes in terms of helping family \nfarmers or small businesses. I wonder if the Senator remembers that \nlast year, when we had this debate, I offered an amendment to the \nestate tax. The amendment was one to the proposal by the then-majority, \nwho wanted to abolish the estate tax. My amendment said I don't believe \nwe ought to interrupt the passage of any family business from the \nfather and mother to the descendants who want to continue to operate \nthe business. It doesn't matter whether it is a family farm or a \nhardware store, and it doesn't matter how big it is. If it is a family \nenterprise being transferred from the parents to the children, I think \nit ought to be totally exempt from the estate tax. So I offered an \namendment.\n\n  My amendment said that transfers of family businesses, regardless of \nsize, to family heirs to operate shall be totally exempt from estate \ntaxes beginning in the year 2003, and all other estates shall have a $4 \nmillion exemption. So if you have up to $4 million in assets, or if you \nare transferring a family business, you are not going to pay any estate \ntax at all.\n  Now, the estate tax provision passed by the Senate said we will begin \ncreating larger exemptions for the transfer of family assets including \na family farm or a family business so that, in 2010, there shall no \nlonger be any tax. I said, no, if you package this by saying what you \nreally want to do is help family farmers and family businesses, why \ndon't you vote for my amendment and they will all be exempt next year, \nin 2003?\n  We had 43 Senators who voted for my amendment. All of those who have \nspent their careers in the Senate saying ``we want to get rid of this \nburdensome death tax for family-owned businesses and family farms'' \nvoted against that amendment. So when there is a family farm or a \nfamily business that is transferred next year, and there is an estate \ntax applied to it, people should understand it is because the then-\nmajority decided last year, when they wanted to ram this fiscal policy \nthrough the Senate, that they were not really quite as interested in \nfamily farms and small businesses as they were in those who have \nmillions and billions of dollars of assets.\n  Incidentally, this country has one-half of the world's billionaires. \nGood for us and good for them. There is nothing wrong with being that \nsuccessful. But if somebody in this country has $6 billion or $8 \nbillion, I guarantee you a substantial amount of that has never been \ntaxed. It represents growth appreciation on assets over time, and there \nis nothing at all wrong, in my judgment, in asking that at least some \nof that--just some of it--be put back into this country's schools, or \ninvested in the country's kids, and in this country's future.\n  But that is not what the Republicans wanted to have done. They \nwanted, at all costs, to protect this, and they did it at the expense \nof having a total exemption for transfers of all family farms and all \nfamily businesses, effective immediately in 2003. That is what we could \nhave had.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois if he recalls that debate and what \nthe real priorities were for the other side of the aisle?\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly do. The Senator is correct. After that \ndebate, I sent a letter to the two major farm organizations in \nIllinois, the Illinois Farm Bureau and the Farmers Union. I said: You \ndon't have to name names, but can you give me an example of somebody \nwho lost a family farm because of the estate tax? They could not come \nup with one in my State.\n  I readily concede that there are sacrifices that have to be made to \npay the estate tax. But the doom and gloom stories we hear from them \nare stories you have heard over and over. With the Senator's amendment, \nif they were worried about family farms or family businesses, they \nwould have jumped all over his amendment. But it is not; it is about \nthe people who are at the highest end of the spectrum, who have an \nappreciation of stock, or the appreciation of some capital asset and \nthey finally face taxation for the first time. That isn't unfair. \nFamilies and businesses across America pay their fair share of taxes. \nWhy do we want to exempt the wealthiest in our society at the expense \nof tax benefits that would help with the cost of health insurance, care \nfor the cost of college education, and deal with prescription drugs? \nThose are the areas I think, frankly, in which the vast majority of \nAmericans would applaud us for dealing with the problems they face.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have one additional question. We ended up with the \nworst of possible worlds last year. Those who said they supported a \nrepeal of the estate taxes to help businesses and farms would not \nsupport the amendment that would have repealed it for family businesses \nand family farms next year. That was more than confusing.\n  No. 2, the bill that was finally completed said let's repeal the \nestate tax and we will ratchet it up until it is finally repealed in \n2010. So if you are going to die, you have to die in 2010 to take full \nadvantage of this because in 2011, the estate tax kicks back in. I \nthink historians and policy analysts will look at that and say what on \nearth could they have been thinking? Who could have constructed \nsomething that bizarre?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I had a group in my office that does financial planning, \nand they said they are cautioning clients not to walk by any open \nwindows above the fourth floor in the year 2010 because that is the \nyear when we have the estate tax repeal and it reinstates in 2011. It \nis a bizarre tax policy. If you will remember correctly, we were told \nby the administration that went ahead with the tax break that the \nreason we could do that was because they projected surpluses of $5.2 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. And with all this money, the obvious \nquestion they asked was: Why should the Government keep the people's \nmoney? Let's give it back to them. Some us who lived through the \ndeficit years said we should be more careful in how we make these \ndecisions. But they went ahead and passed the tax cut.\n  But a year later, they said: We made a mistake; it is not going to be \na $5.2 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. It is going to be $1.2 \ntrillion. What happens with the $4 trillion? Three things happened to \nit: The recession continued, an unexpected war took place; but for 40 \npercent of it, it was a direct result of that tax cut decision. That, \nto me, was the wrong thing to do. It is not cautious or prudent. We \nwill pay for it if we are not careful.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was in the Chamber--I stepped out but \nstill listened to the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from North \nDakota--when the Senator from Texas spoke. I have the greatest respect \nfor him. He has a Ph.D. in economics. I know how versed he is in \neconomic issues, and he has a long history of being a Member of the \nHouse and Senate.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from Illinois was presiding when \nthe Senator from Texas gave his remarks; is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Did the Senator from Illinois hear the Senator from Texas \nsay--and I am paraphrasing but not very much--that he believes the most \nimportant issue before the Congress today is the estate tax issue?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe that is accurate.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure he does not mean that, and I am sure he will let \nus know if I am paraphrasing him improperly. I have to think--and I \nwould like the Senator from Illinois to acknowledge--that prescription \ndrug benefits for seniors may be more important than repealing the \nestate tax or making it permanent. We have already changed it. \nSomething dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights would also be \nsomething we should do.\n  Going from one end of the spectrum where people have billions of \ndollars to the other end of the spectrum where people have nothing, \ndoes the Senator from Illinois think it is also important to raise the \nminimum wage for people who are struggling? I say to the Senator from \nIllinois that 60 percent--I remind the Senator, and I am sure he knows \nthis--60 percent of the people who draw minimum wage are women, and for \n40 percent of those women, that is the only money they get for \nthemselves and their families. Speaking for myself, I am more concerned \nabout that than whether Bill Gates is going to pay taxes when he passes \naway.\n  There are other issues, of course, that are of stronger importance to \nthe people of Nevada than the estate tax. Last year, the people who \nactually paid estate taxes in Nevada were fewer in number than the \nfingers on your hands.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, he reminds me, come September we \nare either going to celebrate the fifth or sixth anniversary since we \nlast increased the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour. Imagine what that \ntranslates into if you are working at $5.15. Double that if you are \nworking two jobs. Say you worked 80 hours a week at $5.15 an hour. What \na glorious life you would lead.\n  The Senator from Nevada comes back to the point I was trying to make \nearlier. Whether you are talking about the cost of health insurance, \nthe cost of college education, prescription drugs in Medicare, or \nminimum wage, those issues certainly are higher priorities to this \nSenator and to most of the people I represent than whether or not \npeople who are worth literally millions and millions of dollars are \ngoing to get a tax break.\n  The Senator from Texas is entitled to his point of view. I respect \nhim for being very honest about it. But I hope this Senate comes down \nto some face-to-face votes, some real votes on real issues that mean \nsomething to families across Nevada and Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one more point?\n  The Senator is aware that the majority of the Democrats in the Senate \nhave agreed to change the estate tax to increase the amount--this is a \nfloor, I should say. The Senator from North Dakota is in the Chamber. \nHe offered an amendment that I supported which would have increased it, \nas I recall, to about $4 million and also exempted family-owned \nbusinesses.\n  I think that everyone knows, hearing this colloquy among the three of \nus, that we support changing the estate tax. It is not as if we are \ntotally opposed to changing it. Does the Senator from Illinois agree \nthat we think it should be done incrementally and not eliminated \ncompletely?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. We made that point over and over \nwith the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota and others, that we \ndo want to increase the exemption, which means fewer estates even than \nthose paying today would be eligible or covered by it, and second, for \nfamily farms and family businesses.\n  I said to a group of small businessmen who came to visit me last \nweek: Don't you think that is a reasonable way to go?\n  One of them said: No, Senator, I have to tell you, I think this is a \nmoral issue; it's a moral issue; we should eliminate the estate tax as \na moral issue.\n  I am not an arbiter of morality; I just ran for political office. If \nwe are going to stack things against moral relevance, I would certainly \nput in that list increasing the minimum wage for millions of Americans; \nproviding health insurance for people, 39 million who have none and \nmore losing it every day; paying for college education expenses and \nprescription drugs for the elderly. Those are certainly moral issues, \ntoo, and if we are going to make a choice, the Senator from Texas made \nit clear what his choice would be: the estate tax.\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\n  For the rest of us, there are other issues of equal moral heft that \nwe ought to be considering before we move to the estate tax issue. I \nhope we get a chance to during the course of this session. It is \nimportant during the course of this budget debate that we talk about \nissues that mean something to families, small businesses, and family \nfarmers across America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I indicated to the Senator from Nevada that if there is \nto be a vote on the estate tax issue in the coming days--and I guess it \nmay be with respect to the tax provisions dealing with the energy bill, \nI will want the opportunity to offer a second-degree amendment or at \nleast offer essentially the same amendment we considered last year, and \nthat amendment will draw a distinction. The distinction is this: If my \namendment is adopted, then effective in 2003, no transfer or passage of \nany family business or family farm, regardless of size, to qualified \nheirs will have an estate tax obligation attached to it. None. It will \nbe completely exempt next year.\n  There is nothing under the minority party's proposal that would \nimmediately exempt family businesses from the estate tax. It will be \nanother 7 years or so before they are totally exempt.\n  My amendment says, yes, let's exempt them, and do it immediately. My \namendment also provides for a higher threshold exemption on all other \nestates. And I do not intend to agree to an unanimous consent agreement \non this issue unless I have an opportunity to offer that as an \namendment as well.\n  Warren Buffett has been here a couple of times in the last year or so \nto visit with us. He is the world's second richest man. He said to us: \nWhat can people be thinking about, getting rid of the estate tax? I do \nnot support getting rid of the estate tax. This is the world's second \nrichest man. He said you ought not do that; it does not make any sense.\n  Bill Gates' father came to Congress and said: Don't get rid of the \nestate tax completely. There are people who have billions of dollars \nwho ought to pay some basic estate tax because they have never paid \ntaxes on those assets, and that is the majority of those assets for the \nlargest estates.\n  When they pass, obviously a significant part ought to go to their \nheirs, but a significant part ought to be available to invest back into \nthis country's future, especially education, health care, and other \ncritical areas.\n  I think the proper way to deal with this issue is to recognize there \nis merit to the question of whether we want to interrupt the transfer \nof a family business to other family members. The answer from us is, \nno, we should not interrupt that transfer. If mom and dad want to pass \nthe business along to the kids to run, I do not care how big the \nbusiness, let's not saddle them with an estate tax obligation.\n  The fact is, the amendment I offered last year would have exempted \nall of them completely next year. We can do that. I would like an \nopportunity to vote on that again, if we are going to vote on exempting \nall estates forever from the estate tax. I think we ought to have a \nvote on the amendment I offered last year.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today Dr. Rudolfo Anaya will be 1 of 14 \ndistinguished artists to receive this year's National Medal of Arts.\n  Dr. Anaya is a legend in New Mexico and throughout the Nation for \nwritings that reflect the cultural crossings unique to the Southwest. \nBorn in the small town of Pastura, NM, he grew up in a Spanish-speaking \nhome rich with tradition. His family moved to Albuquerque when he was \n15, where he attended high school.\n  His first novel, ``Bless Me, Ultima,'' was published in 1972 and won \nhim the prestigious Premio Quinto Sol national award for Chicagno \nliterature. This widely-acclaimed novel brought many Hispanic \ntraditions into the limelight, creating a colorful narrative spiced \nwith Spanish vocabulary. ``Bless Me. Ultima'' continues to be a best-\nselling Chicano work, and is used in classrooms throughout the world as \na standard text for Chicano studies and literature courses.\n  Dr. Anaya's work combines history and tradition with the \nsupernatural. Old Spain and New Spain, Mexico, and Mesoamerica, all \ncome together in a style that Newsweek has referred to as ``the new \nAmerican writing.'' his second novel, ``Heart of Aztlan,'' explores a \nMexican-American family's struggle with discrimination and poverty and \nits determination to preserve a proud sense of cultural identity. Such \nthemes recognize a harsh reality, while also presenting the richness of \nHispanic and Native American traditions and ceremonies that are so \nfundamental to New Mexican culture.\n  Other works by Dr. Anaya include ``Zia Summer,'' ``Rio Grande Fall,'' \n``Jalanta,'' ``Torguga,'' ``Anaya Reader'', ``Albuquerque,'' and his \nmost recent mystery novel, ``Shaman Winter.'' He has also written \nnumerous short stories, essays, and children's books, including \n``Farolitos for Abuelo'' and ``The Farolitos of Christmas.'' Other \ndistinguished awards include the PEN Center West Award for Fiction, the \nBefore Columbus American Book Award, and the Excellence in the \nHumanities Award.\n  Dr. Anaya is a professor emeritus of English at the University of New \nMexico, where he began teaching in the summer of 1974. That same year \nhe served on the board of Coordinating Council of Literary Magazines. \nBoth Dr. Anaya's teaching and his work build an interest and pride in \nNew Mexican history. His unique story-telling abilities stem from the \noral tradition he experienced growing up, and his desire to pass these \nstories down to children make him an author, a story-teller, an \neducator, and a role model.\n  As our Nation continues to explore ways to better educate our \nchildren and increase cultural awareness, we must look to role models \nlike Dr. Anaya for guidance. His writings continue to inspire people of \nall ages, from all ethnic backgrounds. He has not only brought a rich \ntradition of story-telling and folklore to bookshelves all over the \nworld, but he has also utilized his tremendous gift to portray the \nHispanic experience. He inspires young writers to share their gifts, \nand he provides given millions of readers, including myself, incredible \njoy.\n  The state of New Mexico is proud to be home to such an esteemed \nartist--one who has brought the Southwest to the forefront of American \nliterature. I am truly honored to congratulate Dr. Anaya for all of his \naccomplishments for for the distinguished National Medal of Arts award \nthat the President will present to him this afternoon in Constitution \nHall. His hard work has earned him our utmost respect and admiration, I \nwould like to thank him personally for his outstanding contributions to \nthe arts in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3005-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3005-S3006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will say a few words about where we \nfind ourselves. I know we are in morning business, and that is \nappropriate for the various statements that have been made, but this is \nthe beginning of week 6 in which the Senate is considering energy \nlegislation. We are fast approaching a decisive point in that debate: \nWill we be able to bring this bill to an orderly close this week or \nwill we not?\n  We tried before to get a finite list of amendments agreed to, and \nthere were objections raised by some in the Senate so we were not able \nto do that. We also could not get any agreement, at least as yet, on \ntax provisions. So the majority leader has filed for cloture on the \nbill, and all first-degree amendments have now been submitted. That \ndeadline was 1:30 today.\n  I hope we are able to deal with the remaining amendments and move \nforward. I hope we are able to invoke cloture so we can bring this very \nlarge\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nlegislation to an orderly conclusion. Obviously, we want to see all \nissues that relate and that are germane to this energy bill adequately \nconsidered, but at this point, 5 weeks into the debate and starting \nweek 6, I think most Senators have had ample opportunity to present \ntheir amendments and raise the issues they think are of concern.\n  I see there are other Senators seeking recognition. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3006-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3006-S3009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FIX IS IN ON O'HARE AIRPORT\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, in the upcoming discussion on the \nexpansion of O'Hare, in which I know the Presiding Officer has been \ndeeply involved, one of the issues the Senate will be debating will be \na competitive bidding requirement for the contracts and concessions at \nO'Hare Airport. I intend to offer an amendment that would apply Federal \ncompetitive bidding procedures to the contracts at O'Hare and which \nwould require the city of Chicago to disclose the recipients of those \ncontracts.\n  The lead articles in the two major Chicago newspapers over the \nweekend illustrate precisely why this competitive bidding amendment is \nessential. The two papers, taken together, report a pattern of flagrant \nand chronic abuse in the city of Chicago. The Chicago Tribune reports \nthat Mayor Daley's pals get rich yet again on a huge public works \nproject that the city of Chicago thoroughly misrepresented. \nSimultaneously, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that, because of a budget \ncrisis, city workers get the choice of unpaid days off or layoffs. That \nis the pattern: The connected guys get the bucks; the ordinary guys get \nthe shaft.\n  Yesterday, the Tribune reported that a major Chicago deal was enacted \nwith the aid of an intense public relations campaign that misled the \ncitizens of the city and the State on a number of key issues. That \ndeal--Soldier Field--followed a distinctly Chicago pattern. After the \ndeal was rammed through, we find that misrepresentations were so \negregious that it is difficult to call them misrepresentations and not \noutright fabrications. We also find that several political friends and \nallies of both the mayor and the Governor make serious money off their \ninside connections.\n  I will read from the Tribune. The title of the article is ``Bears \nplay, Public pays.'' It is by Andrew Martin, Liam Ford, and Laurie \nCohen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Apr. 21, 2002]\n\n                        Bears Play, Public Pays\n\n             (By Andrew Martin, Liam Ford and Laurie Cohen)\n\n       As construction at Soldier Field advances, a Tribute \n     analysis of the $632 million project shows that the public \n     bill for the stadium renovation is higher than city officials \n     have said it would be while benefits to taxpayers--in terms \n     of promised parkland and additional part revenues--fall short \n     of what was promised.\n       The bottom line is that the new Chicago Bears stadium will \n     get one of the largest government contributions in the \n     history of professional sports, a fact obscured by a public-\n     relations strategy that tried to divert attention from the \n     public costs. Among the Tribune's findings\n       City officials have said the public bill for the project \n     won't exceed $406 million; in fact, another $26 million in \n     public costs is buried in bond documents. That money brings \n     the total public tab to $432 million.\n       While Mayor Richard Daley praised the Bears's $200 million \n     contribution to the project as ``unheard of'' for a publicly \n     owned stadium, neither the mayor nor anyone else involved in \n     the project noted that the city's contribution also might be \n     unprecedented.\n       Officials with the Chicago Park District, which owns \n     Soldier Field, have called the renovated stadium a good deal \n     for the agency. But an internal Park District analysis shows \n     the agency will make $900,000 less the first full year the \n     stadium is open, figures that officials now dispute. \n     Meanwhile, the new stadium is expected to double the value of \n     the Bears franchise, experts said.\n       Proponents of the stadium renovation pointed to the \n     creation of 19 acres of parkland for Chicagoans. But \n     officials counted landscaped medians and sloped berms beside \n     a parking garage as part of the acreage, according to one of \n     the project's architects, Dirk Lohan.\n       In reality, only about 10 acres of usable parkland is being \n     created, according to an analysis by Friends of the Parks, \n     which is suing to stop the renovation. The lawsuit could be \n     decided at a hearing Thursday.\n       ``You're not able to play on a slope or on the middle of a \n     roadway,'' said Erma Tranter, the group's president.\n       The strategy to sell the Soldier Field renovations, mapped \n     out in a 1990 memo by the Bears' public-relations firm, was \n     based on emphasizing the new stadium's amenities, such as new \n     parkland and expanded lakefront parking in an underground \n     garage, while downplaying public costs for the Bears \n     facility.\n       ``The problem with the current debate is that it is too \n     often about the Chicago Bears and not about the future of \n     Chicago and its prized lakefront,'' according to the memo, \n     crafted by the firm, Burson-Marsteller. The public-\n     relations advisers recommended a strategy recommended a \n     strategy that includes changing ``the conversation from \n     `public funding for the Chicago Bears stadium needs' to a \n     civic-led discussion'' about such things as preserving \n     Soldier Field as a landmark and ``doing things right, the \n     Chicago way,'' said the memo, a copy of which was obtained \n     by the Tribune.\n       The Soldier Field deal contradicts previous public \n     statements from the mayor and Gov. George Ryan, who had \n     balked at government financing for the stadium.\n       It also ran counter to a trend in the NFL in which teams in \n     lucrative markets such as the Washington Redskins and the New \n     England Patriots are paying most of the costs for their \n     privately owned stadiums, the Tribune analysis found.\n       Meanwhile, in nearly every city where government subsidies \n     were used for a publicly owned NFL stadium in the last \n     decade, a referendum was held to ask voters whether they \n     approved of the idea. In Chicago, the city went to court to \n     stop a proposed referendum on the plan.\n       Daley on Saturday defended his support for the Soldier \n     Field project, saying the $200 million private contribution \n     was unprecedented and the public portion was paid for by \n     taxes on hotel rooms, not property taxes.\n       Had the city not proceeded with the stadium deal, the mayor \n     said, ``Soldier Field, what are you going to do with it?''\n       Daley appeared to confirm the Friends of the Parks \n     allegation that the project would only create 10 acres of \n     usable parkland, not 17. ``They're building 10 acres of open \n     space and another seven acres of landscape in all of that. \n     That's what you need to make it environmentally friendly.''\n       The city's longtime point man on the Soldier Field deal, \n     Edward Bedore, a former city budget director who now is a \n     lobbyist for the city, Park District Supt. David Doig and \n     other Park District officials declined to be interviewed.\n       Bears Chief Executive Officer Ted Phillips and former Bears \n     President Michael McCaskey declined to comment.\n       Barnaby Dinges, a public relations consultant for the \n     project, said the Park District will save money in the long \n     term by not paying the increasing costs of maintaining an \n     old, deteriorating stadium.\n       ``There are tremendous benefits to this project,'' Dinges \n     said. ``After 30 years of trying, the Park District, the \n     Bears, the city and the state finally found a plan that does \n     right by taxpayers, park and Museum Campus users, the \n     lakefront, sports and entertainment fans and the people of \n     Illinois.''\n       In written responses to questions, Park District officials \n     said that the Bears' contribution to the project far exceeds \n     what most other teams have chipped in for stadiums. Park \n     District officials also stood by their estimate for new \n     parkland, which was revised from 19 acres to 17 acres after \n     the deal passed the state legislature and more precise \n     calculations were made.\n       ``This figure includes the planted medians, which amount to \n     just a fraction of an acre,'' the statement says.\n       Lohan, the architect, said, ``A berm can have plants on it, \n     and isn't that part of a park?''\n\n\n                            a deal is struck\n\n       Although most of the principals would not comment, others \n     familiar with the deal suggested that the decades-long logjam \n     over a new Bears stadium was broken because of a confluence \n     of several key points. There was a flash of inspiration by \n     the Bears' architect about how to squeeze a new stadium into \n     a historic landmark, an infusion of cash from the NFL and a \n     change of leadership in the governor's office and the Bears' \n     executive suites.\n       At the same time, the deal created a huge public-works \n     project with plenty of hefty contracts for friends and \n     political allies of City Hall and Springfield. For instance, \n     the bond work went to former proteges of Bedore's, security \n     for the construction site is provided by an alderman's \n     brother's firm and the local partner for the construction \n     team is a major Ryan contributor whose vice president was \n     chairman of the governor's inaugural ball.\n       The Soldier Field project was sold to the public, in part, \n     because of the $200 million contribution by the Bears, which \n     is the largest private contribution for a publicly owned NFL \n     stadium. But the Bears are contributing only about $30 \n     million of their own money. The remainder comes from $100 \n     million from the NFL and the sale of personal seat licenses \n     to season-ticket holders.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n       The public portion, $432 million, is being financed by an \n     extension of a 2 percent city hotel tax originally levied by \n     the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority to pay for Comiskey \n     Park.\n       On its face, the city's portion of the Soldier Field \n     project is the largest public contribution in the NFL, in \n     which stadiums are larger and generally more expensive than \n     those in other professional sports.\n       The next-biggest public contribution for a football stadium \n     is in Cincinnati, where taxpayers paid $400 million for Paul \n     Brown Stadium, the Bengals' new $449 million home, according \n     to a Tribune analysis of NFL stadiums built in the last \n     decade.\n       Precise comparisons are difficult because some stadium \n     deals, including the deal for Soldier Field, provide \n     amenities outside of the stadium. Similarly, some stadiums \n     include costs for land acquisition. Some, like Soldier Field, \n     do not because they are on publicly owned property.\n       The cost of building just the stadium at Soldier Field is \n     estimated at $383 million, prompting the Park District to \n     claim that the Bears will pay more than half the cost of the \n     new facility. But critics say that calculation is imprecise \n     because it does not include the cost of amenities that will \n     primarily serve the stadium, such as the parking deck south \n     of Soldier Field and landscaping on stadium access roads.\n       Marc Ganis, president of the Chicago-based sports \n     consulting firm Sportscorp Ltd., said the high cost of the \n     stadium and the public contribution reflect a decision to \n     keep the Bears playing on the lakefront in a historic \n     landmark rather than building a new stadium elsewhere.\n       ``A 61,000-seat open-air football stadium on a clean site \n     would likely cost less than $400 million,'' Ganis said.\n\n\n                           creative financing\n\n       Officials have pegged the public cost for the project at \n     $406 million, but the actual amount is $26 million higher, \n     thanks to some financial moves designed to skirt a \n     legislative limit on the value of bonds sold to pay for the \n     deal, the Tribune found.\n       Soon after the legislation was passed, it became clear that \n     the project's costs, including the cost of issuing the bonds \n     would exceed that limit, documents and interviews show. The \n     funding problem worsened after Sept. 11 because a sudden drop \n     in Chicago tourism threatened to erode the hotel tax revenues \n     that would be used to pay off the bonds. Shortfalls would \n     require the city to tap its share of state income taxes.\n       The solution involved a financing device that allowed the \n     Illinois Sports Facilities Authority to raise $425 million on \n     the bond sale in October while keeping the original value of \n     the bonds at the legislative limit of $399 million. This was \n     done by setting such low prices on some of the bonds that \n     investors were willing to pay extra to buy them; the extra \n     amount, or premium, wasn't included in the value of the \n     outstanding bonds.\n       The total public bill comes to $432 million after adding $7 \n     million in interest income on the bond proceeds.\n       While the public costs of the deal are higher than \n     advertised, the benefits to the Park District appear to be \n     lower. The agency's claims that it will make more money from \n     the new Soldier Field are belied by its documents.\n       ``Neighborhood park users win because a renovated Soldier \n     Field will generate at least $10 million in net annual \n     revenues for neighborhood park programs,'' Supt. Doig said in \n     a 2001 letter published in the Tribune.\n       According to a city memo last year to Chicago aldermen, the \n     Park District's profit from Soldier Field had been about $9.5 \n     million a year. That figure will drop to $8.6 million in \n     2004, the first full year the new stadium will be open, a \n     Park District forecast shows.\n       But even the $8.6 million profit forecast is inflated \n     because it includes an annual subsidy from the Illinois \n     Sports Facilities Authority that was wrapped into the Soldier \n     Field legislation, meaning that one public agency essentially \n     will be funding another. That subsidy, which will come from \n     Chicago hotel taxes, will total $3.6 million in 2004.\n       In the written responses, Park district officials said that \n     the $8.6 million forecast for 2004 didn't include another \n     contribution from the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority--a \n     $1.5 million annual payment for Soldier Field improvements--\n     and a projected $500,000 fee from the Chicago Fire.\n       The soccer team, which played at Soldier Field before the \n     renovation, plans to play at the new stadium in 2004 but has \n     made no commitments beyond that year, a Fire official said.\n       Documents obtained by the Tribune did not include revenue \n     forecasts beyond 2004. Park district officials said they are \n     optimistic that revenues will continue to grow but declined \n     to provide specifics.\n\n\n                         Friends land contracts\n\n       The Park District may be coming up short at Soldier Field, \n     but some political supporters of Daley and Ryan are not.\n       Bedore, who retired from City Hall in 1993, has served as \n     the city's consultant on Soldier Field for years. A former \n     budget director for both Daley and his father, Bedore lists \n     Michael Daley, the mayor's brother, as an attorney for his \n     consulting business, records show.\n       The lead bond underwriter for the Soldier Field bonds was \n     George K. Baum and Co. of Kansas City, Mo., which beat out \n     several Wall Street companies for the work. Though the \n     financial advisers for the Illinois Sports Facilities \n     Authority ranked at least two other firms ahead of Baum, \n     sources familiar with the deal said City Hall demanded the \n     Baum get the assignment.\n       Baum's Chicago office is headed by two former city budget \n     officials and Bedore proteges, Anthony Fratto and Albert \n     Boumenot. Baum also had been selected to sell bonds for \n     Millennium Park, another project that Bedore launched for \n     Daley.\n       When Baum was selected for the Soldier Field work in March \n     2001, the firm never had been lead underwriter on a deal for \n     more than $350 million, according to the information service \n     Thomson Financial. Baum collected fees of at least $1.3 \n     million for the deal, bond documents and interviews show.\n       Jerry Blakemore, the sports authority's chief executive, \n     declined to comment on the bond deal, as did the authority's \n     financial advisers. Fratto and Boumenot could not be reached \n     for comment.\n       The prime contractor for the Soldier Field renovation, \n     selected without competitive bidding by the Bears, is a joint \n     venture that includes two national firms with stadium-\n     building experience and Kenny Construction, a Wheeling firm \n     whose principals are campaign contributors to both Daley and \n     Ryan. The company's vice president also was chairman of \n     Ryan's inaugural ball.\n       Security at the construction site is being provided by \n     Monterrey Security, a 3-year-old firm that is partially owned \n     by Santiago Solis, the brother of Ald. Danny Solis (25th), \n     one of Daley's closest allies on the City Council.\n\n\n                          Breaking the logjam\n\n       Despite decades of squabbling over a new stadium for the \n     Bears, the football club's fortunes began to change in late \n     1998.\n       That fall, the Bears' architect, Benjamin wood, raised the \n     possibility of renovating Soldier Field, an idea that had \n     always fizzled because there didn't seem to be a way to fit \n     enough seats along the sidelines without ruining the \n     stadium's historic charm.\n       During a visit to Chicago, Wood measured the distance \n     between the colonnades of the stadium and thought he might be \n     able to squeeze a stadium into Soldier Field by positioning \n     all the skyboxes and club seats on one side.\n       The result: a narrower field that would fit within the \n     stadium's colonnades while positioning most of its seats \n     between the 20 yard lines. Seats in that area offer better \n     views and higher prices.\n       In January 1999, George Ryan became governor, replacing Jim \n     Edgar, who had fought with Daley for years over stadium \n     deals. Ryan vowed to work with the mayor and the Bears to \n     resolve the stadium issue ``short of spending taxpayers' \n     dollars on a new stadium.''\n       A month later, McCaskey, who had openly feuded with Daley \n     over stadium proposals, was ousted by his mother as Bears \n     president and replaced by the more amiable Phillips.\n       With a new design for a stadium in the works, Phillips was \n     a crucial funding boost in March 1999 when the NFL approved a \n     program to help bib-city teams build arenas by offering to \n     match a team's contribution to a stadium project.\n       Daley and Phillips later used the NFL money to pressure \n     state legislators to pass the stadium deal during the fall \n     veto session in 2000, saying the money could disappear unless \n     it was used quickly.\n       The day the legislation was rushed through Springfield \n     infuriated some legislators.\n       ``It came out of left field carried by a Hall of Fame bevy \n     of lobbyists and lawyers who told us that the sky is falling, \n     the world would come to an end, civilization would end as we \n     know it, unless we did this deal in the next 72 hours,'' \n     state Rep. William Black (R-Danville) told his colleagues.\n       But late last week, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello indicated the \n     legislative rush may have been unnecessary to land the NFL's \n     $100 million commitment to the Bears.\n       ``There wasn't a specific time frame,'' he said.\n\n       Mr. FITZGERALD. I will read an excerpt from that article:\n\n       The park district may be coming up short at Soldier Field \n     but some political supporters of Daley and Ryan are not. \n     Bedore, who retired from City Hall in 1993, has served as the \n     city's consultant on Soldier Field for years.

Fratto \n     and Boumenot could not be reached for comment.\n       The prime contractor for the Soldier Field renovation, \n     selected without competitive bidding by the Bears, is a joint \n     venture that includes two national firms with stadium-\n     building experience and Kenny Construction, a Wheeling firm \n     whose principals are campaign contributors to both Daley and \n     Ryan. The company's vice president also was chairman of \n     Ryan's inaugural ball.\n       Security at the construction site is being provided by \n     Monterey Security, a 3-year-old firm that is partially owned \n     by Santiago Solis, the brother of Alderman Danny Solis, one \n     of Daley's closest allies on the city council.\n\n  What the Tribune has reported is flagrant, conspicuous, insider \ndealing. The friends and allies of the mayor get rich on huge public \nworks projects that are, to begin with, misrepresented to the people. \nWe have seen it with Millennium Park in Chicago, and we are seeing it \nnow with Soldier Field. Does anyone really believe it is going to be \nany different with the O'Hare expansion?\n  The only difference with O'Hare will be the scale and the scope, both \nof the misrepresentations of the consequences of the project and of the \namount of money that will flow to the friends and allies of the mayor.\n  Chicago is indeed the city that works, and it works the same angle \nover and over. The city cut the template on this kind of a deal: Ram it \nthrough, fabricate the details, and watch as the money comes home to \ndaddy.\n  And what about the ordinary guys? A headline in the Sunday Chicago \nSun-Times: Daley to city workers: Take unpaid days or face layoffs. The \npaper reports:\n\n       Mayor Daley is asking unions representing all city \n     employees except police and firefighters to make a painful \n     choice--take five unpaid vacation days, put off their raise \n     for six months or face 425 layoffs--to generate $15 million \n     in savings to help solve Chicago's worst budget crisis in a \n     decade. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article \nfrom the Chicago-Sun Times from April 21, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Daley to City Workers: Pick Unpaid Days or Layoffs\n\n\n  ``Don't hold your breath,'' replies police union chief; other labor \n                              groups upset\n\n                           (By Fran Spielman)\n\n       Mayor Daley is asking unions representing all city \n     employees except police and fire-fighters to make a painful \n     choice--take five unpaid vacation days, put off their raise \n     for six months or face 425 layoffs--to generate $15 million \n     in savings to help solve Chicago's worst budget crisis in a \n     decade, labor leaders said.\n       ``It's not anybody against anybody. It's trying to keep \n     people surviving,'' Daley told reporters Saturday at a far \n     South Side school.\n       Sworn police officers and firefighters would be exempt from \n     layoffs partly because their contracts prohibit them unless \n     nonsafety personnel are sacrificed first.\n       But police and fire unions are being asked to contribute by \n     accepting one unpaid furlough day. That would cost the \n     average sworn police officer about $200.\n       ``Don't hold your breath,'' said Mark Donahue, newly \n     elected president of the Fraternal Order of Police.\n       ``Our new board will be consulted. A decision will be made \n     early next week. But I don't know that it has a great deal of \n     chance to be considered. There's a lot of frustration among \n     uniformed sworn personnel over our recent contract \n     negotiations.''\n       James McNally, newly elected president of the Chicago \n     Firefighters Union Local 2, refused to comment on the city's \n     request, except to say that Chicago firefighters who changed \n     union presidents this week are ``looking for a contract.''\n       Ousted Local 2 President Bill Kugelman, who got the boot \n     because of the three-year wait for a new contract, didn't \n     mince words.\n       ``They've been sticking it to us all this time, and now \n     we're supposed to be nice guys? All of these unions that \n     Daley has no use for, and now he needs our help? Forget him? \n     Where was he when we needed him? They haven't done a damned \n     thing for us,'' Kugelman said.\n       ``That's up to them,'' Daley said. ``You can only ask them, \n     and that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to have no \n     one laid off.''\n       The Chicago Police Department also is exploring the \n     politically volatile possibility of slowing the steady march \n     of recruit classes through the police academy to cut costs, \n     said Lisa Schrader, a spokeswoman for the city's Office of \n     Budget and Management.\n       The training academy has been churning out about 10 classes \n     a year, each with 60 to 100 recruits.\n       If rookies hit the streets at a slower rate, it would \n     reduce police protection at a time when the city is losing \n     650 to 700 officers a year to retirement and grappling with a \n     rising homicide rate that last year made Chicago the murder \n     capital of the nation.\n       ``There have been internal discussions about what the \n     effects would be of delaying a class. How much would it \n     save,'' Schrader said. ``We don't want to do anything that \n     will compromise public safety. But that's one of the things \n     that's being looked at.''\n       There are 13,248 sworn police officers on the street, said \n     Kimberly O'Connell-Doyle, manager of police personnel. \n     Daley's 2002 budget authorized 13,522 sworn officers.\n       The Chicago Sun-Times reported earlier this month that \n     Daley was extending a city hiring freeze through the end of \n     the year, ordering a 5 percent cut in non-personnel spending \n     and considering employee layoffs and more unpaid furlough \n     days to close a $25 million first-quarter gap caused by lower \n     than expected local tax revenues.\n       The mayor has said that tax increases on the eve of his \n     2003 re-election bid were a ``last, last, last resort,'' but \n     he has refused to slam the door on either layoffs or new \n     revenues.\n       Already, the budget crisis has prompted the City Council to \n     establish an unprecedented $200 million line of credit to pay \n     the city's bills if there's a repeat of what happened in \n     February when the state was late with a $20 million income \n     tax payment.\n       Late last week, City Hall began meeting with city labor \n     leaders to discuss specific union givebacks.\n       At a meeting Friday hosted by the Chicago Federation of \n     Labor, union leaders representing 14,050 non-safety employees \n     got the bad news from John Doerrer, the former labor liaison \n     now serving as the mayor's director of intergovernmental \n     affairs.\n       Doerrer told them the city needs $15 million in personnel \n     savings and that there are basically three ways to get there \n     unless they have other ideas: 425 layoffs, five unpaid \n     furlough days or a six-month deferral of their 3 percent mid-\n     year pay raise.\n       Daley has the power to order layoffs without union consent \n     so long as he goes about it as outlined by union contracts. \n     Furlough days and pay raise deferrals need union approval.\n       ``They have a shortfall of 425 jobs in two corporate funds, \n     and every furlough day is [the equivalent] of 81 jobs. \n     They're looking for $15 million. They don't care how they get \n     to it,'' said Dennis Gannon, secretary-treasurer of the \n     Chicago Federation of Labor.\n       ``They gave us those choices, but we're not to the point of \n     picking. The labor community chose to have the city talk to \n     fire and police and see what can happen there, then come back \n     and talk to us again,'' he said.\n       Another labor leader in attendance, who asked to remain \n     anonymous, said the city ``didn't seem to have a well \n     thought-out plan . . . They just said, `Here are the options. \n     Let's see which one is most doable.' Obviously to us, layoffs \n     are the worst-case scenario, but most of the unions were \n     pretty upset with it.''\n       Five years ago, union leaders allowed the city to reduce \n     its contribution to their overfunded pension funds in a \n     landmark deal that paved the way for a $20 million property \n     tax cut, head-tax relief and $200 million in neighborhood \n     improvements.\n       In exchange, the city agreed to lobby the General Assembly \n     to increase the maximum retiree benefit from 75 percent of an \n     employee's highest salary to 80 percent.\n       That never happened. And it left a bad taste in the mouths \n     of the union leaders whose support Daley now needs to solve \n     the budget crisis.\n       ``If we go to our people and say, `The city needs a hand,' \n     they're going to say, `They came to us before, and they \n     didn't live up to their promise. Why should we help them \n     out?' '' said one labor leader, who asked to remain \n     anonymous.\n       Gannon agreed it's ``pretty hard to make more concessions \n     when we're still waiting on things that were promised to us \n     years ago.''\n       ``I'd like to see them pass the pension bill, see how many \n     people take retirement and then come back and talk to us \n     about reality,'' he added. ``We could actually have 600 \n     people take their pensions. We might not have to lay so many \n     people off.''\n       Schrader insisted the options laid out for union leaders \n     are not written in stone.\n       ``We need to achieve a certain amount of savings, and there \n     are several ways we can do it. It's not that rigid. We're \n     saying, `Let's work together and be creative,' '' she said.\n       The impact of layoffs on city services won't be known until \n     specific employees are targeted. But it could translate into \n     delayed garbage pickup, one union leader said.\n       Ten years ago, a budget crisis forced Daley to eliminate \n     1,474 jobs, 837 of them layoffs, and cancel a $25 million \n     property tax cut that was the cornerstone of his 1991 \n     reelection campaign.\n       The next year, he ordered an additional 740 layoffs and \n     proposed a $48.7 million property tax increase. A rare City \n     Council rebellion forced the mayor to settle for a $28.7 \n     million property tax increase and cancellation of a \n     supplemental increase to finance a new police contract.\n\n  The Mayor's pals get rich and the workers get to choose between \nlayoffs or unpaid days off. What a contrast.\n  But here is a different idea: why not take it from the inside guys \nfor a change? Why not take it from all the people who use their \nconnections and clout to cash in on no-bid contracts\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nand concessions at O'Hare, or Soldier Field, or Millennium Park?\n  Why not learn from Millennium Park and Soldier Field and exempt \nO'Hare before the Mayor can do it again? We have a competitive bid \nproposal for concessions and contracts at O'Hare. It is comprehensive. \nThe Daley-Ryan forces are opposing it. I wonder why that might be?\n  Maybe Mayor Daley should tell us, before the discussion goes any \nfarther, who's going to pour the concrete at O'Hare? Will it be someone \nwho has been lobbying for the expansion at O'Hare? Who will be hired as \nconsultants or so-called ``expediters''? Who will get a cut of the \ncontracts? Will it be Jeremiah Joyce or will it be Oscar D'Angelo? Who \nis going to get a piece of the action on the insurance? Is it Mickey \nSegal or is he too hot right now? What about the bonds? Who is going to \nrake it in there? Is it Baum and Co., and Tony Fratto? And what about \nthe janitorial contracts? Will that be John Duff, Jr. and his sons, the \nDuffs?\n  We have a chance to pass a Federal competitive bid provision for \nO'Hare in the U.S. Senate. If we pass it, it should mean a markedly \ndifferent way of doing business in Chicago, at least at O'Hare. There \nare a number of arguments we will make, and precedents we will review. \nMr. President, I look forward to the debate and to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues on that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 517, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n  A bill (S. 517) to authorize funding the Department of Energy to \nenhance its mission areas through technology transfer and partnerships \nfor fiscal years 2002 through 2006, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle/Bingaman further modified amendment No. 2917, in \n     the nature of a substitute.\n       Dayton/Grassley amendment No. 3008 (to amendment No. 2917), \n     to require that Federal agencies use ethanol-blended gasoline \n     and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in areas in which ethanol-\n     blended gasoline and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel are \n     available.\n       Landrieu/Kyl amendment No. 3050 (to amendment No. 2917), to \n     increase the transfer capability of electric energy \n     transmission systems through participant-funded investment.\n       Schumer/Clinton amendment No. 3093 (to amendment No. 2917), \n     to prohibit oil and gas drilling activity in Finger Lakes \n     National Forest, New York.\n       Dayton amendment No. 3097 (to amendment No. 2917), to \n     require additional findings for FERC approval of an electric \n     utility merger.\n       Feinstein/Boxer amendment No. 3115 (to amendment No. 2917), \n     to modify the provision relating to the renewable content of \n     motor vehicle fuel to eliminate the required volume of \n     renewable fuel for calendar year 2004.\n       Murkowski/Breaux/Stevens amendment No. 3132 (to amendment \n     No. 2917), to create jobs for Americans, to reduce dependence \n     on foreign sources of crude oil and energy, to strengthen the \n     economic self determination of the Inupiat Eskimos and to \n     promote national security.\n       Reid amendment No. 3145 (to amendment No. 3008), to require \n     that Federal agencies use ethanol-blended gasoline and \n     biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in areas in which ethanol-\n     blended gasoline and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel are \n     available.\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week the Senate adopted an amendment \nthat deals with vehicle efficiency. It deals with the issue of fuel \ncells. I want to describe the amendment, because I think it is a very \nimportant amendment.\n  The amendment directs the Energy Department to develop a program that \nwould create measurable goals and timetables with the aim of putting \n100,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the road by 2010, and 2.5 \nmillion by the year 2020, along with the needed hydrogen \ninfrastructure. DOE would have to report annually on its progress \ntoward achieving these goals.\n  The amendment is designed to have the Department of Energy work with \nthe auto manufacturers to ensure these goals are met. With this \namendment, we are sending a strong signal that our goal is to \naccelerate and enhance the development of fuel cell vehicles and fuel \ncell technologies with concrete targets and timetables.\n  I have asked the question with respect to our energy policy, \nespecially with respect to our transportation sector, about whether our \npolicy is going to be ``yesterday forever.'' I have said on previous \noccasions--and I will say it again--my first car was an antique 1924 \nModel T Ford that I bought for $25 as a young kid, and I restored it. \nIt took me a couple of years to restore that old Model T. But a 1924 \nModel T Ford is fueled exactly the same way as a current model Ford. \nYou drive up to the gas pump, stick a hose in the tank, and start \npumping. Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed in 78 years, and it \nought to change.\n  The issue of how we run our vehicles what kind of engines we use and \nwhat kind of fuel we use--we ought to inspire these changes by \ndeveloping aspirations and national goals with respect to new \ntechnologies. I drove a fuel cell car here on the Capitol grounds some \nmonths ago. It has essentially a limitless battery that allows you to \nrun the vehicle using this fuel cell. The fuel cell combines hydrogen \nand oxygen and the only byproduct is water vapor. Fuel cells have the \npotential to dramatically improve the efficiency of automobiles and \ndramatically reduce emissions, as opposed to the vehicles that we use \nnow, which have the internal combustion engine we have used for decade \nafter decade after decade.\n  We can decide that the debate will be a debate about our energy \nsupply, as it has always been. That has been the energy debate we have \nhad for a long while and will be again 25 and 50 years from now, unless \nwe decide to create national aspirations and goals for new \ntechnologies.\n  I believe we ought to do that with respect to automobiles. Our \ntransportation sector consumes the largest amount of energy in our \nsociety: about 40 percent of the oil products our Nation consumes each \nyear, or nearly 8 billion barrels of oil each day. In 2001, we imported \nabout 53 to 57 percent of our energy from abroad. That is expected to \nincrease, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n  So the question is, What do we do about that? Some say we should just \nadopt CAFE standards. Others say let's develop new technologies. Others \nsay let's not do anything at all. Let's let the marketplace decide who \nbuys what, when, and why.\n  I think this country ought to encourage the development and the \ncapability to move to a new technology. The Ford Motor Company \nrepresentative stated that alternative fuel technology has the \npotential to significantly improve the fuel economy of vehicles, which \ncould reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, and save consumers substantial money at the pump.\n\n  Most major automakers are racing to produce prototype fuel cell \nvehicles. DaimlerChrysler has been talking about this now for several \nyears. They plan to have a fuel cell car in production by the year \n2004. California has a Clean Air Act requirement that will ensure that \nmany fuel cell vehicles are going to be on the road. By next year--\n2003--2 percent of California's vehicles have to be zero-emission \nvehicles, and around 10 percent of its vehicles must be zero-emission \nvehicles by 2018. That means California could have nearly 40,000 or \n50,000 fuel cell cars on the road by the next decade.\n  The amendment I offered is supported by the Alliance to Save Energy\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nand United Technologies. Senators Cantwell, Bayh, Reid of Nevada, Dodd, \nLieberman, and Harkin all cosponsored my amendment. The amendment was \nadopted last week. I think most Members of the Senate want to move, \nusing new technology, to new opportunities and new goals for our \ncountry's future.\n  Fuel cells are expected to achieve energy efficiencies of 40 to 45 \npercent, and possibly much higher. After a century of constant \nimprovements, the internal combustion engine converts, on average, \nabout 19 percent of the energy and gasoline to turn the wheels of an \nautomobile--19 percent. Fuel cells are expected to achieve efficiencies \ndouble that: 40 to 45 percent at least.\n  I think that as we debate this energy bill there is much, perhaps, \nthat will persuade some that it is worthless. There is much in it that \nwill persuade others it has great merit. There are a fair number of \namendments that we have produced in the many weeks this bill has been \non the floor of the Senate--thanks to the patience of Senator Bingaman, \nwho I know wanted it completed much earlier--but there are many \namendments that have been added to a pretty sound piece of legislation, \nin the first instance, that I think will commend this legislation to \nthe Congress as a whole and to the American people as moving toward a \nsolution.\n  Finally, when the Energy Department testified before our Energy \nCommittee, I asked the representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy \nwhat goals they have for 25 and 50 years from now for our country's \nenergy supply and energy use. We talk a great deal about what is going \nto happen 25 and 50 years from now with respect to Social Security and \nMedicare. What about with respect to energy use and energy supply, do \nwe have goals there? The answer is, no, we do not. There are no such \ngoals.\n  We ought to develop those goals, in my judgment. That is the purpose \nof this amendment dealing with new vehicle technology, and specifically \nwith fuel cells.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3239\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Brownback and Corzine have offered \nan amendment No. 3239 to the underlying bill which replaces the \nmandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirement in the underlying bill \nwith a ``hard trigger.'' That means emissions reporting will continue \nto be voluntary for at least the next 5 years, but if voluntary reports \ndon't add up to at least 60 percent of total emissions at the end of 5 \nyears, then mandatory reporting will be triggered.\n  I think this is a sound approach. I applaud the Senators for working \ntogether to come up with a reasonable compromise between voluntary and \nmandatory.\n  This amendment is an important step forward in promoting the \ndevelopment of emissions trading markets and market-based programs to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I also note that it is my belief, if cloture is invoked on this \nunderlying bill, that this amendment will be in order.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will ask to submit an amendment to the \npending business which is the energy bill.\n  As we have seen over the past several days as the Senate has \nconsidered a variety of amendments to the energy bill, energy is not a \nsubject which can be taken up in isolation. It is such a pervasive fact \nof our existence that it necessarily has significant impacts on other \nimportant considerations. Two of those are our environment and other \naspects of our economy beyond energy itself.\n  The amendment I am offering today is intended to give to oil and gas \ncompanies, which currently hold leases for development in the eastern \nGulf of Mexico planning area, an option. This would provide to these \ncompanies a voluntary option to trade those existing leases for credits \nof an equivalent value. These credits could be used toward royalty \npayments and rental fees.\n  I have been working with mineral policy experts, representatives from \nthe oil industry, and concerned citizens over the past several months \nto try to develop a process that is reasonable, flexible, and mutually \nbeneficial. I believe this amendment captures all of those qualities.\n  First, the amendment is reasonable because it gives to oil companies \nthe voluntary option as to whether they wish to continue to pursue the \ndevelopment of the leases they have acquired--in many cases a \nconsiderable period of time in the past--or whether they would like to \nexchange those leases for credits which could be used to pay other \ncosts the oil companies owe the Federal Government in the form of \nroyalties or rentals. These credits take into account the amount the \noil and gas company paid for the original lease and expenditures for \nexploration on those leases.\n  Second, the amendment is flexible. It would require the Secretary of \nthe Interior to offer this lease-for-credit program to all of the \ncompanies that would be covered by the amendment, those that have \nleases in the eastern planning area, except for those that are \ncurrently in the process of application for a drilling permit, and the \ncompanies that voluntarily choose to participate in this program would \nreceive credits which can be used effective in the year 2012. The value \nof these credits would take into account inflation for the period \nbetween the time the credits were issued and the time in which the \ncredits were submitted for redemption. There also is a provision for \nadded flexibility to give the companies the ability to initiate the \nlease-for-credit process and not necessarily have to wait for the \nSecretary of the Interior to do so.\n  Third, the amendment is beneficial because it provides a win-win-win \nsituation for the current leaseholders, for the environment and the \neconomy, and for the Nation as a whole.\n  It provides to the oil and gas companies an option that will give \nthem value for leases in which today they have substantial cost but in \nmany cases limited prospects of deriving a benefit.\n  It will be beneficial to the environment and the economy of the \neastern Gulf of Mexico planning area. This is an area which is \npeculiarly dependent upon the quality of its water and the \nattractiveness of its coastal areas for its economic well-being.\n  In my State of Florida, tourism is the leading business, and of all \nthe reasons that people come to our State, consistently our coastal \nareas have been listed as the No. 1 attraction. They also are a part of \nour fundamental culture. They are to our State and to other areas in \nthe eastern planning region what, for instance, the Platte River would \nbe in Nebraska or the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. They help define \nwhat kind of place, what kind of people we are. They are a critical \npart of our environment, as witness the fact that the Federal \nGovernment, through the Coastal Zone Management Act, has made the \nprotection of our coastal zones a national priority.\n\n  The benefit to the Nation as a whole is seen by a precedent which has \nalready occurred. During the administration of the first President \nBush, there was concern about the potential adverse effects of a \nsimilar set of leases which covered approximately 600 square miles in \nthe area south of the 26th latitude--the 26th latitude runs east and \nwest, more or less, at the line of Naples to Fort Lauderdale--and that \nthe development of those leases over that large 600-square-mile expanse \ncould represent a serious threat to places such as Everglades National \nPark, the Dry Tortugas National Park, and the National Marine Sanctuary \nthat protects the coral reefs of the Florida Keys. Therefore, under the \nleadership of the first President Bush, an effort was initiated to \nreacquire those 600 square miles of leases.\n  This became embroiled in litigation. It took almost 8 years to \nresolve the matter. But in the final instance, in 1995, those 600 \nsquare miles of leases were terminated. A fair compensation was \narranged with the previous leaseholders, and the Nation benefited \nbecause some of its most valuable treasures were no longer subject to \nthat vulnerability.\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\n  I believe the same win-win-win arrangement will be possible through \nthis approach. It would be very appropriate that the now second \nPresident Bush, who as a candidate for President indicated his \nsensitivity to the importance of the coast, the environment, and the \neconomic relationship of those in my State and in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico planning area and indicated that he would use his influence to \nprovide protection--there is no better form of protection that can be \nprovided than that which is sought by this amendment and that which was \nachieved by his father's efforts in the area south of the 26th \nlatitude.\n  There have been some who have suggested that these are in some way \nselfish moves and motivated by a desire for self-protection; that every \npart of the country which is a user of energy, which means every part \nof the country, should also be a supplier of energy; and that no part \nof the country should be off limits to make that contribution.\n  That is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the United States of \nAmerica is. The United States of America is a republic of 50 States \nthat have given to the central government certain powers to be \nadministered under the laws that we and our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives pass.\n  The United States of America represents a common destiny, but each \nState has different things to contribute to that common destiny. As an \nexample, our State provides over half the national supply of phosphate, \na critical mineral, particularly for agriculture and for industrial \nactivities. It is an activity which has been environmentally difficult \nfor our State. I think maybe we are doing a better job today than we \ndid in previous times. But we accept that as part of our contribution \nto the Nation. Nature happened to put a lot of the world's phosphate in \nwhat is now the State of Florida.\n  Near those phosphate mines is also grown over half the citrus that is \nconsumed in the United States. That is a product that has great \nnutritional and health value. It requires a combination of climate and \nsoil type that is uniquely found in Florida; therefore, we produce a \nlot of citrus.\n  We also, during the winter months, provide a substantial percentage \nof all the fresh fruits and vegetables consumed in the eastern U.S. We \nare a major fisheries State. We are the largest State for tourism, and \nwe have the highest percentage of Americans who move to retire to \nsomeplace other than where they had lived. Florida receives more of \nthose retirees than any other State. So we make a substantial number of \ncontributions to America.\n  On the other side, we don't have much energy. Historically, we have \nnot been a site where a significant amount of oil, gas, coal, or other \nmajor energy sources have been found. We even have difficulty with \nthings that people find. Surprisingly, we are not a particularly good \nState for wind power because the winds are not reliable enough to \nconvert it into commercial applications.\n  We are also a State which has not benefited by the industrial \nrevolution, as most other States have. We were a State that did not \nhave the essential qualities that the industrial revolution required. \nEnergy access to certain raw materials, such as iron ore, cheap \ntransportation systems in proximity to markets--none of those were true \nin Florida in the 19th century. Therefore, we largely were passed over \nin the industrial revolution.\n  So every State has its own strengths, weaknesses, and contributions. \nI believe one of the synergies which makes America a great place is \nthat we recognize that and, collectively, we have almost a bounty of \neverything that humans would like to have. It just happens to be \ndistributed over a continental landmass of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  What Florida has particularly contributed, and what the eastern \nplanning area of the Gulf of Mexico includes, is beautiful waters, \npristine beaches, areas that contribute substantially to the economy, \nwhile at the same time protecting the environment. The principal threat \nto that environment today is the potential of developing inappropriate \noil and gas production, and that we might suffer some accident that \nwould result in damage to those critically important parts of our \nState.\n  This amendment I am offering, I believe, stands the test of being \nfair to all parties--fair to the oil and gas companies by giving them a \nvoluntary election, a means by which they can recapture past expenses \nin the form of credits that they can use for required future expenses, \nbalanced insofar as protecting the economy and the environment of the \neastern Gulf of Mexico, and will meet the same kind of national \nstandards as the first President George Bush did when he led the way \nto eliminate 600 square miles of oil and gas leases off the Florida \nKeys and the southwest coast of my State.\n\n  This is an opportunity that I hope we will grasp as part of this \nenergy bill. I recognize there are, in a parliamentary sense, other \namendments that will be considered prior to this. We will be taking a \nvote tomorrow on a cloture motion, which could further affect the \nprocedure for consideration of amendments. But I am committed that the \nCongress will have an opportunity to consider this approach, which I \nthink brings such value and security to our Nation and to our future \nenvironment and economy.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to outline this proposal. At the \nappropriate time, I look forward to calling this amendment before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that Secretary of State Colin \nPowell has concluded his recent diplomatic mission to Israel and the \nMiddle East, I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on recent \nevents in the region. There are many opinions about the most effective \napproach to the current crisis, but I believe the Bush administration's \nrenewed emphasis on ending the violence and reaching a negotiated \nsettlement is a positive development.\n  As America properly takes steps to defend our Nation's vital economic \nand security interests in the region, though, we must be mindful that \nIsrael is a sovereign nation with a responsibility to defend the safety \nand security of its citizens. After suffering dozens of deadly attacks \naimed at innocent civilians during the last 18 months, I believe Israel \nhas every right to take steps, including military action, to neutralize \nPalestinian terrorists that Yasser Arafat and the PLO have been unable \nor unwilling to detain. I would expect no less from our Nation and it \nis unfair to ask any less from Israel. The United States endured some \ninternational criticism for our anti-terrorism campaign in Afghanistan \nand I would expect a special empathy by the U.S. Government toward \nIsrael as it faces similar criticism today.\n  I am optimistic that the current military operation in the West Bank \nwill curb the violence so that the peace process can proceed in a \nmeaningful way. To achieve a final settlement, all interested parties \nwill be required to make painful and difficult choices in the weeks and \nmonths ahead. I believe Israel has demonstrated its willingness and \nability over time to live up to its commitments and responsibilities to \nexist peacefully with its neighbors.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of leadership and vision exhibited by the \nPalestinian Authority in recent years has, in my estimation, prevented \nthe Palestinian people from achieving liberation and attaining the \nhopes and dreams they\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\ndeserve. Let's hope Chairman Arafat fully appreciates the precarious \nnature of his current position and how the choices he makes in the \nimmediate future will determine what role he will play in future peace \nnegotiations.\n  I want to conclude, by expressing my profound sadness for the tragic \nloss of life that has befallen both Israelis and Palestinians in this \nconflict. As a person of faith, I value the inherent dignity of every \nhuman being and believe all interested parties have a responsibility to \nactively pursue the benefits of peace and freedom. It is my sincere \nhope that through strong leadership and determination, the next \ngeneration of Israeli and Palestinian children will be able to focus on \nbuilding a prosperous future instead of on the carnage and destruction \nof the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3012-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EVERY DAY IS EARTH DAY IN OREGON\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \non the occasion of Earth Day, which was first officially recognized 32 \nyears ago. I can assure you, however, that the spirit of Earth Day has \nbeen in bold practice for generations in my home State of Oregon, where \nthe words of John Jay ring true: ``this land and these people were made \nfor each other.''\n  What is unique about Oregon is that, for so many, there is a profound \nconnection between the products and comforts of our daily lives and \nwhere those products ultimately came from. In Oregon, it is difficult \nto forget that the wood our homes are built of came first from a \nforest, a forest that was harvested and has since been regenerated. We \nknow that the food we buy for our families at grocery stores came first \nfrom a farm, a farm most likely owned and operated by another family \nnot unlike our own. Oregonians can easily remember these things because \nthe forests and the farms are not in some distant region, they are \nright down the road.\n  Down those countryside and mountain roads, you will find Oregon's \nfirst and finest environmentalists: generations of fishers, farmers and \nforesters who learned long ago that Oregon's rich natural resources \ncould be perpetually sustained through careful stewardship and \ninnovation.\n  Down one of those roads, near The Dalles, you will find the Baileys, \nwho were recently given the American Farmland Trust's Steward of the \nLand Award. The Bailey's orchard was established in 1923, and \nsuccessive members of the Bailey family have continued to use the \nlatest research and technology to minimize the farm's impact on the \nland and water. The Baileys initiated an Integrated Fruit Production \nprogram for their trees, which includes efficient and responsible pest \nmanagement, irrigation practices and control of weeds without residual \nherbicides.\n  They have also been strong advocates of preserving farmland and \nagricultural communities. For the Baileys and so many others, the \nvalues of the farm go far beyond the safe and affordable food they \nprovide, but also extends to the scenic open space, wildlife habitat \nand filters for clean air and water that the farm provides.\n  The growing awareness of those values has finally reached the \npolicymakers in this country. I am eager and hopeful that a balanced \nagreement on this year's Farm Bill will include a landmark commitment \nto cost-share and incentive payments for farm stewardship practices, as \noutlined in the Harkin-Smith Conservation Security Act. When that \ninvestment is made, we will have taken a bold step toward recognizing \nand rewarding all the Baileys of this country, and ensuring that there \nare many more to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3012-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3012-S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFOREIGN LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY EDUCATION \n            PROGRAM'S NATIONAL FLAGSHIP LANGUAGE INITIATIVE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to request full funding \nfor the Foreign Language Assistance Program, FLAP, which has been cut \nfrom the President's fiscal year 2003 budget and for the National \nSecurity Education Program's, NSEP, National Flagship Language \nInitiative. These two programs would enhance the foreign language \ncapabilities of this Nation at a time when foreign language proficiency \nplays a critical role in maintaining our national security. The \nsecurity, stability, and economic vitality of the United States depend \non American citizens knowledgeable about the world. To become so, we \nneed to encourage knowledge of foreign languages and cultures.\n  Unfortunately, the United States faces a critical shortage of \nlanguage proficient professionals throughout Federal agencies. The \ninability of law enforcement officers, intelligence officers, \nscientists, military personnel, and other federal employees to decipher \nand interpret information from foreign sources, as well as interact \nwith foreign nationals, presents a threat to their mission and to the \nwell being of the Nation. It is crucial that we invest in programs like \nthe Flagship Initiative and FLAP in order to strengthen the security of \nthe United States.\n  While the General Accounting Office has highlighted the Federal \nGovernment's deficiency in personnel with foreign language proficiency, \nthe entire country became aware of this problem after the events of \nSeptember 11th, when FBI Director Robert Mueller called on English-\nspeaking Americans with professional level proficiency in Arabic and \nFarsi to help with the translation of documents for the ensuing \ninvestigation. To address this need, Senators Durbin, Thompson, and I \nintroduced S. 1799, the Homeland Security Education Act, and S. 1800, \nthe Homeland Security Federal Workforce Act. These proposals are \ndesigned to improve educational programs in science, mathematics, and \nforeign languages and then attract graduates possessing these critical \nskills to the Federal Government.\n  However, these legislative initiatives cannot succeed if the \nfoundations on which they are based are not supported. Moreover, while \nthese initiatives go a long way to help agencies recruit those \npossessing these critical skills, we needs programs like FLAP and the \nFlagship Initiative to create a larger talented and proficient \napplicant pool to address the growing foreign language needs in the \nnational security community.\n  NSEP was created in 1991 by the David L. Boren National Security \nEducation Act, P.L. 102-183, and administers three programs to enhance \nforeign language education: undergraduate scholarships for study \nabroad, graduate fellowships, and grants to U.S. institutions of higher \neducation. As part of its grant program, NSEP intends to implement a \nNational Flagship Language Initiative. The Flagship Initiative would \nestablish national and regional language programs in universities \nthroughout the Nation. These institutions would in turn educate \nsignificant numbers of graduates, across disciplines, with advanced \nproficiency levels in those languages critical to our national \nsecurity.\n  The Flagship Initiative is designed to address the urgent and growing \nneed for higher levels of language competency among a broader cross-\nsection of professionals, particularly for those who will join the \nfederal workforce. The goal is to produce students with professional \nproficiency in critical foreign languages. Professional proficiency is \nconsidered to be at least a level 3 proficiency in listening, reading, \nand speaking where an individual is capable of speaking with sufficient \nstructural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most \nformal and informal conversations on practical, social, and \nprofessional topics.\n\n  However, current foreign language programs in the United State, both \nFederal and academic, at best, aim toward `limited working proficiency' \nwhich is defined as level 2. This skill level includes the ability to \nsatisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements and handle \nroutine work-related interactions that are limited in scope. Level 2 \nproficiency is generally insufficient for more complex and \nsophisticated work-related national security tasks.\n  While programs like the Flagship Initiative would make significant \nimprovements in the country's language capabilities, university-level \ntraining alone will not meet the challenge currently before us. We must \nalso take steps to address what foreign language experts have \nrecommended for years--start early. The Foreign Language Assistance \nProgram, FLAP, initiates, through competitive grants, foreign\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nlanguage study at the elementary and secondary level--when students \nhave the best chances of developing the strongest language \nproficiencies as adults. Eliminating funding for FLAP would be a \ndisservice to the nation. We would have contributed to the lack of \nforeign language proficiencies at a time when the government needs \npeople with those skills the most.\n  Both FLAP and NSEP have suffered from inadequate funding over the \npast few years. Funding for FLAP was $14 million in FY 2002, but the \nprogram has never received funding resembling that which was \nanticipated at its inception $35 million.\n  NSEP receives funding from the National Security Education Trust \nFund. Under the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY 1992, \nthe NSEP trust fund received $150 million. Since then, more than $80 \nmillion from the trust fund has been transferred to other federal \nprojects and only $8 million has been appropriated for NSEP projects \neach year. The trust fund is now valued at $43 million. This amount \nalone cannot support both NSEP's current programs and the innovative \nFlagship Initiative.\n  NSEP has conducted a survey of universities and has found a number of \nthem willing and qualified to participate in this program. I am pleased \nto say that the University of Hawaii has been designated a likely \nflagship school due to the strength of its faculty and curriculum. \nHowever, in order to implement this program, approximately 10 national \nflagship programs and three regional flagship programs will be \nrequired. It is estimated that full implementation across a wide array \nof languages will require an investment of at least $20 million per \nyear.\n  I urge my colleagues to support full funding of FLAP and the Flagship \nInitiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3013-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF RUDOLFO ANAYA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \naccomplishments of Chicano writer Rudolfo Anaya. Often considered ``the \ngodfather of Chicano literature,'' Mr. Anaya writes of Hispanic culture \nand his experiences in the American Southwest, and especially of life \nin New Mexico.\n  Born in the small village of Pastura, NM, Mr. Anaya is the fifth \nchild of seven in a devout Catholic family. Growing up, Rudolfo's \nfamily spoke Spanish at home sharing stories about their culture and \nhistory. His upbringing in the American Southwest taught him to be \nproud of his Hispanic heritage which is often reflected in his writing. \nRudolfo's technique of ``cuento'' stems from this important Hispanic \ntradition of oral storytelling.\n  Mr. Anaya can be proud of his many accomplishments. It would be hard \nto find a Chicano studies or literature course that did not include one \nof Rudolfo's works, such as ``Bless Me, Ultima,'' which won the Premio \nQuinto Sol national award for Chicano literature. In addition, New \nMexicans and readers around the world have enjoyed his novel \n``Albuquerque,'' his children's book, ``The Farolitos of Christmas,'' \nand his other essays and plays.\n  In addition, Rudolfo has worked diligently to inspire and promote \nother Hispanic writers. He has encouraged publishers to recruit more \nHispanic writers and share their stories with the American public. His \nefforts have also helped Hispanic children find an interest in reading, \nstimulating a new generation to become more involved in their history \nand improving their literacy skills.\n  President Bush has chosen to honor Rudolfo Anaya's accomplishments by \nbestowing on him a National Medal of Arts for 2001. Originally created \nby Congress in 1984, the National Medal of Arts allows the President to \nselect exceptional individuals for ``their outstanding contributions to \nthe excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in the \nUnited States.'' Clearly, Rudolfo is one such individual deserving of \nrecognition for his contributions not only to the arts but to Hispanic \nculture as well.\n  Rudolfo is a living New Mexico treasure, giving voice to the heritage \nand culture of a proud people. Through his writings we get a chance to \nenter the heart of the Chicano and Hispanic culture that is part and \nparcel of who we are, as a whole, as New Mexicans. On behalf of the \nSenate, I want to thank this fellow New Mexican for the fine work he \nhas done. I am proud of him and commend him on receiving a National \nMedal of Arts award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3013-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO SHARON DARLING\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sharon \nDarling, the founder and president of the National Center for Family \nLiteracy, in Louisville, KY. Sharon is a recipient of the 2001 National \nHumanities Medal and I want to offer my congratulations to her on this \ntremendous honor.\n  Sharon Darling is a devoted civic leader and a longtime advocate of \nfamily literacy. Through hands on experience as an elementary school \nteacher and an adult reading mentor, Sharon developed an education \nprogram that stresses the importance of early childhood education, \nadult literacy education, and parental involvement in the learning \nprocess. In 1989, she used her revolutionary program as a foundation \nfor establishing the National Center for Family Literacy. Under \nSharon's leadership the NCFL has grown into a widely respected national \norganization that promotes family literacy. Today the NCFL has more \nthan 3,000 literacy programs throughout America.\n  The National Humanities Medal honors individuals whose work has \ncontributed to their community by broadening citizens' access to the \nhumanities. Given the years of service Sharon has dedicated to helping \nfamilies read, I cannot think of anyone more deserving of this honor. \nWhether helping them to enjoy classic literature or simply understand \nwritten instructions, Sharon's work has improved the lives of countless \nAmericans.\n  Sharon's commitment to public service does not end with the National \nCenter for Family Literacy. She also actively serves with a number of \nimportant national and international organizations such as the \nInternational Women's Forum, Barbara Bush Foundation for Family \nLiteracy, National Coalition for Literacy, the American Indian \nEducation Foundation, and the Heart of America Foundation.\n  Sharon, my colleagues, and I, join in congratulating you on your fine \nachievements. We also thank you for the time and effort you have put \ninto the lives of others. I know the people of Kentucky and this great \nnation will continue to benefit from your contributions for many years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3013-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 29, 2001 \nin Nashville, Tennessee. Willie Houston, 38, was fatally shot in the \nchest. The alleged gunman, Lewis Maynard Davidson III, 25, taunted the \nvictim with anti-gay epithets, and shot him outside a restaurant. While \nthe victim was reportedly not gay, Tennessee hate crime laws cover \nviolence based on real or perceived sexual orientation.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 3101 West Sunflower Avenue in Santa Ana, as the \n``Hector G. Godinez Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support \na bill to name the Santa Ana, CA Post Office as the ``Hector G. Godinez \nPost Office Building.'' I introduced similar legislation the during the \nlast session of Congress, and I hope, with the Senate's support, it \nwill become law during this session.\n  Hector Godinez, who passed away in May of 1999, was a true leader in \nhis community of Santa Ana, CA. He was a pioneer in the United States \nPostal Service rising from letter carrier to become the first Mexican-\nAmerican to achieve the rank of District Manager within the United \nStates Postal Service. He served with honor in World War II, was a \nardent civil rights activist and an active participant in civic \norganizations and local government.\n  After graduation from Santa Ana High School, Mr. Godinez enlisted \ninto the armed services and was a tank commander in World War II under \nGeneral George Patton. For his service, he earned a bronze star for \nbravery under fire and was also awarded a purple heart for wounds \nreceived in battle.\n  Upon his return home in 1946, Mr. Godinez started his first of 48 \nyears of distinguished service as a United States postal worker.\n  Hector Godinez was a true pillar within the Santa Ana community \ndevoting his tireless energy to such civic groups as the Orange County \nDistrict Boy Scouts of America, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, Orange \nCounty YMCA and National President of the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, one of the country's oldest Hispanic civil rights \norganizations.\n  On behalf of the Godinez family and the people of Santa Ana, CA, it \nis my pleasure to introduce this bill to name the Santa Ana, CA Post in \nhis honor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 2220. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require \nimplementation by brand owners of management plans that provide refund \nvalues for certain beverage containers; to the Committee on Environment \nan Public Works.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day \nto introduce the National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2002. \nThis legislation will increase recycling, reduce litter, save energy, \ncreate jobs, decrease the generation of waste and proliferation of \nlandfills, and supply recyclable materials for a high-demand market.\n  The estimated 1999 recycling rate for aluminum, glass and plastic \nbeverage containers was 41 percent when measured by units and 30 \npercent when measured by weight. This is unacceptable. We have many \nlaws in place holding industries responsible for their actions; the \nbeverage industry should not be exempt.\n  The arguments for increasing the beverage container recycling rate to \n80 percent could not be more timely. This redemption rate would save \nthe equivalent of 640 million barrels of oil in the next decade. Based \non 1999 figures, recycled containers accounted for a reduction of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 4,093,000 metric tons, or about 79 pounds \nfor each of 103.9 million households in the U.S. Analysis shows that \nland filling the containers recycled in 1999 would have required the \nuse of about 20 million cubic yards of landfill space. A single \nlandfill of this size, with a depth of 300 feet, would cover an area of \nabout 40 acres. Recycling is an easy way to ease our dependence on \nforeign oil, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and conserve natural \nresources.\n  Ten States, including Vermont, attest to the success of deposit \nlegislation, commonly called bottle bills. Vermont, whose law passed in \n1972, has one of the highest redemption rates in the nation, 95 to 98 \npercent of deposit-bearing containers are recycled. The popularity \nbehind the issue grows every year; thirty bottle bills were introduced \nthis year in State legislatures across this country.\n  The National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act of 2002 is a new \napproach to the traditional bottle bill\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nlegislation, which prescribes specific roles and responsibilities for \nretailers and distributors. Some believe that these prescriptive \nprovisions constrain the industry from innovating more cost-effective \nsolutions to the beverage container management challenge.\n  The National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act sets a performance \nstandard which industry must meet and allows industry the freedom to \ndesign the most efficient deposit-return program to reach the standard. \nBy providing beverage companies the flexibility to structure and \noperate their own container recovery programs, this legislation simply \nextends the beverage company's ``supply chain'' to include the \nmanagement of empty containers after consumption. This approach is \nappealing because it reduces the administrative burden on government \nand takes full advantage of the business skills of industry.\n  Specifically, the National Beverage Producer Responsibility Act \nwould: establish a measurable performance standard of 80% recovery of \nused, empty beverage containers for recycling or reuse; establish a \nminimum refundable deposit, of 10 cents, as the economic incentive for \nconsumers to recycle; require beverage brand-owners, as a condition of \nsale of their product, to develop and submit to the Environmental \nProtection Agency a Beverage Container Management Plan, within 180 days \nof the law's implementation; establish consequences for failing to \nsubmit, implement and operate the approved Program and achieve the \nlegislated Performance Standard; and establish provisions for \nevaluation and monitoring of the industry's performance.\n  I look forward to holding a hearing on this legislation this summer \nin the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the beverage industry has an established and effective \n     marketing infrastructure that provides a wide range of \n     beverage products at affordable prices to consumers in the \n     United States;\n       (2) the absence of a beverage industry infrastructure for \n     recovering used beverage containers has--\n       (A) placed undue burdens on local waste authorities;\n       (B) failed to provide any incentive for the beverage \n     industry to reduce waste; and\n       (C) resulted in tens of billions of unrecycled beverage \n     containers per year, including 114,000,000,000 unrecycled \n     beverage containers in 1999;\n       (3) of particular concern--\n       (A) glass beverage containers are difficult and costly to \n     recycle through municipal curbside programs because of \n     breakage;\n       (B) valuable beverage container types are being replaced \n     with low-value plastics and composite packaging; and\n       (C) removing glass or other valuable beverage container \n     types from curbside programs has been found to reduce the \n     public costs of those programs;\n       (4) an efficient, industry-operated system of beverage \n     container collection, recycling, and reuse would--\n       (A) reduce the overall burden placed on taxpayers and \n     municipal waste management systems; and\n       (B) shift the responsibility for that collection, \n     recycling, and reuse to beverage producers and consumers;\n       (5) deposit systems, originally devised by the beverage \n     industry to recover used bottles, have been shown to be an \n     effective and sustainable means for recovering used beverage \n     containers, especially the increasing proportion of beverage \n     containers the beverages contained by which are consumed away \n     from the home;\n       (6) greater reuse and recycling of beverage containers \n     would--\n       (A) significantly improve the energy and emissions \n     performance of the beverage industry of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) in each year, conserve an amount of electrical energy \n     equivalent to that required to serve millions of homes in the \n     United States;\n       (7) 10 States have enacted and implemented laws designed to \n     protect the environment, conserve energy and material \n     resources, and reduce waste by requiring--\n       (A) beverage consumers to pay a deposit on the purchase of \n     beverage containers; and\n       (B) the beverage industry to pay a refund on used beverage \n     containers that are returned for reuse and recycling;\n       (8) those laws--\n       (A) enjoy strong public support; and\n       (B) have proven to be effective in achieving high rates of \n     beverage container reuse and recycling;\n       (9) a national standard for beverage container reuse and \n     recycling would ensure that beverage consumers in all regions \n     of the United States would enjoy access to beverage container \n     reuse and recycling services;\n       (10) a beverage container reuse and recycling system \n     designed by brand owners could--\n       (A) be seamlessly integrated with the national and regional \n     marketing systems of the brand owners;\n       (B) maximize efficiency of the brand owners; and\n       (C) minimize unproductive costs of compliance with \n     requirements of several different recycling programs;\n       (11) a national system of beverage container reuse and \n     recycling is consistent with the intent of the Solid Waste \n     Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); and\n       (12) this Act is consistent with the goals established by \n     the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     including the national goal of 35 percent source reduction \n     and recycling by 2005.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to temporarily increase the Federal medical \nassistance percentage for the medicaid program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a \nvital federal program that is an essential part of our health care \nsafety net--Medicaid. Last year, the Medicaid program provided health \ncoverage for 44 million of the most vulnerable Americans--22.6 million \nchildren, 9.2 million adults in low-income families, and 12 million \nelderly and disabled. One in four American children are covered by this \nimportant program.\n  Yet despite the program's importance, states around the country are \nstruggling to fund their share of their Medicaid programs. Going into \nlegislative session this year, my home state of Oregon faced a budget \nshortfall of nearly $800 million, and most other states are facing \nsimilar conditions. The cruel irony of this situation is that just as \nstate revenues have dropped due to poor economic conditions, many more \nfamilies are turning to Medicaid as their only source of health care. I \nknow that in Oregon, the number of people on Medicaid has risen by 10% \nsince June of last year, and I suspect that many of your states have \nexperienced similar increases. Additionally, because of scheduled \nformula adjustments, many states will see their existing Medicaid \npayments from the Federal government fall this year.\n  It is not a mystery what will happen if we do not act: states will be \nforced to cut their Medicaid programs and more Americans will lose \ntheir health coverage. The number of uninsured people in this country \nwill rise dramatically. Last year, more than 40 million Americans lived \nand worked without health insurance, and it is estimated that the \neconomic downturn will add another 4 million to the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  This legislation would allow states to continue providing health care \nto our society's most vulnerable members in this economic downturn by \nproviding a temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance \nProgram, FMAP, funds states receive to pay their portion of the \nMedicaid bill. This legislation would hold states harmless at their \n2003 FMAP levels so that no state will experience a decrease in Federal \nfunds for Medicaid, while providing all states with an additional \ntemporary 1.5 percentage in their matching rates for three years. It \nwould also target assistance to the most needy states by providing \nanother 1.5 percentage point increase in their FMAP for three years.\n  The goal of this bill is to prevent erosion of health insurance \ncoverage and to maintain a strong health care safety net for vulnerable \npeople during the economic downturn. By temporarily increasing the \nFederal portion of the Medicaid bill, the scope and depth of possible \nstate budget cuts or tax increases will be lessened, minimizing the \npotential negative impact on the economy and our most vulnerable \ncitizens across the country. It is the right thing to do, and the right \ntime to do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3018-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3018-S3019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 247--EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH ISRAEL IN ITS FIGHT \n                           AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nCleland, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

America has a message for the nations of the \n     world: If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you \n     train or arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a \n     terrorist or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist, and you \n     will be held accountable by the United States and our \n     friends.''; and\n       Whereas the United States has committed to provide \n     resources to states on the frontline in the war against \n     terrorism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) stands in solidarity with Israel, a frontline state in \n     the war against terrorism, as it takes necessary steps to \n     provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist \n     infrastructure in the Palestinian areas;\n       (2) remains committed to Israel's right to self-defense;\n       (3) will continue to assist Israel in strengthening its \n     homeland defenses;\n       (4) condemns Palestinian suicide bombings;\n       (5) demands that the Palestinian Authority fulfill its \n     commitment to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the \n     Palestinian areas;\n       (6) urges all Arab states, particularly the United States' \n     allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to declare their unqualified \n     opposition to all forms of terrorism, particularly suicide \n     bombing, and to act in concert with the United States to stop \n     the violence; and\n       (7) urges all parties in the region to pursue vigorously \n     efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace \n     in the Middle East.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have submitted a resolution today, \nalong with Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Daschle, our majority \nleader, and we are currently in the process of communicating with the \nRepublican leader. I hope Senator Lott will become the fourth initial \ncosponsor of this resolution which expresses the solidarity of \nCongress--Senate and House--with the State of Israel in its fight \nagainst terrorism.\n  The painful events of September 11 have taught us Americans a \npowerful lesson: When innocent people are attacked, we have no choice \nbut to capture or kill those killers and dismantle their terrorist \ninfrastructure. That is the first step in reducing the likelihood of \nfuture attacks and making clear through our actions--not just our \nwords--that violence against innocents will never be tolerated.\n  Now we see Israel under siege by a systematic and deliberate campaign \nof suicide-homicide attacks whose essence is identical to the attacks \non our country on September 11. Those suicide bombers striking innocent \nIsraelis in supermarkets, pizza restaurants, buses, and schools are cut \nfrom the same cloth of fanatical, inhumane hatred as those terrorists \nwho turned airplanes into weapons of mass destruction and killed more \nthan 3,000 Americans on September 11.\n  God knows that we have not always been astute enough to learn from \nhistory, but when the history of September 11 is this fresh in our \nminds and in our hearts, and the lessons are as clear and compelling as \nthe lessons of September 11 were, let us not fail to apply those \nlessons. Let us not waver, let us not blur our vision or our values, \nparticularly in this case when the victims of the country are citizens \nof a fellow democracy and a great ally, which is to say the State of \nIsrael.\n  Instead, let us recall the principled message of President Bush in \nhis address to Congress less than 7 months ago: Terrorism is evil. It \nis not an acceptable form of political action. It is a crime that runs \ncontrary to our most basic human values. Nations that support it, \ncondone it, or enable it are our enemies, and nations that dismantle \nits immoral, inhuman machinery and go after its perpetrators to protect \ninnocent lives of their citizens are doing freedom's work and they are \nour allies.\n  In laying out this doctrine, President Bush actually echoed the words \nthat\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt spoke in 1940 when he said:\n\n       No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There \n     can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no \n     reasoning with an incendiary bomb.\n\n  The United States supports a peaceful Palestine along a secure \nIsrael, as, for that matter, does Israel herself. We support a two-\nstate solution. In other words, we support what we hope and pray is \nstill the cause of the vast majority of the Palestinian people. But \nthere is a danger that these suicide bombers operating out of \nPalestinian territory have hijacked the legitimate cause of Palestinian \nstatehood. These homicide bombers do not represent what we hope is the \naspiration of a majority of the Palestinian people for statehood, for a \nbetter life for themselves and their children.\n  These homicide bombers--terrorists--insult that cause and undermine \ntheir own people's desire to live a better life. They represent a \nmorally bankrupt and tactically suicide policy. Their militancy will \nonly deepen the misery of the Palestinian people.\n  Ultimately, in supporting Israel's right to protect and defend \nitself, we are also supporting our own war against terrorism because if \nwe lose our bearings and muddy the moral clarity with which we began \nand are carrying out our campaign against terror, we risk undermining \nthe fight against al-Qaida and other international terrorist groups \nthat threaten our own people. We cannot allow that.\n  The United States, acting in concert with Israel and our allies in \nthe Arab world, and hopefully our allies in the rest of the world, \nincluding Europe and Asia, can still bring security to the region. It \ncan still happen if mainstream, moderate leaders in the Arab world will \nnot accommodate themselves out of fear or insecurity to the threats of \nthe fanatical elements within the region but will stand up with our \nstrong support and assert that the only way to achieve a better future \nfor the Palestinian people and, in fact, for all the people in the \nMiddle East, is to come together for the good people, to come together \nbehind the rule of law against fanaticism, against solving problems \nwith violence, for more human rights, for more democracy, for the kind \nof open economies that allow people to raise up their standard of \nliving and deprive terrorists of the conditions they exploit for \nviolent and suicidal purposes. Together, we can bring such a result to \nthe region.\n  This week, President Bush has two very important meetings: One with \nKing Mohamed VI of Morocco, the other with Crown Prince Abdullah of \nSaudi Arabia. These are opportunities not only to develop the hopes \nexpressed in the Saudi peace proposal for mutual recognition of Israel \nby the Arab world, but to make clear to our allies in the Arab world \nand countries like Saudi Arabia and Morocco how critically important \ntheir own moral clarity in this moment of crisis is; that we need them \nto stand with us for a peaceful path to Palestinian statehood and a \nbetter life for all the people of their region.\n  Ultimately, that only comes with more human rights for their citizens \nand a more open economic society with more opportunity. Together we can \ncreate conditions for a just and lasting peace, a peaceful and \nsovereign Palestine alongside a peaceful and secure Israel. It is time \nfor the humane, law-abiding forces within the Middle East and those \noutside to come together and defeat the cancer of terrorism that now \neats away at that region and the world.\n  The United States must stand with our ally, Israel, sharing values \nand hopes for peace as we do, as she attempts to defeat and protect her \ncitizens from acts of terrorism. That is the message we send with the \nresolution we are submitting today. I hope an overwhelming majority of \nmy colleagues will join Senator Smith and me, Senator Daschle and, I \nhope, Senator Lott, in cosponsoring this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/22/senate-section/article/S3019-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3019-S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3177.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds that:\n       (1) Many corporate tax shelter transactions are complicated \n     ways of accomplishing nothing aside from claimed tax \n     benefits, and the legal opinions justifying those \n     transactions take an inappropriately narrow and restrictive \n     view of well-developed court doctrines under which--\n       (A) the taxation of a transaction is determined in \n     accordance with its substance and not merely its form,\n       (B) transactions which have no significant effect on the \n     taxpayer's economic or beneficial interests except for tax \n     benefits are treated as sham transactions and disregarded,\n       (C) transactions involving multiple steps are collapsed \n     when those steps have no substantial economic meaning and are \n     merely designed to create tax benefits,\n       (D) transactions with no business purpose are not given \n     effect, and\n       (E) in the absence of a specific congressional \n     authorization, it is presumed that Congress did not intend a \n     transaction to result in a negative tax where the taxpayer's \n     economic position or rate of return is better after tax than \n     before tax.\n       (2) Permitting aggressive and abusive tax shelters not only \n     results in large revenue losses but also undermines voluntary \n     compliance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to eliminate \n     abusive tax shelters by denying tax attributes claimed to \n     arise from transactions that do not meet a heightened \n     economic substance requirement and by repealing the provision \n     that permits legal opinions to be used to avoid penalties on \n     tax underpayments resulting from transactions without \n     significant economic substance or business purpose.\n\n          PART I--CLARIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE DOCTRINE\n\n     SEC. __11.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the Earth's \n     average temperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years.'' The \n     National Academy of Sciences also noted that ``because there \n     is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how \n     the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions \n     of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the \n     magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative \n     and subject to future adjustments upward or downward.''\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years, the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) In October 2000, a U.S. government report found that \n     global climate change may harm the United States by altering \n     crop yields, accelerating sea-level rise, and increasing the \n     spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ultimate \n     objective of which is the ``stabilization of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would \n     prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \n     system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-\n     frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to \n     climate change, to ensure that food production is not \n     threatened and to enable economic development to proceed \n     in a sustainable manner.''\n       (7) The UNFCCC stated in part that the Parties to the \n     Convention are to implement policies ``with the aim of \n     returning . . . to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions \n     of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases'' under the \n     principle that ``policies and measures . . . should be \n     appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and \n     should be integrated with national development programmes, \n     taking into account that economic development is essential \n     for adopting measures to address climate change.''\n       (8) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (9) The UNFCCC further stated that ``developed country \n     Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and \n     the adverse effects thereof,'' as these nations are the \n     largest historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases. \n     The UNFCCC also stated that ``steps required to understand \n     and address climate change will be environmentally, socially \n     and economically most effective if they are based on relevant \n     scientific, technical and economic considerations and \n     continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in \n     these areas.''\n       (10) Senate Resolution 98 of the 105th Congress, which \n     expressed that developing nations must also be included in \n     any future, binding climate change treaty and such a treaty \n     must not result in serious harm to the United States economy, \n     should not cause the United States to abandon its shared \n     responsibility to help reduce the risks of climate change and \n     its impacts. Future international efforts in this regard \n     should focus on recognizing the equitable responsibilities \n     for addressing climate change by all nations, including \n     commitments by the largest developing country emitters in a \n     future, binding climate change treaty.\n       (11) It is the position of the United States that it will \n     not interfere with the plans of any nation that chooses to \n     ratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n       (12) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will address the risks of climate change.\n       (13) The United States benefits from investments in the \n     research, development and deployment of a range of clean \n     energy and efficiency technologies that can reduce the risks \n     of climate change and its impacts and that can make the \n     United States economy\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n     more productive, bolster energy security, create jobs, and \n     protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the United \n     States Congress that the United States should demonstrate \n     international leadership and responsibility in reducing the \n     health, environmental, and economic risks posed by climate \n     change by:\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors:\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, tradable credits for emissions reductions and \n     carbon sequestration projects that will reduce, avoid, and \n     sequester greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal to the Conference of the Parties, \n     with the objective of securing United States' participation \n     in a future binding climate change Treaty in a manner that is \n     consistent with the environmental objectives of the UNFCCC, \n     that protects the economic interests of the United States, \n     and recognizes the shared international responsibility for \n     addressing climate change, including developing country \n     participation.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Climate Change Strategy\n\n     SEC. 1011.
