Mr. President, all of us are pleased to be back, able to \ngo on and finish the business we have yet to do. There is a lot of it, \nof course. I have read from time to time that we have been on vacation. \nI have to tell you, it is scarcely a vacation. All of us spend this \ntime, as we should, traveling in our States and visiting with the \npeople we represent. Frankly, it is a real pleasure and honor to travel \nabout Wyoming this time of year. It is important that we reflect on \nwhat we have heard, some of the issues laid before us, some of the \nnotions of the people at home. After all, it is our responsibility to \nbe here to represent those people.\n  There are a number of things we all hear about and hear about \nrepeatedly while we are in our States. One of them is the tax issue, \nthe idea of tax reduction, and specifically the returns that have been \nmade during this period of time. Many people have received their $600 \nor $300. I heard a great deal about that. I heard a great deal of \npraise and support for tax relief, having an opportunity to receive \nthose dollars that were deemed to be surplus. They were not dollars \nthat belonged to Washington; they were dollars that belonged to the \ntaxpayers.\n  I heard that quite often. Frankly, I was very pleased to hear that \nand also to share the belief that the return of tax dollars certainly \nis appropriate in a time of a slowing-down economy.\n  We also hear a great deal about budgets. Most people do understand \nthat, depending on your point of view about the size of government and \nthe involvement of government, sticking to budgets is a very important \nissue. Of course, it is very significant now as we enter into this last \nmonth. We are supposed to pass all the appropriations bills and come up \nwith next year's spending outline during these next several weeks. That \nis a relatively short time to do that.\n  The majority of people I spoke with said: You passed a budget; stay \nwith the budget and a 4 percent increase, which is a reasonable \nincrease; stay with it. Of course, that is not what we have done over \nthe last number of years. I think that shows a good deal of knowledge \nabout what is happening.\n  In Wyoming, where we are involved in the production of energy, \nwhether it be gas or oil or coal, there is a great deal of interest in \nenergy policy. That is something we have not had for a very long time. \nThe President set one forth and, as a matter of fact, the House has \npassed an energy bill. We have not. It is one of the issues that ought \nto be a priority. The folks at home indicated to me it ought to be a \npriority.\n  When we first started talking about energy 6 or 8 months ago, \nCalifornia was undergoing an energy shortage. It certainly seemed that \nit was a crisis. Then we got over that a little bit; some of the gas \nprices began to go down some, although they are coming back up again \nnow, but the problem still remains. We have not resolved the energy \nproblem at all. I hope that will be a high priority for us during these \nclosing weeks. Some of us had hoped it would have been a priority \nbefore now, but it has not been. Now I think it is clear it needs to \nbe.\n  One of the other things I heard a great deal about, which I suppose \nis a little different in a State such as Wyoming where 50 percent of \nthe State belongs to the Federal Government, is that this \nadministration has indicated and is beginning to demonstrate that they \nare willing and anxious to have more local input into the decisions \nthat affect public land and affect the people who live by and depend on \npublic land. That is not saying it is going to protect the environment. \nIt says that each area, each park, and each forest is unique, and to \ntry to set nationwide standards from Washington, as has been done in \nthe recent past, is not a workable situation. Our folks are very \npleased about that.\n  Finally, I will take a moment to say, as someone who feels some \nresponsibility, that I like the idea that we are paying down the debt. \nThat is good.\n  We have a number of things to do. Certainly this whole business of \nappropriations needs to be done.\n  I have already mentioned energy.\n  I hope we are able to work some more on simplifying and making \nMedicare a little more workable and putting pharmaceuticals into it. We \nare working on that, of course, in the Finance Committee, and we will \ncontinue to do so. There are dollars in the budget to do those things.\n  Education: We need to complete our work on education, of course. \nSometimes it seems the only solution to education is the dollars. \nDollars are necessary, but dollars alone do not work. We need to have \nsome accountability. We need to have some local control.\n  In any event, I think we have some real challenges before us and an \nopportunity to accomplish them. Frankly, I am a little discouraged \nabout what I read and hear--that we are entering into a time when many \npeople, particularly I think on the other side of the aisle, are more \ninterested in developing issues for their upcoming campaigns than they \nare in solving the problems. I hope that is not the case. We are trying \nto, of course, work towards midterm, which becomes very political, a \nlittle more than a year from now. Politicking is fine, issues are fine, \nbut when a political issue becomes more important than resolving the \nproblem before us, I think that is a mistake. I think we are going to \nsee some of that.\n  Certainly, there are different views about how we go forward. There \nis no question about that. Some in this body, of course, want more \ngovernment. Some want more spending. Some are very sorry about tax \nrelief because it may reduce the spending.\n  I have to tell you that I think we really ought to stay within the \nbudget we passed, which is about a 4-percent increase. I hope we don't \ngo back to last year's history and increase it by 14 or 15 percent. I \nthink that is a mistake. Certainly, things are a little different now \nwhen we are faced with this slowing of the economy.\n  Speaking of the political issue, back in April, for example, there \nwas a lot of talk about tax relief. There was a Democrat amendment to \nincrease the amount of tax relief to $85 billion. It was defeated by 94 \nto 6. In July there was another Democrat amendment that would repeal \nthe immediate tax rebate. It failed 91 to 3.\n  The idea that there is now an effort to move some responsibility to \nthe White House for added tax reduction and so on is just not the case. \nIt is just a political kind of issue. We hear all kinds of political \nviews in the Senate, and various Senators on the other side of the \naisle have said it should have been larger and kicked in sooner. Some \nare using radio programs to say to their constituents that this was a \ngreat thing to do. Indeed, it was.\n  We are going to have a lot of talk about the surplus, of course, and \nabout the differences between OMB and the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe fact is that both sets of figures show that this is the second \nlargest surplus in history. It is. The new numbers, of course, really \nsay that what is most important is that we do not have irresponsible \nspending. If we can follow the budget we passed and say that is what we \nwant to do, then we will be in good shape.\n  The President's budget protects Social Security and Medicare. \nBesides, the surplus, frankly, has no impact on those trust funds. The \nPresident's priorities are to protect Social Security and Medicare. We \nare going to improve Medicare to help seniors. We are going to work on \nthat.\n  We are paying down a good deal of publicly held debt. Sometimes we \nhave to review what happens to a surplus. If we use it to pay down \npublicly held debt, then debts are created for the various programs \nunder the trust funds. That is the way it works. It is the only place \nto put the money to have a return on the money that is there and \nmeeting the needs that are set forth.\n  I hope we can hold the political rhetoric to a minimum and deal with \nthe real issues and the fact that we have the second largest surplus in \nhistory. Besides, the budget surplus really has no impact on the trust \nfunds. It has been that way over the years. We have to pay down a \nhistoric amount of publicly held debt and work to foster economic \ngrowth. That is one of the ways to do that.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n  I see my friend from Iowa is here.\n  I urge setting those issues before us and moving to resolve them in a \nfashion that is best for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9013-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to expand a little bit on the \nquestion of energy policy. As I mentioned before, there certainly have \nbeen some changes in the California situation. There have been some \nchanges throughout the country in gas prices and other kinds of energy \nprices. They are not significant changes and, indeed, now we see them \nmoving back again.\n  The point we do not want to overlook is that when we had what we \ncalled an energy crisis 6 or 8 months ago, we had a problem; and the \nproblem basically, of course, was that demand was growing but supply \nwas not. We had a problem in terms of the amount of refining capacity \nin this country. It had not grown for a very long time. The same was \ntrue with electric generation.\n  We overcame that problem largely, I suppose, because, among other \nthings, winter was over and some of the refineries that had to make \nfuel oil for New England had changed their production. But the fact is, \nthe problem is still there. We do need an energy policy.\n  I urge that we do move forward. The President has put forth a \npolicy--and much of it is incorporated in what has passed in the \nHouse--that I think makes a lot of sense. It includes conservation, \nhaving some opportunities for conservation in the usage of energy. \nThere are many things we could do in that area. We can do it as \nindividuals and we can do it as governments and still continue to be \nproductive. Conservation should be part of our energy plan. There are \nmany groups that believe conservation is very important.\n\n  One of the other areas of energy policy has to do with renewable \nenergy. We have renewables that are growing. We have wind energy, \nhydroenergy, and other kinds of energy that I suppose have potential \nfor the future. Outside of hydro, renewables now represent about 1 \npercent of our total energy usage, but, nevertheless, we ought to be \ndoing something in that area. To do that, of course, we need research \nand research dollars.\n  Our committee has already dealt with research, but there needs to be \na considerable amount of research in the whole area of conservation, of \nrenewables, of how to have more efficient production with less impact \non the environment. So that is a very real part of energy research.\n  Then, of course, the real key is production. We have allowed \nourselves in the energy production field to become dependent on OPEC. \nNearly 60 percent of our energy resources now come from overseas. When \nthey change their views, or when things happen over in those countries, \nit impacts our economy and our society.\n  We need to have an opportunity to increase production and to do it \nwith diversity so we can use various kinds of energy, which includes \ncoal. Part of the research is to make coal even more clean in terms of \nthe air. We need to have diversity in terms of using gas, coal, \nnuclear, oil, and renewables so we do not find ourselves becoming \ndependent on one source.\n  Unfortunately, the plans that were sort of underway for having \nadditional generating plants almost all had to do with natural gas. \nNatural gas is a good source of energy, but our largest energy resource \nis coal. If we can continue to make coal even more clean, why, \ncertainly that is a source of energy that ought to be used for \ngeneration.\n  Also, we have not built generation plants for a very long time. Part \nof the reason for that is because of the uncertainty of some \nreregulation and ideas that are out there. In the past, when utilities \nserved a particular area, they produced and generated the electricity. \nThat was a pretty simple arrangement. Now we find more people looking \nat generation as a marketable commodity. It does not have to be tied to \nany particular area. But what is the secret to making that work? More \ntransportation. More transmission.\n  If you cannot move energy from the place it is developed and \nmanufactured to where the markets are, of course, then that is part of \nthe problem. The main source in the West for coal and gas has been the \nMountain States area: Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and New Mexico. But \nin order to get it to the market, you have to have transmission \ncapacity, particularly if you have mine mouth which is very efficient. \nSo these are issues that need to be dealt with in terms of an energy \npolicy.\n  One of the issues in terms of transmission capacity is to have a \nnationwide grid so electric power can be moved across the country and \ncan be moved into the RTOs, the regional transmission organizations, \nand become an efficient transmitter of energy. We can, in fact, do \nthat.\n  I believe there needs to be an emphasis on this energy question \nbetween now and the time we adjourn so we can get into the field and \nbegin to make some difference in terms of where our energy sources are \ncoming from so we can continue to have reasonably priced energy in \norder to fuel an economy that we would like to have, which obviously is \nnecessary in order to do that.\n  So I am hopeful that as we set our priorities for where we go we will \ninclude that in the very near future. We have talked about it a great \ndeal. I think actually in a lot of ways there isn't a lot of \ncontroversy. There has been controversy, of course, in relation to \nhaving access to public lands and the idea of protecting the \nenvironment which has to go with energy development.\n  Some have used ANWR up in the north region as a poster child for not \ngetting into public lands. The fact is, the House-passed provision is \n2,000 acres out of 19 million that would be accessible for a footprint. \nSo we are pretty close to some agreements on how we can set this \ncountry forward in terms of a source and an opportunity to have \naffordable energy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have another subject upon which I am going \nto speak. I do want to make a couple of comments on the statements made \nby my friend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  This last couple weeks has been somewhat troublesome to me because we \nhave all been spread around the country not able to respond to the \nPresident who, of course, has the ability to speak from any place in \nthe world. What has concerned me a great deal is the President and his \nDirector of Budget Mitch Daniels talking about this great surplus we \nhave, the second largest surplus in the history of the country. They \nfailed to mention the surplus is all Social Security surplus.\n  Of course, we have a surplus because Social Security is not something \nthat is funded as we go along. We forward fund Social Security. We have \nhuge amounts of money coming into the Social Security trust fund today \nthat we are not paying out. That is the way it was planned in 1983 when \nthere was a compromise reached by Tip O'Neill, Ronald Reagan, Claude \nPepper, and a few others. So people, including the President of the \nUnited States, who talk about this huge surplus are not being fair to \nthe American public.\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\n  We do not have a surplus. The surplus is a Social Security surplus. \nThe economy is in a tremendous downturn. This country's tax revenues \nare significantly lower than they have been in a long time. We have had \n8 years where we have brought down the debt.\n  In fact, the 1993 budget deficit reduction act, passed in the House \nwithout a single Republican vote, passed in the Senate without a single \nRepublican vote--Vice President Gore had to break the tie--put this \ncountry on a road to economic stability. We have 300,000 fewer Federal \njobs than we had in 1993. We have a surplus that we have never had \nbefore. And that is as a result of the efforts of President Clinton and \nhis Democratic colleagues in the House and the Senate.\n  We have experienced inflation lower than it has been in some 40-odd \nyears. We have done remarkably good things with the economy, created 24 \nmillion new jobs, in the 8 years it took us to do that. It has been 8 \nmonths that this administration has been in office, and they have taken \nthis away from us, in effect. Social Security surplus moneys were once \nused to mask the Federal deficit. We stopped doing that. But now the \nsecond Bush Presidency is using Social Security surpluses to again mask \nthis deficit.\n  I can't imagine how anyone can come on the floor and say with a \nstraight face that we have the second largest surplus in the history of \nthe country, unless they are candid and say that it is as a result of \nthe Social Security surplus. That is what it is all about. I hope my \nfriend from Illinois has an opportunity today; I know he has some \nthings to say about this.\n  But let's also talk about energy policy. One of the biggest robberies \nin the history of this country took place in Congress the last week \nthat the House was in session when they passed the energy bill. The \nreason I say it was a robbery is because people who voted for that bill \nthought that they had limited the drilling in ANWR to 2,000 acres. That \nis a big diversion from the truth.\n  The fact is, they now allow them to have 2,000 acres of oil derricks \nall over the Arctic national wilderness. That is what they would allow, \n2,000 acres of equipment. This could cover 150,000, 200,000 acres of \npristine wilderness.\n  There are some of us who believe so strongly about this drilling in \nthe Arctic national wilderness that we will do just about anything to \nstop it from happening. We are not going to let them drill in the \nArctic wilderness. We are not going to let them pull this phony \nsituation where they say we are only going to drill on 2,000 acres \nwhen, in fact, the legislation states that they are going to allow oil \nequipment on 2,000 acres.\n  We don't have a surplus. We are not going to allow drilling in ANWR.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9014-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9014-S9016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RED LIGHT CAMERAS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first got out of law school, I had a \npart-time job. I was a city attorney for the city of Henderson. \nHenderson at the time was a suburb of Las Vegas and a relatively small \ncommunity. Now, by Nevada standards, it is a large city, the second \nlargest city in Nevada, approaching about 250,000 people.\n  When I was city attorney, one of the things I did was prosecute \npeople convicted of misdemeanors, but one of the big jobs I had was \nprosecuting drunk drivers. Prosecuting drunk drivers was very difficult \nbecause a police officer would stop somebody and say: OK, put your \nfinger to your nose, walk on the line--all these things they had people \ndo who were suspected of drunk driving. They would come in and the \nperson charged would say: I hadn't had anything to drink; I don't know \nwhy I was arrested. And the police officer would say: His eyes were \nbloodshot; I could smell liquor on his breath. It was a factual issue \nas to whether or not that person had been drinking.\n  After I was city attorney, along came some new procedures. You could \nbreathe into a piece of equipment and it would determine how much \nalcohol was in your system or an even more sure-fire way was blood \nalcohol tests. That way the driver was protected. The driver was \nprotected because the driver no longer had to depend on some police \nofficer who may have been mad at him, may have had some personal grudge \nwith him, may have not liked the kind of car he was driving or the \ncolor of his skin. Now this person driving could have a blood test \nadministered and show that he was not drinking or they could breathe \ninto a balloon and a breathometer would tell whether or not he had \nanything to drink--scientific advancements to protect not only the \naccused but also to protect the State.\n  When I decided to run for Congress at the beginning of the 1980s, one \nof the people who I recognized was doing some really good things for \nmany years was a Congressman from New York by the name of James \nScheuer. What had Congressman Scheuer done that attracted my attention? \nHe gave speeches around the country and in Congress on the need for \npolice officers to have more scientific equipment to keep up with the \nmore scientific criminals. I thought this was intriguing. I thought it \nwas true. Having been a prosecutor and having been a defense attorney, \nI recognized that was true.\n  I was able as a defense attorney to do a lot of things to really \nhinder the process. That was part of my job. And because we were more \nin tune with modern scientific things we could hold up warrants and all \nkinds of things. But we have gotten more modern. We have electronic \nwarrants that are now available. We have video arraignments for people \ncharged with crimes. We have SWAT teams, special weapons people who \ncome in and in a special situation can really go into a building, which \nis safer for the people in the neighborhood. These people are experts \nat getting into buildings. They are experts at negotiating with people.\n  As I speak, there is a situation going on since the weekend. In \nMichigan, one person has been killed. There is another person \nnegotiating in this compound. These are experts that are doing the \nnegotiating. In effect, we have become more modern. We are doing a \nbetter job of law enforcement. We are doing a better job keeping up \nwith the criminal element. That is why I want to bring to the Senate's \nattention the promise of something I think is in keeping with what I \nbelieve is the direction law enforcement should go. That is photo \nenforcement of traffic laws.\n\n  Each year there are about 2,000 deaths and probably about 250,000 \ninjuries in crashes involving motorists who ignore red lights. More \nthan half of these deaths are pedestrians or passengers in other \nvehicles who are hit by these people who run the red lights. Between \n1992 and 1998, about 1.5 million people were injured in these \naccidents. It is easy for us to talk about injuries as compared to \ndeaths; maybe they had a broken arm, maybe a whiplash. But lots of \nthese people are confined to wheelchairs. Lots of these people are \ninjured irreparably. They have been hurt so bad their life is never \ngoing to be the same, as a result of people trying to save the second \nor two running a red light.\n  We have all witnessed it. Probably, we have truthfully all run a red \nlight or two. The signal changes to yellow and vehicles continue to \npass through the intersection with little hesitation. The light turns \nred and one or two more cars blow past in a hurry, speeding through \nintersections until the last possible second. Unfortunately, experience \nhas taught us that we can get away with it.\n  For example, there are about a thousand intersections with traffic \nsignals in the greater Las Vegas area. Odds are very good that the \npolice won't be watching when we drive through an intersection a little \ntoo late. Nevadans have paid a high price for this daredevil driving. \nLas Vegas ranks 12th in the Nation in deaths attributed to motorists \nrunning red lights.\n  I can't help but think that Las Vegas streets, as well as streets \nnationwide, would be a lot safer if there were consequences for running \nred lights. What if there were a traffic officer at every intersection, \nall 1,000 intersections where there are red lights in Las Vegas? Let's \nsay there was a traffic officer, or at least that were a possibility. \nThe District of Columbia found out that they can do that. In 1999--and \nI have spoken to the chief as late as this morning--the District began \nusing cameras to catch motorists running red lights. Thirty other \ndistricts in the country have similar laws.\n  For those unfamiliar with photo enforcement, most use cameras after \nthe light has turned red. A photo of the infraction or violation is \ntaken and later\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\nmailed to the red light runner or the address that corresponds to the \nlicense plate.\n  With the stepped up enforcement, motorists in the District of \nColumbia running red lights may have saved a minute or two, but they \nhave not been getting away with it. Since the District began using \ncameras, the number of motorists running red lights--I talked to the \nchief this morning--is down 57 percent from 1999, when they were \ninstalled. They don't have them at all intersections, but drivers think \nthey might. So people running red lights has dropped almost 60 percent.\n  Think of the people who are not in wheelchairs. Think of the people \nwho have not had to go to the hospital. Think of the lives saved as a \nresult. In a report released in April of this year, the Insurance \nInstitute for Highway Safety state that camera enforcement has changed \ndrivers' behavior and may have prevented collisions and injury in car \naccidents. That is a no-brainer. The number of crashes at intersections \nwith traffic signals has dropped. Front-end and side injury collisions, \nmost commonly associated with red light running, fell as well.\n  Most surprising is that drivers' behavior changed throughout the \ncity, and not just at intersections with cameras. Even though only 39 \nof the District of Columbia's signals were equipped with cameras--the \nred lights--traffic violations have dropped at all city intersections. \nEnforcement is changing the way the residents drive. They are better \noff for it. We all are.\n  Nationwide, there have been significantly fewer front-end and side \ncollisions following the introduction of camera enforcement. Nine \nStates have either granted use of cameras statewide or are allowing \nthem. The data makes a compelling case for widespread cameras. Photo \nenforcement of traffic laws helps catch and identify lawbreakers and \nserves as a deterrent for reckless drivers.\n  The sad truth is that most drivers obey traffic laws not because they \nwill prevent crashes or save lives--although that is what some say--but \nbecause they believe there is a real chance they might be caught and \nfined. That is why everybody slows down when a police car is nearby. \nWhen enforcement is present, accidents fall.\n  I am sorry to report that in its 1999 session the Nevada Legislature \npassed a bill banning the use of cameras to enforce traffic laws, \nciting concern over government intrusion.\n  On this date, I am writing a letter to the State of Nevada, along \nwith the majority leader of the Senate, telling them to reconsider \nthat. I hope they do. I think it is wrong. I think the legislators in \nNevada and all around the country should take a second look at the \npromise this technology holds, if for no other reason than the \npowerless lobbying organization that believes strongly in this.\n  What is this lobbying organization that has very little power? It is \ncalled the American Trauma Society. I am sure the Presiding Officer has \nmet with them. I have gone to their facilities and seen the people who \nhave had these terrible head injuries. Most are traffic related; many \nare people having run red lights.\n  On this issue, the American Trauma Society, composed of emergency \nroom personnel, would like to have fewer customers, and they point to \nstudies that cameras reduce violations by 40 percent.\n  The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes a lot of things, \ndropped its opposition to red light cameras because they recognize \nthere is a limit even to what they can go to. They believe this is \nsomething that helps keep highways safe. With a million crashes at \nintersections each year, causing 250,000 injuries and 2,000 deaths, the \ncarnage is very bad.\n  Why do I raise this issue? Because changing driver behavior in a \nmeaningful way will save lives. Studies show that more than 90 percent \nof Americans believe red light running is dangerous. The vast majority \nof citizens and law enforcement officials support the use of photo \nenforcement to stop red light running. Some may not agree. They say \nthis is ``big brother.''\n  Going back to when I was city attorney, we needed modern law \nenforcement methods to keep up with criminals and also those accused. \nIt doesn't matter whether it is cop or a camera; it is getting caught \nthat counts. There are consequences for breaking traffic laws. Ensuring \nthe safety and well-being of America's families and neighborhoods \nshould be one of our top priorities. Photo enforcement supports this \npriority in a way that is constitutionally effective and proven free of \nbias.\n  I want those 30 jurisdictions, including the chief in the District of \nColumbia, to know I am going to do what I can to support his position \nand not go off on some side issue or side street issue saying this is \n``big brother'' or that Orwellians are coming after us.\n  There is a lot of agreement in the country, not the least of which \nwas a very fine editorial in the U.S. News and World Report of \nSeptember 3 of this year written by Randall E. Stoss, ``Choose Life \nOver Liberty.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Sept. 3, 2001]\n\n                        Choose Life Over Liberty\n\n\n                Red-light cameras in dick Armey's sights\n\n                         (By Randall E. Stross)\n\n       In police work, machines have increasingly supplanted the \n     vagaries of human judgment, and I say, Amen! Beginning in the \n     1930s with the pioneering Drunkometer, followed by the \n     Intoximeter, Alcometer, and the Breathalyzer, impartial \n     mechanical devices have indirectly saved countless lives.\n       Today, another kind of gadget records objectively and \n     averts future accidents: red-light cameras installed at \n     intersections to automatically record and ticket violators. \n     House Majority Leader Dick Armey is up in arms, however, \n     assailing the camera as an ``unthinking machine'' that has \n     usurped police officers in the performance of their \n     ``traditional duties.''\n       When Armey says that the answer to red-light violations is \n     ``putting cops on the beat,'' is that meant in the truly \n     traditional sense of walking the beat? Even if granted \n     dispensation to use unthinking machines with wheels--\n     automobiles--police officers giving physical chase to red-\n     light-running drivers must run the light, too. With 1 million \n     crashes at intersections each year, causing 250,000 injuries \n     and 2,000 deaths, the carnage is bad enough now.\n       As a former professor of economics, Armey surely is capable \n     of grasping the concept of productivity gains that follow \n     automation. When he gravely intones that ``police officers \n     belong on the streets and in the community, not in remote \n     control booths,'' he is demagoguing. The cameras are \n     activated automatically by sensors embedded in the road, \n     capturing in a single frame the car's license plate, presence \n     in the intersection, and the color of the traffic light. The \n     evidence is incontrovertible, wonderfully so if you'd like to \n     see the incidence of death and mayhem decline, and \n     maddeningly so if you believe that a traffic light's signal \n     is best left to you alone to interpret.\n       Video on demand. The newest generation of ``unthinking \n     machines'' that Armey detests are actually doing considerable \n     thinking on their own. Digital video systems use software to \n     tract the progress of approaching vehicles and predict \n     whether the driver will stop for the red light. If it appears \n     likely that the driver is going to motor through, the system \n     will extend the red light shown to the cross traffic, \n     removing the chance of a collision with a law-abiding driver \n     about to set off in harm's way.\n       EDS, which markets the system as CrossingGuard--admittedly, \n     not as catchy as Drunkometer--is considering offering police \n     departments the ability to post video clips on the Web. The \n     ticket that is mailed out would include a Web address and \n     password; the recipient could have a look and judge the \n     wisdom of contesting on epistemological grounds what can be \n     seen plainly in beautiful, living color.\n       What if the culprit was a friend to whom you loaned the \n     car? The systems can be set up to capture the faces of \n     drivers as well as license plates; the degree of intrusion is \n     determined by requirements of varying state laws. What makes \n     the most sense is the approach taken by New York: ``Owner \n     liability'' allows the state to treat red-light running like \n     a parking citation, which makes registered owners responsible \n     regardless of who actually drives. The American Civil \n     Liberties Union dropped its opposition to the red-light \n     cameras with the proviso that the cameras be trained only on \n     the license plates.\n       Armey's opposition to the cameras places him somewhere off \n     to the left of the ACLU. He is also taking on a small 2,700-\n     member group that may not have a lot of political weight in \n     Armey's Washington, but nevertheless carries a lot of \n     credibility on this issue: the American Trauma Society, \n     composed of emergency-room personnel. They would like to have \n     fewer ``customers,'' and point to studies that show cameras \n     reduce violations by 40 percent.\n       The data collected by the cameras might be used for \n     purposes other than tracking reckless drivers--``mission \n     creep,'' in the ACLU's phrasing--and this is a legitimate\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n     concern. But a distinction is easily drawn: Using cameras \n     activated only when a traffic law is broken--good; deploying \n     police cameras in public spaces in order to scan in the faces \n     of unsuspecting passersby--bad.\n       Armey would have us believe that the police departments \n     that use red-light cameras are not interested in reducing \n     accidents but in maximizing traffic-ticket revenue. His \n     evidence, however, consists of nothing more than listing the \n     number of tickets issued by various departments and the sums \n     collected. New York City, for example, sent out 400,000 \n     tickets to red-light runners last year, a truly astounding \n     number. Contrarily, the same facts can be read as powerful \n     evidence of the magnitude of the problem.\n       In Armey's home state, the legislature has twice rejected \n     proposals to use red-light cameras statewide. But Garland, \n     Texas, is about to go ahead with cameras anyhow. That the \n     House majority leader, an outspoken opponent of government \n     interventionism, is attempting to interfere in a local safety \n     program strikes Garland's city's attorney as ironic.\n       Armey believes the so-called crisis is solved simply by \n     lengthening yellow-light signals. His reasoning is more \n     Orwellian than the cameras. War is peace, and now red is to \n     be yellow.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9016-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9016-S9017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRESS FACES CHALLENGING TIMES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Congress will now reconvene following \nthe August recess. We face some challenging and difficult times, \nespecially dealing with fiscal policy.\n  I noted this weekend on some of the news shows that Bush \nadministration spokesperson, Mitch Daniels, who heads the Office of \nManagement and Budget, made the following observations about our fiscal \nsituation. He said, ``We have the second largest surplus in U.S. \nhistory. We are awash in cash.'' He used the term ``awash in money.'' \nAnd then he seemed to say: Well, there is not a problem here because we \nhave this very large surplus.\n  I think it is interesting to note that the economy in this country is \nweak. It has softened substantially. That which was expected to have \nbeen in surplus just months ago has now evaporated. The Office of \nManagement and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office both \nacknowledge that the surplus is largely gone. When Mitch Daniels uses \nthe term ``surplus'' and says we are ``awash'' in money and we have the \nsecond biggest surplus in history, what is he talking about? He is \ntalking about the Social Security trust fund. He is doing it pretty \nmuch the same way that Charles Krauthammer, a columnist for the \nWashington Post, has done it. He wrote ``no lock, no box,'' talking \nabout a lockbox for Social Security trust funds. Robert Novak, a \ncolumnist for the Sun Times, wrote a column that says, ``Don't believe \nthe Dem scare tactics.'' In effect, Mr. Novak said all of this notion \nabout a Social Security trust fund issue is bogus.\n  George Will weighed in with essentially the same message. What are \nthey talking about? Mr. Novak says that Senator Conrad, my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, and I are effectively deceiving people about this.\n  Let's look at this for a moment. Workers in this country, when they \nget their paycheck, discovers something is taken out of that, which is \ncalled Social Security taxes. They are told it is going to go into a \ntrust fund. This money taken out for Social Security isn't taken out \nfor the purpose of paying for the Defense Department, or paying for air \ntraffic controllers, or paying for a farm program, or paying for food \ninspection; it is taken out of the paycheck and the worker is told this \ngoes into a Social Security trust fund. The word ``trust'' is used in \nthe trust fund because it is a trust fund in the classic sense. That \ntrust fund invests its money in Government securities.\n  The trust fund exists; it is real. If Mr. Novak, for example, \npurchases a U.S. Government savings bond for his grandson next \nChristmas, I hope he will not tell his grandson what he is telling \nreaders, that somehow the savings bond he purchased has no value, that \nthere is nothing there and the security is meaningless. I hope he will \nnot tell his grandson that. We ought not tell the American workers \nthat, either.\n\n  When Mr. Mitch Daniels, the head of OMB, says we have the second \nlargest surplus in history, what he is saying is, by the way, we have \nthese surplus funds in the Social Security trust fund and we view them \nas surplus. The moderator on ``Meet the Press'' said, well, but these \nare trust funds, are they not? Are they not dedicated to Social \nSecurity? Mr. Daniels said, well, yes, but they are not really \ndedicated to Social Security.\n  Well, that is new. The message ought to be, keep your hands off these \ntrust funds, to everybody: The administration, the Congress, keep your \nhands off these trust funds. They do not belong to you.\n  It is not the Government's money. It is money that came out of \nworkers' paychecks to be put in a trust fund for their future. And we \nwill need that when the baby boomers retire and put a maximum strain on \nthe Social Security system. That is precisely why we are accruing \nsurpluses at this point. It is not for the purpose of Mr. Daniels or \nothers to say that we have this huge surplus of funds and look at the \ngreat shape we are in. If a business said, by the way, we made a huge \nprofit last year but only if you consider the pension funds of our \nemployees, people would say, are you crazy? You cannot consider pension \nfunds as part of your profit, and yet that is exactly what some people \nare trying to tell us.\n  Will Rogers once said: When there is no place left to spit, you \neither have to swallow your tobacco juice or change with the times. \nWell, there is no place left, and we have to change.\n  Four months ago we were told there was going to be a surplus of $125 \nbillion above the Social Security accounts. That is all gone. It has \nevaporated. It does not exist anymore. The question for the President \nand Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, is how do you reconcile \nall of these interests and needs with the current situation?\n  The President wants $18 billion additional spending for defense. The \nsurplus that would be used to pay for that does not exist at this \npoint. It seems to me the President is going to have to come to \nCongress, Mr. Daniels, Mr. Rumsfeld, and others, and say here is the \nplan by which we are going to pay for that. That plan ought not include \nusing the Social Security trust fund.\n  I say to my conservative friends who write these columns that you do \na real disservice, in my judgment, to the facts when you suggest that \nthat which we take out of workers' paychecks to be put in a trust fund \ndoes not really exist in the trust fund. That is not true. The fact is, \nit forces national savings if we have a fiscal policy that recognizes \nthese trust funds for the purpose they were collected in the first \ninstance.\n  Now we have a lot of people who are poised to get their mitts into \nthat trust fund and use it for other purposes. I hope the \nadministration and the Congress will hold firm and say, keep your hands \noff those trust funds. They do not belong to the Government. They \nbelong to the American people. They are the ones who paid those taxes, \nand they were the ones who were told it was going to be put in a trust \nfund. The word ``trust'' ought to mean something.\n  I will comment on another issue. This weekend I was enormously \ndismayed to see press reports in the New York Times and the Washington \nPost on the subject of national missile defense and the potential \nbuildup of offensive nuclear weapons in China. The New York Times \nheadline said: The U.S. will drop objections to China's missile \nbuildup: strategy meant to ease Beijing's concern about plans for a \nweapons shield.\n\n  According to the reports, the U.S. will tell China that it will not \nobject to a missile buildup by that country. It says, ``The Bush \nadministration seeking to overcome Chinese opposition to its missile \ndefense program intends to tell leaders in Beijing it has no objections \nto the country's plans to build up its small fleet of nuclear \nmissiles.'' It also says, ``One senior official said that in the future \nthe United States and China might also discuss resuming underground \nnuclear tests.''\n  Let me ask a question: Does anyone think this will be a safer and \nmore secure world if we say it does not matter whether China builds \nmore offensive nuclear weapons? Does anyone believe it enhances world \nsecurity and makes this a safer place in which to live if we give a \ngreen light to China and tell that country that it does not matter to \nus, you just go ahead and build up a huge nuclear arsenal? It defies \nall common sense. We ought to be the world\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nleader in trying to convince countries not to build up their nuclear \narsenals, to reduce rather than increase their nuclear arsenals. We \nought to be the world's leader in saying not only stop nuclear testing, \nwhich we did a long while ago, but to have everyone, including this \ncountry, subscribe to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Regrettably, this Senate turned down that treaty almost two years \nago. However, this country still needs to be a leader to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons. We need to be a leader in a way that helps \npersuade other countries not to build an offensive nuclear threat. Some \npeople, including myself, think that is just daft for our country to \nsay we would like to spend tens and tens of billions of dollars--some \nsay the current proposal would be about $60 billion, other people say \nit would be well over $100 billion--to build a national missile defense \nsystem and in order to do so we will say to China, by the way, you go \nright ahead and build up your offensive nuclear capabilities.\n  What on Earth could we be thinking of? We need to push in the \nopposite direction. We need to say to China and Russia and others, \nwhich are part of the nuclear club in this world, that we want to build \ndown, not up. We do not want to see an increase in offensive nuclear \nweapons.\n  This is exactly what many of us have feared, by the way. The \ndiscussion about abandoning the ABM Treaty, which has been the center \npole of the tent for arms control and arms reductions, the abandonment \nof that which is being proposed by the White House and some of their \nfriends in Congress, is a substantial retreat from this country's \nresponsibility to be a leader in trying to stop and reduce the threat \nof nuclear war.\n  Is it really going to provide more security and more safety for this \nworld if the administration says we do not care about an ABM Treaty, we \nwill just abandon it and not care about the consequences. Or if the \nadministration says we do not care if our building a national missile \ndefense system of some type if it leads Russia to stop cutting its \nnuclear forces and if it leads China to have an offensive nuclear \nweapons buildup. Does it matter to us? It sure does.\n  Since the dismantlement of the Soviet Union well over a decade ago \nnow, there have been really just two major nuclear superpowers. There \nwere two nuclear superpowers involved in the cold war, us and the \nSoviets. Now we alone and the country of Russia have very substantial \nnuclear capability. It is estimated there are over 30,000 nuclear \nweapons in the arsenal of both countries, 30,000 nuclear weapons. We \nneed to be reducing the threat of nuclear war. We need to be building \ndown and reducing the stockpile of nuclear weapons. We ought not as a \ncountry be saying it does not matter much to us whether China builds up \nits offensive nuclear weapon capability. It sure ought to matter to us. \nIt will be a significant part of our future if we allow that to happen.\n\n  I hope we can have an aggressive discussion on this subject in the \ncoming month or so. This country ought to care very much about whether \nthe country of China is going to increase and build up its offensive \nnuclear capability. This country ought to care a great deal about that, \nand this country's policy ought not be giving a green light to other \ncountries to say we do not mind. We should not be saying: You let us \nbuild a national missile defense, and we will just say you go right \nahead and increase your stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Mr. President, most of us are returning today for the \nfirst time since the August recess. It was a period of time when we had \na chance to spend a little vacation time with our families, and I was \nhappy to be part of that process and to be reunited with my extended \nfamily and have a great time. It was also a time to be back in our \nStates to travel around, to listen and to hear what is on the minds of \nthe people we represent, and for a few of us a chance to perhaps take a \nfew days to go overseas and to be part of the global dialog which comes \nwith this job as much as our dialog with the people we represent.\n  In these past 4 weeks, we have been busy and most of us have enjoyed \nit, but now we are back to work. We come back to work with additional \ninformation and more views on the issues that we are about to debate. \nWhat a difference a month has made. Many of us did not believe in this \nshort period of time there could be such a turn of fortune as we have \nseen occur with the recent report on the status of surpluses in our \nFederal budget.\n  It was not that long ago we were deep in red ink in Washington with \ndeficits in every direction. We saw ourselves building up a national \ndebt to $5.7 trillion, a national mortgage which we still shoulder, a \nburden which we carry, and our children and grandchildren are likely to \ncarry as well.\n  The good news, of course, starting in 1993 we began to turn the \ncorner on that debt with an expanding positive economy, with the \ncreation of jobs and new businesses, profits to build up retirement \naccounts. People were making more money and paying taxes, providing \nmore revenue to the Government. We found ourselves in a surplus \nsituation. We were exalting after so many years and years of deficits \nunder President Reagan, President George Bush, and then for the first \nfew years the Clinton administration. We finally came out of that dark \nveil and now we are in a position to enjoy the surplus.\n  The President who was elected last November, President George Bush, \nsaid the surpluses give an opportunity to enact a massive tax cut, one \nof the largest tax cuts in our history. Many members of his party, as \nwell as a few on this side of the aisle, joined with the President to \nenact this tax cut, believing that the surpluses were virtually as far \nas the eye could see. Why not take this extra money in Washington and \ngive it back to the people of the United States? The logic was simple. \nIt seemed so clear.\n  Some Members believed that caution was the guide to which we should \nturn. Instead of spending a possible surplus, we should wait to see if \nthe American economy would recover strongly, and how quickly, and \nwhether it would generate a surplus, and before we committed the \npossible future surplus, we ought to take care, lest we find ourselves \nin a deficit situation.\n  We return in the first few days of September of the year 2001 to find \nPresident Bush's tax cut, in addition to the state of the American \neconomy, has cost the projected surplus which the President said we \nwould have. We find ourselves knocking on the door, without that \nsurplus, going back into, if not a deficit, the situation where we have \nto go to trust funds in order to pay for the ordinary expenses of \nGovernment. Which trust funds? The largest--Medicare and Social \nSecurity. In a short period of time--just a few months--with this new \nPresident we have gone from the euphoria of surpluses to now worrying \nover whether or not we are going to endanger the Social Security trust \nfund. It tells you we have come very far very fast.\n  The tax rebates that many people have received in the last few weeks \nof $300 and $600 are welcome to many families who need to buy supplies \nfor kids to go back to school this week, or clothing, or to pay off \nsome of the debts they might have. It does not appear at this moment it \nwill show any\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\ngreat impact on the economy. A general tax cut that helps lower and \nmiddle-income families is one I have supported. I believe, as many do, \nthat we should be very careful in how much of this projected surplus we \ndedicate to that tax cut until we are certain we have it in hand.\n  During the campaign, President Bush and many Members of Congress said \nthat when we reached the tough times in the future, one area would be \nsacred: We would not reach into the Social Security trust fund to fund \nthe ordinary expenses of Government. President Bush, much like his \nfather, who said, ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' pronounced during the \ncourse of his campaign that as President he would not raid the Social \nSecurity nor the Medicare trust fund. Now we find ourselves perilously \nclose to that situation after just a few months into the new \nPresidency.\n\n  Many of the conservative Republican writers are saying: Why are you \nworried about a Social Security trust fund? It is not that important. I \nthink we know better. Those who notice every time we receive a paycheck \nthere is more and more money taken out for Social Security have asked \nsome hard questions. What is this all about? It is to shore up a \nsurplus in Social Security to protect the future, the need for Social \nSecurity benefits for baby boomers and others. If we reach into that \nSocial Security trust fund to take that money out now, it could \nendanger the liquidity and solvency of Social Security in years to \ncome. That is irresponsible. It is wrong. We shouldn't be in this \npredicament.\n  Many of the conservative writers who say not to worry about \nprotecting the Social Security trust fund do not have much passion for \nSocial Security anyway. These are people who have criticized it in \nyears gone by as a big government scheme taking too much money, one \nthat we ought to change so people could invest in the stock market \nwithout much concern about the impact on those who are relying on it. \nSome 40 million Americans rely on Social Security. It is a major source \nof income for many. We should not take it lightly.\n  We are faced with a predicament as we return: How will we meet the \nobligations of Government and the requirements for new spending and do \nit without raiding Social Security and the Medicare trust fund? The \nPresident has said through his spokesman, Mitch Daniels of the Office \nof Management and Budget, that we have the second largest surplus in \nthe history of the United States. He said this publicly, and they have \nsaid it many times. It is part of the George W. Bush administration's \n``don't worry, be happy'' refrain.\n  I think Americans ought to think twice. The second largest surplus in \nour history is the Social Security trust fund surplus. It is money \ndedicated to Social Security. It is not the general revenue of this \ncountry to be spent on everything that we might like. It should be \nprotected. The Republicans come back and say: Wait a minute. In the \ndeep dark days of the deficits, even Democratic Congresses spent the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  They are correct. And I can say we did some very desperate things in \nthose years when we were seeing multibillion-dollar deficits, things we \nvowed we would never do again when we got into the era of the surplus. \nWe came together on a bipartisan basis with over 400 votes in the \nHouse, a substantial majority in the Senate, and vowed we would never \ntouch the Social Security trust fund once we had surpluses again.\n  Here we are, just a few months into the new administration, facing \nthat kind of pressure. How do we take care of our national needs, \nwhether it is the Department of Defense saying they need more modern \nweaponry to protect the United States or whether it is the needs of \npublic education? The President said he would be an education \nPresident; he would find a bipartisan way to deal with it. And now we \nhave a bill languishing in the conference committee because we have not \ncome up with the funds to pay for education.\n  If you believe, as I do, that education is critical to the future of \nthis country, we certainly should invest in it. But President Bush's \ndecisions on tax cuts and other budget priorities have pushed us in a \ncorner where precious few funds are available for the high priorities.\n  The same is true on prescription drugs under Medicare. Most promised \nwe would work for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare--\nuniversal, voluntary--to help seniors pay for prescriptions, and now we \nfind because of the Bush budget and the Bush tax cut that we have very \nfew dollars available to even dedicate to a bipartisan national \npriority.\n\n  The same thing is true on energy policy. Just a few months ago, \nPresident Bush sent a message which said we ought to do something about \nour dependence on foreign energy sources, so let's invest more money in \nresearch to find alternative fuels, sustainable energy, ways to use \ncoal in States such as Illinois in an environmentally responsible way. \nThat takes money. We now turn to find that President Bush's budget and \nhis tax policy have taken those funds off the table.\n  The same thing is true when it comes to the new farm bill. We hoped \nto have a new farm bill this fall. I hope we can. I have seen in \nIllinois and across my State what has happened to the farm economy over \nthe last 4 or 5 years. If we are to have a new farm bill and dedicate \nresources to it, the obvious question is: Where will they come from?\n  When we look at the state of the economy in America today, people are \nrightfully concerned. The President went to speak to members of labor \nunions yesterday to tell them he felt their pain, their worry, and \ntheir anguish over the state of our economy. But what we need is real \nleadership from the President and from Congress on a bipartisan basis \nto come up with a roadmap and guidelines, so we can return to the era \nof economic growth and prosperity.\n  Over a period of 9 years, we saw a dramatic buildup in the American \neconomy: Over 200 million new jobs, new businesses, more home ownership \nthan any time in our history. Now, of course, we see this correction in \nour economy. We have lost a half-million jobs this year.\n  In closing, we have an opportunity in the weeks ahead to come \ntogether and concede the obvious. The Bush budget and the Bush tax \npolicy were things that, frankly, should have been put off until we \nwere certain of the surpluses we would have. Now we know those \nsurpluses do not exist.\n  It is time for us to come together on a bipartisan basis to rewrite \nthis budget to meet our Nation's priorities and protect the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of S. 149, \nthe Export Administration Act of 2001.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Johnson, and Senator Gramm, in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation was reported out of the Senate Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs Committee by a vote of 19-1. It was a bipartisan vote, \nobviously, of 19-1. The legislation has been very strongly endorsed by \nthe administration. That was in early April of this year. The Export \nAdministration Act provides for the President to control exports for \nreasons of national security and foreign policy.\n  Let me begin by saying I believe there is a very strong national \ninterest in reauthorizing the Export Administration Act. I think that \nis a view held by a clear majority of the Congress.\n  It is important to understand a bit about the historical situation as \nwe consider this legislation. Regrettably, the Export Administration \nAct has not been reauthorized since 1990, except for three temporary \nextensions in 1993, in 1994, and again last year. At the end of the \nlast Congress, we passed a temporary extension of the Export \nAdministration Act that expired on August 20 of this year, just a few \nweeks ago.\n  Prior to this most recent temporary extension and since the EAA \nexpired on August 20, the authority of the President to impose export \ncontrols has been exercised pursuant to the International Economic \nEmergency Powers\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\nAct, the so-called IEEPA. This is generally how we have been \nfunctioning throughout this decade with respect to export controls.\n  I believe strongly that Congress should put in place a permanent \nstatutory framework for the imposition of export controls. They should \nnot be imposed pursuant to an emergency economic authority of the \nPresident. It can be done that way. It has been done that way. That is \nthe currently existing situation. But I don't think that is the most \ndesirable way to proceed. It doesn't give you the most substantial \nstatutory framework, obviously. It doesn't introduce an element of \nstability and permanency into the arrangements. In fact, I believe \nstrongly that this legislation provides greater protection for national \nsecurity and foreign policy concerns than is provided under IEEPA or \nprovided under the previous Export Administration Act.\n  Just one example: The penalties that can be imposed under IEEPA for \nviolation of export controls are significantly less than the penalties \nthat are provided for in the legislation that is before us. Let me \nrepeat that.\n  Under the current arrangement in which the export control regime has \nbeen put in place by the President's invoking of his economic emergency \npowers, the penalties for violation are substantially less than the \npenalties which we provide in this legislation. This legislation is a \ncarefully balanced effort to provide the President authority to control \nexports for reasons of national security and foreign policy while also \nresponding to the need of U.S. exporters to compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  I point out that effective competition by U.S. exporters in the \nglobal marketplace, which will strengthen their economic position--that \nis, the economic position of U.S. exporters--and thereby strengthen the \neconomic position of the United States in the global marketplace, also \nhas important national security and foreign policy implications for the \nUnited States. In the end, our national security and foreign policy \nstrength rests in part on our economic strength. I think we need to \nkeep that in mind as we consider this legislation.\n\n  In preparation for acting on this legislation, the Banking Committee \nthis year held two hearings with representatives of industry groups and \nformer Defense Department officials.\n  I might note that the committee held extensive hearings in the prior \nCongress with respect to this issue. So there has been a continual \nperiod now, over a number of years, of very careful examination of \nexport controls and how to address this matter. Extensive consultation \ntook place with representatives of the new administration, including \nthe Commerce Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, \nthe intelligence agencies, and the National Security Council.\n  Prior to the markup of the legislation in the Banking Committee \nearlier this year, Dr. Rice, the Assistant to the President for \nNational Security Affairs, sent a letter to the committee dated March \n21 of this year, which I quote:\n\n       The Administration has carefully reviewed the current \n     version of S. 149, the Export Administration Act of 2001, \n     which provides authority for controlling exports of dual-use \n     goods and technologies. As a result of its review, the \n     Administration has proposed a number of changes to S. 149. \n     The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of \n     Commerce, and I agree that these changes will strengthen the \n     President's national security and foreign policy authorities \n     to control dual-use exports in a balanced manner, which will \n     permit U.S. companies to compete more effectively in the \n     global market place. With these changes, S. 149 represents a \n     positive step towards the reform of the U.S. export control \n     system supported by the President. If the Committee \n     incorporates these changes into S. 149, the Administration \n     will support the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, a major effort was made to work through the list of \nproposals by the administration. That resulted in those proposals being \nincorporated into the bill during the Banking Committee's markup. As a \nconsequence, in effect we met the standard that the administration set \nfor us. They were incorporated in the markup.\n  The administration is supportive of this bill. It has expressed that \nsupport on more than one occasion. They have been in constant \ncommunication with us about this matter. We are obviously proceeding \nnot only in accordance with our own judgment, but it also represents \nthe judgment of the administration as well. In fact, in late March \nPresident Bush, in speaking to high-tech leaders in the White House, \nurged quick passage of the bill by the Senate. He reiterated that \nsupport in May in a speech he gave in Washington.\n  In April, the Office of Management and Budget submitted to the \nCongress a statement of administration policy on S. 149, which said in \npart:\n\n       The Administration supports S. 149, as reported by the \n     Senate Banking Committee. The bill provides authority for \n     controlling exports of dual-use goods and technologies. The \n     Administration believes that S. 149 would allow the United \n     States to successfully meet its national security and foreign \n     policy objectives without impairing the ability of U.S. \n     companies to compete effectively in the global marketplace.\n\n  As reported, S. 149 includes a number of changes that the \nadministration sought to strengthen the President's national security \nand foreign policy authorities to control dual-use exports.\n  Let me underscore: changes they sought to strengthen the President's \nnational security and foreign policy authorities to control dual-use \nexports.\n\n       The Administration will continue to work with Congress to \n     ensure that our national security needs are incorporated into \n     a rational export control system.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Statement of \nAdministration Policy submitted by the Office of Management and Budget \nwith respect to S. 149 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2001.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n               s. 149--export administration Act of 2001\n\n       The Administration supports S. 149, as reported by the \n     Senate Banking Committee. The bill provides authority for \n     controlling exports of dual-use goods and technologies. The \n     Administration believes that S. 149 would allow the United \n     States to successfully meet its national security and foreign \n     policy objectives without impairing the ability of U.S. \n     companies to compete effectively in the global marketplace. \n     As reported, S. 149 includes a number of changes that the \n     Administration sought to strengthen the President's national \n     security and foreign policy authorities to control duel-use \n     exports. The Administration will continue to work with \n     Congress to ensure that our national security needs are \n     incorporated into a rational export control system.\n     Pay-As-You-Go Scoring\n       S. 149 would affect receipts and direct spending; \n     therefore, it is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \n     requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) \n     of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring estimates is that the \n     PAYGO effect of this bill is minimal. Final scoring of this \n     legislation may deviate from this estimate.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I commend Senator Gramm, who was \nactually chairman of the committee at the time that we brought the \nlegislation forward. And I commend Senator Enzi and Senator Johnson. \nSenator Enzi and Senator Johnson, respectively, were the chairman and \nranking member of the Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance \nof the Banking Committee in the last Congress. They carried forward \ntheir strong interest in this legislation in this Congress and have \nplayed an instrumental role in helping to shape the legislation. I \nthank them for their very dedicated efforts, and the efforts of their \nstaff which contributed so much to developing a bipartisan consensus on \nthis legislation.\n  Also, I acknowledge the significant contributions made by Senator \nBayh and by Senator Hagel, who are the chairman and ranking member of \nthe International Trade and Finance Subcommittee in this Congress, for \ntheir contributions in moving the legislation forward this year.\n  The legislation generally tracks the authorities provided the \nPresident under the Export Administration Act which expired in 1990. \nHowever, a significant effort was made, with the assistance of the \nlegislative counsel's office, to provide these authorities in a more \nclear and straightforward manner. We believe this will make the statute \nboth easier for the executive branch agencies to administer and for \nexporters to comply with.\n  The bill also makes a number of significant improvements to the EAA. \nI would like to mention a few. The legislation provides, for the first \ntime, a\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nstatutory basis for the resolution of interagency disputes over export \nlicense applications. The intent is to provide an orderly process for \nthe timely resolution of disputes while allowing all interested \nagencies a full opportunity to express their views. This was an issue \nof significant concern to the administration, to the national security \ncommunity, and to industry. And I believe we have reached a reasonable \nresolution of this issue in the bill.\n  One of the things that industry was seeking was a process whereby \nthey would get an ultimate decision. This bill sets out a process of \ninteragency consultation that provides for moving it up to the next \nlevel, if there is not agreement, so that it keeps moving forth. In the \nend, it can reach the President for decision. But at least it works \nwithin a framework in which the industry knows that at the end they \nwill get a decision; it will not simply disappear into the great void \nwith no decision of any sort forthcoming.\n  We think this is a very reasonable way to structure the situation. I \nsimply note that it is still reserved to the President, in the end, the \nultimate authority to rule on the matter with respect to export \ncontrols.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the bill significantly increases both \ncriminal and civil penalties for violations of the Export \nAdministration Act, reflecting the seriousness of such violations.\n  The bill provides new authority to the President to determine that a \ngood has mass market status in the United States. And because it has \nmass market status--in other words, there is a set of criteria, but \nessentially generally available in the marketplace--it should be \ncontrolled. But the President retains authority to set aside a mass \nmarket determination if he determines that it would constitute a \nserious threat to national security and that continued export controls \nwould be likely to advance the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  We have tried to recognize changes that are taking place in the \nmarketplace, to factor them into the thinking, but even so in the last \nanalysis reserving to the President the authority to set aside a mass \nmarket determination. I think this is, again, another example of the \nconcern of those of us who have helped to shape this legislation to \nmake sure that we are able to protect national security and foreign \npolicy interests. We are trying to, in effect, accommodate the market \nchanges and the needs of our exporters in terms of participating \neffectively and competitively in the global marketplace but, at the \nsame time, making sure the President retains the power and the \nauthority that might be necessary, under certain circumstances, to \nprotect our national security interests and our foreign policy \ninterests.\n  At the urging of Senator Enzi, who has been a very thoughtful and \ndedicated exponent of this legislation--and in my perception has bent \nover backwards to try to accommodate concerns in shaping this \nlegislation--the bill contains a provision that would require the \nPresident to establish a system of tiers to which countries would be \nassigned based on their perceived threat to U.S. national security. The \nlegislation requires that there be at least three such tiers. The \nintent is to provide exporters a clear guide as to the licensing \nrequirements of the export of a particular item to a particular \ncountry.\n  The bill would also require that any foreign company that declined a \nU.S. request for a postshipment verification of an export would be \ndenied licenses for future exports. The President would have authority \nto deny licenses to affiliates of the company and to the country in \nwhich the company is located as well.\n  Overall, I believe this bill is a very balanced piece of work. As I \nmentioned at the outset, it commanded overwhelming bipartisan support \nin the committee. It has the strong support of the administration. It \nis my belief it will receive broad bipartisan support in the full \nSenate.\n  In criticizing this bill when it was brought up in this Chamber in \nApril--it was up for 1 day; we had 1 day of debate on the legislation--\nsome of my colleagues registered objections. They thought that the bill \ntipped the balance towards meeting commercial needs versus national \nsecurity needs, that it placed an emphasis on export decontrol without \nan adequate assessment of the national security implications of that \ndecontrol. Others said that the bill's restriction on Presidential \nauthorities to regulate national security-related exports, the \nliberalization of exports of all goods, poses a problem and needs to be \nresolved. And we had other comments in that vein.\n  I want to take a moment to respond to these assertions because I \nrespectfully disagree with them. First of all, it is very important to \nnote that the alternative to reauthorizing the Export Administration \nAct is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n  As we indicated earlier, that is really not a satisfactory framework \nunder which to operate.\n  This was made clear in letters that Dr. Rice, Assistant to the \nPresident for National Security Affairs, sent to Senator Gramm and \nmyself on August 2. In the course of that letter she stated:\n\n       I am pleased that the Senate plans to take up S. 149. \n     Because the current Export Administration Act (EAA) will \n     expire on August 20, 2001, the President is prepared to use \n     the authorities provided to him under the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to extend the existing \n     dual-use export control programs. As you know, IEEPA \n     authority has previously been used to administer our export \n     control programs. Since a new EAA will provide us the \n     strongest authority to administer dual-use export controls, \n     particularly as related to enforcement, penalties for export \n     control violations, and the protection of business \n     proprietary information, we support swift enactment of S. \n     149.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the full text of the \nletter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, August 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your efforts to advance \n     the Senate's consideration of S. 149, the Export \n     Administration Act of 2001. This bill has the \n     Administration's strong support.\n       I am pleased that the Senate plans to take up S. 149 on \n     September 4, 2001. Because the current Export Administration \n     Act (EAA) will expire on August 20, 2001, the President is \n     prepared to use the authorities provided to him under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to extend \n     the existing dual-use export control program. As you know, \n     IEEPA authority has previously been used to administer our \n     export control programs. Since a new EAA will provide us the \n     strongest authority to administer dual-use export controls, \n     particularly as related to enforcement, penalties for export \n     control violations, and the protection of business \n     proprietary information, we support swift enactment of S. \n     149.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you on these \n     important national security issues.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Condoleezza Rice,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                    for National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Aside from the issue that the Export Administration Act \nis better than IEEPA, which I think is clear, let me address the \nassertions that S. 149 would weaken the national security protections \nin the previous Export Administration Act.\n  I believe quite strongly that just the opposite is the case, as \nwitnessed by the support the administration and the national security \ncommunity have extended to this legislation. We have already talked \nabout the increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the \nEAA. The penalties are stronger in this legislation, not only with \nrespect to the existing ones in IEEPA but also with respect to the \npenalties in the previously existing Export Administration Act.\n  Let me mention some other provisions that significantly expand the \nPresident's authority to impose export controls on dual-use goods and \ntechnology in regard to the EAA.\n  Section 201(c) of this legislation states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, controls \n     may be imposed, based on the end use or end user, on the \n     export of any item, that could contribute to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the means to \n     deliver them.\n\n  This authority did not exist in the EAA. It is the so-called enhanced \nproliferation control initiative which until now has been implemented \nthrough an executive order. This provision would give the President \nbroad\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\nstatutory authority to impose controls on any export that could \ncontribute to proliferation or delivery of weapons of mass destruction, \nif there was a concern about the end use or the end user of the export.\n  Section 201(d) of this legislation, the so-called enhanced controls \nprovision, provides:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, the \n     President may determine that applying the provisions of \n     section 204 or 211 with respect to an item on the National \n     Security Control List would constitute a significant threat \n     to the national security of the United States and that such \n     item requires enhanced control.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       If the President determines that enhanced control should \n     apply to such item, the item may be excluded from the \n     provisions of section 204, section 211, or both, until such \n     time as the President shall determine that such enhanced \n     control should no longer apply to such item.\n\n  Section 204 is a section on containing parts and components that says \nyou can't put on controls if the parts and components are less than 25 \npercent of the total value of the export. But the President will be \ngiven the power, in effect, to ignore that restriction and impose the \ncontrols. Under the previous EAA, the President did not have the \nauthority to set aside the parts and components or the foreign \navailability provisions, which is what 211 requires refers to. So this \nrepresents a very significant expansion of the President's export \ncontrol authority.\n  We have had a lot of discussions about foreign availability, mass \nmarket provisions and the President's standards to set aside this \nauthority. It should be clear that this broad setaside power, separate \nand apart from the powers the President has in the foreign availability \nand mass market provisions themselves, is a very important addition to \nPresidential authority and one that was important to the national \nsecurity community.\n  Furthermore, the legislation provides that notwithstanding any other \nprovisions of the act setting forth limitations on the authority to \ncontrol exports, the President may impose controls listed on a control \nlist of a multilateral export control regime.\n  This is a very broad authority for the President to set aside all the \nrequirements of the EAA and impose controls on any export that is on a \ncontrol list pursuant to an international agreement.\n  This is an important provision because export controls are most \neffective when they are implemented in concert with the controls of \nother supplier nations. One of the things we seek to do in this \nlegislation is encourage the development of such multilateral export \ncontrol regimes. Actually, the majority of items today subject to \nexport controls in the U.S. are controlled by most of the other \nsupplier nations through four multilateral export control regimes: the \nWaasenaar agreement, which relates to arms and dual-use items useful \nfor conventional arms purposes; the nuclear suppliers group; the \nmissile technology control regime; and the Australia group, which \nrelates to items useful for chemical and biological weapons. These four \nregimes form the multilateral basis for export controls, and they are \nobviously an important element for effective nonproliferation.\n  One of our objectives here, of course, is to work closely with others \nin further developing multilateral cooperation and strengthening the \ncontribution of these regimes to the nonproliferation objectives.\n  Let me point out, we are constantly encouraging other countries to \nput in place a thoroughly considered, rational export control regime. \nWe go to other countries and say: We need you to put this in place. We \nwant you to join the multilateral regimes, and we want you to establish \nyour own bilateral control systems so we can get a handle on this \nproblem worldwide. I am very supportive of those efforts.\n  What position does it put our interlocutors and our negotiators in \nwhen they go to these countries and then they say, ``You don't seem to \nhave established your own regimes''? What is the U.S. regime?\n  It is another argument for putting this legislation into place so \nthat the U.S. has a fully developed, rational, comprehensive framework \ndealing with export controls, and then we, in a sense, try to pull \nother countries towards it or in that direction in order to enhance the \nmultilateral controls that exist worldwide.\n  Now one other point I want to underscore is, of course, the regime is \ndesigned to prevent exporters from moving out, moving overseas, exports \nwith dual-use technology. When we make the judgment and go through this \nprocess, it has a negative effect on our national security or foreign \npolicy interests, and of course you are going to have people trying to \nget around this all the time--some few people.\n  We have enforcement provisions now that are much tougher. One of the \nthings in this bill is a significant increase in the authorization \nlevels for the Department of Commerce in a whole host of areas in order \nto try to tighten up the enforcement of this regime. In fact, we have a \nnumber of various provisions that are designed to strengthen our \nvarious export controls and to ensure that the resources the Department \nneeds are available to it in order to carry out the provisions of the \nlegislation.\n  Now most exporters want to comply with the regime. They are not out \nto try to send abroad technology that can be abused to the harm of \nAmerican interests. A number of them invest significant amounts of \nmoney in trying to comply with the regime's reporting and recording \nrequirements. So it is important to the export community to have a \ncomprehensive, rational statutory framework. They know, then, what the \nrules of the game are. I think it encourages compliance; it draws, in a \nsense, on the business community to help implement this matter. So I \nthink that also represents an important step.\n  Let me draw to a conclusion by once again saying this is a balanced \neffort to address a complex area of national security concerns that \nalso impact U.S. trade interests. We received just this morning a \nletter sent to Senator Daschle, the majority leader of the Senate, \nsigned by Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and \nSecretary of Commerce Evans. Mr. President, I think this letter is of \nsufficient import that I am going ask unanimous consent it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                September 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We would like to bring to your \n     attention proposed legislation that will be before you \n     shortly for consideration: S. 149, the Export Administration \n     Act of 2001. This bill addresses the subject of export \n     controls, which is very important to the President. He spoke \n     definitively about reforming our export control policies and \n     process during his campaign.\n       Earlier this year, our agencies conducted an intensive \n     review of S. 149, as proposed by Senators Gramm, Enzi, \n     Sarbanes, and Johnson. As a result of the review, we \n     recommended that the Senate Banking Committee make a number \n     of changes to the bill to strengthen the President's ability \n     to control sensitive dual-use goods and technology. The \n     Committee made the requested changes. Accordingly, we \n     strongly support the bill passed by the Senate Banking \n     Committee.\n       S. 149 is an important step in our efforts to improve the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of our export control system. S. \n     149 will provide the President with the authority and \n     flexibility he needs to administer a stronger, updated export \n     control system. The Administration will continue to review \n     our policies and procedures in this area and will consult \n     with Congress as we identify any additional necessary \n     changes.\n       President Bush strongly supports the bill as passed by the \n     Senate Banking Committee and wants to move forward in this \n     important area. We urge you to support S. 149 so that the \n     President will be able to sign a new export control law soon.\n           Sincerely,\n     Colin L. Powell,\n       Secretary of State.\n     Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Donald L. Evans,\n       Secretary of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as we move forward in the debate, I \npresumably will have a chance to examine in greater detail the \nprovisions of the legislation. I read through this legislation again \nover the weekend, from start to finish. I must say to you, on this \nissue I have always been sensitive to the national security and foreign \npolicy arguments. In the past, in considering this legislation, I have \nnever been one who sort of willy-nilly wanted to remove export \ncontrols. I think they have a very important role to play.\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\n  I think this legislation substantially strengthens the ability of the \nPresident and the administration to exercise export controls on behalf \nof national security and foreign policy interests. So I very much hope \nmy colleagues will be supportive of this legislation as we move ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 149, the Export \nAdministration Act of 2001. Consideration and passage of this bill are \nessential for the advancement of our national security, our foreign \npolicy, and our economic interests.\n  I am very excited that today is here. This is the culmination of a \nlot of effort on the part of Senator Johnson, myself, Senator Sarbanes, \nand Senator Gramm. Almost 3 years ago now, Senator Johnson and I, as \nchairman and ranking member of the International Finance Trade \nSubcommittee of the Banking Committee, were given the task of looking \nat the Export Administration Act to see if it could be renewed. It had \nexpired in 1994, and there was recognition that there was a huge gap in \nour national security. That was brought to light a lot, of course, by \nthe Cox commission, which looked at some of the ways China was stealing \nsecrets from the United States. A very extensive document during the \noriginal part of this process was a top secret document, and later a \npublic version was put out; it brought a lot of attention to the issue. \nThere had been 12 previous attempts to renew the Export Administration \nAct. They had failed. Only one version in the House had even gotten out \nof committee.\n  It is an interesting bill because here in the Senate there are 100 \nSenators who are concerned about national security. There are also 100 \nSenators who are concerned about the economic interests of the United \nStates. When a bill is balanced, it will have more than 50 percent in \nfavor, but we have found that the way these coalitions merge, there are \nmore than a majority in opposition to everything that has happened. We \nfaced the unique challenge of trying to do what the other 12 bills had \nnot been able to do. To do that, Senator Johnson and I went through a \nprocess and saw exactly how the whole process worked. We visited each \nstage of the licensing process.\n  It occurs to me at this moment that there may be people who don't \nunderstand the licensing process. There is a lot of confusion among \npeople about the different licensing processes because there isn't just \none. We are only talking about the Export Administration Act.\n  The Export Administration Act is different from the Arms Export \nControl Act. It is different by way of what is controlled. The Arms \nExport Control Act, of course, handles defense articles and services. \nThe Export Administration Act, on the other hand, handles dual-use \nproducts. That could be very confusing. Dual-use products are primarily \nnot used for a military purpose but could have a military purpose. That \nis the main distinction between the Arms Export Control Act and the \nExport Administration Act.\n  The jurisdiction between these two acts is different because the \nState Department and the Defense Department, of course, have a much \ngreater interest and need to control the defense articles and services. \nThe Commerce Department has been given the jurisdiction over dual-use \nproducts provided they are involved with the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of State, and the security agencies, all of which have some \nvoice in the licensing process.\n  One of the big changes in this bill is the way that licensing process \nhappens so that each of those agencies has a little greater role in \nbeing able to object to a license.\n  At any rate, the Republicans and the Democrats on the Banking \nCommittee and on the subcommittee went through a bipartisan process and \nworked together to reach a point of balance with a majority of the \nsecurity folks who are interested in the bill and a majority of the \neconomic interest folks who are interested in the bill. And there is \noverlap. That is how it is possible to have a vast majority from both \nsides. I am pleased to have a bill before us today that, after a lot of \nchanges, I think has reached that point.\n  I have to thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Gramm for giving us the \nopportunity to pursue this. I know it is not the most exciting bill in \nthe world. In fact, some people would say it is an accounting sort of \nthing, a boring sort of thing. But it is one of the most important \nbills that will pass. It is just very detailed. That makes it difficult \nto consider.\n  Over the last 3 years, a lot of people have looked at this, a lot of \npeople have given suggestions and, in fact, the handful of people who \nhave provided the most opposition have also provided the most change. \nWe have put in 59 changes based on their suggestions for how we needed \nto increase national security. We have been working with everyone. We \nare still willing to work with everyone. Of course, the latest one we \nworked with is the President. The President suggested 16 changes that \nare also included in the bill.\n  At this point, we appear to have a balance that still has a vast \nworking majority to pass the bill and I think a bill that will provide \nnational security. Of course, the best evidence that it will provide \nnational security is the President himself. The President has strongly \nurged the Senate to pass it quickly.\n  I have a chart of President Bush's support:\n\n       In working with the Senate, we're working to tighten \n     control of sensitive technology products with unique military \n     applications, and to give our industry an equal chance in \n     world markets. I believe we've got a good bill, and I urge \n     the Senate to pass it quickly.\n\n  That was March 28. Later:\n\n       During the campaign, I promised to lead an effort to reform \n     our export control system, so that it safeguards genuine \n     military technology while letting American companies sell \n     items that are already widely available. I'm pleased to \n     report the Senate Banking Committee passed a revised EAA, \n     which my administration strongly supports. It's now time to \n     pass it for the House, so I can sign it into law.\n\n  There have been numerous statements by the President. He has had an \ninterest in this bill, clear back to when he was campaigning and this \nwas part of his Web site. Since August 20, we have been operating under \nthe International Economic Emergency Powers Act, IEEPA, that was \nreferred to by the chairman of the committee, Senator Sarbanes, due to \nthe expiration of the EAA. It is one of those temporary extensions we \npassed.\n  Operating EAA under IEEPA is unacceptable. IEEPA applies minimal \npenalties to exporters of unlicensed technologies and puts confidential \nbusiness records of the business community at risk of exposure. I want \nto mention some of the changes and the differences between penalties \nbecause that is a big security portion of this bill.\n  Under criminal penalties, for companies that willfully violate under \nIEEPA, there is a penalty of $50,000 per violation. Under the old EAA \nof 1979, which has been extended a few times, there is a $1 million \npenalty, considerably greater than the $50,000 penalty, or five times \nthe value of the exports, whichever is greater.\n  Under the bill we are considering, instead of even the $1 million \nfine under EAA, it will be $5 million per violation or 10 times the \nvalue of the exports, whichever is greater.\n  Persons who willfully violated under the IEEPA would have gotten a \n$50,000 penalty or 10 years imprisonment or both. Under the EAA, they \nwould get $250,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. But under the bill \nwe are considering at the present time, instead of the $250,000, it \nwill be $1 million or 10 times the value of the exports, whichever is \ngreater, or 10 years imprisonment, or both. We have considerably \nincreased the penalties.\n  Under IEEPA, the penalties are almost the cost of doing business or \nperhaps less than that. Under the EAA, the amount of the violations has \nbeen bypassed by inflation, but that has been easily taken care of in \nthis bill.\n  Under civil penalties, it is the same situation. Under IEEPA a civil \npenalty is $10,000, and under EAA a civil penalty is $100,000. Under \nthis bill, a civil penalty will be $500,000.\n  The last major revision to the EAA came when the Soviet Union was \nstill in existence and considered a threat to our national security. \nThat revision of the EAA of 1979 occurred before the Berlin Wall came \ncrumbling down and freedom was unleashed for the first time in almost a \ngeneration for millions of Europeans.\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\n  At that time, almost all of the new invention development was also \nGovernment funded. Today most of it is done by the private sector which \nis forging ahead without Government money involved. There is no need to \npostpone passage of this critical legislation any further.\n  The issues surrounding the reauthorization of the EAA have been \nstudied and studied and restudied. The President, Secretary Rumsfeld, \nSecretary Powell, Secretary Evans, and National Security Adviser \nCondoleezza Rice have endorsed this bipartisan and responsible \nlegislation.\n  Here is one of the messages from Condoleezza Rice, National Security \nAdviser:\n\n       The Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of \n     Commerce, and I agree that [S. 149 as reported] will \n     strengthen the President's national security and foreign \n     policy authorities to control dual-use exports in a balanced \n     manner, which will permit U.S. companies to compete more \n     effectively in the global marketplace. S. 149 represents a \n     positive step towards the reform of the U.S. export control \n     system supported by the President.\n\n  In listening to the arguments of the critics of this reasonable bill, \nthere seems to be a misunderstanding about what the current law is. If \na comparison of the 1979 EAA and S. 149 were made, one would find \nnumerous similarities, as were pointed out by Senator Sarbanes, \nchairman of the committee. In addition, one would find several new and \nmore extensive national security control authorities included in S. 149 \nthat allow the President to restrict the export of technologies \ncritical to our national security.\n  Senator Sarbanes has covered that in his remarks. Contrary to what \nthe critics would have you believe, this bill is not a radical new \napproach to export controls or a radical departure from the current \nexport control system. It updates and simplifies certain aspects of the \nact that are outdated or unnecessary but keeps the basic structure of \nthe 1979 act.\n  There are reasons why this administration's national security experts \nare unified in their support of S. 149. It builds upon the framework of \nthe current law, or the 1979 act, while modernizing, simplifying, and \nstreamlining the act and export control processes, again involving all \nof the people who have been involved in it in the past in this \nadministration and the previous administration to come up with a \nbalanced proposal.\n  It requires a risk analysis of proposed exports and emphasizes \ntransparency and accountability to both the Congress and the exporter. \nWith transparency and accountability, we and the people trying to put \nproducts out will have a better opportunity to follow the process and \nstay within the law.\n  S. 149 embraces national security and foreign policy export controls \neven going well beyond the 1979 act in several respects. For example, \nthe bill grants to the President special control authorities for cases \ninvolving national security and international terrorism, as well as \ninternational commitments made by the United States. Section 201(c) \nallows controls to be imposed based on end user and end use of an item \nif it would contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Section 201(d) adds enhanced controls which allow the \nPresident to impose controls on any item, including those items with \nincorporated parts for national security purposes.\n  These two national security protections are not in current law and \ncould be used regardless of the foreign availability or mass market \nstatus of the item. In addition, the bill retains the Presidential set-\naside authority in the case of foreign availability determination, \nsection 212, as well as unlimited set-aside authority for mass market \ndetermination.\n  Those are two determinations. Foreign availability, of course, is if \nthe same product of the same quality is available from other countries \nthat can compete with our industry and do not have to follow our export \nlaws, under some very careful criteria that has been outlined in the \nbill, then they have the right to export those properties. The \nPresident has the right to override it.\n  Mass market, of course, has already been explained as those items you \ncan go to the store and buy at a relatively low price anywhere in the \ncountry, which makes any regulation over their export very difficult. A \ntourist coming to the country can go to the store, pick up the item, \nput it in their suitcase, and take it home. If it is that widely \navailable, then it is very difficult to control.\n  The purpose of our bill, of course, is to build a higher fence around \nfewer items and really concentrate on those things that can be \ncontrolled and need to be controlled and put more effort and resources \ninto it. The general authorities contained throughout the bill are \nentirely consistent with the current law. The bill requires concurrence \nwith the Secretary of Defense for identifying which items are to be \nincluded on the control list for national security purposes.\n  There are three stages to this. There is a control list which gives \npeople an idea of what kinds of items need to be licensed. There is a \ncountry tiering system. This is the one that evaluates countries in the \nworld. No countries are named specifically, but the President, in \ncooperation with the experts that he has, would rank these people \nthrough three tiers from bad to good, with a whole bunch in the middle, \nwhich would all have different rights to access things on the control \nlist based on their sensitivity. Then, of course, if it has to be \nlicensed, it has to go through a licensing process.\n\n  So we are talking about concurrence of the Secretary of Defense for \nidentifying items to be included on the control list for national \nsecurity purposes, and this is consistent with current law.\n  The foreign policy export control authorities in title III are \nexercised by the Secretary of Commerce in consultation with the \nSecretary of State. This is also identical to current law. In addition, \nthe authority for the issuance of regulations is the same as the EAA of \n1979.\n  The Banking Committee determined that a flexible but transparent \nprocess was essential to keep the export control system from becoming \nobsolete the day after it becomes law. S. 149 allows flexibility for \nthe administration in implementation of export controls because \ntechnology is changing at a phenomenal rate. Business models are very \ndifferent from those employed a decade ago and, of course, \nglobalization is breaking down some of the traditional barriers to \ntrade and investment.\n  As a result, it is vital that Congress resist the temptation to lock \ninto a statute policy toward a specific country or a specific item. \nExperience has shown that this is not an advisable course of action in \nmost cases. Flexibility is needed in the light of rapid technological \nchange. To illustrate this point, the Congress placed in fiscal year \n1998 the National Defense Authorization Act provisions relating to \nhigh-performance computers. Concerns were genuine about the export of \ncomputers to potentially dangerous end users. However, to my knowledge, \nnever before had the Congress locked into statute a specific parameter \nof control for an item.\n  In addition, the Congress initially required a 180-day waiting period \nbefore the President could change the MTOPS control threshold, the \nspeed of the computers. As we all know, this was in the midst of some \nof the most rapid advancements in computing power constraining the \nadministration's ability to keep pace with technological progressions.\n  In keeping with the need for flexibility, the Banking Committee \nadopted an amendment offered by Senator Bennett that would repeal the \nMTOPS 180-day waiting period. This does not mean computers would not be \ncontrolled. Instead, it means the President may control computer \nexports in a way that is more effective, more updated.\n  S. 149 emphasizes the need for strengthened multilateral export \ncontrol regimes. Multilateral controls are the most desirable because \nthey are the most effective. This is where we get our allies and our \nfriends, again any country that we can talk into it, to join us in the \ncontrol effort. As Senator Sarbanes pointed out, we have been \nemphasizing to other countries they need to have a good export control \nact, a good export licensing process. We are the ones who are behind \nthe curve on doing that.\n  The multilateral controls need to be more emphasized. We used to have \na process, a regime, called COCOM, and it was a mandatory group of our \nallies that under agreement would eliminate\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\nexports on which they agreed across the board.\n  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, COCOM disappeared. We have a \nprocess called Wassenaar now, the Wassenaar Arrangement, which is more \nof a voluntary effort. Section 501 of this act urges the President to \nundertake efforts to strengthen or build upon multilateral export \ncontrol regimes.\n  I had the distinct pleasure of serving as a cochair with Senator \nBingaman and Congressman Cox and Congressman Berman on the \ncongressionally mandated Study Group on Enhancing Multilateral Export \nControls for U.S. National Security. The study group, with the \nassistance of the Stimson Center, came to the conclusion that reform of \nthe export control system is vital to U.S. national security \nobjectives. Now we recommend that the U.S. should seek to improve the \nWassenaar Arrangement with the long-term goal of merging existing \nmultilateral regimes.\n  Additionally, the study group recommended that the U.S. should reform \nits export control laws to build confidence and support among allies \nand friends for improving multilateral export control regimes. The \nprovisions in S. 149 are consistent with these recommendations and \nshould help to guide the administration as it seeks to strengthen the \nmultilateral efforts and arrangements so we do not unnecessarily punish \nU.S. firms with unilateral controls.\n  Finally, and importantly, the bill greatly enhances enforcement. It \nsubstantially increases criminal and civil penalties for violators, and \nI went through some of those differences between what happens with the \nExecutive order we are under now and the previous EAA act of 1979 and \nthe present one. It adds new resources for enforcement activities \nincluding an additional $4.5 million for end-use checks.\n\n  It strengthens postshipment verifications, checking to see if the \nproduct actually went where the product was supposed to go.\n  By targeting resources to exports involving the greatest risk rather \nthan focusing solely on computers--there are other things out there \nthat need to be checked on--this puts more money into the checking and \ntargets those things that create the greatest risk to the United \nStates.\n  The Banking Committee took a tough stand on violators of postshipment \nverifications. We do not believe we should reward those entities that \ndeny postshipment verifications. Therefore, the bill requires the \nSecretary to deny licenses to end users that do not allow postshipment \nverification for a controlled item. That is pretty well nailed down \nwith the company involved, any subsidiaries of the company. I think it \nkeeps them from getting around any provision of that. It strengthens \npostshipment verification, which is something that needed to be done.\n  In conclusion, I offer a couple of quotes from a general and a former \nNational Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft. On June 8, 2001, when the \nCenter for Strategic and International Studies publicly released its \nreport on computer exports and national security in the global era, \nGeneral Scowcroft said that some seem chained to the same policies that \nare largely not useful, and that there is a natural bureaucratic \ntendency to cling to the current rules.\n  As we consider S. 149, I urge my colleagues to be mindful of General \nScowcroft's comment and do the right thing and support passage of the \nExport Administration Act of 2001. Export control issues have been \nintensely reviewed and all the results of the studies come to the same \nconclusion. It is best for Congress to reauthorize the EAA now. The \nSenate should act now and pass this bill.\n  I express thanks to the chairman, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator \nGramm, to my coworker on this, Senator Johnson, and the new chairman \nand ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Trade and \nFinance, Senators Bayh and Hagel who have done a great job.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention some of the staff people: \nKatherine McGuire; my legislative director, Amy Dunathan; the Banking \nCommittee staff, Joel Oswald, who used to be on my staff. There was a \n3-year time and there has been some transition. Paul Nash, Naomi \nCampbell, and Marty Gruenberg have done a tremendous job working around \nthe clock in putting together this bill. They have been good at \ncoordinating our efforts so we could get together with everybody.\n  As I mentioned, we are still willing to talk to anybody about any of \nthe provisions but think that a bill has been put in place now that has \nsome balance to it. Of course, 16 changes we made on behalf of the \nPresident incorporated a number of issues that some of the security \nchairmen had been concerned about. We think we have a bill that should \nand can be passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 149, the \nExport Administration Act of 2001. It is difficult to overstate the \nurgency of reauthorizing EAA, which expired on August 20. We are now \noperating under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, an \nimprovised export control measure that has weak enforcement powers and \nthat has been challenged in the courts. President Bush and his national \nsecurity team have repeatedly urged Congress to pass S. 149, and I rise \ntoday to urge my colleagues to do just that.\n  S. 149 is both a national security and a trade bill. It is one of the \nbest examples that I have seen of a law that accounts for the vast \ngeopolitical and commercial changes of the past decade and at the same \ntime provides flexibility for the continued changes we must expect over \nthe coming decades.\n  The Export Administration Act has seen no major revisions since 1985. \nSince that time, the Soviet Union has collapsed, the cold war has ended \nand a new world order, including new threats, have emerged. At the time \nthe political landscape has changed dramatically, so too has the \ncommercial landscape. A global marketplace for goods, services and \ntechnology has developed, and once unimaginable technological \nadvancements are now available on a widespread basis. The high tech \nsector is largely responsible for the remarkable change in our access \nto computers and the Internet, and we must take great care not to \njeopardize that economic vitality.\n  I have spent the last few years working on EAA with my colleagues \nacross the aisle. When we started this effort, Senator Enzi and I were, \nrespectively, the ranking member and chairman of the International \nTrade and Finance Subcommittee of the Banking Committee. From the \nbeginning, we have had the full support of Chairman Sarbanes and \nSenator Gramm, and I am hard pressed to recall a situation in my 15 \nyears in Congress where a bipartisan team was completely cohesive. \nThere is a reason why our team of unlikely bedfellows has held together \nso well, and the reason is that S. 149 is a very good bill.\n  I believe in this bill. I believe it will help our nation. It will \nstrengthen our national security. It will create an environment that \npromotes further technological advancement and fosters economic \nvitality. And it provides a structure that can grow and change into the \nfuture.\n  S. 149 creates a new framework for export controls on dual-use items. \nBy targeting enforcement efforts on problem areas, this more focused \napproach is just good, common sense. S. 149 will make exporting some \nitems easier, and make exporting other items much more difficult. As \nRepresentative Cox has stated, ``We ought not to have export controls \nto pretend to make ourselves safe as a country. We ought to have export \ncontrols that work.'' At the same time, S. 149 will impose real costs \nand penalties on those who violate the law. Some violators will serve \nprison terms along with their hefty fines.\n  While no one has more respect than I do for the deliberative process \nthat allows the Senate to create thoughtful and responsible laws, I am \nstruck by the irony of today's debate. I understand that several of my \ndistinguished colleagues will object to reauthorization of EAA on the \ngrounds that S. 149 will somehow compromise our national security. They \nwill urge us to delay passage of EAA in the interest of our national \nsecurity. They will demand further study before we move forward\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\nwith S. 149, which has nearly unanimous support of both industry and \ngovernment, including the national security community. I look forward \nto hearing from those colleagues because I am having some difficulty \nunderstanding how delaying passage of EAA does anything but harm our \nnation and our national security. I must remind my colleagues that EAA \nhas expired. We are operating under IEEPA and will continue to do so \nuntil we enact S. 149. This is the real national security threat.\n  The argument that S. 149 compromises our national security is, I \nbelieve, based on a false premise. That premise is that national \nsecurity and a strong export economy are incompatible. In fact, our \nnational security depends on a strong export economy and America's \ncontinued leadership in the high tech field. I agree with the way \nSenator Gramm framed the question last year:\n\n       Is our security tied to our being the leader in technology, \n     or is it tied to our ability to hold onto the technology we \n     have and not share it with anybody?\n\n  Clearly, our security is tied to being the leader in technology, and \nsecurity experts confirm this point.\n\n  As Dr. Donald A. Hicks, former Under Secretary of Defense for \nResearch & Engineering and chairman of the Defense Science Board Task \nForce on Globalization and Security testified before the Banking \nCommittee on February 14, 2001:\n\n       Today, the ``U.S. defense industrial base'' no longer \n     exists in its Cold War form . . . DoD is relying increasingly \n     on the U.S. commercial advanced technology sector to push the \n     technological envelope and enable the Department to ``run \n     faster'' than its competitors. DoD is not a large enough \n     customer, however, to keep the U.S. high-tech sector vibrant. \n     Exports are now the key to growth and good health. . . . If \n     U.S. high-tech exports are restricted in any significant \n     manner, it could well have a stifling effect on the U.S. \n     military's rate of technological advancement.\n\n  Without a vibrant high technology sector, our national security will \nsuffer. And without the ability to export dual-use items, the high tech \nsector will simply not be able to support our national security needs. \nWe must not lose sight of this critical point.\n  This is not to say that we should never restrict exports of our \ngoods, services and technologies. On the contrary. In fact, S. 149 is \nlargely about establishing the most effective mechanism for restricting \nthe export of dual-use items that pose a potential national security or \nforeign policy threat. Based on recommendations from national security \nexperts, including the Cox Committee and the WMD Commission, S. 149 \ntakes a risk-based approach to export control. This approach is \nsensible, and allows resources to be used where they are most \neffective.\n  More specifically, S. 149 targets export controls on those items and \ndestinations that the U.S. determines to pose the greatest risk to \nnational security and foreign policy, while removing ineffective \ncontrols that serve as unnecessary barriers to trade. This so-called \n``tiering'' approach is an ingenious solution to the current situation. \nToday, 99.4 percent of all export applications are approved. This leads \nme to believe that the current system is not making effective use of \nour export control resources.\n  My colleagues on the Banking Committee determined that the U.S. \nexport control regime should focus on controlling those items that pose \nthe greatest risk to national security. A useful way of thinking about \nthe right approach was voiced by Dr. Hicks before our committee. He \nsaid the U.S. ``must put up higher walls around a much smaller group of \ncapabilities and technologies.''\n  We on the Banking Committee identified two categories of exports \nwhose control does little to enhance our national security, and the \ncontrol of which could in fact undermine our security interests by \nendangering America's technology leadership. We determined that it is \nbest to heed the wise counsel of former Secretary of Defense and \nNational Security Advisor Frank Carlucci that ``we should do only that \nwhich has an effect, not that which simply makes us feel good. . . .''\n  Based on this principle, we concluded that there is little national \nsecurity benefit derived from controlling U.S. items if substantially \nidentical items can be acquired through another source or if such items \nare produced and available for sale in large volume to multiple \npurchasers. For these reasons, we created the so-called ``foreign \navailable'' and ``mass market'' exceptions to export controls.\n  Specifically, the foreign available exception acknowledges that \nunilateral control on items that are readily available from foreign \nsources are ineffective, and in fact may be counterproductive. The \nDefense Science Board Task Force on Globalization and Security noted in \nits final report that:\n\n     Shutting U.S. companies out of markets served instead by \n     foreign firms could inhibit the competitiveness of the U.S. \n     commercial advanced technology and defense sectors upon which \n     U.S. economic security and military-technical advantage \n     depend.\n\n  Stated another way, Mr. John Douglass, president of the Aerospace \nIndustries Association, noted before our committee that such unilateral \nmeasures punish the exporter rather than the importer.\n  The ``mass market'' exception likewise acknowledges the futility of \ntrying to control items that are virtually uncontrollable by the nature \nof their wide distribution channels, large volumes, and general \npurposes.\n  While S. 149 strives to be as targeted as possible, it also provides \nappropriate flexibility by recognizing that the President should have \nthe ability to impose controls in certain critical circumstances, \nincluding cases involving national security, international obligations, \nand international terrorism. At the same time, the bill promotes \naccountability, discipline and transparency in the decision-making \nprocess through review and other procedures.\n  Some have criticized S. 149 for reducing the power of the President \nin a way that I believe is, frankly, misleading. In fact, S. 149 grants \nthe President unprecedented authority to set aside foreign availability \nor mass market determinations. President Bush and his national security \nteam themselves believe that S. 149 as reported gives the President \nfull and sufficient authority to maintain controls when it is in \nAmerica's national security or foreign policy interest.\n  One other aspect of the bill worthy of note involves how risk \nmanagement techniques can be used to target our export control \nresources. First, the bill's system builds in controls for \ntechnological and political change by imposing a risk analysis \nrequirement and continual review of controlled items. In addition, S. \n149 establishes a country tiering system that assigns items and \ncountries to tiers according to their potential threat to U.S. national \nsecurity. This flexibility to classify risk by both destination and \nproduct will be highly effective in targeting our efforts. In addition, \na new Office of Technical Evaluation would be established in the \nDepartment of Commerce to assess, evaluate and monitor technological \nand other developments. And finally, S. 149 places a great emphasis on \npost-shipment verification resources of exports posing the greatest \nrisk to U.S. national security.\n  As a final matter, I would like to discuss the role of penalties in \nS. 149. Under the 1979 act, and especially under IEEPA, which we \ncurrently operate under, penalties are modest from any perspective. In \nfact, penalties are modest enough that businesses intent on violating \nour export laws simply factor the penalties in as a cost of doing \nbusiness. That is how inadequate, how modest, how unsatifactory the \ncurrent regime, both under the old 1949 act and under IEEPA are. A \ncompany that willfully violates export laws today is liable for a mere \n$50,000 per violation--chicken feed. Under S. 149, that company would \npay a minimum penalty of $5 million per violation, and could owe \nsignificantly more. Individuals who willfully violate the law will owe \na minimum penalty of $1 million and could serve up to a 10-year prison \nsentence. Civil penalties for any violation of export law rise from \n$10,000 per violation under IEEPA to $500,000 per violation under S. \n149.\n  My distinguished colleagues, reauthorization of EAA is critical to \nour nation's interests.\n  We are now operating under a grossly inadequate emergency control \nsystem, IEEPA, and that situation will not change until we enact S. \n149. Our situation is urgent. Under current law, exporters face anemic \npenalties for violations, and in fact the entire structure\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nis vulnerable to court challenge. Until we pass EAA, we do indeed face \na national security crisis.\n  In addition, we must not lose sight of the impact our export control \nsystem on dual-use items could have on our high tech sector. The \nAmerican economy has achieved unprecedented growth largely as a result \nof high tech innovations. In addition to creating wealth for our \ncitizens, new technologies have enhanced our national security by \ngiving us a competitive edge in development of our own security \nsystems. The bill beefore us does nothing to compromise our security. \nOn the contrary, S. 149 takes a common sense approach to export \ncontrols that significantly enhances our national security and economic \nvitality.\n  S. 149 is bipartisan, and has the strong support of the \nadministration, the national security community, and business \norganizations.\n  This morning, our chairman, Chairman Sarbanes, submitted for the \nRecord the most recent letter expressing support for the passage of \nthis bill from President Bush, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, Secretary \nof State Powell, Secretary of Commerce Evans, and National Security \nAdviser Condoleezza Rice previously indicated her support for this \nbill--not the concept but this bill.\n  I thank many for the extraordinary effort they have given to the \ncreation of this bipartisan legislation. This kind of legislation has \nthe support of Republicans and Democrats. It passed the Senate Banking \nCommittee on a vote of 19-1. It has the support of the administration \nas well as the Senate.\n  A lot of significant work ought to be credited to Marty Gruenberg of \nSenator Sarbanes' staff; Amy Dunathan of Senator Gramm's staff; \nKatherine McGuire of Senator Enzi's staff; Joel Oswald, Senator Enzi's \nformer Banking Committee staff; Paul Nash, my former Banking Committee \nstaffer; Naomi Campbell of my staff; and certainly Senator Bayh of \nIndiana and Senator Hagel of Nebraska have made significant \ncontributions as well to the furthering of this legislation.\n  This legislation has been reviewed by the Bush administration. They \nstate in their letters there is intensive review of S. 149. They \nexpress their strong support. I express my strong support. It is my \nhope that this debate will proceed in an expedited fashion and that we \nwill very quickly pass this legislation by the overwhelming bipartisan \nmargin it deserves, and that it will go to the President who asked that \nit be presented to him for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to address S. 149. I \nbelieve my colleagues who have spoken are correct in that they have \nsubstantial support for this legislation. I do not doubt they have a \nmajority of the Democrats and a majority of the Republicans. I do not \ndoubt they have the support of the administration. My understanding was \nthat the President made a campaign statement or commitment with regard \nto this issue during the last campaign. President Clinton made the same \ncommitment during his campaign for President.\n  The President had a group of high-tech executives to the White House, \njust as President Clinton did, to promote this sort of legislation. My \ncolleagues are correct in that the President now supports essentially a \ncontinuation of the Clinton policy with regard to the liberalization or \nloosening of our export controls law. I disagreed with it when \nPresident Clinton was President. I disagree with it now.\n  While we need an Export Administration Act and while we need to take \ninto consideration commercial circumstances and changes in the world, I \nthink the balance between our national security interests and our \ncommerce interests is not there.\n  This is not really a bill, as I think about it, that is supposed to \nbalance as such. It is a bill that has very specific purposes. It is \nconsistent with our export administration process that we have had for \ndecades in this country. It is based on the notion that there are some \nitems we need to try to keep out of the hands of some people for as \nlong as we can. The most ardent proponents of liberalized trade \nrestrictions, of course, would acknowledge that. We have the so-called \nrogue nations, and so forth, to which, we all acknowledge, we should \nnot let any of this high-tech stuff get through. If we were really in a \nworld where the technology genie were totally out of the bottle, I \nsuppose we would not bother ever making the distinctions between really \nbad countries and pretty bad countries and friends because it would be \nout there for all to have. This is based on the proposition that is not \nthe case, that there are some things controllable and that we should \ntry to keep these things out of the hands of some entities and some \ncountries for as long as we can.\n\n  When you look at the purpose of the act we are dealing with today, I \nthink it correctly states that the purpose is about national security \nexport controls, it is not about enhancing exports. In fact, you might \nsay it is kind of anti-export. I think the norm is and should be that \nthis country is for free trade. I certainly have tried to be one of the \nleaders in that area. I think the President ought to have trade \npromotion authority. I think we need to do more in that area. I think \nit is the basis for a large segment of our economic security and \nprosperity in this country.\n  We had a debate with regard to a section of NAFTA recently. I think \nmost of us are very committed to the process. But the fact that we have \nan export administration process and an Export Administration Act \nacknowledges that, be that as it may, there are some things that bring \nin extremely serious national security considerations.\n  I refer to S. 149. It says the purposes of this act are to restrict \nthe export of items that would contribute to the military potential of \ncountries so as to prove detrimental to the national security of the \nUnited States. It further says the purpose is to stem the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. It doesn't really talk about a balance \nof those grave and primary considerations that we all must acknowledge \nare, more than anything else, against some commercial considerations. \nHere we are talking about I think our total exports to these control \ncountries, which are about 3 percent of our exports. So we are talking \nabout a small fraction--3 percent of our exports as balanced against \nwhat I just described in the act.\n  I am not for some kind of equipoise, or some kind of a balance, when \nit comes to these things. We shouldn't control things that are \nuncontrollable. We shouldn't be foolish about it. But we ought to have \na very careful process that is not weighted or prejudiced in any way by \nthose whose interest it is to get things out the door, whose interest \nis to export, whose interest is to come to the White House and come to \nthe Congress and lobby on behalf of more and more exports for economic \nreasons. You don't have the average man on the street with a lobbying \nteam coming up here saying be very, very careful about how you \nliberalize our export control laws because we are concerned about what \nwe read about what is going on in the world in terms of proliferation.\n  The world has changed a lot. We should look at these matters from \ntime to time to see whether or not we are operating in the right \ncentury. We don't have the old Soviet Union anymore. We don't have the \nthreat that posed. But in its place are several new threats which, in \nmany cases, are more dangerous than the ones we had.\n  We know, for example, that with the development of technology, \nweapons of mass destruction can now kill many, many more people than \nthey otherwise could. There are ways of delivering weapons of mass \ndestruction that did not exist a short time ago to countries such as \nthe United States.\n  We have biological weapons that stagger the imagination with the \ndescription of the devastation that just a small amount of it can \nwreak, again, accompanying that with the means to deliver them, the \nmeans that did not exist a short time ago. That is the other side of \nthe technological coin, the technology that has helped us in so many \nways and has made the world a better place. That is the other side of \nthat coin. It is real.\n  Of course, the world has changed in another way. My colleagues are \ncorrect when they say that more of this technology is available around \nthe world. In some cases, to some extent perhaps, there is nothing we \ncan do about it. But in some cases, to some extent, there is something \nwe can do about it.\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\n Therein lies what we are trying to deal with here with regard to our \nexport administration policy; that is, being very careful in making \nsure, with regard to the things we can have some control over, even if \nit is just to slow down the bad actors that wish our country and our \nnational security ill, that it is a good thing to do. If we are not \nwilling and committed to doing that, regardless of what it does to \ntrade in a certain segment of exports, then we should not have any \nexport policy at all; we should not have any export restrictions at \nall. I do not think we are there. I do not think that anyone would \nadvocate that.\n  But it concerns me to hear that my colleagues think by passing this \nbill we are in some way enhancing our security. We are not. You can \nmake a case that it is out of balance the other way, that we are trying \nto control things that are uncontrollable, and it is hurting our \nexports to the extent we need a new balance. I disagree with that \nstrongly, but you can make that case. But I do not think you can have \nyour cake and eat it, too.\n  I do not think you can liberalize trade so people do not have to have \nlicenses anymore for some of this dangerous stuff while at the same \ntime claiming you are enhancing national security. It is just not the \ncase. And it is not as if I have the answer as to where to draw the \nline. It is not as if my colleagues have the answer as to where to draw \nthe line. Reasonable export controls that do not do any more harm than \nis necessary but protect us to the extent possible: It is very \ndifficult to draw that line.\n  What is important is that we have a process because that line has to \nbe drawn every day. There are thousands of applications--15,000 to \n20,000 applications--for exports on an annual basis. We must have a \nvery carefully thought-out process where responsible people, in all \nobjectivity, with requisite expertise, have an opportunity to pass on \nthese things and make those judgments. That is what this is all about: \nwhether or not we are setting up the right responsible framework, not \nto be so irresponsible that we shut things down, but, on the other \nhand, that we recognize that the world is a much more dangerous place, \nthat countries have the ability to harm us and harm our allies, which \nwould directly involve us immediately, more so than ever before, and \nthat we must do what is reasonably necessary to keep these things out \nof the hands--as the world's leading manufacturer in the creative \ngenius behind most of the advanced technology that is going on in the \nworld in so many areas now, that we have a stewardship, we have a \nresponsibility to use that in a proper and correct way.\n\n  As I said, it may be difficult to draw that line, but we must have a \nprocedure that errs, if it is to err, on the side of national security. \nBecause even the bill, as drafted, points out that this is the purpose \nof the Export Administration Act. This is the fundamental purpose of an \nExport Administration Act.\n  So does this act take into consideration sufficiently the matters of \nnational security? And does it take into consideration sufficiently the \nmatters of commerce and exports?\n  If we are going to talk about balance, let's talk for a minute about \nthe side where we have our concern, the things that we are trying to \naddress. In many different ways this is just a part of an overall \npolicy of recognizing we live in a more dangerous world. But while \nrealizing that genie is out of the bottle, we are trying to--through \nour policies, through our diplomacy, and through our policies--mitigate \nsomewhat the danger that we see.\n  As I have stated, because of the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, the world is a more dangerous place in many respects than \never before. Numerous reports have confirmed that a ballistic missile \nstrike on the United States is not a distant but an imminent threat.\n  The Rumsfeld report, published in July of 1998, concluded that \nemerging ballistic missile powers such as Iran and North Korea could \nstrike the United States within 5 years of deciding to acquire missile \ncapability.\n  Shortly after that, North Korea surprised our intelligence agencies \nby successfully launching a three-stage rocket over Japan, essentially \nconfirming the Rumsfeld conclusions. Certainly they, along with Iraq, \nSyria, Libya, and others, can strike our allies and our troops \nstationed abroad today.\n  In September of 1999, the national intelligence estimate of the \nballistic missile threat concluded that the United States would ``most \nlikely'' face ICBM threats from Russia, China, North Korea, and \npossibly from Iran and Iraq over the next 15 years, and that North \nKorea could deliver a light payload sufficient for biological or \nchemical weapons to the United States right now. It has also said that \nsome rogue states may have some ICBMs much sooner than previously \nthought, and those missiles would be more sophisticated and dangerous \nthan previously estimated.\n  The classified briefings are even more disconcerting. Perhaps the \nmost alarming report from these commissions and intelligence sources is \nthat, despite the urgency of this problem, the United States' lax \nexport controls are contributing to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction by global bad actors--our own export policies. The Cox \ncommission concluded that U.S. export control policies have \nfacilitated, rather than impeded, China's ability to acquire military-\nuseful technology. The Rumsfeld commission has said the U.S. export \ncontrol policies make it a major, albeit unintentional, contributor to \nthe proliferation of ballistic missiles and associated weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  There you have it. I do not know how it can be stated much plainer \nthan that and with more authority than that; that we have a serious \nproblem on our hands and that our own policies are contributing to that \nproblem.\n  Nowhere is it more clear than in the case of China, which is really \nthe country that stands to benefit from changes to our export control \nlaws the most, and, ironically, is also the country of greatest \nproliferation concern.\n  China was described by the Rumsfeld commission as a significant \nproliferator of ballistic missiles, weapons of mass destruction, and \nenabling technologies. The PRC has sold missiles to Pakistan, missile \nparts to Libya, cruise missiles to Iran, and shared sensitive \ntechnologies with North Korea. All these actions have occurred despite \nthe PRC's public assurances and commitments to several international \nproliferation regimes.\n  Within the last few days, this Government sanctioned a Chinese \ncompany again for transferring missile components to Pakistan. Even \nmore disturbing is that many of the items that China is proliferating \nto rogue nations around the world may have been legally acquired from \nthe United States. The Cox commission notes that China has deliberately \ntaken advantage of our lax export enforcement policies to further its \nproliferation efforts.\n  China has illegally diverted or misused many sensitive dual-use \ntechnologies or items to further their military modernization. In \nJanuary of 2000, the licensing threshold for high-performance computers \nwas 2,000 MTOPS. In January of 2001, the licensing threshold was 75,000 \nMTOPS, a fortyfold increase in a 12-month period.\n  (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As the Cox committee points out, no threat assessment \nwas ever conducted. As we have seen the rapid decontrol of \nsupercomputers in this country to countries such as China, under the \nnotion that, well, MTOP is not a valid criteria anymore and they will \nget it from somebody else anyway, the defense authorization bill in \n1998 required that if we are going to do this rapid decontrol of our \ncomputers, that we do a national security assessment as a part of that, \nbecause the real bottom line is, we don't know what the effects of this \nrapid decontrol are. We don't know what the significance to national \nsecurity is.\n  We operated for a long time under the notion that it was very \nimportant--and the Cox committee will bear this out--to try to keep the \nsupercomputers at a certain level out of the hands of Russia and China \nand countries such as that because they use them for nuclear \nsimulation, their stockpile enhancement programs, things of that \nnature. We have totally changed our view about that based on no study, \nbased on anecdotal comments by people who come and testify before these \ncommittees who have a direct or indirect interest in companies or \nrepresent companies that are interested in\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\nexporting in many cases--not all of them, but many--time after time. We \nhave not really had any in-depth study or analysis by this Government \nas to what the effect of this substantial change in our policy is to \nour national security.\n  I am not saying I know the answer. I rest assured that no one else, \neven in this body, has the answer. It is extremely complex, but it is \nextremely important. I know of no other change of that importance in \nthat short period of time that has undergone less assessment. That is \none of the things we should address.\n  The PRC diverted and used these American supercomputers to improve \ntheir nuclear weapons. The Cox commission notes that in 1992, U.S. \nsatellite manufacturers transferred missile design information to the \nPRC without obtaining the legally required license, and China used that \ninformation to improve the reliability of its rockets.\n  We are all familiar with the Hughes-Loral problem. I noticed the \nreport in the Wall Street Journal the other day that Loral apparently \nis about to cut a deal with the State Department and Justice to pay a \nfine and still be allowed to go ahead and launch Chinese rockets in the \nfuture, going back to their business. I will be interested in comparing \nthe amount of that civil fine with the profit they make over the \nsubsequent launches that they have in their deals with the Chinese.\n  In 1993, China diverted six high-precision machine tools it obtained \nfrom McDonnell-Douglas and used them to manufacture military aircraft \nand cruise missile components. Just months ago we learned that Chinese \ntechnicians were installing fiber optic cable for Iraqi air defense in \nviolation of U.N. sanctions. This fiber optic system is based on U.S. \ntechnology sold to China in the mid-1990s.\n  According to published reports, we have discovered twice that \ncompanies in China were assisting Saddam Hussein with regard to his \nantiaircraft capability, which is what this fiber optic cable is used \nfor, in order to help him shoot down our aircraft in the no-fly zone. \nThere have been over 300 incidents where Saddam's troops have shot at \nour aircraft over that no-fly zone. I hope and pray they never hit one. \nI hope and pray that if they do, we don't discover that the \ntechnology used to shoot that airplane down did not originally emanate \nfrom the United States of America. I would not want to be the one to \ntry to tell the mother of that pilot who was shot down: Ma'am, we are \nsorry about your son, but they probably could have gotten this ability \nfrom someone else if we hadn't given it to them.\n\n  The Cox commission informs us that China pursues a deliberate policy \nof using commercial contacts to advance its efforts to obtain U.S. \nmilitary technology. The commission states that China uses access to \nits markets to induce U.S. businesses to provide military-related \ntechnology and to lobby on behalf of liberalized export standards, a \npolicy that has had significant success.\n  We see from the Rumsfeld report, the Deutch commission, the biennial \nCIA reports, the nature of this threat and the fact that it is based on \ntechnology, technology in some cases where we are certainly the leader. \nWe know that a lot of this proliferation activity from these rogue \nnations, a lot of their assistance comes from China. We claim we need a \nmissile defense system. I believe we do because of the threats these \nrogue nations present to us. They, in turn, are getting their \ncapability in significant part from countries such as China and Russia. \nWe simultaneously, with all of that liberalizing of our export laws, \nmake it easier to sell high tech items and equipment to China and \nRussia. That does not make sense.\n  Where is the balance? What do we balance that threat against? What is \nthe concern--that our export licensing procedure is too onerous? It is \nnot like we are stopping these exports. As was said, 99 percent of them \nare approved. It is just the ones that are disapproved that are really \nimportant, important to our national security. It is not like we are \ntrying to stop a great many exports because we are not. We are trying \nto have a procedure where we are more likely to not let something \nimportant slip through the cracks.\n  Let's be clear about how much business is at stake. The total value \nof goods subject to export controls in 1998 was approximately $20 \nbillion, less than 3 percent of U.S. exports. The fact that an item is \ncontrolled does not mean that it can't be exported. It only means that \nit has to go through a review process. The overwhelming majority of \nthem are approved.\n  But what this legislation does is take certain categories, \nincorporated parts, mass marketing, foreign availability, and says, \nwith regard to those items, with regard to those matters, if someone \nwithin the bowels of the Department of Commerce essentially decides \nthat they fit into these categories, you don't have to have a license \nat all. You don't have to go through that process. It decontrols those \nmatters and takes them outside of the regulatory process altogether.\n  They say the President can stop it. We will talk about that in a \nminute.\n  First of all, let's understand what we are doing here. In the past \nthere was no such animal as the one I just described. In the past, \nforeign availability was legitimate as a consideration, and it ought to \nbe. When the licensers looked at the matter, if there was foreign \navailability, that was something they could take into consideration in \nissuing the license. Now it is taken out of their hands. If someone in \ncommerce, their technical evaluation team, decides that there is \nforeign availability, it doesn't even come through the process anymore.\n  Mass marketing is a whole new concept. Mass marketing was not even \nused, that concept was not even used in prior administrations.\n  Now I am sad to say that the embedded component was, but it makes \nless sense of all. If an item is controlled and deemed to be \nsignificant from a potential national security purpose, under this bill \nif it constitutes 25 percent or less of the item that it is \nincorporated in, then it is decontrolled.\n  So if you have a controlled item and it is put into an item that is \nbigger and worth more, that is not controlled, that makes the item that \nis controlled decontrolled. Of course, all an importer has to do, in \nsome cases, is to buy the larger item and take out the item that \nperhaps he wants, which is the embedded part.\n  If it is significant from a national security standpoint before it \ngoes into the larger item, it is significant from a national security \nstandpoint after it is put into it. What does money have to do with it? \nWhat is the fact that it is or is not 25 percent of the price of a \nlarger item? Of what significance is that? Especially from a national \nsecurity standpoint. That makes no sense whatsoever.\n  So when we talk about building higher walls around fewer things, \npoint out the higher walls to me. When we talk about making it more \ndifficult to export some things, making it easier for some and harder \nfor others, somebody point out to me the things that this bill makes it \nmore difficult to export.\n  This legislation provides broad and sometimes exclusive authority to \nthe Secretary of Commerce on important procedural issues such as \ncommodity classifications, license and dispute referrals, license \nexemptions, and development of export administration regulations.\n  I have a lot of faith in our new Secretary of Commerce. I think he is \na fine man, excellent choice, and is doing a great job. But the fact \nremains that the mission of the Department of Commerce is to promote \nexports. We used to criticize Secretary Ron Brown for his export \npolicies and getting items changed from one list to another to make it \neasier to export, and things of that nature. The Commerce Department \nsimply doesn't have the personnel and expertise to protect national \nsecurity. It should not have to. That is not their job. Somehow we have \nset it up this way.\n  We are letting the tail wag the dog. If national security concerns \nought to be given adequate consideration in an export decision, the \nDepartments of State and Defense must be given greater authority and a \ngreater role in this process. This legislation doesn't do that. Really, \nto the contrary, it increases the authority of the Department of \nCommerce.\n  Let me go over a few things here, and keep in mind, first of all, the \npurposes of this bill, the stated purposes of this bill. I didn't hear \nit discussed much\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\nwhen we were talking about the details of it. I think it is probably \nthe most important part:\n\n       To restrict the export of items that would contribute to \n     the military potential of countries so as to prove \n     detrimental to the national security of the United States.\n\n  And also:\n\n       To stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. . \n     . .\n\n  That is the stated purpose. Whose job is it to do that? Well, we are \ngoing to give it to the guy who is in charge of commercial activities.\n  Look at some of these areas. The Secretaries of Commerce and Defense \nmust concur in order to add items to the control list. While this is an \nimprovement over the previous draft of S. 149, which left sole \ndiscretion to the Department of Commerce, S. 149 still gives the \nDepartment of Commerce a veto over the Department of Defense if the \nSecretary of Defense believes an item should be controlled on the \nnational security control list.\n  Secondly, on commodity classification, the Secretary of Commerce has \nsole discretion over classifying items when exporters make commodity \nclassification requests. These classifications determine whether items \nwill require license or not and are particularly critical for new \ntechnologies. Commerce must notify Defense, but it is not required to \nsolicit any input.\n  What about the interagency dispute resolution process? Well, S. 149 \ngives the Secretary of Commerce sole authority to select a chairperson \nof, and determine procedures for, the interagency committee to review \nlicense applications. The chairperson considers the positions of all \nthe reviewing agencies but then makes the final decision on the license \napplication. The only role of the Department of Defense is to provide a \nposition, and additional levels of review are resolved by a majority \nvote.\n  What about foreign availability and mass marketing? The Secretary of \nCommerce has sole authority to determine whether items are foreign \navailable or mass marketed. He must consult with other agencies, \nincluding the Department of Defense. Since items determined to be \nforeign available and mass marketed are automatically removed from the \nnational control list and decontrolled, this authority to Commerce \nessentially creates a loophole around the Department of Defense veto \nover removing items from the national security control list.\n  What about issuing regulations? The Department of Commerce and the \nPresident have the authority to issue regulations. These regulations \nmust be submitted for review to any department or agency the President \nconsiders appropriate, but the legislation explicitly notes that the \nrequirement to submit the regulations for review doesn't require the \nconcurrence or approval of any reviewing department.\n  Finally, the catch-all provision in S. 149 provides that unless \notherwise reserved to the President or department or agency in the \nUnited States, all power, authority, and discretion conferred by this \nact shall be exercised by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, that is substantial authority and control by the \nOffice of the Secretary of Commerce. Regarding matters of national \nsecurity, they should not have to bear that much responsibility. So now \nin the act here, we are not really building higher walls around \nanything. We are not trying to come up with a procedure to determine \nthe national security implications of what we are about to do. We \nrecognize that there is more dangerous technology out there than ever \nbefore, and we are providing it to people who are misusing it, but we \nwant to continue to do that at a more efficient rate.\n  With regard to the increased penalties on exporters, I think by and \nlarge that is an improvement. But the act totally decontrols large \nsegments of exports. So if you are decontrolled, how are you going to \nget in trouble? If I were an exporter, I would make that tradeoff, too. \nGive me a penalty on something that there is no way I could ever be \naccused of violating if it falls under one of these items that don't \neven require a license. How do you violate something like that? We are \ngoing to make a higher, more onerous penalty on you for violating this, \nbut we are going to amend the law so it doesn't apply to you.\n  The Presidential override: It is true that there is a section here \nthat, as the proponents indicate, really does override both the \nincorporated parts provision and the mass marketing and foreign \navailability provisions. In other words, the President can step in \nregardless of any of those provisions. To me, it is inconsistent with \nand renders a nullity many of the provisions in the foreign \navailability section, for example, because that section says the \nPresident must jump through all these hoops and go negotiate with all \nthese countries and report back to Congress.\n  In other words, Mr. President, if you are going to step in on behalf \nof national security, we are going to make it awfully tough on you; you \nhave to jump through all these hoops. They are saying: Enhanced control \nprovisions, no, no; the President, if he wants to use this section, \ndoes not have to do all that; in other words, if there is a significant \nthreat, not just a threat to national security but a significant threat \nto national security.\n  I am not sure how all that operates. I think it bears more studying. \nI think we are going to have to look at those sections together. If it \ndoes what is suggested, I still think we need to ask ourselves: Do we \nwant to create whole new categories that are essentially determined by \nthe Secretary of Commerce to decontrol and then say to our President: \nCatch me if you can?\n  If we have made a mistake out of these thousands of applications we \nget every year--another section says the President cannot delegate this \nauthority, so let's make it as tough on him as we can; he does not have \nmany other responsibilities; let's create these whole new avenues of \ndecontrol and then say to the President: You have the authority if you \ncan come up with something.\n  I do not know how much longer he is going to sit over there with a \nskeletal staff in some of these departments. Some people are estimating \nit will be 14 months before he gets his full team together, as far as \nhis government is concerned.\n  Assuming the President does have the authority ultimately to step in, \nis that a wise idea? We are not just giving him new authority to step \nin with regard to an old situation. We are creating a whole new \nsituation, a much more decontrolled situation, and giving him the \ninvitation without delegating any authority. If he personally wants to \nstep into one of these situations, he has the authority to do that. He \ndid not need this authority before because we did not have a concept \nsuch as foreign availability except as something to be considered. We \ndid not have a concept of decontrol based on foreign availability or \nmass marketing up until this bill.\n  Under those sections, if a company can persuade the Department of \nCommerce that it ought to be decontrolled, then it is decontrolled; \nthere is no license requirement. We cannot even keep up with the number \nof computers we are sending to China or anywhere else. We do not even \nhave a list to make some cumulative effect assessment if we wanted to.\n  The business community ought to have their say. I get the top \nrankings from the businesses and small businesses. I do pretty good by \nthem. But I must say, when it comes to matters of export controls based \non national security in a world where we are being threatened as we \nspeak by weapons of mass destruction, it irritates me somewhat when I \nsee in this export bill ``the Secretary shall permit the widest \npossible participation by the business community on the export control \nadvisory committees.''\n  This bill allows the Secretary to appoint advisory committees to \nadvise the Secretary on these matters--quite objectively, I am sure. It \nalso says the Secretary has to disclose to them information consistent \nwith national security and intelligence sources and methods pertaining \nto the reasons for the export controls which are in effect or \ncontemplated.\n  If you want to impose any export controls for national security \npurposes, you have to go to these business entities and explain what \nyou are doing and why you are doing it. Not only is that unnecessary, I \nam afraid it gives an indication or it belies the purposes of this act.\n\n  This bill is going to pass, and we all know that. The forces behind \nit are strong. When you have the administration and probably the \nmajority of both\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\nparties supporting it, that is a pretty fair indicator. I understand \nthat. But for some time now, starting back a couple of years ago, the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, along with Senator Kyl, who is an expert in these \nmatters, have had grave concerns about the balance we are striking; \nthat we are continuing a policy based upon the tremendous pressures \nthat are being brought to bear and based on campaign commitments that \nwere made. It is not in the best long-term interests of this Nation.\n  I do not think any of us can say for sure to what extent it is not or \nin what way our security might be harmed, but we are concerned that the \nprocess is not properly weighted. We are concerned that if we are going \nto err, we err on the part of national security; that when we are \nwilling to engage in such debate to take on our European allies, to \ntake on Russia and China all for the sake of a national missile defense \nsystem, based on the concept of tremendous threats this country faces--\nand I believe in the system--we must move forward on it because I \nbelieve in the threats, but we are refusing to acknowledge and \nrecognize what is right before us and that we are helping to create the \nthreat.\n  When we are exporting high-tech items to countries that have already \nshown that they will take them legally or illegally, that they will \ndivert them for military purposes, that they will send them to rogue \nnations, and we come up with a concept to make it even easier because \nit takes 40 days to go through a licensing process--we do not want our \ncompanies to have to wait 40 days for people take an adequate look at \nthis before they do that--I do not think we have our values in the \nright place; I do not think we are looking at what is right before us.\n  I am not suggesting we not reauthorize the Export Administration Act. \nI am not suggesting we build a wall around our technology. We know we \ncannot do that. But we must have a procedure that is not dominated by \ncommercial interests, either outside Government or inside Government. \nAnd those in the Department of Commerce who are rightfully concerned \nabout our commercial interests, that is their job. It cannot be \ndominated that way. We have to have a fair shot. All this is weighted \ntoo heavily on the side of people who have vested interests in foreign \ncommercial relationships.\n  We have a $100 billion trade deficit with China today. I just got \nback from China with the distinguished chairman of the Banking \nCommittee. The biggest meeting we had was with the American Chamber of \nCommerce in Shanghai. We have tremendous foreign investment over there. \nThat is fine. That is well and good. But surely to goodness we are not \ngoing to let that cause us, when we are considering matters of this \nnature, to come down too heavily on making the process more efficient \nfor exports of potentially sensitive materials.\n  Again, we are not even talking about stopping exports. What we are \ntalking about is a procedure where, more likely than not, we can stop \nfrom making one substantial mistake. We should not back end load this \nprocess and put all that responsibility on the President, if he or his \npeople are fortunate enough to catch something on which those who, with \ngood intentions, just simply do not have the expertise to make a call.\n  That is what we are concerned about. So I hope in the rush to get \nthis bill approved and passed, which will eventually happen, we will \nhave an opportunity to get some fair considerations for some \namendments. I would overhaul this whole bill if it were left up to me, \nbut it is not, and I do not have the votes. I am not going to stand in \nthe way any longer. We have held this up now for a couple of years, and \nwe cannot do it any longer. The votes are too great, and I see that. We \ncould not filibuster it successfully if we wanted.\n  Surely we can consider some amendments that just as an example might \ngive a little bit more time to an agency to review a complicated export \nrequest based on the potential impact of the export on national \nsecurity. An agency now only has 30 days. If they do not get back \nwithin 30 days, it is deemed to be approved. Thirty days is fine for \nmost things, but they ought to be able to have 60 days, if they need \nit, for the complexity of the analysis or if the reviewing agency \nrequires additional time based on the potential impact of export on \nnational security, a bit of additional time under those circumstances.\n  I hope we consider an amendment requiring the Secretary of Commerce \nto refer commodity classification requests to the Secretary of Defense \nand the Secretary of State. The current draft of the bill requires the \nSecretary of Commerce to notify the Secretary of Defense of commodity \nclassification requests, but there is no referral, and the Secretary of \nState is not even required to be notified.\n  That is a prudent addition, an improvement. We should have unanimous \nconsent of all the reviewing agencies on a license application. The Cox \ncommittee recommended that. It can still be taken up and ultimately \napproved if need be, but if the Department of Defense, for example, \nobjects and no one else does, or the CIA or whoever, should that not \nrequire their sign-off?\n  As to postshipment verification, S. 149 says the Secretary of \nCommerce may deny licenses to countries that deny postshipment \nverification, although it says the Secretary shall deny licenses to \nparticular end users. I suggest we add to that language that the \nSecretary of Commerce shall deny licenses to countries. Why do we \nmandate denying a license to an end user that will not let you verify \nit but leave it discretionary with the Secretary of Commerce to deny to \na country that will not let you verify, when in many, if not all, of \nthese cases it is a country policy?\n  We have an agreement, for example, with the country of China. If we \nare being denied the right to go in and do our postshipment \nverification, it makes no sense to blame it on a company. It is the \ncountry that is denying us. So why should we make it mandatory on a \ncompany but discretionary with the country that is calling the shots?\n  As to foreign availability, the definition of ``foreign \navailability'' requires only that an item or substantially identical or \ndirectly competitive item be available to control countries from \nsources outside the United States in sufficient quantities at a price \nnot reasonably excessive. This definition does not speak to relative \nquality. In other words, if it is out there, if other countries can \nsupply it but if it is not the same quality as that of the United \nStates, and it is potentially dangerous and it is something that can \npotentially be used for military purposes to a country of some concern, \nwould we not want to take into consideration the fact we are \nliberalizing or loosening our standards because they have access to a \nsimilar item even though it is not of the same quality as our item? We \nought to consider that carefully.\n\n  The deemed export issue, the definition of ``exports'' in S. 149 \nincludes transfers of items out of the country or transfers of items \nwithin the country with the knowledge and intent that a person will \ntake the item out of the country, but it does not cover any transfer of \ntechnology to a foreign national.\n  We have had a concept of deemed exports in this country for a long \ntime, and that is if you give a foreign national the same kind of \ncontrolled information that is sent abroad, it ought to operate under \nthe same rules if it is the same information because of the \npotentiality of it getting back, and we know that happens.\n  Under the current definition of the statute, the Secretary of \nCommerce has discretion over whether to control deemed exports. I do \nnot think the Secretary of Commerce ought to have that discretion.\n  Now my concern here is that there has been pressure from the business \ncommunity to eliminate the deemed export requirement altogether, and S. \n149 includes language stating it is the committee's understanding that \nthe administration will be reviewing the deemed export process with a \nview toward clarifying its application. I do not have any idea what \nthat means. What I think it means is that we are going to work to get \nrid of this sucker, but we need a deemed export rule and we need it to \nbe mandatory.\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\n  We had hearings and heard countless hours of testimony about what was \nhappening in our National Laboratories when we were concerned about the \ninformation was getting out, and we saw the thousands of hours and \nthousands of people who were coming in from other countries who had \naccess to information. Private industry was doing much better than the \nGovernment, but our own Government people were not submitting the \nnecessary documentation for deemed exports to tell our people what \ninformation these folks had access to. It was common sense. We do not \nwant to cut off foreign students. We do not want to cut off foreign \nexperts, the technology; it benefits our own economy; we need that \ninterplay. But it is common sense to protect yourself a little bit. We \nneed to do that.\n  There are others we might consider, but those are some I hope within \nthe next couple of days we have the opportunity to consider in some \ndetail with an idea toward tightening it up some, and making it so when \nwe leave this, having passed it, we have not unwittingly done something \nthat made it more difficult in the operation of this process. It all \nsounds pristine when we describe it.\n  It goes here and here and here, and then someone has this right and \nthe other fellow has the other right and these thousands of things that \ncome rushing through, but in actual application it is not always quite \nthat smooth. This bill, thank goodness, devotes some additional funding \nfor this licensing process, which I think is a good thing. Let us make \nsure that in all of this we do what we can, at least around the edges, \nis the way I would look at it, to make sure we give enough time to \nproperly consider these things, and we have them considered by the \nentities that ought to be looking at it and not being totally weighted \nor unduly weighted toward the commercial side.\n  So I look forward to the discussion. I congratulate my colleagues on \ntheir perseverance to get this bill this far. We have been arguing and \ndiscussing this bill for a long time. It is one of those cases where \npeople have strong feelings on both sides and make valid points on both \nsides. Everyone is trying to strive for the right thing and the proper \nbalance, and hopefully at the end of the day we will have something \nthat will not produce grave concern among the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to make a \nbrief response to my able colleague from Tennessee. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming also wants to speak.\n  Much of what was contained in my colleague's statement I agree with \nregarding concerns and how to address them. I think there are basic \ndifferences of perception of this bill and what it does. As I said at \nthe outset, I am frank to say I think the bill provides greater \nprotection for national security and foreign policy interests than \neither the previous Export Administration Act or the regime in place \nunder IEEPA.\n  In my opening statement I didn't have the material at hand and I made \nreference to the significant improvement in the commitment of resources \nfor enforcement which is extremely important in any regime. You can \nhave a nice paper regime, and if you do not have the resources for \nenforcement it does not have any reality. I will go through those \nquickly.\n  Beginning on page 296, we have a number of provisions of additional \nresources for enforcement programs. I want those in the Record because \nI think they are important: $3.5 million additional authorization to \nthe Department of Commerce to hire 20 additional employees to assist \nU.S. freight forwarders and other interested parties in developing and \nimplementing on a voluntary basis, a ``best practices'' program to \nensure that exports of controlled items are undertaken in compliance \nwith this act.\n  We are trying to draw on the export community, in effect, to become \nan active partner in trying to maintain the controls and support the \nregime. The freight forwarders are an integral aspect of the export \nprocess. This provision would be very important.\n  We go on to $4.5 million to hire new investigators to be posted \nabroad in order to verify the end use of high-risk dual-use technology; \n$5 million for the end-use verification program. That is in addition to \nthe authorization I was just talking about. The station oversees \ninvestigators. There is $5 million for upgrading the computer licensing \nand enforcement system within the Department of Commerce; $2 million \nfor additional license review officers, and $2 million to train license \nreview officers, auditors, and investigators. That is a total of $22 \nmillion in additional enforcement programs. It significantly boosts the \nbudget by about 50 percent. We are talking about a 50-percent increase \nin the commitment of resources.\n  I listened carefully to my colleague. A fair amount of what the \nSenator discussed involved matters that are not affected in the export \ncontrol regime. If a nation is transferring military technology, that \nis not part of the export regime which deals with dual-use technology. \nWe confront that situation in some instances.\n  I was interested by the reference of the Senator to these various \ncommissions. My colleague from Wyoming, in fact, was the cochair of one \nof those commissions investigating some of the problems. There were a \nnumber of references to the commission chaired by Rumsfeld in terms of \nour export program. I point out to my colleague we have a letter today \nfrom the same Rumsfeld, as far as I understand it, endorsing this \nlegislation and urging Members to act on it. That is the very Rumsfeld, \nunless I am mistaken, being cited in terms of a particular point of \nview with respect to export controls.\n  One item the Senator mentioned as a possible amendment, the notion \nthat there had to be a unanimous decision of the interagency group with \nrespect to a license approval. What that means is the issue then would \nnever get off of the first tier in terms of going up the appeals \nprocess because any one of the departments or agencies involved in the \ninteragency review could, in effect, stop it at that level.\n\n  That is not the scheme of the legislation. The scheme of the \nlegislation is that the matter can move forward as long as there is a \nmajority decision, but the dissenting voice in the majority decision \ncan take it to the next level for review so it can be moved up the line \nin terms of the officials examining this matter, and eventually, of \ncourse, can be taken right to the President for an ultimate decision \nthat will resolve a dispute between one department and another with \nrespect to the issuance of a license. If they all agree that the \nlicense should be issued, it will be issued; if they all agree it \nshould not be issued, it will not be issued.\n  What do you do if they differ? If they differ and you require \nunanimity for issuing the license, in effect, it is blocked at that \nlevel. What this arrangement provides is that you can continue to move \nforward, but an appeal can be taken to the next level and to the level \nbeyond that and eventually to the President for a determination. I \nthink that is a much fairer process. It is a more open process. It is a \nmore transparent process and that means that the exporters at least \nwill get a decision and will not simply disappear into the great void \nwhere they are left without any decision.\n  Much of what has motivated the business community is the argument \nthat ``we need to know, we need a judgment.'' If we can't do the \nlicense, let us know we cannot do the license within a limited period \nof time and we will go on about our business in other ways. If we can \ndo the license, let us know within a period so we are in the bidding or \ncompetitive process in terms of trying to land this contract.\n  I don't think we can go from the majority to unanimity because then \nwe are right back where we were. One of the old problems we have \nconfronted is an impediment and a burden on trade without making a \ncontribution to national security that can't be achieved according to \nthe procedures in this legislation. It is not as though we say if there \nis a majority decision at the lowest level, that decides the matter. \nThat only begins the process and the department that has been outvoted \ncan appeal the matter and take it up the line.\n  It seems to me that is a much more sensible way in which to proceed. \nI think one of the things this bill provides to industry, which I think \nthey\n\n[[Page S9048]]\n\nare reasonable in seeking, is a defined process within a limited time \nperiod that in the end gives them an answer, yes or no. But it gives \nthem an answer.\n  That is an improvement over current arrangements where they may well \nbe simply left in limbo. It is reasonable to expect the Government \ndecisionmakers and the Government process to work in such a way that in \nthe end they get a decision.\n  One of the premises on tightening up is that if you have foreign \navailability or mass market, that you are not contributing in any \nsignificant way to stemming the spread of technology by inhibiting it \nbecause it is available from other sources generally available. So it \nseems sensible to try to take those goods and services out of the \nsurveillance as a starter. We do not do that anywhere near completely \nbecause in both instances we provide authorities whereby that can be \nsuspended.\n  The reason we have the double Presidential authority--for example, on \nforeign availability--is the part in the foreign availability section \nis designed to get the executive to try to negotiate and arrive at a \nmultilateral restraint. This technology is available, foreign \navailable, so it can be acquired there--comparable technology. If that \nis so, we are saying to the President: You should try to see if you can \nnegotiate an agreement. We have the three 6-month periods, the 18-month \nperiod, in which if he has not been successful in doing that, that \nauthority, in effect, comes to an end. But we have the general catch-\nall authority which enables the President to, in effect, limit or \ncontrol it or prohibit it on the basis of the general authority.\n  The mass marketing does not have that. He can keep rolling that over, \nif he chooses. But, in any event, he has this reserve power under the \nenhanced control that enables him to deal with parts and components. It \nenables him to deal with foreign availability. It enables him to deal \nwith mass marketing in which, in effect, a very, very broad authority \nand power has been committed to the President. That is one of the \nreasons it seems to me clear that the administration and the various \nofficials are supportive of this legislation.\n  We are trying to improve the process, provide some certainty in how \nit works, make sure the private sector gets answers, and at the same \ntime reserve to the President the ultimate authority to make control \ndecisions based on national security and foreign policy interests. So I \nthink the basic scheme, the basic arrangement is one that, in fact, \ndeals more adequately with national security and foreign policy \ninterests than either the existing regime now under IEEPA or the \nprevious Export Administration Act.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Surely.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would appreciate a clarification on comparing the \nPresidential set-aside on foreign availability with the enhanced \ncontrols; the former section, section 212, and enhanced controls is \nunder 201.\n  I will ask a question in a moment. I know the Senator knows that \nunder 212, the Presidential set-aside, if he determines that failing to \ncontrol an item would constitute a threat to the national security, the \nPresident can set aside the Secretary's determination of foreign \navailability. Then it requires the President to pursue negotiations, as \nthe Senator has described. It requires the President to notify Congress \nthat he has begun such negotiations. The President shall review a \ndetermination at least every 6 months and notify the committees. Then, \n18 months after the date, the determination is made; if the President \nhas been unable to achieve an agreement to eliminate foreign \navailability with these other countries he is negotiating with within \nthe 18 months, then the set-aside is lifted. But when you come over \nhere to enhanced controls, it seems to give the President broad \nauthority to lift the application of provisions of, in this case, \nforeign availability.\n\n  I take it from what the Senator said a moment ago he thinks with \nenhanced controls the President would still be required to enter into \nthe negotiations with foreign countries, for example. And, if so, which \nof these other provisions--the notifying Congress--presumably the \ncutoff would not apply, the 18-month cutoff.\n  I am a little curious, if the President has enhanced controls, you \nwould think that would obviate all of these other reporting conditions \nand negotiation requirements and things of that nature because that 18-\nmonth requirement certainly would be obviated, and it would make the \nrequirements under the set-aside unnecessary.\n  Will the Senator comment or give me his view on that? There is a lot \nof legislation here. I have referred to it once. We will have an \nopportunity to discuss it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I understand exactly what the Senator is referring to. \nThe Presidential set-aside of foreign availability status \ndetermination, which is section 212, is designed to encourage the \nPresident, in a foreign availability issue, to achieve, if possible, a \nmultilateral agreement through international negotiations. And that is \nsort of spelled out in there as part of the purpose. You know, we \nemphasize negotiations, the reports to the Congress, the periodic \nreview of determination, and the expiration of the set-aside at a \ncertain period, although he can renew it for 6 months over three times, \nfor an 18-month period.\n  Over and above that, the President is given an enhanced control \nauthority in section 201(d). That is on page 183, section 201(d). Let \nme read that because I think it makes it clear that, without being \nbound up in the process of section 211:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the \n     President may determine that applying the provisions of \n     section 204 or 211--\n\n  Section 204 is the parts and components section. ``Incorporated Parts \nand Components,'' is section 204.\n  Section 211 is, of course, the ``Foreign Availability and Mass-Market \nStatus'' section--\n\n     the President may determine that applying the provisions of \n     sections 204 or 211 with respect to an item on the National \n     Security Control List would constitute a significant threat \n     to the national security of the United States and that such \n     item requires enhanced control. If the President determines \n     that enhanced controls should apply to such item, the item \n     may be excluded from the provisions of section 204, \n     section 211, or both until such time as the President \n     shall determine that such enhanced control should no \n     longer apply to such item. The President may not delegate \n     the authority provided for in this section.\n\n  That is a pretty far-reaching authority. We seek the President's \ndetermination on that. Then the only report is, the President shall \npromptly report any determination described in paragraph 1 along with \nspecific reasons for the determination to the Banking Committee in the \nSenate and the International Relations Committee in the House.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sure.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I just noticed when the Senator was reading under \nenhanced control that it refers to control 204, incorporated parts, \n211, which has to do with the determination of foreign availability \nalong with mass marketing. But it does not refer to 212. Enhanced \ncontrol does not refer to 212; it refers to 211, which has to do with \nmaking the determination of foreign availability, but it does not refer \nto 212, which has to do with Presidential set-aside.\n  The first question would be, Do in fact the enhanced controls \noverride 212?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Surely 212 defines how the President can carve out from \n211 foreign availability, and 213 defines how the President can set \naside mass market status determinations, both of which are in section \n211. So 211 sets out these things, and then 212 and 213 provide the \nPresidential carve-out from the requirements of 211. This isn't \nrelevant if the President invokes section 201(d) because 201(d) in \neffect negates section 211. So there is no reason to go to the carve-\nouts in 212 or 213. The President doesn't have to invoke 201(d). And he \ncan do the carve-outs according to 212 and 213, depending on whether it \nis foreign availability or mass market.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I see what the Senator is saying. If you are assuming \nthat the determination made by the Secretary of foreign availability \nand the President's decision to set that aside were made \nsimultaneously, I am wondering whether or not there could be a \nsituation where that would not be the case, that a determination could \nbe\n\n[[Page S9049]]\n\nmade of foreign availability by the Secretary. The President doesn't \nhave anything to do with that. Then at a later date the President makes \na determination that this is not working out very well and he wants to \nuse his enhanced authority. But enhanced authority doesn't refer to \n212, which gives him the right to set aside which foreign availability \nwould subsume.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. I don't want to bring in 201(d) under 212 or 213 \nbecause 201(d) is over and above 212 and 213. This is a tremendous \nauthority to give to the President. It is over and above. If you \nsubsumed them under, then you would be creating problems.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That gets to my second point, if I may. I go back to my \noriginal question. If that is the case, then why is the section under \n212--the set-aside that has to do with the President's actions in the \ncase of set-aside, which has to do with pursuing negotiations with \nforeign governments, notifying Congress, periodic review, exploration \nof Presidential set-aside --if the President did in fact decide to use \nhis enhanced control authority, why would any of that be applicable? \nCertainly the exploration of the Presidential set-aside would not be \napplicable. Or would it?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Why do you have it at all? It is a reasonable question. \nHere is the answer as I perceive it. You are trying to set up a \nframework and a regime in the way of proceeding. As a general \nproposition, for the sake of transparency, for rationality, for \nunderstanding in the export community what is being done, the sort of \nstandard way of proceeding, so to speak, on both foreign availability \nand mass marketing would be to follow the procedures in 212 and 213 \nwhich have been worked out and are designed, as I said, certainly in \nthe case of foreign availability, to accomplish the objective of trying \nto develop multilateral negotiations.\n  So this is the process you set out to be followed. Conceivably, that \nis the process which, generally speaking, the executive branch would \npursue. But in a sense, in an abundance of caution, with respect to \nnational security and foreign policy interests, we give the enhanced \ncontrol power to the President contained in 201(d). There he doesn't \nhave to go through these notices. He doesn't have to go through these \nprocedures. He is not bound into a timeframe.\n  But you don't simply do that. If you just did that and nothing else, \nyou would have, in a sense, sort of a process without any sort of \nstandards or review.\n  We have a process of standards and review. But then we go on to say, \nas I said, with an abundance of caution, that in any event the \nPresident can exercise the 201(d) authority. That is essentially to \ntake care of the argument--actually, I think the Senator used the \nphrase earlier in his statement about unintended consequences. This is \nreally to foreclose any unintended consequences in sections 212 and 213 \nby giving the President this broad authority contained in 201(d) on \nenhanced controls.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It seems to me what we are getting down to is that if a \nforeign availability determination has been made, the President has the \ndiscretion of operating under 211, going through the notice \nrequirements, going through the consultation requirements, and going \nthrough the negotiation with foreign governments----\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is 212.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is not 211?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is correct. But he may not proceed linearly. When \na determination is made of foreign availability, if he at the outset \nwants to use his enhanced control authority under 201, he may do that. \nThen none of the provisions having to do with 212 would apply. Would \nthat be correct?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes. The President could do that. Generally speaking, \nthe President would use 212 and 213 in addressing foreign availability \nand mass marketing, because that is the process, as I spelled out, that \nhas certain benefits that flow from its use. But he would not have to \ndo that. He could invoke 201(d). That is why I said earlier in my \nopening statement that I thought this legislation gave very significant \nauthorities to the President to make these judgments about national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests, and it is one of the reasons \nthat I think the administration, after very careful review of this \nlegislation, is so supportive of it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I will make brief comments while my \ncolleagues are preparing to speak.\n  I am pleased we have had the opening statements that we have had so \nfar, and particularly I am pleased with this colloquy we have just had \nwhich shows that we have built some supreme authority into the \nPresidential position that gives the President the right to trump the \nother provisions that are in the bill but that still puts a process in \nplace which we hope will be followed because foreign availability will \ndefinitely bite us if we do not work with other countries to control \nit.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Right.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is why we are concentrating on the multilateral \ncontrol as opposed to the way we have been doing it which is the \nunilateral control. Unilateral control does not work. Every report \nshows that.\n  I also thank the Senator from Tennessee for his comments about the \ncommission that was chaired by Mr. Rumsfeld and the expertise that he \nalluded to--and I would confirm--that Mr. Rumsfeld has on weapons of \nmass destruction. Of course, one of the reasons that I am very willing \nto point that out is to reemphasize the letter that we had printed in \nthe Record this morning from the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, the \nSecretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, and the Secretary of Commerce, \nDonald Evans, which is dated today, and was delivered to us, that shows \nthe support of these three Secretaries for S. 149. It isn't a hedged \nsupport; it is a very specific support. We appreciate the expertise of \nMr. Rumsfeld in the area of weapons of mass destruction and, while \nthese are dual-use items, he gives the same level of credence to our \nbill as to his report.\n  Another fine line that needs to be pointed out is that in our bill \none of the things we did not do was turn the process over to the \nbureaucrats. We turned the process over to the elected officials. We \nwent to the power at the top. The reason we did that is because there \nis a tendency among bureaucrats to pigeonhole things, to avoid \ndecisions; and if you build a process that allows them to avoid \ndecisions, they will avoid decisions. That is why we put some of the \ntime limits that are in here in here. But there is, at any step of the \nprocess, the capability of stopping the whole process. And that is also \nbuilt in this bill.\n  Mr. Thompson. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am supposed to be a witness in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I wonder if I could be allowed to lay down an amendment \nbefore I leave the Chamber.\n  Mr. ENZI. I appreciate that. I was hoping we would get to amendments. \nI yield for that purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1481\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1481.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To modify the exceptions for required time periods)\n\n       On page 232, strike lines 16 through 18, and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) Agreement of the applicant; complexity of analysis; \n     national security impact.--\n       (A) Agreement of the applicant.--Delays upon which the \n     Secretary and the applicant mutually agree.\n       (B) Complexity of analysis.--The reviewing department or \n     agency requires more time due to the complexity of the \n     analysis, if the additional time is not more than 60 days.\n       (C) National security impact.--The reviewing department or \n     agency requires additional time because of the potential \n     impact\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\n     on the national security of foreign policy interests of the \n     United States, if the additional time is not more than 60 \n     days.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, the amendment I have offered makes a \nsmall but significant change in the license application review process.\n  This amendment allows executive branch agencies such as the \nDepartment of Defense or the Department of State that are reviewing \nlicensing applications to have an extension of up to 60 days to review \nthe license if the analysis involved in reviewing the license is \ncomplex or based on the potential impact of the export on the national \nsecurity or foreign policy interests of the United States. This \namendment should not be controversial. The amendment is simple and easy \nto understand and, in my view, it is very hard to oppose. For example, \nif the Department of Defense is reviewing a license application for \nsensitive dual-use technologies that are controlled under our export \ncontrol process, it should be able to get additional time if the \nanalysis is complex or if the export presents particularly sensitive \nnational security concerns.\n  This change is small but very important. The House International \nRelations Committee accepted this amendment unanimously by voice vote \nin its recent markup of the Export Administration Act of 2001. And this \namendment reflects a recommendation made by the Cox commission on U.S. \nNational Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's \nRepublic of China. The Cox commission report concluded that U.S. export \ncontrol policies and practices have ``facilitated the PRC's efforts to \nobtain militarily useful technology.'' One of the issues the Cox \ncommission discussed was the fact that in 1995, the U.S. reduced the \ntime available for national security agencies to consider export \nlicenses. The commission said that these new deadlines placed national \nsecurity agencies under ``significant time pressures.'' It concluded \nthat the time allowed for consideration of licenses was ``not always \nsufficient for the Department of Defense to determine whether a license \nshould be granted, or if conditions should be imposed.'' The Cox \ncommission recommends:\n\n       With respect to those controlled technologies and items \n     that are of greatest national security concern, current \n     licensing procedures should be modified.  .  .to provide \n     longer review periods when deemed necessary by any reviewing \n     Executive department or agency on national security grounds.\n\n  The current version of the legislation contains strict time \nrestrictions. Reviewing agencies, such as the Department of Defense, \nthe Department of State, or the Department of Energy, have 30 calendar \ndays to provide a recommendation to the Department of Commerce. If they \ndo not provide a recommendation within 30 days, they are deemed not to \nhave any objection. This means that if the Department of Defense, for \nexample, has inadequate time to complete a complex review, the license \napplication is automatically granted and sensitive dual-use technology \nis exported. Allowing additional time in particularly complex or \nsensitive cases would protect our national security at little cost to \nany economic interests.\n  Under the current draft of the legislation, the longest time an \napplicant could wait for an answer under the legislation is 129 days. \nThe Secretary of Commerce has 9 days from receipt of the license \napplication to refer it to the appropriate reviewing agencies. These \nagencies have 30 days to respond. If there is an interagency dispute \nregarding whether to grant the license, it is referred to the \ninteragency dispute resolution process. The interagency process must \nresolve the issue or refer it to the President within 90 days after the \nlicense application is referred to the interagency process by the \nSecretary of Commerce. In fiscal year 1999, average processing time for \nall applications was 40 days. Applications that did not need to be \nreferred to another agency, which comprised 14 percent of all \napplications, had an average processing time of 20 days, and \napplications that were referred to reviewing agencies had an average \nprocessing time of 43 days. This amendment would provide up to 60 \nadditional days of review for export license applications that are \ncomplex or based on the potential impact on U.S. national security or \nforeign policy interests. While this could lengthen the process \nsomewhat in the most sensitive cases, it would have little or no impact \non the majority of export licenses.\n  Madam President, this change to the legislation is small, but \nsignificant. It is designed to address a national security issue \nidentified by the Cox commission and it implements one of the Cox \ncommission's recommendations. The House International Relations \nCommittee accepted this amendment unanimously during its markup of the \nExport Administration Act. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, we have an amendment pending. I would \njust hold it pending because I believe a number of Members wish to make \nopening statements on the legislation. I invite Members who have \nopening statements to come to the Chamber so we can get the opening \nstatements done, and then presumably later in the afternoon we will \nrevert back to the amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. My understanding is that this will probably be the vote \nat 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In between, I was hoping we would get the opening \nstatements out of the way.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A number of Members have gotten in touch with us and \nhave indicated they wish to do so. I just wanted to set out the \nprocedure.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I say to my colleague also that if, by chance, after \nreviewing this, we could come to an agreement on this amendment, I will \ntell the leadership that we would have another amendment which we could \nvote on by 5 o'clock. So we would still have a vote at 5 o'clock, as \nthe leadership wishes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator from Tennessee have a total list of \namendments he is thinking of offering so we can put these amendments in \ncontext? That helps to make a judgment as to whether we are simply \nunraveling carpet step by step or whether there is a finite picture we \ncan look at to make some determination.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may respond, the Senator has a floating list that \nI would be glad, when I get back, to sit down and go over with him. \nFrankly, I am evaluating several that I have prepared based on the \ndebate and the remarks that are made. I would enjoy the opportunity to \nsit down and discuss with him and other Members some of the ones I \nprobably will introduce in the next day or two.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Senator from North \nCarolina for his usual courtesy in allowing us to have this exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndeemed to be appropriate by the managers of the bill I be recognized to \nbe heard for 30 minutes on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Carolina is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for me to deliver my remarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I feel obliged to voice my strong \nopposition to S. 149, the pending Export Administration Act of 2001.\n  I do this because this bill does not protect the national security of \nthe American people. It does not control the export of our most \nsensitive dual-use items. It does not promote U.S. foreign policy.\n  Instead, this is an indiscriminate trade promotion bill, and I am \nobliged to state that I am troubled by the fact that this bill, S. 149, \nwas written in fact, by the business community to maximize future sales \nto Communist China, and to other such countries that represent the \nhighest risk of technology diversion and proliferation.\n  Make no mistake about it, this legislation will enable dangerous \nregimes around the world to arm themselves through the use of the best \ndual-use technology America has to offer.\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n  This bill's sponsors argue that because the cold war is over, the \nworld is a much safer place and that we need to rid ourselves of \noutdated export controls that inhibit trade and harm the economy. These \nPollyannas could not be more mistaken.\n  As the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, I feel \nobliged to make clear that I hold a very different view. It is a view \nbased on years of experience in foreign policy and national security \nmatters, and sharpened by ongoing intelligence assessments. My view is \nshared by the other ranking members of the national security committees \nof the Senate; that is why we have joined together in opposing this \nlegislation.\n  The fact is, despite the fall of the Soviet Union, the world is \nactually a far more complicated and dangerous place due to the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. \nDuring the past 30 years alone, the number of countries pursuing \nnuclear weapons programs has doubled, the number of countries pursuing \nballistic missile programs has tripled, and more than a dozen \ncountries, including most state sponsors of terrorism, have offensive \nbiological and chemical weapons programs.\n  Even worse, this activity is being fueled by Russia and Communist \nChina, two members of the United Nations Security Council who are \nillicitly selling to rogue countries the dual-use technologies so \ncritical to their weapons of mass destruction and missile programs.\n  For years, some other Senators and I have cautioned the Senate about \nthese growing threats; we have argued forcefully for a national missile \ndefense system to make the United States less vulnerable to blackmail \nor missile attack itself. But missile defense cannot alone keep us \nsafe. What we desperately need, and don't have, is a comprehensive \nstrategy that ranges from a credible strategic deterrent to rigorus \nexport controls as our first line of defense.\n\n  At a time when the United States of America is becoming increasingly \nvulnerable to rogue states and others armed with WMD-tipped ballistic \nmissiles, it makes absolutely no sense for the United States to \nliberalize its export controls over the technology and know-how so \ncritical to these weapons programs. Moreover, doing so sends all of the \nwrong signals to our allies, and others, about our commitment to \nnonproliferation.\n  I have also tried as best I can to make clear my view about the need \nto deal firmly with Communist China, which is dramatically increasing \nits military spending and modernizing and expanding its nuclear forces. \nChina's leaders talk openly about preparing for a future conflict with \nthe United States. Meanwhile, Communist China is making every effort to \nacquire U.S. technology and know-how, through theft, circumvention of \nexport laws, or legitimate commercial activity.\n  In the past year and a half alone, Communist China illegally used \nU.S. supercomputers to improve its nuclear weapons. And just a few \nmonths ago, we learned that Chinese technicians were installing fiber \noptic cable for Iraq's air defenses, a clear violation of U.N. \nsanctions. Worse yet, this assistance and technology--which was \nprovided to Chinese companies by American business firms when the \nprevious administration mistakenly decontrolled this equipment over--\nand I must emphasize ``over''--the objections of the National Security \nAgency in 1994--has been of great help to Saddam Hussein in his quest \nto shoot down American pilots.\n  Seven months ago, a CIA report made clear that China continues ``to \ntake a very narrow interpretation of their non-proliferation \ncommitments with the United States.'' Just recently, we learned that \nthe Communist Chinese are continuing to ship missile parts and \ncomponents to Pakistan despite Beijing's pledge in November 2000 to \nstop all such transfers and set up an export control system.\n  Consideration of this bill by the Senate sends all of the wrong \nsignals, wrong messages, to China. It reminds Beijing that the United \nStates is all too willing to place profit before principle.\n  Let me address some of the major elements of this legislation that \nhave convinced me that its passage will seriously jeopardize the \nnational security of the United States.\n  To begin, no one--and I repeat no one--has conducted a thorough \nnational security risk assessment to determine the possible impact of \nthis bill's sweeping changes on our national security. Rather, many \nhave blindly accepted the anecdotes and assertions of industry as the \nbasis for changes in the bill.\n  Second, this bill does not adequately cover ``deemed exports,'' more \ncommonly understood as the transfers of sensitive knowledge from one \nperson to another within the United States. Under this bill, the \ninformation and know-how passed to visiting scientists and others does \nnot appear to be illegal.\n  Third, this bill creates a new licensing exemption category called \nmass marketed items, which allows companies to produce their products \noff of the control lists, notwithstanding the sensitivity of the item. \nIf an item is widely available in the United States, then the bill's \nauthors argue that it shouldn't be controlled.\n  Fourth, when coupled with a new definition of foreign availability \nthat further loosens controls, this bill has the potential to decontrol \nlarge numbers of items. For example, according to one outside expert, \nunder S. 149, the high-precision electronic switches needed to detonate \natomic bombs could be up for sale by claiming that they are needed as \nspare parts for medical equipment; this is what Iraq tried as recently \nas 1998.\n  Fifth, despite the fact that the purpose of the EAA is to safeguard \nour nation's security, the various advisory committees and consultative \nrequirements placed on the administration in the bill do not require \nthat national security or non-proliferation experts be included, while \nlabor organizations and the business community are clearly mentioned.\n  Sixth, this legislation prohibits export controls on sensitive parts \nif they are incorporated into more expensive commercial items or if the \ncontrolled item in shipping overseas for final assembly. In other \nwords, despite the national security importance of an item, whether or \nnot it's controlled depends to some degree on its relative monetary \nvalue and where it is produced. So if a special airborne navigation or \nradar system requires a license when exported individually, a license \nwould not be required if it were merely a part of an expensive \naircraft.\n  And last, but certainly not least, S. 149 provides extraordinary \nauthority to the Secretary of Commerce on important procedural issues \nsuch as commodity classifications, license referrals, dispute \nresolutions, and the development of export administration regulations. \nIf national security concerns are to be given adequate consideration in \nexport decisions, then the Departments of State and Defense must be \ngiven greater authority in the export licensing process. And if these \ntwo departments are found already to have sufficient authority under \ncurrent practice, then why not codify it?\n  The bottom line is that there seem to be more loopholes and \nexemptions from export controls in this bill than there are export \ncontrols. Could it be that the drafters of this legislation assume that \nany effort to obtain a license will meet with failure, and that no \neffort should therefore be spared in ensuring that companies need not \nbother to ask for one.\n  I cannot understand why the bill goes to such great lengths to ensure \nthat no exporter will ever be required to tell the U.S. government what \nhe proposes to export, and to whom he intends to sell it. Just because \nan exporter is required to obtain a license for a sale does not mean \nthat the sale is going to be denied. In fact, over 80 percent of all \nlicense applications are approved.\n  At the same time, the requirement for a license enables the United \nStates Government to ensure that U.S. companies do not contribute, \neither intentionally or unintentionally, to the arming of potentially \nhostile regimes. Licenses also allow the government to track \nacquisition efforts by various countries and groups. Without the \nlicensing of dual-use commodities, the U.S. will know less about the \npotential proliferation of dangerous technologies, will be less able to \ncombat that proliferation, and will lose the ability to exhort other \nnations to take steps to strengthen their regimes.\n  Notwithstanding these facts, the bill's authors will argue that they \nhave\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nmade considerable changes to the bill that address many of the concerns \nmy colleagues and others have raised in the past. For example, the \nBanking Committee will argue that:\n  Penalties for violations of this Act have been raised in order to \npunish violators and deter others. While this is true, this bill also \nraises the evidentiary standard for illicit transfers. Moreover, \nraising penalties doesn't make much difference when fewer items are \nbeing controlled, or when enforcement procedures--such as the mandatory \nconduct of post-shipment verifications on high-performance computers--\nare stripped from the law.\n  An Executive order will be issued to cover deemed exports, give the \nDepartment of Defense more visibility and a larger role in the \ncommodity classification process, and strengthen the voice and role of \nother agencies. However, to date, a draft of the Executive order has \nyet to be provided for review. But more importantly, given the \nsignificance of these matters, doesn't it make sense to make these \nchanges part of the law?\n  It doesn't make sense to control mass marketed items that can be \npurchased at Radio Shack and carried out of the country. The problem \nwith this argument is that if items were controlled, they wouldn't be \navailable for purchase at Radio Shack. But beyond that, acquiring \nwidely available items illegally denies end-users the parts, \nmaintenance, and servicing agreements essential to their long-term \noperation.\n  Since most licenses are approved anyway, requiring a licensing only \nharms U.S. companies by slowing them down. The fact is, DoD and the \nintelligence community benefit greatly from the opportunity to look at \nand understand complex dual-use items before they are shipped abroad, \nand the licensing data provides an important audit trail that is useful \nfor conducting cumulative effects analyses and other follow-ups.\n\n  This bill addresses all of the major findings and recommendations of \nthe Cox commission report. Upon closer examination, many of the Cox \ncommission's conclusions are not addressed, but are simply explained \naway. For example, the Cox commission recommended that the government \nconduct a comprehensive review of the national security implications of \nexporting high-performance computers to the PRC, yet S. 149 does away \nwith that requirement. The Cox commission also recommended that current \nlicensing procedures be modified to provide longer review periods when \ndeemed necessary by any reviewing department or agency on national \nsecurity grounds, and require a consensus by all reviewing departments \nand agencies for license approval. Unfortunately, S. 149 also fails to \nfully adopt these proposals as well.\n  The Wassenaar arrangement is a weak multilateral regime that fails to \ncontrol many dual-use items to the advantage of our European partners. \nIt is true that Wassenaar is an inadequate agreement, but it is also \ntrue that the U.S. government has contributed to its weakness by making \nchanges to our export control laws that seemed to undercut our \nWassenaar partners. But rather than pushing for greater decontrol, we \nshould follow up on President Bush's statement that we need a stronger \nregime--closer to what we had under COCOM--to prevent the proliferation \nof sensitive dual-use items to rogue states. It is unfortunate that the \nUnited States is giving up its leadership role on this issue and \nwalking away from years of progress in the export control and \nnonproliferation field.\n  Finally, some have argued that failure to pass S. 149 will result in \neconomic harm to our country and the loss of thousands of U.S. jobs. \nThese claims ignore the fact that, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, controlled exports represented less than 3 percent of \ntotal U.S. exports in 1998. And since over 80 percent of all licenses \nare approved, only a few billion dollars in sales were lost due to \ndenied licenses--an extremely low percentage of the United States' $10 \ntrillion GDP. These numbers also demonstrate that while exports are \nbeing controlled--and mainly to embargoed countries or those at high \nrisk of diversion, such as China--American firms are not losing out to \nforeign competition.\n  Industry simply does not want the U.S. government reviewing the \nexport of sensitive dual-use items, even if it is for national security \npurposes. If current licensing procedures are cumbersome for business, \nthen the solution is to improve the efficiency and operations of the \nexport process, not decontrol sensitive items simply to avoid the \nprocess altogether.\n  Despite all of these dubious arguments by the drafters and supporters \nof this flawed bill, the core problem with S. 149 is its fundamental \nrefusal to recognize that sometimes the United States must go it alone \nto make a point. The structure of S. 149 fails to take into account the \nability of the U.S. to lead other nations by demonstrating self-\nrestraint and a commitment to principle. It restricts the U.S. ability \nto control exports unless other nations are already doing likewise, or \ncan be guaranteed to do the same in the near term.\n  I do not believe in the contrived arguments of those who say if you \ncan't beat them, join them. Industry reasons that if America cannot \nstop rogue states from acquiring weapons of mass destruction, then why \nshould we be ceding market share to our competitors? They say that the \nUnited States cannot stop dictators or communist governments from \ndenying their people certain basic rights and freedoms, so why not \nconduct business as usual with them?\n  Well, that is not the American way. Americans do not support profit \nat any price, especially if that price is our national security or our \nmoral dignity. The American people will not support the prospect of \nfueling our economy by selling sensitive technologies to tyrants and \npotential adversaries. This is what we witnessed in the eight years of \nthe Clinton-Gore administration, and it is time for this type of \nnonsense to stop.\n  We don't need another eight years of intelligence reports that are \nleaked to the press, outlining in great detail how the PRC is using \nAmerican technology to improve its armed forces; how Russian and \nCommunist Chinese entities are transferring American technology to \nrogue states around the world; how American security, interests and \nfriends have been jeopardized; and how it is completely legal thanks to \nthe Export Administration Act of 2001.\n  Rather, the Senate should follow the wisdom and courage of the House \nInternational Relations Committee. Under the fine leadership of \nChairman Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos, the HIRC was able to pass, with \noverwhelming bipartisan support, numerous amendments--similar to the \nones my colleagues and I will offer this week--that put national \nsecurity back into this legislation.\n  While the United States does need a new Export Administration Act, \nthe bill should protect our national security, not jeopardize it at the \nexpense of marginal increases in trade. The bill should give every \ngovernment department a role commensurate with its expertise and \nresponsibilities. And the bill should send the right message to our \nallies, friends and adversaries, that United States takes non-\nproliferation issues seriously, and will continue to take the lead in \nthe efforts. We need a new EAA but not this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Virginia \nwishes to speak. He will be ready in about 5 or 6 minutes. In the \nmeantime, I thought I might respond, if it is in the schedule of the \nranking member and chairman, to a point that was the subject of a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Maryland and Senator Thompson. Is that \nall right?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. KYL. I noted that one of the subjects of discussion in the \ncolloquy between the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from \nTennessee had to do with the President's authority under this \nlegislation to waive certain provisions, important provisions, because \nthey deal with a question of whether or not an item that is on the \ncontrol list--so-called commerce control list--should be waived or \nwhether there should be a waiver of either the embedded product rule or \nthe foreign availability and mass market rule under sections 204 and \n211 of the act.\n  The point was made by the Senator from Maryland that if there were a \nproblem with one of the dual-use items on the list, the President had \nthe authority to waive that. Therefore, those\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\nof us who have concerns about the legislation need not be concerned. \nThe Senator from Wyoming made the further point that in this case we \ndidn't want to turn this matter over to the bureaucrats so we gave the \nauthority directly to the President.\n  I appreciate the sentiment behind those vows. There is a problem with \nthem however. That is, the President, with all of his other \nresponsibilities, can't possibly exercise this authority without the \nhelp of the so-called bureaucrats, without the help of a staff.\n  I have in my hand just a partial list of the commerce control list \nitems. It specifically says at the top: This index is not an exhaustive \nlist of the controlled items.\n  I haven't bothered to count these. There are hundreds and hundreds of \nitems. I don't know how many pages. It is single spaced, and there must \nbe 60 or 80 items per page and probably 20, 30, 40 pages of an awful \nlot of items that could be the subject of the export regulations that \nare the subject of this bill. It would be impossible for the President \nto be able to devote his attention to this list and intelligently deal \nwith it. In fact, it would be bad public policy for us to require that \nthe President be the only person permitted to exercise the authority. \nYet that is exactly what this proposed legislation does.\n  A provision of the section being discussed that was not quoted occurs \non page 184 of the printed version of S. 149. At the end of the section \non enhanced controls, it reads as follows:\n\n       The President may not delegate the authority provided for \n     in this subsection.\n\n  Well, usually we provide that the President may delegate \nresponsibility because, frankly, he has better things to do than be a \nstaffer going through all of these items with the background to know \nwhether or not some of them should be taken off the list or not. It is \nsimply unrealistic to expect any President, despite a President's \nintelligence and willingness to get into the details, to be able to \nexercise that authority with the limitation here. That is the primary \nreason for our concern.\n  We appreciate the fact that the President has a waiver authority. But \nin most cases the President's waiver authority can be realistically \nadministered and utilized. I think it is unrealistic to expect the \nPresident to be able to do that in this case.\n  One of the possible amendments, I advise the Senator from Maryland, I \nwill present--if not I, another Member will--is an amendment to try to \nsolve this particular problem and conform this provision of the bill \nmore to the type of legislation that ordinarily accompanies a \nPresidential waiver authority. We think that would improve the \nadministration of this act and make the waiver authority really \nmeaningful. I advise the Senator of that point. I intend to make a \nstatement that generally speaks to this issue of the Export Control \nAdministration reauthorization.\n  I also want to speak specifically to the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Tennessee before we have a vote on that amendment. Given \nthe fact that there are a couple of other Senators prepared to make \nremarks at this time, I am willing to stand back and let those Senators \nmake those remarks and then I will come and make mine later.\n  If there is anything I have just said that is subject to correction, \nI would be happy to stand for any questioning with respect to my \ncomments, but perhaps we will have an opportunity to debate that at the \ntime I offer an amendment, unless there is a possibility we might work \nthat out between the proponents and opponents of the legislation in the \nmeantime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I say very briefly to my distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona, this is quite a broad sweeping power we are \nproviding to the executive branch. I think it is reasonable to expect \nthe decision will be made by the President. That does not mean the \nPresident has to staff his own decision. It will obviously be staffed \nfor him. But the determination to provide the enhanced controls ought \nto be a Presidential determination.\n  We do not expect that is going to be before him very often, but when \nthat sort of issue arises, it seems to us it is reasonable that the \nPresident should make that judgment.\n  One of the difficulties we have been experiencing all along is the \nway the export control regime gets bound up down the line and the \ndecisions never go to the top to be made in those instances in which \nthere are differences of opinion. In most instances, you have unanimity \nbelow either for the license or against the license. That is over and \ndone with. But in those instances in which that is not the case and the \nPresident is going to exercise his sweeping authority, we do not think \nit is unreasonable to expect a determination to be the President's.\n  I am very frank to say, I do not know to whom you would otherwise \ndelegate it, since he represents the ultimate arbiter amongst the \ndepartments and agencies, and I do not see any way you can give that \nrole to anybody else because anybody else would be out of one or \nanother, presumably out of one or another of the departments or \nagencies. You are not, as it were, above it making this separate and \nindependent determination which the President will make.\n  The other point I want to note is that the President and his team \nsupport this legislation, so they obviously do not see in it the kind \nof extended practical problems which the Senator has--presumably they \ndo not see that in the bill; otherwise, they not only would not have \nsupported it, but they have been very strong in their support. It is \nfair to say that their support is anything but pro forma. It is very \nactive and very vital, and they have gone over this legislation very \ncarefully over an extended period of time and reached the judgment they \nare very much behind it. That is, of course, what they urged on the \nSenate, including, of course, the receipt this morning--I do not know \nif the Senator has yet had an opportunity to see it--a letter from \nSecretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Secretary Evans in very \nstrong support of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Maryland, yes, I \nhave seen the letter. I agree with him the support is much more than \npro forma; it is sincere and thought-out support. I do not know how \nmany pages of this very complex legislation there are. There are \nnumerous areas that represent room for improvement, and support for any \nlegislation generally does not obviate the possibility of improvements \nand compromises.\n  I hope, as this debate goes forward, we might consider the \npossibility that in this particular area a mechanism be found to \nprovide for a waiver that is more realistic in its ability to be \npractically used than to require the President, not delegated to anyone \nelse, as being the only person who could grant such a waiver.\n  We will talk more about that later. The Senator from Virginia is \nhere, and I do not want to impinge upon his time. Perhaps we can work \nthat out. If we cannot, perhaps we will need to offer an amendment.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I am pleased to rise in support of S. \n149, the Export Administration Act of 2001. Back on June 28, 2001, I \njoined my colleagues of the Republican Senate high-tech task force, \nSenators Allard, Bennett, Brownback, Burns, Grassley, Hatch, and \nHutchison, in sending a letter to majority leader Tom Daschle urging \nhim to bring S. 149 to the Senate floor as early as possible. I am \ngrateful to the majority leader for heeding our request and permitting \nthe Senate to consider this very important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter my colleagues and I sent to \nSenator Daschle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                          High Tech Task Force, June 28, 2001.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As members of the Senate Republican High \n     Tech Task Force, we write to ask you to schedule floor \n     consideration of S. 149, the Export Administration Act of \n     2001 (``EAA''), as the next piece of business on the Senate \n     floor following conclusion of the pending health care bill. \n     Prompt consideration of this bipartisan bill would be a \n     welcome sign of your willingness to pursue a bipartisan \n     agenda.\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\n       As you know, Senators Gramm and Enzi have worked diligently \n     to craft the broadly-supported pending EAA bill which was \n     reported out of the Banking Committee by a 19-1 vote. The \n     Bush Administration also deserves great credit for weighing \n     in to support this critical piece of legislation. President \n     Bush himself last month stated publicly that he hopes the \n     Congress will send him the EAA bill for his signature.\n       The proposed EAA legislation represents a logical \n     improvement over the outdated EAA Act passed in 1979 and the \n     current patchwork of executive orders regulating export \n     controls issued under the International Emergency Economic \n     Powers Act. The bill dramatically enhances our national \n     security needs by increasing penalties, focusing attention on \n     truly sensitive items, and granting the President new \n     authority in cases involving national security and terrorism. \n     At the same time, the legislation will remove punitive \n     regulatory controls on mass market and foreign availability \n     technology products that have hindered the competitiveness of \n     our technology industries. Study after study have concluded \n     that the present system of export controls has the unenviable \n     distinction of harming private enterprise without enhancing \n     security.\n       At a time when our technology industries are seeing \n     declining sales, it is imperative that the Congress remove \n     unnecessary and ineffective barriers to exports that will \n     keep technology jobs in this country.\n       The current extension of the 1979 EAA Act will expire on \n     August 20, 2001. Given this bill's strong bipartisan support, \n     we believe it could be quickly considered and passed by the \n     full Senate, thereby minimizing the interruption of the \n     Senate schedule for other business. Therefore, we look \n     forward to your prompt scheduling of floor action on this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sam Brownback, George Allen, Chuck Grassley, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Robert F. Bennett, Orrin Hatch, Conrad \n           Burns, Wayne Allard.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Gramm, Senator \nEnzi, and Senator Sarbanes who have worked diligently to craft this \nbroadly supported measure. President Bush and his team also deserve a \ngreat deal of credit for weighing in, in support of this legislation.\n  This bill represents a logical improvement over the outdated Export \nAdministration Act that was passed in 1979 and the current patchwork of \nExecutive orders regulating export controls issued under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act. S. 149 dramatically \nenhances our national security needs by increasing penalties, by \nfocusing attention on truly sensitive items, and granting the President \nnew control authority in cases involving national security and \nterrorists.\n  At the same time, this legislation will remove unnecessarily \nburdensome punitive regulatory controls on mass market and readily \navailable foreign technology products that have hindered the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. technology industries.\n  Many studies have concluded that the present system of export \ncontrols has the unenviable distinction of harming American private \nenterprise without enhancing our security. At a time when our \ntechnology industries are seeing declining sales--and, indeed, the \ntechnology sector of our economy is in a recession--it is imperative \nthat the Congress remove unnecessary and ineffective barriers to \nexports and, by doing so, help keep technology jobs in our country.\n  Current U.S. policy on export controls is harming good paying jobs \nfor Americans, and it is time that Congress acts to remedy this \nsituation.\n  Existing export controls which aim to keep our computing power out of \nthe hands of potential U.S. adversaries do not work given the \ntechnological and global realities of the 21st century. These policies \nmust be reformed. One may ask why. There are five main reasons. No. 1, \nthey are outdated; No. 2, they are ineffective; No. 3, they are \nunrealistic; No. 4, they are potentially dangerous; and No. 5, these \ncurrent laws are bad economics.\n  Let me expand on that and actually cite some studies that point out \nthe inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of these current laws.\n  They are outdated: The current policy was formulated during the cold \nwar when we once had a very clear adversary, the U.S.S.R., and when \ncomputers were the size of a dorm room.\n  Today's international makeup is much more vague. Our potential \nadversaries or enemies are not as easily identified, and computers are \nnow the size of a large remote control. There are some computers, such \nas Zybernaut's Mobile Assistant, which you can wear on your belt. They \nweigh a couple of pounds at most.\n  The export controls we have now are ineffective. Access to high-\nperformance computing capability cannot be restricted. Almost anyone, \nwhether they are in Vienna or Venezuela or Virginia, can download \ncomputing power off the Internet or link lower level computers together \nto perform certain calculations.\n  These current laws are unrealistic. The United States cannot attempt \nto control access to computer hardware or components when foreign \ncompetitors are producing the same types of technology as domestic \nfirms.\n  In today's global economy, the United States no longer has a clear \nmonopoly on technological innovation. These rules are potentially \ndangerous. By struggling to control access to computers and computer \nhardware that is readily available worldwide, we are diverting \nresources from policing the truly sensitive capabilities. All the \nwhile, our military is way behind the curve when it comes to taking \nadvantage of the very technologies we are trying to restrict.\n  Finally, these current laws are just bad economics. As high-tech \nindustry suffers a dramatic downshift, we are limiting their access to \nthe fastest growing consumer markets in the world. In the new global \neconomy, being first to market is a critical advantage. Currently our \ncompanies are not on a level playing field. This hurts their ability to \nmake inroads into millions of potential new customers, not to mention \nreducing how much U.S. firms can spend on continued R, or research \nand development, to maintain our competitive and innovative leadership.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, the time is right to modernize \nand reform export controls. Leading members of the Senate Banking \nCommittee have worked closely to develop a thoughtful, reasonable \napproach to balancing U.S. national security and economic interests. \nThere is broad bipartisan support for reform, including among the \nnational security establishment.\n  President Bush and his national security advisers, including \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, and Condoleezza Rice, Commerce \nSecretary Don Evans, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, former \nPresident Clinton, four former Secretaries of Defense, the Pentagon, \nthe Defense Science Board, and the General Accounting Office, Democrats \nand Republicans alike, have all drawn the same conclusions: The current \nsystem is broken.\n  For example, under the current law, the President is required to use \nan outmoded standard called MTOPS, millions of theoretical operations \nper second, to measure computer performance and set export control \nthresholds based on country tiers.\n  A recent report on ``Computer Exports and National Security in the \nGlobal Era'' issued by the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies reflects the widespread consensus amongst those in the U.S. \ndefense and security communities that MTOPS-based computer hardware \ncontrols are ``ineffective given the global diffusion of information \ntechnology and rapid increases in performance.''\n  The report explains, for example, while various U.S. computer systems \nare currently subject to controls based on their MTOPS ratings, the \nequivalent computing power can be easily achieved by clustering several \nwidely available low-level systems.\n\n  A recent report from the Department of Defense itself also concludes, \n``MTOPS has lost its effectiveness as a control measure due to rapid \ntechnology advances.'' The General Accounting Office's report to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee similarly concludes that the MTOPS \nstandard is outdated and invalid and the current export control system \nfor high-performance computers which focuses on controlling individual \nmachines is ineffective because it cannot prevent countries of concern \nfrom linking or clustering many lower performance uncontrolled \ncomputers to collectively perform at higher levels than current export \ncontrols allow.\n  The Defense Science Board echoes this same analysis, warning that \n``clinging to a failing policy of export controls has undesirable \nconsequences beyond self-delusion.''\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\n  Finally, a multilateral export control study recently released by the \nsecurity-minded Harry Stimson Center reflects the overall consensus \nview that:\n\n       [T]he system of controlling the export of militarily \n     sensitive goods is increasingly at odds with the world \n     characterized by rapid technological innovation, the \n     globalization of business and the internationalization of the \n     industrial base, including that of defense companies. \n     Although efforts have been made to adapt Cold War processes \n     and regulations to changed circumstances, the current \n     approach to controlling militarily relevant trade has failed \n     to keep pace with changing international conditions and often \n     falls short of adequately protecting U.S. national security \n     interests.\n\n  In effect, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the \nDepartment of Defense, the General Accounting Office, and the Defense \nScience Board all agree that while the most advanced stand-alone high-\nperformance computers may be controllable, high-performance computing \nis not. Thus, by struggling to control the uncontrollable, the Federal \nGovernment is diverting our attention away from the export of truly \nsensitive technologies. By keeping ineffective export controls in \nplace, the Federal Government is restricting U.S. industry's access to \nthe fastest growing consumer markets around the world without achieving \nany significant national security advantage. In the process, the \nFederal Government is creating an unlevel playing field for U.S. \ncompanies and stifling future research and development efforts upon \nwhich U.S. technological and military supremacy demands and depends.\n  For the U.S. computer industry to maintain its preeminence in \ninnovation and business, we must promote policies that encourage \ninvestment in R, not hinder it. S. 149 represents a solid stride \ntoward an export control system that effectively balances our Nation's \neconomic and national security interests.\n  As it relates to computer exports, this bill removes the MTOPS \nregulatory straitjacket and empowers the President, the Secretary of \nCommerce, and the Secretary of Defense to review the national security \ncontrol lists and determine both what computers should be controlled \nand how they may be controlled. The bill does not alter the way in \nwhich computer exports are currently controlled under existing \nregulations. Rather, it simply gives the President, the Secretary of \nCommerce, and the Secretary of Defense the flexibility to reassess the \neffectiveness of these controls in the future, taking into account all \nrelevant risk assessment factors, including the factors affecting an \nitem's controllability, such as foreign availability and mass market \nstatus, as well as other relevant factors such as, in the case of \ncomputers, whether the capability or performance provided by the item \ncan be effectively restricted.\n\n  Passage of S. 149 does not in any way equal decontrol of computer \nhardware sales. Many levels of restrictions will still exist to protect \nU.S. national security interests if the EAA becomes law, such as rogue \ncountry embargoes. Those rogue country embargoes will remain in place, \nand user restrictions will allow the Government to prevent specific \nsale of computer technology to certain organizations or individuals, \nand protections over highly specialized military hardware and software \napplications will still exist.\n  The success of export control efforts depends on vigorous enforcement \nof the law, with meaningful punishment of violators. For many potential \nviolators, the monetary penalties associated with the current Export \nAdministration Act pose no compelling deterrent. The Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Commission noted that under current law, ``an export \ncontrol violator could view the risk and burden of penalty for a \nviolation as low enough to merely be a cost of doing business, to be \nbalanced against the revenue received from an illegal transaction.''\n  The Cox committee recommended that particular attention be given to \nreestablishing higher penalties for export control violations. Toward \nthat end, S. 149 significantly enhances criminal and civil penalties \nfor export control violations.\n  Section 503 of the bill imposes a criminal fine of up to 10 times the \nvalue of the exports or $1 million for each violation, whichever is \ngreater, for willfully violating or willfully conspiring to violate the \nprovisions of S. 149 or any regulation issued under it.\n  In addition, individuals may be imprisoned for a period of up to 10 \nyears, and companies can be fined up to 10 times the value of the \nexport, or $5 million, whichever is greater, for each violation.\n  Additionally, the Secretary of Commerce may impose on a violator, in \naddition to or in lieu of the criminal penalties, a maximum civil fine \nof $500,000 for each export control violation. This bill gives the \nSecretary of Commerce the discretion he or she needs to take into \naccount the aggravating and mitigating factors that may be present in \nany given case.\n\n  Finally, the Government will be able to focus its resources on those \ncritical technologies it must protect, rather than wasting time and \nmoney on the futile exercise of attempting to control access to \ncommodity computing power and technology.\n  I say to Members of the Senate, Senators Enzi, Gramm, and Sarbanes \nhave worked diligently in crafting an outstanding bill. The passage of \nS. 149 is important to the future of national security and economic \ninterests of the people of the United States of America. I thank \nMembers for their efforts and urge support of S. 149.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I held in August, in Reno, NV, a high-tech \ntownhall meeting. I have held a number in Nevada. Although we do not \nmanufacture a lot of computers and computer equipment in Nevada, we \nhave a high-tech industry. There is no issue more important to them \nthan passing this legislation. If it is important to people in the \nhigh-tech industry in Nevada, it is also important in the high-tech \nindustry around the country. I have had numerous calls over the last \nyear and a half from companies around America indicating the importance \nof this legislation. It is high time we did something about this.\n  I applaud and commend Senators Sarbanes and Gramm, the chairman and \nranking member of the committee of jurisdiction, for their advocacy for \nthe last many months on this issue. Of course, members of the \ncommittee, Senators Enzi and Johnson, have worked extremely hard and \nhave done exemplary work in helping move the legislation.\n  I strongly support passage of S. 149. This bill is a product of many \nyears of hard work. A number of people have worked on this. I worked \nwith my friend, Senator Bennett of Utah, on the appropriations level \nmaking sure, especially last year, we had some legislation impacting on \nthis. This bill represents a well-crafted, appropriate balance between \na more modern, effective export control system and the U.S. national \nsecurity interests.\n  I talked about this high-tech meeting held in Reno at the University \nof Nevada. It was a hearing to determine what is going on in Nevada and \naround the country with the high-tech industry. It is very clear at \nthis time in the history of the United States there is hemorrhaging \ntaking place. There are many examples. We have a high-tech company on \nthe front page of the Reno paper today trying to maintain their listing \nwith NASDAQ. One year ago their stock was about $35 a share; it is now \nat 40 cents a share. There are many other examples of this. This is a \nhigh-tech company mentioned on the front page of the Gazette Journal \ntoday. There are companies such as this all over America.\n\n  We as a country need to maintain our competitive edge. If this \nlegislation does not pass, this equipment will be manufactured \nsomeplace else using non-Americans and it will be the same product. We \nneed to do it here. That is what this is about. You can talk about what \npercentage moves through and how little it matters. It is something we \nneed to do. Many business coalitions, including the Computer Systems \nPolicy Project, the Business Roundtable, the American Electronics \nAssociation, the Electronics Industry Association, the Association of \nManufacturing Technology, and the Computer Coalition of Responsible \nExports are supportive of S. 149. Among the members are Apple, AT, \nBoeing, Compaq, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, SGI, Sun \nMicrosystems, Unisys, and United Technology. These are extremely \nimportant businesses in America. They\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\nare important employers in America. They are important on a worldwide \nscene. That they are joining with us in maintaining how important it is \nto pass this legislation says a lot.\n  I throw a bouquet to the Bush administration for having three of \ntheir top Cabinet officers write a letter saying how important this \nlegislation is. It is important. We heard from the Secretary of State, \nthe Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Commerce indicating this \nlegislation is critically important. This is bipartisan legislation.\n  Having worked this floor the past couple years or more, I have never \nseen a piece of legislation with so much support held up by so few \npeople. Everybody wants this to pass. But in the Senate, it is \ndifficult to get this to the point where it will pass. And it will \npass. It will. It is hard to find someone who does not believe the \ncurrent system of export controls in the United States is broken and \nneeds to be fixed. We cannot continue with what we now have.\n  We have four former Secretaries of Defense who support this \nlegislation. The Pentagon supports this legislation. The Defense \nScience Board and General Accounting Office, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, have drawn the same conclusion: Existing export controls aimed \nto keep computing power out of the hands of U.S. adversaries has not \nworked and must be reformed.\n  Why? No. 1, what we have is outdated. Everyone knows how rapidly the \ncomputer industry is changing. In the Clark County Courthouse in Las \nVegas, NV, one floor was dedicated to taking care of the computer needs \nof Clark County. That same work can be done in a very small office now, \nnot one whole floor. We had to have the temperature controlled to a \ncertain degree; no longer is that necessary. In fact, I bet we can do \non my laptop most everything that could be done on the vast floor 25 \nyears ago.\n  This is important. The present law is outdated. The current policy \nwas formulated during the cold war. The cold war is over, when we had \none obvious adversary, when computers were the size of a dorm room, and \nsome the size of dormitories. Today's international makeup is much more \nvague. Potential enemies are not as easily identified, and computers \nare now the size of a remote control for a television set.\n  Another reason we must change this law is the present law is \nineffective. Access to high-performance computing capability cannot be \nrestricted. Anyone, whether Indonesia or Indiana, can download \ncomputing power off the Internet or link lower level computers together \nto form certain calculations. You do not have to have a degree from \nHarvard in computer science to do that. High school kids can do it. \nProbably my grandchildren in the sixth grade can do a lot of this. Why \ndoes the law need to be changed?\n  The current law is unrealistic. The United States cannot attempt to \ncontrol access to computer hardware components when foreign competitors \nare producing the same types of technology as domestic firms. In \ntoday's global economy, the United States no longer has a clear \nmonopoly in technology innovations. We must change because the present \nlaw provides potential dangers. By struggling to control access to \ncomputers and computer hardware that is readily available worldwide, we \nrevert resources from the true areas we need to police. All the while, \nour military is way behind the curve when it comes to taking advantage \nof the very technologies we are trying to restrict.\n\n  Finally, it is just bad economics to keep the present law in force. \nAs the high-tech industry suffers a dramatic downshift, we are limiting \ntheir access to the fastest growing consumer markets in the world. In \nthe new global economy, being first to market is a critical advantage. \nCurrently our companies are not on a level playing field. The computer \nmade in France can get there much quicker than a computer made in the \nUnited States. This hurts our companies' ability to make inroads with \nmillions of potential new customers, not to mention how much U.S. firms \ncan spend on continued R, research and development, to maintain our \ncompetitive and innovative leadership.\n  The current law requires the President to use an outmoded metric, \nMTOPS, which stands for millions of theoretical operations per second--\nMTOPS. The current law requires the President to use MTOPS to measure \ncomputer performance and set computer thresholds based on country \ntiers. What does this mean?\n  A recent report on ``Computer Exports and National Security in the \nGlobal Era'' issued by the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, CSIS, reflects the widespread consensus among those in the \nU.S. defense and security community that MTOPS-based computer hardware \ncontrols are ``ineffective given the global diffusion of information \ntechnology and rapid increases in performance.'' The report continues \nand explains that while various U.S. computer systems are currently \nsubject to controls based on their MTOPS rating, the equivalent \ncomputing power can be easily achieved by clustering several widely \navailable low-level systems: Radio Shack.\n  The conclusion of the CSIS report could not be more clear. No. 1, \nMTOPS are a useless measure of performance; No. 2, MTOPS cannot \ncurrently measure performance of current microprocessors or sources of \nsupercomputering like clustering; and third, this makes MTOPS-based \nhardware controls irrelevant. The best choice is to eliminate MTOPS.\n  This study is only the most recent of a host of export reports to \nidentify the system governing computer exports is broken. A recent \nreport from the Department of Defense concludes, for example, that:\n\n       MTOPS has lost its effectiveness as a control measure . . . \n     due to rapid technology advances.\n\n  On this point, the Department of Defense has emphasized that:\n\n       Controls that are ineffective due to market and technology \n     realities do not benefit national security. In fact, they can \n     harm national security by giving a false sense of protection; \n     by diverting people and other finite export controls \n     resources from areas in which they can be effective; and by \n     unnecessarily impeding the U.S. computer industry's ability \n     to compete in global markets.\n\n  Those who oppose this legislation are living in a dream world, a \nworld of more than two decades ago. In reality, there is every reason \nto pass this legislation. Four Secretaries of Defense, I repeat, \ncurrent Cabinet officers, scientists all over the world--scientists in \nthe United States--America's burgeoning high-tech industry, without \nquestion or qualification, support this legislation.\n  The General Accounting Office's report to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee similarly concluded, with the CSIS report, that the MTOPS \nstandard is ``outdated and invalid'' and:\n\n       The current export control system for high performance \n     computers, which focuses on controlling individual machines, \n     is ineffective because it cannot prevent countries of concern \n     from linking or clustering many lower performance \n     uncontrolled computers to collectively perform at a higher \n     level than current export controls allow.\n\n  Finally, in this regard the Defense Science Board echoes this same \nanalysis, warning that ``clinging to a failing policy of export \ncontrols has undesirable consequences beyond self-delusion.''\n  We could go on literally all afternoon, reading from reports and \nstudies, scientific analysis that says the present system is worthless, \nit is broken; all it does is hurt our economy. It doesn't do anything \nto protect our security. In effect, the Department of Defense, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the Defense Science Board, the Center for \nStrategic International Studies, and a multitude of other entities and \norganizations all agree that while the most advanced stand-alone high-\nperformance computers may be controllable, high-performance computing \nis not.\n  By struggling to control the uncontrollable, we are diverting our \nattention from the export of truly sensitive capabilities. By keeping \nineffective export controls in place, we are unnecessarily restricting \nU.S. industry's access to consumer markets around the world. In the \nprocess, we create an unlevel playing field for U.S. companies and we \nstifle future R efforts on which U.S. technological and military \nsupremacy depends.\n  What does this all mean? Should we throw away any attempt to control \ntechnology and ``sell, sell, sell''? Of course not. We must develop a \nnew,\n\n[[Page S9057]]\n\nmore effective system that better balances our economic priorities with \nnational security interests. S.149 represents a critical step forward \ntoward this very worthwhile goal. As it relates to computer exports, \nthe bill removes the MTOPS straitjacket and empowers the President of \nthe United States, his Secretary of Commerce, and his Secretary of \nDefense to review the National Security Control List and determine both \nwhat computers should be controlled and how they may be controlled.\n\n  This bill does not eliminate controls. It just sets up a modern \nstandard of controlling what we are going to do with exporting \ncomputers. This bill does not--and I think we need to be very clear on \nthis point--alter the way in which computer exports are currently \ncontrolled under existing regulations. Rather, it simply gives the \nPresident, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of Defense the \nflexibility to reassess the effectiveness of these controls in the \nfuture, taking into account all relevant risk assessment factors, \nincluding the factors affecting an item's controllability, such as \nforeign availability, mass market status, as well as other relevant \nfactors such as, in the case of computers, whether the capability of \nperformance provided by that item can be effectively restricted.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, I think has \ndone an excellent job explaining this today. We have a lot of very \ntalented people in the Senate. But as far as your basic intelligence \nand someone who understands what goes on around here, there is no one I \nhave more confidence in than the Senator from Maryland. He is a Rhodes \nscholar in more than name only. He is somebody who is truly very \nintelligent. And when he said today--I talked to him before he came to \nthe floor, and then I heard him say it on on the floor--he read this \nbill from cover to cover, that says a lot. This is a heavy piece of \nlegislation. This is a bill that would take a long afternoon of reading \nif it could be done. It is about 350 pages long. If you wanted to have \nsomebody who knew the bill better than he--and I don't know who that \nwould be--to give him a test on it, either essay or multiple choice, he \nwould pass it with a great score.\n  He has certainly stated on several occasions today, this bill is \ngoing to improve the security of this country and allow our commercial \ninterests to be more competitive. I think it is important we keep that \nin mind. Two considerations: Our security is going to be maintained, \nand we are going to be able to be commercially more effective than we \nhave been. We are going to continue leading the world in selling these \ncomputers that our scientists have developed.\n  The bill we are considering takes all challenges into account and \nwill allow, I repeat, the United States to move forward and formulate \nan export control policy that recognizes the technological, trade, and \npolitical realities of the 21st century. In so doing, this bill will \neffectively promote U.S. economic and national security interests, a \ngoal we should all agree is important.\n  It is not as if computer companies will be able to sell willy-nilly \nto anyone who comes calling in search of, for example, a submarine \ndetection system. This legislation applies several levels of \nrestrictions to protect our national security interests, including, but \nnot limited to, total embargoes on shipping products to rogue nations \nsuch as Iran and Iraq at the present time; end-user restrictions that \nidentify specifically who in certain countries the United States can \nand cannot sell to; and, finally, controls over the most critical \ntechnologies, highly specialized, military-designed software and \nhardware applications.\n  That is pretty strong.\n  By focusing our resources in these areas, instead of wasting our time \nand money on trying to control commercial computing power, the \ngovernment will be able to better keep the most critical applications \nout of the wrong hands.\n  I want to stress to my colleagues that the need for export control \nreform is widely supported.\n  To quote an esteemed member of our country's National Security \ncommunity, former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, ``It's a \nwhole new world. And I think it's past time we respond to that world. \nThe genesis of invention and innovation used to be the military-\nindustrial complex but the government doesn't control technology the \nway it used to.''\n  The bill we are considering takes all of these challenges into \naccount and will allow the United States to move forward and formulate \nan export control policy that recognizes the technological, trade and \npolitical realities of the 21st century.\n  I say again that the Department of Defense, the General Accounting \nOffice, the Defense Science Board and the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies have all concluded that MTOPS is an ``outdated \nand invalid'' metric and that the current system is ineffective. Repeal \nof the National Defense Authorizing Act language would give the \nPresident the flexibility to develop a more modern and effective \nsystem.\n  This is a good bill for Nevada. It is a good bill for the country. It \nis a good bill for the world. I urge my colleagues to follow the lead \nof the managers of this bill, the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, and move forward. Defeat the amendments that will be \noffered by just a small number of Members. Defeat them overwhelmingly. \nThis is important legislation. We need to send a message to the world \nthat we mean business in maintaining our superiority in the production \nof computers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to S. \n149 proposed by the Senator from Tennessee. This amendment contains \nsubstantial changes that will not only upset the delicate balance of \ncontrol between agencies established in S. 149, but it will create a \nburdensome licensing, classification and regulatory process and further \nfuel the turf battles between agencies.\n  This amendment would allow a reviewing agency to stop the clock \nduring the licensing application process ``due to the complexity of the \nanalysis'' or ``because of the potential impact on the national \nsecurity or foreign policy interests of the United States.'' Simply \nput, it would unnecessarily delay licensing decisions and, ultimately, \nreduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports.\n  This amendment is unneeded at best and harmful to national security \nand the economy at worst. The danger of this amendment lies in that it \nwould enable a single agency to delay the approval of a license for up \nto 60 days due to the ``complexity of the analysis.'' Used effectively \nas a delay tactic, a reviewing agency could bury an application in the \n``complex analysis required'' bin and walk away for 2 months. The \nnatural bureaucratic tendency to avoid risk would cause unprocessed \nlicense applications to languish for days weeks or even months without \nany action. This extended delay would not only greatly increase the \noverall processing time, but it could bring the entire process to a \ngrinding halt and destroy an exporters ability to meet market demand \nquickly and efficiently. Furthermore, at this point, the exporter is in \nlimbo, as she or he neither has the approval needed to move forward or \nthe denial needed to make improvements.\n  One exception would allow for 60 days, but there are two exceptions \nin here. So it can be read that an agency would get 120 days by \nutilizing the two exceptions one right after the other.\n  Although proponents argue that this amendment would ensure ample time \nfor the Department of Defense, the Department of State or other \nreviewing agencies to conduct their investigations, it is, in reality, \na solution in search of a problem. Never has there been a case where \nthe Departments of State and Defense have not had enough time to \nadequately review a license application. In fact, Fiscal Year 2000 data \nfrom the Department of Commerce indicates that the average time for the \nreview of a license by the Department of Defense was only 13 days. The \nDepartment of Energy averaged 22 days, while the State Department \naveraged 9 days. All three agencies demonstrated that the 30 days \ncurrently permitted to review a license is more than adequate. \nExporters lose their customers when faced with uncertainty about \ndelivery times. This amendment could place all export licenses in \nvirtual limbo for five\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\nmonths--surely enough time for competitors to easily step in and fill \nour exporters orders.\n  Moreover, any agency that might conceivably require more time to \nreview an application is fully protected under S. 149. First, an agency \nmay exercise any of the carefully thought-out exceptions listed in \nSection 401(g). For example, under Sec. 401(g)(1), the applicant might \nbe willing to provide additional time in order to have a better chance \nat approval. Second, an agency is always free to return a \nrecommendation of disapproval, thereby kicking the application into the \ninteragency dispute resolution process. Third, once within the \ninteragency process, an agency can escalate a decision to a higher \nlevel.\n  Second, the amendment undoes the discipline of the entire system. A \nkey recommendation of the various commissions that have studied our \nexport control system is to increase discipline in the export control \nsystem. Without strict deadlines, discipline disappears. And without \ndiscipline, the system is unworkable. An undisciplined system is the \nsame as no system at all. The consequences for both our national \nsecurity and economic interests would be severe.\n  It was mentioned in the arguments in favor that the Cox commission \nhad taken a look at this and proponents argue that the longer review \nperiods were provided for by the Cox commission.\n  The Banking Committee extensively reviewed the recommendations of the \nCox committee, and indeed adopted virtually all of their dual-use-\nrelated suggestions. Recommendation 31 of the Cox committee did suggest \nlonger review periods for national security purposes. However, the Cox \ncommittee made that recommendation only with regard to items that are \nof the greatest national security concern. For other items, the Cox \ncommittee strongly recommended streamlining the process and providing \ngreater transparency, predictability, and certainty.\n  S. 149 does not classify items as of ``greatest national security \nconcern'' or ``lesser national security concern.'' Instead, it sets up \na risk-based system that allows the administration to make such \ndeterminations within the bill's guidelines. Based on past experience \nand demonstrated agency data, both the administration and the bill \nsponsors believe that S. 149's system--by setting mandatory time \nperiods with the existing ``stop the clock'' exceptions--is the most \neffective framework for operating export controls.\n  In conclusion, this amendment, although it is portrayed as simple and \ncommon-sense, undoes the key element of discipline of S. 149. It would \nresult in a application system bogged down by bureaucracy and politics, \na system in which delays are the rule rather than the exception. It is \nnot simple or technical, but would undo the careful balance of the \nbill. I urge its rejection.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleagues for being \nlate; I was busy on a matter important to my State. I wanted to come \nover today both to oppose the amendment that is before us and to speak \non behalf of the bill itself. Let me do those in reverse order.\n  First of all, our colleagues can be proud of the fact that the bill \nbefore us today is truly bipartisan, and I want to congratulate Senator \nSarbanes for his leadership on this bill, both as chairman of the \nBanking Committee now and as ranking member when the bill was \noriginally written. I also want to thank Senator Johnson and Senator \nEnzi for their leadership on this bill.\n  This bill tries to deal with an inherent conflict that we face as a \nnation. On the one hand, we want to be the greatest technological giant \nin the world. We want to dominate the world in producing everything \nthat embodies new technology because the country that controls that \ntechnology ultimately dominates the world economically. It has the \nhighest wages, and the brightest future. So, we have not only a goal \nbut a passion to see that when new tools are produced, when new \ntechnology is implemented in the marketplace, that it is American \ntechnology, implemented by Americans.\n\n  We are the most technologically and scientifically friendly society \nin history, which is one of the reasons we are the greatest country in \nthe history of the world. This bill is very much about that, but it is \nalso about our other objective, which is to try to see, to the maximum \nextent we can, that new technology does not get into the hands of those \nwho would use it to harm America or her interests and to engage in \nterrorist activities around the world. And that is the inherent \nconflict between these two goals.\n  What this bill is trying to do is to find a way to deal with this \ninherent conflict. I personally believe, after having now spent some \n2\\1/2\\ years working on this bill, that we have come to a good \nsolution. We have come as close as you can come to reconciling these \ndifferences. Let me try to explain how.\n  I know some of our colleagues are concerned that we have gone too far \nin trying to promote American sales of technologically advanced \nproducts. I believe, upon close scrutiny of this bill, objective \nobservers will conclude that charge is not true. This bill tries to \nrecognize something that we do not like to admit but that everybody has \nto admit is true: if a technology is generally available, if you can go \nto Radio Shack and buy something, if it is mass marketed all over the \nworld--it may have defense implications; it may be something you would \nwant to prevent a terrorist or terrorist state from getting--but if \nsomething is mass marketed, then would-be terrorists can go to Radio \nShack and buy it. Would-be terrorist nations could get access to \nsomething that is mass marketed.\n  One of the great strengths of the bill is that we introduce a new \nconcept into American law--the concept of mass marketing. What we say \nis, if a technology is available on a mass market basis, if you can buy \nit all over the world, it is too late to protect it. So we propose \nbuilding a higher wall around a smaller number of items. That is the \nlogic of this bill. It is a very simple logic.\n  The second component of the bill recognizes that it is very difficult \nto prove somebody knowingly sold or transferred technology that is \nprotected. And since it is very difficult to prove that--very difficult \nto catch bad actors--we want the penalties to be extraordinarily stiff. \nPenalties in current law are so small as to be irrelevant to a modern \ncorporate entity.\n  Our penalties, which can run into the tens and hundreds of millions \nof dollars, can, for repeat offenses and a pattern of behavior, result \nin imprisonment or life imprisonment or penalties that affect anybody's \nbehavior.\n  So we build a higher wall around a smaller number of items. We \nrecognize it is certainly true that you can go into any Radio Shack and \nbuy a computer that is more powerful than the most powerful computer \nthat existed in the world when I was a college professor.\n  I remember running multiple regressions which people now run on \ncalculators. I had these punchcards that had all this data--more \nprecious than life, almost. You would tote big boxes of these \npunchcards over to the computer center at 4:30 in the morning. They had \nan entire building that had an analog computer--an entire building. And \nit had so little storage capacity that my little multiple regression \ntook the entire memory of the entire computer. And this whole building \nwas devoted to running this computer. Now any college student taking \ncollege statistics can perform the same transaction on a modern \ncalculator.\n\n  Obviously modern technology can be put to defense use. But the point \nis, if our purpose is just to feel good, then we could do a lot of \ndifferent things. But in writing this bill, we want to have a \nmeaningful impact in the law. So for technologies that are readily \navailable, that can be purchased anywhere, we decided to take them off \nthe list of restricted export items.\n  We have put together a system where the security agencies have the \nstrongest voice they have ever had in the process. We have put together \na procedure whereby an agency that has doubt can buck the decision up \nto a higher level, if they can get approval by a Senate-confirmed \nperson in their department.\n  We make it easier to say no. We give the President an all-\nencompassing power: if the President of the United States, having \nreviewed all the data,\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nconcludes that the sale of an item represents a national security \nthreat, no matter whether it is mass marketed or anything else, then \nthe President can intervene and say no. Now, the President himself has \nto do it. This cannot be delegated to somebody else, removing the \nPresident's responsibility to answer whether it is wise or promotes the \npublic interest. That is the basic structure of this bill.\n  This bill is strongly supported by the administration. It is \nsupported by the Defense Department. It embodies the recommendations \nfrom the Cox Commission, whose key recommendation was that Congress \nquit trying to do things that only make it look as if it is concerned \nabout national security, and instead focus on national security. We \nhave done that.\n  Some of our colleagues have concerns. I am hopeful, perhaps as early \nas in the morning, that I will get a chance to sit down with them to \nsee whether, even at this late date, we might work something out that \ncould give them greater confidence in what we are doing. But \nregardless, we have a good bill. It is a bill the country needs, and it \nis important.\n  Let me add, my trusty staff has just passed me a note reminding me \nthat we made no less than 59 changes in trying to deal with the \nconcerns some of our colleagues raised in the last Congress. It is not \nas if the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and I \nhave been deaf in terms of listening to their concerns. We have \nlistened to them, and we have responded. We have made 59 changes in the \nbill and worked with the previous administration. And when the new \nadministration came, we gave the bill to them, and they made suggested \nchanges which we made. So, I think we have tried to work with \neverybody. But the point is, we are not through working. If we can \nimprove the bill, we want to do it.\n  Let me address a central point, though. I think it is important that \npeople understand the logic of the bill. I then want to talk very \nbriefly about the Thompson amendment.\n  Ultimately, you have to ask yourself a question: Is America's \nsecurity enhanced by our being the dominant economic power in the world \nthat generates the great bulk of modern technology and that implements \nit first? Or could we promote our national security by freezing things \nas they are, by stopping the production and the export and the \nutilization of technology that might in the future have national \nsecurity ramifications?\n  Some people still seem to have this vision of the Cold War--that Ivan \nis at the gate, that technology is coming out of defense research \nestablishments and into the American private sector, and then into the \nworld private sector, and it is then absorbed by would-be adversaries.\n  The plain truth is, that concept of the world is no longer valid. \nMost of the modern technology is coming from the private sector. In a \nsense, we are back to where we were in World War I, where one of the \nthings we tried to do was take modern technology and implement it for \nmilitary use. Then, as we developed what Eisenhower called the military \nindustrial complex and redeveloped basically this university defense \nindustry consortium, it was the engine for new technology.\n  But today technology comes from the private sector, from \ninternational companies. If we don't let them implement the technology \nand put it to work and produce products here, they will produce them \nelsewhere. The net result is that we will have less control than we do \nnow.\n  Ultimately, the security of America is based on our ability to \nproduce new technology, not on the technology that exists today. It is \nbased on the technology we are going to generate in the future and that \nwe are going to implement before anyone else. The only way we can keep \nthat system intact is by allowing American industry to use modern \ntechnology.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1481\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Thompson amendment on its face looks desirable. But in \nreality, it assaults a system that we have put into place that forces a \ndecision. Let's say I am Texas Instruments, and I want to export a \ntechnology. I have to file an application. Now, if I can prove that the \ntechnology is mass marketed that it is readily available or if we find \nthat the technology is going to be mass marketed in the future, then \nall of those factors can come into play in making the export decision. \nBut if at any point in the process an official believes there is a \nnational security concern, then all he has to do is say no.\n  The only thing that any one person on the whole panel representing \nall of these national security agencies--the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of State, the Department of Commerce--has to do to stop the \nprocess is to utter the magic word ``no.'' And when they say no, the \nprocess is stopped, and the decision can be appealed to the next \nhighest level--ultimately, to the President himself. But there is no \nlack of ability to stop a sensitive product from being exported.\n  What I am concerned about--I have no question in my mind whatsoever \nof the good intent of this amendment--is that if we make it easy to not \nsay ``no'' but just say ``let's wait,'' if we make it easy for someone \nto avoid making a decision, no politician and nobody governed by \npoliticians will ever make a hard decision as long as there is any \nviable alternative. That is a chiseled-in-stone law of public behavior. \nAnd if we make it possible for people to delay because it is complex or \nbecause they say it has the potential of having national security \ninterest, then what is going to happen? The whole process is going to \nget tied up. This bill, which tries to achieve a delicate balance \nbetween jobs and security, will end up being destroyed.\n\n  I want my colleagues to know, in asking them to vote against this \namendment, that any representative of any agency who is serving on the \nreview panel has a right to stop the process by saying no. What they \ndon't have the right to do is to say: Well, let's think about this for \n6 months, or let's wait for a year while some foreign competitor is \ndeveloping the same technology. They have to say yes or no, but they \ncan say no.\n  Secondly, I remind my colleagues that in part in response to concerns \nthat were raised by Senator Thompson and others, we put a Presidential \nwaiver in the bill where the President. Even if the review process says \nyes, even if under the law the export is exempt from the review, if the \nPresident finds that the product poses a national security concern, \nthen the President has the right to intervene.\n  Some people are going to say: Well, you made it so the President \ncan't use it because how can the President do all these things? But we \nalready know that the President doesn't do all these things. The \npractical implication of this waiver is that when a process is stopped \nthat has otherwise been approved or that would otherwise be exempt, the \ndecision is not going to be made by a deputy assistant secretary in the \nCommerce Department or an unknown person in the Defense Department. The \nperson who will have to answer to the public for the decision is the \nPresident.\n  What does that do? It guarantees that the agency representatives are \nnot going to make this decision to circumvent the process for a light \nor transient reason. But if the President believes, based on the best \nadvice he is given, that the product should not be exported, then the \ndecision is made and it is not exported.\n  I do believe we have put together a good system of checks and \nbalances. The Thompson amendment makes it too easy to bail out of the \nsystem. An agency representative can always say no if he objects, but \nwhat he cannot do is cause delay after delay. That is what we are \ntrying to deal with here, and I hope my colleagues will vote no on the \nThompson amendment.\n  Let me repeat, since I see that our distinguished colleague has come \nto the Chamber, I am hopeful we can get together, perhaps in the \nmorning, with those who still have concerns about the bill to see if \nthere is anything we can do to deal with those concerns. I know some \nsuggestion has been made that we might have a blue ribbon panel to \nevaluate the entire process. I haven't talked to Chairman Sarbanes in \nany detail about that. But I think that is something we would be \nwilling to look at as an addition to what we are doing.\n  What we want to do is pass a good bill that I believe America needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I take this opportunity while Senator \nGramm is still with us on the floor to depart from the debate on S. 149 \nfor a moment and say a few words about my very able and distinguished \ncolleague who announced earlier this afternoon that he will not be \nseeking re-election next year in 2002. I think that comes as a surprise \nto many of us. We heard the stories, but no one ever assumed they would \namount to anything. All of a sudden, they have.\n  I just want to say a few words about our working relationship and \nalso, of course, to wish Senator Gramm the very best. I know that this \ndecision was influenced by his desire, in a sense, to begin a new \ncareer and by some family considerations. Of course, I respect those. \nObviously his presence here in the Senate--a very strong presence, I \nmight observe--will be missed post-2002 or post-January 3, 2003.\n  Just as we are co-managing this reauthorization of the Export \nAdministration Act today, I think we have accomplished a great deal \nworking together in our respective roles on the Senate Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee.\n  Senator Gramm was Chairman of the Committee from January 1999 to June \n2001. I have to say that virtually every major piece of legislation \nthat came out of our Committee came out either unanimously or very \nclose to it with one exception. We had a big dust-up, as it were, over \nthe financial services modernization bill, essentially over the CRA \nprovisions.\n  We subsequently worked it out with the Administration and the bill \nfinally passed on the Senate floor in November of 1999 by a vote of 90-\n8. In the end, we found our way through and reached an understanding \nand an accommodation.\n  I want to acknowledge Senator Gramm for his leadership during his \nchairmanship on the following bills: the Competitive Market Supervision \nAct, the International Monetary Stability Act, the Manufactured Housing \nImprovement Act, and the Public Utility Holding Company Act. In the \narea of housing and urban affairs, we have passed into law elderly \nhousing legislation; reforms to the rural housing program; and reforms \nto the Native American housing program. This year we passed Market-to-\nMarket reform and reauthorization legislation through the Committee. \nThe President also signed into law the Iran-Libya Sanctions Extension \nAct on August 3, 2001. I think the Committee has had a very good track \nrecord under his leadership in the last Congress and at the beginning \nof this Congress.\n  I also want to acknowledge that without Senator Gramm's active \nleadership on the Export Administration Act, we actually would not be \non the floor today. I also look forward to working closely with him on \nthe reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and the Defense \nProduction Act.\n  I have to say we are going to miss Senator Gramm. I think that is \nobvious. I want to say that despite what the President wanted to report \nabout our working relationship, I think we have had a very positive and \nconstructive relationship. It happens that we differ from time to time \non an issue--but what is this place about if it doesn't allow room for \nthose sorts of differences? Yet as I indicated, in virtually every \ninstance we were able to accommodate those differences, work through \nthem in a rational fashion, and reach good decisions on behalf of the \npublic.\n  I know of the determination and commitment with which Senator Gramm \nhas represented the people of Texas as one of their two U.S. Senators \nin this body. I know of his own very strong commitment to a peaceful \nand prosperous America, and his keen interest in economic policy. We \nhave had a lot of very good discussions in the Committee on that very \nsubject. I didn't want the occasion of his announcement just a little \nearlier this afternoon to pass without taking the floor and making a \nfew comments. I look forward to continuing to work very closely and \ncooperatively with Senator Gramm over the balance of this year and all \nof next year. I hope we can continue to cooperate together and do good \nthings for the country. I say this to my colleague with all respect and \naffection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that I appreciate Senator \nSarbanes' remarks. When your mama says something nice about you, people \nexpect it. I do think Senator Sarbanes is correct, and I don't think I \nwill do him any harm in Maryland by saying that he and I differ on a \nlot of subjects. In fact, it might well help him politically by saying \nthat. But when we ended up running the Banking Committee--Senator \nSarbanes as a Democrat and me as a Republican--everybody assumed that \npeople who differed on as many issues as we differed on would never get \nanything done. I appreciate very much his kind comments, and I \nappreciate his pointing out the plain truth, which is that we have \ngotten a near record amount done. We have achieved that by recognizing \nthat under our system you get things done by working with people \ninstead of running over people. I have been chairman and Senator \nSarbanes has been chairman, and I assume he will be chairman for the \nremainder of my time, but you never know. Maybe Senator Reid will have \na change of heart and decide to come join us. Who knows?\n  In any case, I am very proud of our record, and I am very proud to \nhave Senator Sarbanes' friendship. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may take a minute, I have been \nfortunate in the last 3 years or so to spend most of my time here on \nthe floor. Every time Senator Gramm of Texas comes to the floor I \nalways anticipate a good experience. I may not agree with what he is \nsaying, but nobody is more in tune with the subject matter and more \nentertaining than Senator Gramm.\n  I have not served on committees with Senator Gramm. He served in the \nHouse, as I did, and we have served in the Senate together. We have \nnever worked on committees together, as you do a lot of times, where \nyou really get to know people. But I have gotten to know Phil Gramm by \nvirtue of the fact that I have such great respect for what he says. I, \nlike Senator Sarbanes, don't agree all the time with what he says, but \nI have to tell you I have great appreciation for the way Senator Gramm \nsays it and the fact that he is a man of conviction. He talks about \nwhat he believes is the way it should be.\n  He is a person who got an education not in an easy fashion. Senator \nGramm may not want a lot of people to know, but I have heard him saying \nthis, so I am not speaking out of school. He had some learning \ndisabilities. Yet he turned out to be one of the finest scholars Texas \nhad and one of the finest scholars the Senate has ever had. He is a \nPh.D., a professor.\n  I am going to enjoy very much the next 18 months with Senator Gramm, \nas I have the prior 19 years or so I have spent in Washington with him. \nBut there will never be another Phil Gramm. He is one of a kind. He has \nreally dedicated his life to public service, for which I have no doubt \nthe State of Texas is a better place.\n  Phil Gramm is virtually unbeatable in Texas. It is bad news for the \npeople of the State of Texas that he is leaving. The good news for us \nin Washington is that he is leaving and we are going to have an \nopportunity to take the Senate seat. We could never do that with \nSenator Gramm here. We know it is an uphill battle he left there.\n  I wish words could connote the warm feeling that I have for Phil \nGramm. I just think the world of him. I like him a lot. He is a fine \nperson, and I hope his family is proud of him and also the people of \nTexas, as they should be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I suppose I am going to have to say \nsomething nice about Senator Gramm. In all honesty, I have a tremendous \namount of admiration for Senator Gramm, and it was with great sadness \nthat I learned a short time ago he decided not to run again. Regardless \nof what anybody else does here, I think this institution needs a Phil \nGramm. The institution is going to have to come up with another one \nnow, it looks like. But the institution has been better for his having \nbeen here.\n  I know of no one who has more intellectual honesty and who is more \nfearless in the pursuit of the things in which he believes. More often \nthan not,\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\nthey are the things in which I believe. But that is almost beside the \npoint. I want to express publicly to him my tremendous admiration for \nhim and for the service he has rendered the State of Texas and our \ncountry.\n  I will yield to anyone else at any time who wants to speak to this \nsubject. But if not, I will continue on with the business at hand. I \nbelieve Senator Enzi wants to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is with a lot of regret and sadness that \nI learned of this decision this afternoon. I came to the Senate just \n4\\1/2\\ years ago, which would be about the equivalent of the college \ndegree.\n  During that time, I have gotten to study under Phil Gramm. There have \nbeen a lot of times that I really thought I ought to be paying him \ntuition. It has been a tremendous educational process. If we could just \nget him to be a little more outspoken.\n  I do recall he said when he retires he is going to retire to a town \nin the United States that does not have a single traffic light. I \nassume there are still some of those in Texas. If there are not, \nWyoming would welcome the Senator with open arms. We would love to have \nhim there and, of course, we are looking forward to the game against \nhis alma mater, Texas A, the team the Senator follows day in and day \nout, and we are looking forward to a good contest.\n  I thank the Senator for all of the instruction that he has given, for \nthe education he has provided for America. I have appreciated the \nstands he has taken and the ferocity with which he has taken them. \nThanks again for the education.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Thank you, Mike.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote \nin relation to the Thompson amendment No. 1481 at 5:15 p.m. today, with \nno second-degree amendments in order to the Thompson amendment; that \nprior to the vote there be 4 minutes for debate equally divided in the \nusual form, with no other intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. So we will vote at 5:15 on this amendment that we are \ndiscussing right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I will address the issue concerning the \namendment I have submitted having to do with the amount of time \nagencies would have to consider a license application. This amendment \nprovides additional exceptions from acquired time periods for \nprocessing license applications if the reviewing agency requires more \ntime due to the complexity of the analysis or if the reviewing agency \nrequires additional time based on the potential impact of the export on \nnational security or foreign policy interests of the United States. It \nlimits any additional time to not more than 60 days.\n  In other words, what this amendment does--first of all, as it is \ncurrently drafted, it gives an agency 30 days to look over this license \napplication and to come to a decision as to whether or not it wants to \ngo along with it or try to oppose it. If the agency is not heard from \nwithin 30 days, then it is deemed the agency waives its rights and the \nagency approves it.\n  What this amendment does is it takes a particular set of \ncircumstances where there are national security implications; in other \nwords, the Department of Defense takes a look at something and says: \nPerhaps this is a very complex application, and it very well may have \nnational security implications. We simply cannot get this done in 30 \ndays. We need additional time.\n  As to the Cox Commission, I hope my friends who are sponsoring this \nlegislation will not choose the Cox Commission as authority when it \nchooses and ignore the Cox Commission when it makes recommendations \nthat oppose it because the Cox Commission concluded in its \ndetermination that there were undue time pressures brought to bear on \nthese agencies sometimes. We needed to get the merchandise out the door \nwhen these agencies were trying to make these national security \ndeterminations, so they came up with recommendations that are \nconsistent with what we are talking about here.\n  The amendment was accepted unanimously by voice vote in the House \nInternational Relations Committee markup of the Export Administration \nAct. The Cox Commission recommended this: With respect to those \ncontrolled technologies and items that are of greatest national \nsecurity concern, current licensing procedures should be modified to \nprovide longer review periods when deemed necessary by the reviewing \nexecutive department or agency on national security grounds.\n  I have heard it said this is when there is great national security \nconcern.\n  As I indicated, the Cox committee recommended additional time be \ngiven under appropriate circumstances, and these are appropriate \ncircumstances. Opponents of this amendment say these are just \ncircumstances where there is substantial national security concern.\n  I ask my colleagues, how do we know whether or not there is a \nsubstantial national security concern if the agencies that are \ndetermining that do not have sufficient time enough to investigate it? \nAre we going to decide if the Department of Defense believes it needs \nadditional time and believes there may be national security concerns? \nAre we going to cut them off prematurely because they cannot make out a \nprima facie case at that point?\n  Should they not, as the agency dealing with this and having the \nexpertise, be given, in a matter of national security--as we are trying \nto get the merchandise out the door, let us remember what we are \ntalking about--national security. Do we not let the Department of \nDefense have a little additional time to make sure we are not sending \nsomething dangerous to somebody dangerous?\n  I do not fully appreciate the talk of the balance between jobs and \nsecurity. We are not dealing with a jobs bill. We are dealing with a \nbill that is designed to protect national security. We are not \nbalancing off how much money somebody could make. Three percent of our \ntotal exports are exports to these controlled companies, so we are \ntalking about most all of them are approved. We are talking about a \nfraction of 3 percent.\n  They have a very effective lobby and they have been doing their job \nwell, but let us not lose sight of the smallness of the exports we are \ntalking about in terms of the total economic picture. Even if it were \nlarge, I would think the same way about it. If we want to talk about a \nbalance or a tradeoff, are we not willing to trade off a fraction of 3 \npercent over against, say, the Department of Defense when it has a \nnational security concern, having an additional 60 days to take a look \nat it? Are we that eager to get the merchandise out the door when we \nare being told on a regular basis these rogue nations are developing \nthis additional technology; that they are developing weapons of mass \ndestruction; that China and Russia are supplying them with technology \nthat will assist them in their weapons of mass destruction; that China, \nwhich will greatly benefit from this bill, is taking our technology and \nusing it for military purposes; when our commissions and agencies are \ntelling us in their reports, whether it be Rumsfeld, Deutch, or our own \nintelligence agencies that report on a biannual basis, that these \nthreats are growing and that they are using American technology; when \nwe hear things like Saddam Hussein has been furnished by a Chinese \ncompany with technology that will assist him in his fiber optic cable \nnetwork that will actually assist him in shooting down American \nairplanes--we have caught him twice at it now--and it is being supplied \nby a company that has a relationship with a company in the United \nStates?\n  I hope if one of our boys gets shot down over there it is not \ndetermined it is with American technology. It is not farfetched. I am \nnot claiming I can suggest anything that would forever prohibit that, \nbut we can surely give the Department of Defense an extra 60 days if it \nbelieves it has a national security concern.\n  We have gotten past, I suppose, the debate on things such as foreign \navailability. We are going to have somebody down in the bowels of the \nDepartment of Commerce determine all that needs to be deregulated and \nit is out the door; anything they say is foreign\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\navailable. Mass marketing: Somebody within the bowels of the Department \nof Commerce decides it is mass marketed so all of that goes out the \ndoor. Embeded components: If something is regulated and considered to \nbe sensitive because it can be used potentially for military purposes, \nit is regulated, you have to have a license. But if somebody puts it in \na bigger component, you do not have to have a license for it or the \nbigger component if the bigger component is worth more than 75 percent \nof the total value of what is being shipped. It makes no sense at all. \nIt makes no national security sense. It might make economic sense for \nsome folks. But all that is by the board. We passed that. We will do \nthat and tell the President, catch him if you can, fixing it so the \nPresident can't delegate any of this. The President has to make the \ndetermination that he wants to come in with oversight action that will \ngo against this entire regulatory process when we have thousands of \nthese applications a year. We are not going to be able to do anything \nwith that. The train left the station. I can count votes.\n\n  Apparently, we have decided in this Nation to turn a blind eye to the \nproliferation activities in this world, to the fact that we are now \nsubject to being hit from some of the smaller rogue nations, countries \nthat are starving their own people to death, putting their money into \nmissile and nuclear capability, to now hit us, our allies, or our \ntroops in the field, and we are opening the door wider to send stuff to \ncountries that are supplying the rogue nations. We have apparently made \nthat decision.\n  For goodness' sake, can't we give the Department of Defense a little \nmore time when they are asking us to hold up a little bit and make sure \nwe are not hurting our country? Do we have to draw the line at an \nadditional 60 days for that kind of consideration? If we can't do this, \nwe might as well fold up our tent and do anything that exporters want \nto do. I don't see why we ought to have an export process anymore. It \nclearly will not be designed to protect this country, which was its \noriginal design.\n  I hope history does not prove this is an even more unwise decision \nthan I fear it might be. The cold war certainly is over, and it has \nleft a country that is more vulnerable than ever to our own technology. \nMost of it we are not dealing with today. We are not dealing with \nnontechnology matters. We are dealing with limited items in a very \nnarrow regulatory process. We approve 98 percent of them anyway, even \nin the regulatory process. The average time it takes is 40 days. We \ncan't stop and take a deep breath long enough to make sure we are not \nhurting our country, when it takes 40 days on average to get this done? \nAnd the overwhelming majority are already approved.\n  We need to reauthorize the Export Administration Act. We need to \ntighten it up, instead of loosening it. But that will not happen. It \nwill be loosened. I ask, can't we at least consider the agencies \ninvolved, as the Cox commission suggested?\n  It has been said if there is a national security concern, they can \nraise it later in the review process. If the Department of Defense has \nnot had time to adequately investigate the matter, it is already in the \ninteragency review process and they will not have the information on \nwhich to base an objection. Do we want to force the process along so \nfast we ensure the Department of Defense or the affected agency does \nnot have sufficient time to make an objection, had they known the full \nextent of the nature of the export and perhaps the end user and how it \nwould be used and the potential uses for it?\n  We may have to go down this road, but we don't have to get in the \njetstream. We don't have to do it with blinders. I suggest this is a \nminimalist amendment that we would want to pass to benefit the process \nand to show the world we are not so intent on trade and money that we \nwill not even take modest measures to make sure we are not making a \nmistake with regard to something important to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. While the parties have been speaking, and we have been in \ncontact with the White House to see how difficult the time schedule in \nthe S. 149 bill would be to meet, I have been told there is no problem \nmeeting those time schedules, that the agencies can do that, the \nagencies have done that; that the records show they have been able to \nmeet those time deadlines, and the administration is opposed to this \namendment.\n  This amendment allows the reviewing agency to stop the clock during \nthe licensing application process. One of our difficulties in arriving \nat a bill has been to eliminate turf battles. The agencies are working \nvery cooperatively, but there is the potential of who will be in charge \nof what and how long the delay and who can cause them, which changes \nthe balance between the agencies. This bill has that balance between \nagencies.\n  The agencies agree--and there will be a letter on everyone's desk--\nthat they have the capability of operating 60 days under this bill. \nThis bill does not just give 60 days. It could give 120 days the way it \nis written, which in addition to the 30 is 150 days for a process that \nhas been workable in less than 30 days by each of the three main \nagencies that have been reviewing the bill.\n  Under this amendment, a single agency could further delay the \napproval of the license based on the complexity of analysis and then \npotentially use the other excuse to delay it another 60 days. The bill \nalready provides for several different ways to stop the clock on any \nbill. The license applicant and the Secretary of Commerce mutually \nagree more time is necessary to process the application, or if more \ntime is needed to verify and identify the reliability of an end user, \nor if additional time is necessary to secure government to government \nassurances regarding item end use, or if more time is required for \nmultilateral review if applicable or if additional time is needed to \nallow for congressional notification, if that is required, if more time \nis necessary to permit consultation with foreign governments, then, of \ncourse, we have the essential provisions of the bill. First, an agency \ncould exercise any of these thought-out exceptions that are very \ncarefully defined in the bill. The two provisions in this amendment are \nnot carefully defined. So they give a very broad, general, bureaucratic \napproach that allows people to pigeon hole a bill and walk away from it \nfor at least 60 to 120 days. They could use the carefully thought-out \ndefined provisions in section 401(g).\n  Second, any of the agencies are free to return a recommendation of \ndisapproval. That kicks the application into the interagency dispute \nresolution process which would give additional time for the review.\n  Third, once within the interagency process, the agency can escalate a \ndecision to the higher level.\n  In practicality, after you and I have watched the process, Mr. \nPresident, and seen how it works, it also works if the agency calls and \nsays we can give you a disapproval right now unless you can provide \nadditional time or information. That same process is an effective way \nof stopping the clock, provided the application doesn't have to go back \nto ground zero when it comes back in again. That is a mechanism that \nhas been used.\n  This amendment unravels the discipline of the system that has been \nset out. With its capability of escalating clear up to the President, \nthere is a recognition that this can take a lot more time. That is how \nthe time element was addressed under the recommendations we had from \nthe different commissions.\n  A key recommendation of the various commissions that study our export \nsystem is to increase the discipline in the export system. Without \ndeadlines, discipline disappears. Without discipline, the system is \nunworkable. An undisciplined system is the same as no system at all. \nThe consequences for both our national security and economic interests \nwould be severe.\n  My colleague mentioned the Cox report. The Cox report was done before \nS. 149 was done, or even S. 1712 was done. We reviewed those \nrecommendations. Recommendation No. 31 did suggest longer review \nperiods for national security purposes. The Cox Commission made that \nrecommendation only with items that are of the greatest national \nsecurity concern. For other items, the Cox Commission strongly \nrecommended streamlining the process and providing greater \ntransparency,\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\npredictability, and certainty. We did that, plus building into the \nsystem this system of referrals, that easier process of resolving \ninteragency disputes or interagency concerns, the ability to escalate \nin the process. So that got built into the system at the same time, \nwhich answers some of those concerns.\n  S. 149 does not classify items as being ``of greatest national \nsecurity concern'' or ``of lesser national security concern.'' It sets \nup a risk-based system that allows the administration to make such \ndeterminations within the bill's guidelines. Based on past experience \nand demonstrated agency data, both the administration and the bill's \nsponsors believe that S. 149's system, by setting mandatory time \nperiods with the existing ``stop the clock'' exceptions, is the most \neffective framework for operating export controls. For that reason, the \nbill does not include that particular and specific aspect of the Cox \nCommission recommendation.\n  This amendment, although it is portrayed as simple and common sense, \nundoes the key element of the discipline in S. 149. It would result in \nan application system bogged down by bureaucracy and politics, a system \nin which delays are the rule rather than the exception. It is not a \nsimple or technical change but would undo the careful balance of the \nbill.\n  I have mentioned what can be a tendency. What we tried to do with the \nbill was escalate the decisions up to the higher levels of government \nrather than have the decisions made at the bureaucratic level. We have \ntried to eliminate possibilities that, rather than make a decision, \npeople would pigeonhole things. This is one of those opportunities to \npigeonhole things for 60 to 120 days, with an undefined but good-\nsounding concern.\n  I do urge rejection of this amendment and ask colleagues on behalf of \nthe administration to join me in that rejection.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I had indicated earlier that I wanted to \nspeak in favor of the Thompson amendment. I do that at this time.\n  It has been explained by the Senator from Tennessee. The point is, \nthere are some matters that would be very complicated, very complex. \nEveryone acknowledges that. It may be that a 30-day time for review in \nthat circumstance would be inadequate.\n  All this amendment does is to say that the department, in that case, \ncould ask for an additional period of time, up to 60 days, to review \nand be able to make its recommendation for export license under the \nlegislation.\n  This was the recommendation of the Cox committee report in 1999, when \nit indicated that the existing 30-day limit for departmental license \nreview may be inadequate for complex requests that could have a lasting \nnational security impact. And since the legislation before us allows \nonly for extensions on a limited basis, and we think that it would be \nappropriate, for, for example, the Defense Department, should it deem \nit necessary to have a little more time, that that at least be written \ninto the bill as a possibility. That is what Senator Thompson has \nsought to accomplish through his amendment. It seems to me to be \neminently reasonable. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this \nvery reasonable amendment.\n  The primary argument I have heard about it relates to a political \nmatter; that is, that the White House supports the legislation. We have \nbeen advised that the White House supports the legislation without \nchange. I want to comment on that a moment.\n  My friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, the Senator from \nMaryland, for example, in response to something I said earlier, wanted \nto be sure I was aware of the administration's support. Indeed, I was. \nI would like to make this offer to any of my Democratic colleagues. I \nwill support this legislation based upon the fact that the \nadministration supports it if my Democratic colleagues will commit to \nme today that they will do the same for legislation that the \nadministration supports.\n  In other words, if I can get a letter from the Secretary of Defense \nor the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of State on a matter that \nwill come before the Senate in the future, since they regard the \nadministration so highly with respect to the EAA and suggest that is \nthe reason why this legislation should be adopted without change, then \nit seems to me, unless they are picking and choosing which opinion of \nthe administration they regard so highly, they should also regard \nhighly other opinions of the administration and be equally willing to \nsupport those positions.\n  I am sure that as Senators we all like to pick and choose the things \non which we agree or don't agree with any administration. I am a \nRepublican. I happen to have a disagreement with the administration now \nand then--not very often; in fact, very seldom. On this matter I do \nhave some disagreement.\n  I think it is not a sufficient argument in and of itself to say that \nbecause the administration supports something, therefore we should vote \nfor it and then turn around on a subsequent matter which the \nadministration strongly supports and vote against them. I suspect that \nmy Democratic friends more often than not will find themselves in that \nposition in the future.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Earlier in the day when I first spoke on this bill, I \ndon't think the Senator was in the Chamber. I was very careful to make \nthe point that I supported this bill on the basis of my own judgment \nabout its contents. I then went on to add the point that the \nadministration was supportive of this bill, and obviously one finds \nsome comfort in that since much of what is in the bill involves the \nexecutive branch making it work. So particularly on a bill such as \nthis, if they were against it, that would give one pause for thought.\n  I simply say to my colleague, it is a very interesting challenge he \nputs forward. Without anticipating that he would make such a challenge, \nI was very careful in my opening statement to make the point that my \nsupport for the bill was based on my own judgment about its provisions \nhaving worked through it very carefully. Over and above that judgment, \nI also, of course, alluded to the fact that the administration was very \nsupportive of it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I very much appreciate that comment from the \nSenator from Maryland because that is the basis on which we should \napproach this legislation--our own evaluation. I know that because of \nthe Senator's work on this issue. Prior to the strong expressions from \nthe administration, the Senator from Maryland was very supportive of \nthe legislation. I know that he is very truthful in what he just said. \nI appreciate that. That is the position each of us should take with \nrespect to legislation regardless of which administration is in power \nat the time and whether or not that administration supports the \nlegislation.\n  My point is that it is not a sufficient argument that we should \nreject all the amendments because the administration supports the bill. \nWe should debate each on the merits. And on the merits of this \namendment, I see no real opposition. If because these matters of \nnational security are so important to the United States and there is \nsuch a background of violations, particularly in this area of dual-use \ntechnology, of countries acquiring things and then selling them to \nsomebody else or providing them in some other way to another country to \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction inimical to the interests of \nthe United States, because we have such a history of that, so many \nexamples of it, we should be bending over backward to ensure that we \nhave proper control over the export of these dual-use technologies. And \nwe should not simply be opening it up to essentially free license, and \nif an agency isn't able to complete its review within a 30-day period, \nthe clock runs out and you are deemed to have supported the export of \nthis particular item.\n\n  That is putting it exactly backward because matters of national \nsecurity should be our highest test. The rule should be exactly the \nopposite. If you can't complete the review in 30 days, then you should \nget a little more time\n\n[[Page S9064]]\n\nto complete the review, not to be told: Sorry, the clock ran out; if \nyou could not get it done in 30 days, no matter how complicated, no \nmatter how important the national security interest, the export is \nallowed.\n  That is the problem with taking an approach that if the \nadministration supports the bill, it can't be changed in any respect.\n  There are some things about this bill that should be changed. \nRepresentatives of the administration have made it clear to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and myself and others that they recognize there will \nhave to be implementation of this legislation by executive order. Some \nof the concerns we have expressed, they assured us, would be dealt with \nin this executive order in some way or other. I have absolute \nconfidence in the administration with respect to that. Obviously, they \nhave not issued any executive order yet. It would be premature to do \nso.\n  But failing to understand what specific things might be addressed, we \nthink it is important to try to fix those problems now, and one of the \nproblems deals with this question of possibly needing a little more \ntime. I just ask my colleague, what could be lost, what could be wrong \nwith having a department--let's say the Department of Defense, if it \nsays it needs more time--get a little more time? This is too serious to \nput an arbitrary 30-day clock on and say: Sorry, time is up, national \nsecurity be damned; the 30 days ran out, and the export is allowed to \ngo forward. This is the problem with this strict provision in the law \nwith no ability to move out of it.\n  That is why the Thompson amendment makes sense. That is why I hope my \ncolleagues support the Thompson amendment. It is specifically \nrecommended by the Cox Commission report. I believe--and I ask my \ncolleague from Tennessee if my recollection is correct--the House of \nRepresentatives has already incorporated this recommendation of the Cox \ncommittee report in its legislation. I am not certain. I ask the \nSenator from Tennessee for his understanding of that.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. The House committee reported this out with \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, that includes the provision of the Senator's \namendment in it; is that correct?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I believe it is essentially the same.\n  Mr. KYL. Very similar thereto. There you have it. It seems to me we \nare already making changes to the legislation. We should not be so \nhidebound to every specific jot and tittle in a bill which is now 327 \npages long, very complicated, that we can't make a few changes in this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider exactly what Senator Thompson is \nproposing. It is simple and straightforward. It seems to me that for us \nto just say, no, there is going to be no extra time, no matter how \ncomplex the issue or how strongly the Department of Defense may want \nit, they are not going to get any more time, is not wise public \npolicymaking. I urge my colleagues to support the Thompson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. What was the unanimous consent with regard to the \nprovision of time right before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes evenly divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. All right. That was my understanding, 2 minutes per \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take advantage of these few \nminutes to address a couple of the points the Senator from Arizona \nraised.\n  First of all, in fiscal year 2000, the data indicates that the \naverage time for the review of a license by the Department of Defense \nwas 13 days. The Department of Energy averaged 22 days. The State \nDepartment averaged 9 days. The 30-day time period that is in the bill \nis identical to the current practice under the Executive order. The \namendment would add an additional 60 days in each of two separate \ncircumstances.\n  Of course, one of the things we were trying to do here was to set up \na process whereby applicants could get a definitive decision within a \ndefined timeframe. Now there are provisions in the bill to stop the \nrunning of a clock, a couple of which directly go to the end user issue \nwhich the Senator from Arizona raised, as requiring further time to \nascertain the end user issue.\n  There are these exceptions that stop the clock, as it were, on the \ntime period. That involves the identity and reliability of the end user \nin one instance and additional time to secure the government-to-\ngovernment assurances regarding end item use. So the very concern that \nthe Senator raised is actually addressed in the legislation in terms of \nstopping the clock and providing extra time.\n  I think it is important to underscore that one of the things we were \ntrying to provide to the exporters, which we think is important, was \nthat they could get an answer within a defined period of time. Often \nthey are more concerned in some instances in getting an answer. They \nneed to know, yes or no. They are often competing in an environment in \nwhich they have to find out whether they can move forward or not. A \ndepartment having difficulty with the application can simply say: We \nthink it should be denied. Of course, if they say that, you can then \nstart the interagency appeal process working. But of course that \nextends over a sustained period of time.\n  So we think the framework that is in the legislation really \nadequately addresses these concerns. It does represent a balance, and, \nas I indicated earlier, we are giving quite extensive powers to the \nexecutive branch in here.\n  One of the things the business community was concerned to get was a \nframework with some discipline in it into which they could get an \nanswer. If you are left hanging, you don't know what to do.\n  So given the provisions for stopping the clock that are in there, we \nthink to add another 60 days on top of this period would extend the \nprocess to such an extent that the exporters really could not function \nin the real world.\n  Now if the time period was taking a lot longer to get agency \nresponse, we could be sensitive to that argument. But that is not the \ncase. In any event, the very people who are concerned with making this \nwork, upon whom the burden would fall, have indicated that they find \nthe time periods that are in the bill quite acceptable and, in fact, \nare in opposition to the proposed amendment. They are the very ones who \nwould have to make the process work. So I think that is also an \nimportant consideration to take into account.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment does nothing to lessen \nthe certainty for the exporters. Under the old law, it is 30 days the \nagencies have. Under the new law, it will be 30 days. The only \ndifference is that in the case of potential national security, an \nagency would have additional time. The agency doesn't have to take that \ntime. If the average time for these licenses, as the Senator described, \nwas 13 days, it certainly doesn't sound like that bureaucratic mess we \nheard described earlier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I remind the Senator that we are now under \ncontrolled time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will use my 2 minutes. It doesn't sound like that \nbureaucratic mess we had earlier. These 14-day cases are streamlined \nwhere there is no controversy. We are trying to deal with a situation \nwhere national security might be involved. You don't know whether or \nnot you want to object, if you are an agency, until you get into it.\n  I have heard it referred to again that the agencies apparently do not \nwant this, and it may be politically incorrect for me to say this, but \nit is quite obvious the administration has passed the word they want \nthis bill passed without amendments, even to the point where they do \nnot want agencies to be given the opportunity to ask for another 60 \ndays, even in a matter of national security. I think that is extremely \nunfortunate.\n  It is surprising to me, but apparently that is the case. However, it \ndoes not make it right.\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues, in light of the proliferation concerns that this \ncountry has, in light of the developing technology, the fact that it is \nbeing proliferated around the world and posing a danger to us, that \ncertainly in this export licensing process we can afford to give our \nagencies, such as the Department of Defense, a little additional time \nif they have a national security concern.\n  It is not going to put anybody out of business, and it is not going \nto hurt the overall export process. And what if it does if we are \nsaving something from being exported that otherwise should not be? It \nis a very simple matter to dispose of, but it is a very important \nmatter to get right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have no question about the sincerity of \nSenator Thompson's amendment. He has worked with us on this bill, and \nagainst us to some extent. We have made 59 changes in the bill to \naccommodate Senator Thompson and people who share his concerns, but let \nme explain to my colleagues why this amendment is not good.\n  We have established a system that for the first time is giving the \nsecurity agencies a voice in this process. We have changed the system \nso one member of the panel, from any one agency, can vote no, and the \nprocess at that point is denied and it has to be appealed to a higher \nlevel.\n  It is not like the old system, where the person from the Department \nof Defense could express concern but they could be overridden. Under \nthe current system, you just have to have one person say no and the \nprocess either ends or it is bumped up to the next level.\n  Finally, we give the President a new national security power that \nsays no matter what the circumstances are, no matter whether a product \nis mass marketed or not, no matter whether a terrorist group or a \nterrorist nation or a would-be adversary could get the product from any \nother source, if the President believes it threatens national security, \nit is stopped.\n  What this amendment would do would basically terminate the \neffectiveness to the system by saying that at any point anybody \nbelieves there is complexity in the analysis or there is a potential \nimpact on national security or foreign policy interest, they could \nindefinitely delay. What we want is a decision. Remember, the reviewing \nofficers can vote no, but we want them to vote yes or no. That is what \nthe process is about.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, on August 1, 2001, the Committee on \nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs took up the Mark-to-Market Extension \nAct of 2001.\n  I introduced the Mark-to-Market Extension Act of 2001 along with \nSenators Reed and Allard, the chair and ranking member of the Housing \nand Transportation Subcommittee. The bill passed the committee by a 21-\n0 vote with an amendment offered by Senator Allard. The amendment would \nrequire the GAO, through a series of reports, to update Congress on the \nperformance of the mark-to-market program.\n  The bill makes some modest changes in the program, which was \noriginally passed in 1997 on a bipartisan basis. The changes \nincorporate almost all of the suggestions made by HUD's Office of \nMultifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring (OHMAR) as well as a \nnumber provided by other stakeholders at our June 19 hearing, including \nthe General Accounting Office (GAO). The GAO's thorough review of the \nprogram has proven invaluable, and we will look to them to continue to \nwork with us to keep things on track.\n  As my colleagues know, we passed the original Multifamily Assisted \nHousing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (MAHRAA) in order to bring \ndown the rising costs of project-based section 8 rental assistance \ncontracts. In many markets these section 8 contract rents were higher \nthan the real market rent in the neighborhood in which the project was \nlocated. In order to save money on these contracts, the committee and \nthe Congress chose to reset those contract rents at the lower market \nlevels.\n  However, in many cases, these new, lower rents were inadequate to pay \nthe federally insured mortgages. So the committee also created a number \nof tools that allow the mortgages to be restructured proportionately. \nThe restructuring process includes a thorough review of the physical \ncondition of the building, provides that it be adequately rehabilitated \nand that adequate reserves be built in as part of the building's new \nunderwriting. This is important because, as part of the deal, the owner \nmakes a long-term commitment to continue to serve low income families.\n  After getting off to a slow start, the GAO and most other \nstakeholders agree that the program has finally gotten moving, and a \nmuch larger number\n\n[[Page S9066]]\n\nof deals are being restructured. HUD reports that the program has saved \nthe federal government about $500 million on a present value basis to \ndate.\n  The legislation we have before us includes a series of purposes \ndesigned to reiterate Congress' emphasis on adequate rehabilitation and \nreserves in order to meet ongoing affordability commitments. Similarly, \nwe want to make sure that expenses are properly calculated, so that \nrents and mortgages can be set correctly. This is included in the bill \nbecause of concerns raised by a number of stakeholders, including both \nresidents and owners, that these important goals have been \nshortchanged. We chose not to burden the program with an overly \nprescriptive set of directives regarding these matters. Nonetheless, we \nexpect HUD and the Office to bear these purposes very much in mind as \nthey administer the program.\n  The bill reauthorizes grants to tenant and non-profit groups to help \nresidents participate in the Mark-to-Market process. It calls for \nindependent rent calculations to determine whether a property should go \nthrough the restructuring process, a simple rent reduction, or a \nstraightforward contract renewal. This independent assessment will be \nused to set rents for vouchers, should the owner choose to opt out of \nthe program. Owners will continue to have the right to appeal the rent \nset by the independent review. The bill also expands the flexibility of \nthe Department to approve market rent exceptions where necessary.\n  The bill gives the Secretary flexibility to reduce the 25 percent \nowner rehabilitation contribution for the cost of significant additions \nto a project that are required by HUD. This was done in response to a \nreasonable equity argument made by the owners.\n  Finally, in consultation with HUD and a number of owners, we include \nchanges that will expedite refinancing of the old mortgages and \nlengthen the term of the new first mortgages. We also make adjustments \nthat will allow the size of the second mortgages to be larger, thereby \nreducing the potential for cancellation of indebtedness income rulings \nby the IRS with their attendant tax penalties. Taken together, these \nchanges will allow the underwriting to provide for more rehabilitation, \nreduce the amount of claims taken against the FHA fund, and increase \nthe collection of the second mortgages, thereby saving the taxpayer \nadditional funds on top of the rent savings.\n  We take HUD's suggestion and put the Director of OMHAR under the \nauthority of the FHA Commissioner, as did the House Financial Services \nCommittee. We keep the provision in current law that establishes higher \ncompensation for OMHAR employees because we want to retain the highly \nskilled staff. A significant part of the reason we are moving this \nlegislation so expeditiously is that we want to signal that staff that \nit is our intention to keep them on board and on the job.\n  The legislation extends the life of both the program and the Office \nfor 5 years. I understand that HUD requested a 3 year extension only. \nHowever, data from the GAO indicates that there will still be a \nsignificant, if declining, stream of expiring contracts after the third \nyear of the reauthorization. Frankly, I see no reason to revisit this \nissue a third time. I would strongly prefer to make sure this is the \nlast time we have to act on this issue. Of course, as we move forward, \nI would expect to continue to discuss these and other matters, both \nwith the administration and with the House.\n  In closing, this legislation has broad bipartisan support. My \ncolleagues and I tried to be responsive to the administration and other \nstakeholders, while ensuring that we maintain a highly skilled staff at \nthe Department. I am hopeful that we can move this legislation quickly \nthrough the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9066-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPPORT FOR FULL FUNDING OF THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the National Guard's counterdrug mission. I am concerned that \nproposed Department of Defense, DoD, funding for the National Guard's \nFY-2002 Counterdrug Program, State Plans, is not sufficient to ensure \nthe continuance of this valuable service to law enforcement and local \ncommunities, and request that the funding be increased $40.7 million, \nfrom the President's $154.3 million request, to a total of $195 \nmillion.\n  The National Guard's Adjutant Generals, from the various States, have \nindicated to the National Guard Bureau, that without a minimum of $195 \nmillion budgeted for this program, large personnel layoffs may occur. \nMy staff has heard reports that one State may have to downsize by as \nmuch as one-third their personnel. Over ninety percent of the National \nGuard's counterdrug program costs are personnel-based, and as such, it \nis extremely sensitive to variations in funding, taking years to \nrecover from any reduction in trained and experienced personnel. These \nreductions affect supported agencies, including the Customs Service, \nDEA, U.S. Border Patrol, FBI, HIDTAs, scores of State and local law \nenforcement agencies, and community based organizations.\n  I am also concerned about the apparent lack of emphasis, and even \ndistancing of itself, by the Department of Defense, on the counterdrug \nmission, especially in a year of discussions of increased DoD funding \nfor other military mission areas. I sense this repeatedly in \ninsufficient funding for the National Guard and other critical \ncounterdrug mission areas, and believe this would be a poor policy \ndecision and a poor indication of the nation's priorities.\n  I urge my colleagues and the Department of Defense to give serious \nconsideration to the National Guard program and its contribution to our \nnational drug control strategy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9066-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nSeptember 2, 2001, as the 10th anniversary of Nagorno Karabagh's \ndeclaration of independence. Born from the disintegration of the Soviet \nUnion in the late 1980s, the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh has faced \nincredible odds over the past decade in its struggle for self-\ndetermination, independence, peace, and stability.\n  Many Americans know very little about Nagorno Karabagh. However, the \nregion is culturally rich and historically significant as a bridge \nbetween Eastern and Western societies. Armenians have been a distinct \npolitical entity in Artsakh--the traditional Armenian name for the \nRepublic of Nagorno Karabagh--since the 2nd Century B.C. Christianity \nin the region grew and strengthened following the construction of the \nhistoric Monastery in Amaras in 330 A.D. Repeatedly destroyed by \ngenerations of invaders and rebuilt, the Monastery in Amaras currently \nstands as a symbol of faith and perseverance for Armenians.\n  The Soviet Union's oppression of independence in the region began in \nthe 1920s as Nagorno Karabagh and its predominantly Armenian population \nwere attached to Azerbaijan. Most recently, Armenians in Nagorno \nKarabagh struggled to fight the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the \nCancasus region.\n  Finally, on September 2, 1991, the Armenians of Nagorno Karabagh \ndeclared\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\ntheir independence and survived a three-year war with Azerbaijan to \ncreate legitimate government institutions. Residents of Nagorno \nKarabagh have participated in national elections for parliament and \npresident since then.\n  Many challenges face the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh and Armenians \nin the region. I applaud efforts undertaken earlier this year to bring \ntogether Armenia and Azerbaijan in Key West, Florida, to discuss a \npeaceful end to the Nagorno Karabagh conflict. As Secretary of State \nPowell noted, ``achieving a durable and mutually acceptable resolution \nto Armenia's conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabagh is key to \nseveral US interests.'' In addition to helping to restore stability in \nthe Caucasus region, a lasting peace agreement would allow Armenia to \nimprove its relations with Turkey and focus much of its economic \nresources on internal development and social improvements.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I will continue to work to secure funding to support a \nsettlement of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict. These funds are critical \nto the peace process and to post-settlement reconstruction in \nAzerbaijan and Armenia as part of a coordinated international donor \neffort.\n  Again, I commend the Armenians of the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh \nfor their courage and perseverance on this anniversary of their \nindependence. I look forward to years of peace and economic vitality in \nthe region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9067-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9067-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9067-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 8, 2001, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 93.

A bill to ensure availability of the mail to transmit \nshipments of day-old poultry; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today be introduce legislation \nthat will ensure the continued availability of the U.S. mail for the \nshipment of day-old poultry * * * For decades, America's hatcheries and \nfamily farmers have relied on the United States Postal Service to \nsafely and efficiently deliver live, day-old poultry. However, \nNorthwest Airlines, the last contractor to provide the service to the \nPostal Service in the Midwest recently decided to discontinue the \nshipment of live poultry as of September 1.\n  the decision by the air carriers to stop working with the Postal \nService has placed the economic vitality of many rural communities and \nthe livelihoods of many of my constituents in serious jeopardy. In \nfact, hundreds of Iowans are employed in Iowa hatcheries which supply \nday-old birds to family farmers and hobbyists.\n  For example, the McMurray Hatchery in Webster City, IA, has shipped \nday-old chicks and other poultry to customers in all parts of the \nUnited States for over eighty years. The hatchery employs up to seventy \npeople in sseason and is a major contributor to the region's economy. \nNinety-five percent of the hatchery's orders are shipped through the \nmail, and carried by Northwest Airlines. Without the ability to deliver \ntheir product to their customers, however, the McMurray Hatchery would \nlikely be put out of business.\n  In the community of Rudd, the Hoover Hatchery employs thirty people. \nThe Welp Hatchery in Bancroft employs fifty people. For these small, \nrural communities, each with fewer than a thousand people, loss of \nthese hatcheries would be devastating.\n  The legislation I introduce today would protect these hatcheries and \nthe economies of Webster City, Rudd, Bancroft, and communities like \nthem across the country. My legislation would authorize the U.S. Postal \nService to require an air carrier to accept shipments of any day-old \npoultry and other live animals that are also allowed by the carriers's \ncargo service. In addition, my legislation would permit the Postal \nService to assess a reasonable postage surcharge on shipments of live \npoultry to compensate carriers for any necessary additional expenses \nassociated with the handling of live animals.\n  Most importantly, my legislation would ensure that the commitment of \nthe United States Postal Service to deliver all of the mail, without \ndiscrimination, would not be broken. Therefore, I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this legislation and to uphold our obligation to \nAmerica's hatcheries and family farmers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kyl, \n        and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1399. A bill to prevent identity theft, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to introduce the Identity \nTheft Prevention Act of 2001 along with Senator Shelby, Senator \nCorzine, Senator Kyl, and Senator Grassley.\n  The goal of this legislation is to require credit bureaus and banks \nto take precautions against identity theft and to assist identity theft \nvictims in restoring their good name.\n  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses \nanother person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license \nnumber, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car \nloans, phone plans or other services in the victim's name. The criminal \nliterally assumes the identity of the victim for illicit gain.\n  Identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in the new \neconomy. The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates 350,000 cases of \nidentify theft occur annually.\n  If recent trends continue, reports of identity theft to the Federal \nTrade Commission will double between 2000 and 2001, to over 60,000 \ncases.\n  Fully 40 percent of all consumer fraud complaints received by the FTC \nin the first three months of 2001 involved identity theft.\n  Consider some of the following cases: my constituent, Kim Bradbury of \nCastro Valley, reported that an identity thief obtained a credit card \nin her name through the Internet in just 10 seconds. The false \napplication only had her Social Security number and birth date correct.\n  A man's drivers license was stolen at a night club in Florida. The \nthief opened a checking account in the man's name at multiple banks and \nused the accounts to engage in financial fraud. The police, in pursuit \nof the identity thief, mistakenly arrested the victim five times for \ncrimes committed by the identity thief. One of the arrests caused him \nto miss his honeymoon.\n  Three youths robbed a young woman on a San Francisco MUNI bus. The \nthieves stole her driver's license and Social Security card.\n  While the victim was traveling over the Christmas holiday, the \nthieves represented themselves as her and drained her bank accounts, \nand applied for cell phones and credit cards in her name.\n  This bill attempts to stem the tide of identity theft by requiring \nbanks, credit bureaus, and other financial institutions to take some \npractical steps to protect sensitive personal information.\n  1. The Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2001 would require all new \ncredit-card machines to truncate any credit card number printed on a \ncustomer receipt. Thus, when a store gives a customer a receipt from a \ncredit card purchase, only the last five digits of the credit card \nnumber will show. This prevents identity thieves from stealing credit \ncard numbers by retrieving discarded receipts. Existing machines would \nhave to be reprogrammed to truncate credit card numbers on receipts by \n2006. Given that most credit machines have a working life of \napproximately five years, this reprogramming requirement will put a \nminimal burden on businesses.\n  2. The bill requires a credit card company to notify consumers when \nan additional credit card is requested on an existing credit account \nwithin 30 days of an address change request.\n  3. The bill would require credit bureaus to alert credit issuers of \ndiscrepancies between the consumer's address in the bureau's records \nand the address in the consumer's application for credit. Thus, credit \ncard issuers would be alerted to possible fraud.\n  4. This bill codifies the industry practice of placing fraud alerts \non a consumer's credit file and gives the Federal Trade Commission the \nauthority to impose fines against credit issuers that ignore the alert.\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n  Too many credit card issuers are granting new cards without \nadequately verifying the identity of the applicant. Putting some teeth \ninto fraud alerts will curb irresponsible granting of credit.\n  I also would have reintroduced a provision from the Identity Theft \nPrevention Act of 2000, requiring that the Federal Trade Commission, \nFTC, develop a Model Reporting Form for victims to send to creditors.\n  However, I am pleased to report that the FTC, encouraged by last \nyear's identity theft bill, has drafted this model form.\n  The new form will be launched in the next several weeks, and will be \naccepted by the three major credit bureaus as well as several major \nfinancial institutions. It will reduce substantially the paperwork \nburden on identity theft victims who otherwise would have to file \nliterally dozens of reports of fraud.\n  The simple, concrete proposals of this bill are are necessary because \nfinancial institutions are the stewards of personal financial data. \nThey have unique access and control over the most sensitive personal \ninformation like one's bank account balance or one's credit card \nnumber. With this unique access comes a responsibility.\n  Some may question why Congress needs to impose tighter information \npractices on banks and credit bureaus to address the identify theft \ncrisis. After all, it is true that banks are on the hook for any \npersonal credit losses over $50 due to fraud.\n  Presumably, if banks were losing excessive amounts of money due to \nidentity theft, they would tighten their information practices. \nHowever, the problems that face identity theft victims are independent \nof market forces.\n  So much of identify theft victims' suffering comes from sources other \nthan credit card losses.\n  For example, victims often face extreme difficulties clearing their \ndamaged credit, or even a criminal record, caused by the thief. The \ntypical victim of identity theft spends over 175 hours over two years \nto clear his name.\n  This legislation has earned the widespread support from a number of \nconsumer and victims groups including the Identity Theft Resources \nCenter, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Consumers Union, U.S. PIRG, \nand Consumer Federation of America.\n  The Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2001 requires financial \ninstitutions to take some simple precautions to prevent identity fraud \nand protect a person's good name.\n  Verifying a credit applicant's address, complying with ``fraud \nalerts'', notifying credit card holders of unusual requests for new \ncards, and truncating credit numbers on receipts are all measures that \nwill it make harder for criminals to engage in identify fraud.\n  It is appropriate and necessary for financial institutions to take \nthese steps. These companies have a responsibility to prevent \nfraudsters from using their services to harm the good name of other \ncitizens. Morever, in this complex, information-driven society, \nconsumers simply can't protect their good name on their own.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein \nin introducing the ``Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2001.''\n  Unfortunately, with the growth of electronic commerce, there has been \na corresponding growth in the number of high tech crimes. In fact, \nidentity theft is now the fastest growing crime in the United States. \nOver the last few years, identity thieves have stolen billions of \ndollars from hundreds of thousands of people.\n  The difficulties for victims of identity theft do not simply end \nafter the crime that has been committed. It can take years and \nconsiderable effort for victims to clear their names, reestablish their \ncredit histories and get themselves back on their feet. In some cases, \nthe crime never ends: stolen personal information is used repeatedly by \nnumerous thieves placing individuals in an endless cycle of \nvictimization.\n  The ``Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2001'' is intended as a first \nstep towards combating this devastating crime. The legislation requires \nnew, common sense measures such as: notifying a credit card holder of a \nrequest for an additional card or request to change an address; \nrequiring consumer approval prior to the issuance of credit; and \ntruncation of credit card account numbers on print-out receipts. These \nprovisions are intended to reduce the opportunities of thieves to \nobtain the consumer data they use to commit fraud in the first place.\n  Additionally, in an effort to ease the considerable burdens the crime \nplaces on its victims, the bill makes it easier for consumers to report \nfraud and for them to quickly restore their credit history after they \nhave been targeted.\n  The seriousness of the of the crime of identity theft has already \nbeen well documented in economic terms: hundreds of thousands of people \nhave lost billions of dollars. However, the crime causes additional \nlosses that far exceed the economic ones. An identity theft victim can \nlose his or her hard-earned good name and reputation in a matter of \nseconds. I believe Senator Feinstein's bill will help prevent such \nassaults and it will help those who are victimized restore their credit \nrecord and their reputation more quickly. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 1402. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to fully \nintegrate the beneficiaries of the Individual Case Management Program \ninto the TRICARE program, to provide long-term health care benefits \nunder the TRICARE program and otherwise to improve the benefits \nprovided under the TRICARE program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today, I am introducing \nlegislation to ensure that disabled family members of our active duty \nmilitary have greater access to the health care they deserve.\n  Early last year, a young man in the United States Air Force drove \nover 12 hours with his wife and disabled 4 year old daughter to testify \nabout how important it was to make Medicaid more accessible. Why? \nBecause the military health care system does not provide for his \ndaughter's needs, and Medicaid does. But, in order to continue her \neligibility for Medicaid, this service member could not accept his \npromotion to the next rank.\n  No member of the Armed Forces, who risk their lives for our country \nshould ever be put in a position of having to decide between health \ncare for their disabled child and doing their job for our country. Nor \nshould these families have to rely on Medicaid to find health care that \nworks. This bill corrects the injustices these families have suffered. \nThe TRICARE Modernization Act integrates services for disabled \ndependents into the basic military health benefit program, so that no \nmedically necessary services can be denied. It allows disabled \ndependents to receive care that is necessary to maintain their \nfunctions and prevent further deterioration of their disability. It \nprovides skilled nursing care as long as is necessary, and is \ncoordinated with Medicare. And, it authorizes respite care, hearing \naids, and other therapies to help a disabled person stay or become \nindependent.\n  We know how far we have come in the ongoing battle over many decades \nto guarantee that disabled people have the independence they need to be \nparticipating members of their communities. Our military families with \ndisabled dependents should not be denied that opportunity.\n  Enactment of this legislation is one of the most significant steps we \ncan take in this Congress. It offers a new and better life to large \nnumbers of military families. It gives servicemen and women, and their \ndisabled family members, the health care they need. And, most important \nfor active duty military members and their families, it ensures that \ndisability need no longer end the American dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/04/senate-section/article/S9079-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9079-S9080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1481.
