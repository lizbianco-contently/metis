Madam President, I rise to speak today to pay tribute \nto the life and legend of Katharine Graham. It is as if the Washington \nMonument has fallen. It is as if the lights have gone out at the \nSmithsonian Institution or the lights have gone out at the Lincoln \nMemorial. I\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\ntruly cannot imagine Washington without Kay Graham. She was a \nWashington institution, a very real person with a remarkable mix of \nqualities. Much has been said about her grace, her grit, her steel, her \ngreat intelligence.\n  Kay Graham put those qualities into action. She lived an \nextraordinary life and left an indelible mark on our Nation.\n  I know the Presiding Officer liked Kay Graham because she took \nchances. Perhaps one of the greatest chances she took was when she \nactually took the helm of the Washington Post. Think about it. It was \n1963. It was not a time when women did bold things, power things, and \nthey certainly were not on the rung of leadership to be CEOs. She was a \nwoman who had faced an enormous personal tragedy. But as she reflected \non where she was, where her family was, and where this newspaper was, \nshe decided to take the helm.\n  She was initially a reluctant leader, thrown into a leadership \nposition because of the death of her husband. In embracing a leadership \nposition, she set about hiring the very best people and giving them the \nindependence to create one of the greatest newspapers in the world.\n  She built a Fortune 500 company. And guess what. She became the first \nwoman to head a Fortune 500 company.\n  There were other firsts for Katharine Graham as well. She was the \nfirst director of the Associated Press, the first woman to lead the \nAmerican Newspaper Publishers Association. I could go through a whole \nlist.\n  Now we take for granted that women will lead, that women will be in \npositions of leadership in the private sector and in the public sector. \nWe now enjoy the fact that there are 13 women in the Senate. We have \nwomen as university presidents, Governors, and CEOs from dot coms to \nleaders of the old economy. Yet we cannot forget how hard it was to be \nthe first because for the first and the only, it is also being the \nfirst and the lonely.\n  What Katharine Graham did was involve other people in her life and in \nher family and in creating that institution.\n  She was known for probably two great milestones in the history of \njournalism. She made the courageous decision to print the Pentagon \nPapers, which gave us this view on the Vietnam war, and then she \nrigorously pursued the Watergate story.\n  It is said that men in the highest of power just cringed at the name \nof Katharine Graham, the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee and the team that \nhe assembled. The highest levels of Government tried to suppress these \nstories. They used threats. They used intimidations. Katharine Graham \ndid not flinch nor did she falter. The Washington Post and Kay Graham \nstood firm.\n  Katharine Graham knew her role was to print the truth, no matter what \nthe impact would be. She truly changed the course of history.\n  Mrs. Graham's actions reinforced the fact that the freedom of speech \ncannot be abridged--especially by our own Government.\n\n  While she hired gifted and talented reporters and editors, she \nherself did not take up the pen until 1997 when she wrote a book called \nher ``Personal History.'' Her autobiography struck a chord even with \npeople who cared nothing about the ways of Washington. In it she had \nwonderful stories about historic figures. She also showed that she \nherself was a gifted and talented writer, going on to win the Pulitzer \nPrize. So much for being a shy, awkward debutante of 40 years before.\n  What really resonated was the story about a woman who faced crises \nand confronted them with courage and dignity. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has experienced some of the same. We all cheered when Kay won \nthat Pulitzer Prize because we knew she deserved it and we were proud \nof her.\n  I was deeply grateful for a chance she took on me. In 1986 I was \nrunning for the U.S. Senate. I was viewed by some as a long shot. The \nWashington insiders said I did not look the part, and they were not \nsure that I could act the part. But as history has shown, I got the \npart. One of the reasons I got the part was because of the endorsement \nof the Washington Post.\n  I will be forever grateful to have gotten the Washington Post \nendorsement in both my primary and the general. Meg Greenfield--the \nwonderful and special friend, Meg Greenfield--felt that I had the \nqualities to become the first Democratic woman ever elected to the U.S. \nSenate in her own right.\n  I just want to say that Kay Graham, this wonderful blue-blooded lady, \nwelcomed a blue-collar spitfire. And for that I will always be \ngrateful. When I came to the U.S. Senate, I came with her endorsement \nand her welcome. It is something I treasured in those years as she \nintroduced me to people.\n  She had me in her home. I had a chance to be at those great parties \nshe had to essentially get started in my own life in Washington. But \nthe story that I want to recall is one that is very special to me in \nwhich I participated with her. It was 1987. The late Pamela Harriman \nwas asked to host a lunch at her home for Raisa Gorbachev to introduce \nher to ``women of distinction.'' Dobrynin had called Mrs. Harriman to \nhost this luncheon. Mrs. Harriman called me. And guess who else was on \nthe list? My colleague, Senator Nancy Kassebaum--there were only two of \nus in the Senate then--Kay Graham of the Washington Post, Sandra Day \nO'Connor, at that time the only woman on the Supreme Court, and Dr. \nHanna Grey, the president of the University of Chicago.\n  What an incredible lunch. First of all, we were the talk of \nWashington, and we were the talk of the world. Raisa was trying to woo \nAmerica to show that Soviet women were smart and fashionable. And she \nchose as her venue the Pamela Harriman lunch.\n  I tried to engage her, in her dissertation on what life was like on \nthe collective farm, as two sociologists. We talked about life and \ntimes. But the hit of the lunch was Kay Graham and the way she engaged \nRaisa Gorbachev. Under Kay Graham's incredible graciousness, courtesy, \nmanners, and charm was one ace investigative reporter. While the rest \nof us were talking and engaging in intellectual conversation, Mrs. \nGraham began to engage Mrs. Gorbachev in these kinds of questions: What \nis it like to be the functional equivalent of the First Lady in the \nSoviet Union? What was your surprise when you came to power? What do \nyou find it like as in the life of a woman?\n  I wish you could have heard the late Mrs. Gorbachev's answers. We saw \na side of Raisa Gorbachev we didn't know: a woman who saw herself as a \nscholar, coming to power with a man who had been the head of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, that they were changing world history. She \nwas shocked by the number of letters she received, the way the Soviet \nwomen had reached out to her, one on one.\n  We heard that Raisa story because of the way Kay Graham talked to \nher. It was a very special afternoon. I got to know Mrs. Gorbachev a \nlot better. Do you know who else I got to know a lot better? Kay \nGraham. She had world leaders at her feet and at her side. But most of \nall, she had the gratitude of leaders who knew that at the Washington \nPost there was a great leader who was willing to meet with other \nleaders but, no matter what, she said to print the truth and call them \nthe way she saw them.\n  I am sorry that Kay Graham has been called to glory. God bless her, \nand may she rest in peace. She has left a legacy that should be a \nbenchmark, a hallmark, and a torch for every other newspaper in \nAmerica, for all of us who hold leadership, and for we women who are in \npower. May we be as gracious and as unflinching in our duties as Kay \nGraham.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I send the managers' amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 1024.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the purpose of my amendment is to \naddress the very serious problem of shoreline erosion and sedimentation \nwhich are adversely impacting the health of the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. There are approximately 7,325 miles of tidal shoreline along \nthe Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. In an average year, it is \nestimated that 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material are \ndeposited in the bay due to shoreline erosion. The results not only in \nserious property damage, but also contributes millions of cubic yards \nof sediment annually to the bay. This sediment adversely affects the \nbay's water quality, destroys valuable wetlands and habitat and clogs \nthe bay's navigational channels.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers operates thirteen reservoirs on the upper \nSusquehanna River and regulates the river's low and high water flows. \nThere are also four hydroelectric projects on the lower Susquehanna. \nUnder normal conditions, these reservoirs and dams serve as traps for \nthe harmful sediments which flow into the River. During major storms \nhowever, they suddenly discharge tremendous amounts of built-up \nsediments, severely degrading the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay, \ndestroying valuable habitat and killing fish and other living \nresources. Scientists estimate that Tropical Storm Agnes in 1982 \n``aged'' the bay by more than a decade in a matter of days because of \nthe slug of sediments discharged from the Susquehanna River reservoirs. \nThere is a real danger that another major storm in the basin could \nscour the sediment that has been accumulating behind these dams and \npresent a major set-back to our efforts to clean up the bay.\n  Chesapeake 2000, the new interstate Chesapeake Bay Agreement, has \nidentified control of sediment loads as a top priority for improving \nthe water quality of the bay. The agreement specifically calls for load \nreductions fro sediment in each major tributary by 2001 and for \nimplementing strategies that prevent the loss of the sediment retention \ncapabilities on the lower Susquehanna River dams by 2003.\n  Unfortunately, our understanding of the sediment processes and \nsources of sediments which feed the bay system is still very limited \nand, to date, few efforts have been undertaken to address the \nenvironmental impacts of shoreline erosion and sedimentation on the \nbay. In 1990, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a study on the \nfeasibility of shoreline erosion protection measures which could \nprotect both the land and water resources of the Chesapeake Bay from \nthe adverse effects of continued erosion but, due to limited \nauthorities, no Federal construction action was recommended at the \ntime. However, the report recommended that the Corps pursue further \nstudies including developing and refining ecosystem models to provide a \nbetter understanding of the environmental impacts of sedimentation and \nsediment transport mechanisms and identifying priority deposition-\nprevention areas which could lead to structural and non-structural \nenvironmental enhancement initiatives.\n  On May 23, 2001, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \napproved a resolution which I sponsored together with Senators Warner \nand Mikulski, directing the Secretary of the Army to review the \nrecommendations of the Army Corps of Engineers' 1990 Chesapeake Bay \nShoreline Erosion Study and other related reports and to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of shoreline erosion and related sediment \nmanagement measures which could be undertaken to protect the water and \nland resources of the Chesapeake Bay watershed and achieve the water \nquality conditions necessary to protect the bay's living resources.\n  The resolution called for the study to be conducted in cooperation \nwith other Federal agencies, the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, their political \nsubdivisions and the Chesapeake Bay Program. It also directed the Corps \nto evaluate structural and non-structural environmental enhancement \nopportunities and other innovative protection measures in the interest \nof environmental restoration, ecosystem protection, and other allied \npurposes for the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The funding which my amendment would make available, would enable the \nCorps of Engineers to initiate this study and begin to assess \nalternative strategies for addressing the shoreline erosion/\nsedimentation problem in the bay. As the lead Federal agency in water \nresource management, the Army Corps of Engineers has an important role \nto play in the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. The results of this \nstudy could benefit not only the overall environmental quality of the \nChesapeake Bay, but improve the Corps' dredging management program in \nthe bay.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in favor of an amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Sarbanes and Senator Allen relating to the ongoing \neffort by the Corps of Engineers, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the \nState of Maryland to give new life to the Chesapeake Bay oyster.\n  Since 1996, the Corps of Engineers has joined with Maryland and \nVirginia to provide oyster habitat in the Chesapeake Bay. This \npartnership has stimulated significant financial support from\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nVirginia and Maryland, dollars from the non-profit Chesapeake Bay \nFoundation, and many individuals.\n  The oyster, once plentiful in the Bay, has been ravaged by disease, \nover-harvesting and pollution. Oyster populations in the Bay are nearly \nnon-existent at 99 percent of its traditional stock. In 1999, watermen \nlanded about 420,000 bushels--approximately 2 percent of the historic \nlevels.\n  Since the beginning of the joint federal-state Chesapeake Bay \nRestoration program in 1983, we have learned that restoring healthy \noyster populations in the Bay is critical to improving water quality \nand supporting other finfish and shellfish populations. According to \nscientists, when oyster populations were at its height, they could \nfilter all of the water in the Bay in three to four days. Today, with \nthe depleted oyster stocks, it takes over one year.\n  Although it took a long time to develop, there is now consensus in \nthe scientific community, and among watermen and the Bay partners that \nincreasing oyster populations by tenfold over the next decade is a key \nfactor in restoring the living resources of the Bay. Using historic \noyster bed locations, owned by the Commonwealth, this federal-state \neffort has built three-dimensional reefs, stocked them with oyster spat \nand designated these areas as permanent sanctuaries. These protected \nareas, off limits to harvesting, have shown great promise in producing \noysters that are ``disease tolerant'' which are reproducing and \nbuilding up adjacent oyster beds.\n  The new Chesapeake Bay 2000 Agreement, between the federal government \nand the Bay states, calls for increasing oyster stocks tenfold by 2010, \nusing the 1994 baseline. This goal calls for constructing 20 to 25 \nreefs per year at dimensions where the reefs rise about the Bay bottom \nso that young oysters survive and grow faster than silt can cover them.\n\n  Mr. President, with the funding provided last year to the Corps and \nthe additional state funds, there is now an active oyster reef \nconstruction program underway in both Virginia and Maryland.\n  My amendment today recognizes the significant allocation of state \nscientists and state programs that devote their time and resources to \nthe oysters restoration partnership. Integral to the entire project is \nthe state effort to map the large oyster ground areas to determine \nthose sites most suitable for restoration, and to provide suitable \nshell stock.\n  For example, in Virginia the focus of the next oyster reef \nconstruction area is on the large grounds in Tangier and Pocomoke \nSounds. State Conservation and Replenishment Department staff created \nmaps that were gridded and more than 3,000 acres were sampled and \nevaluated. Eight sanctuary reef sites and more than 190 acres of \nrestorable harvest areas were identified during the oyster ground stock \nassessment in this area earlier this year.\n  In preparation for reef construction this summer, Virginia contracted \nwith local watermen to clean the harvest areas and reef sites. In June \nof this year, four areas were planted with 86,788 bushels of oyster \nshells at a cost of $139,000 in state funds.\n  The State of Maryland has been equally committed to providing \nresources to the Corps for the construction of reef sites in the \nMaryland waters of the Bay.\n  Consistent with other Corps programs, my amendment permits the Corps \nto recognize the strong partnership by the states to restore oyster \npopulations and provide credit toward the non-federal cost share for in \nkind work performed by the states.\n  This federal-state sanctuary program is essential to restoring the \nChesapeake Bay oyster. The oyster is a national asset because it has \nthe capability to purify the water by filtering algae, sediments and \npollutants. Sanctuary oyster reefs also provide critical habitat to \nother shellfish, finfish and migratory waterfowl.\n  It has been my privilege to see the construction of these sanctuary \nreefs last April and I am encouraged by the success of the initial \nreefs built in Virginia. I am confident that this program is the only \nway to replenish--and to save--the Chesapeake Bay oyster. I \nrespectfully urge its adoption.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senators Reid and Domenici \nfor including the Snowe-Collins amendment in the Fiscal Year 2002 \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations today to help the Town of \nFt. Fairfield, ME. My amendment should resolve a serious design problem \nthat has arisen in connection with the construction of a small flood \ncontrol levy project in Ft. Fairfield, which is located above the 46th \nparallel in Northern Maine, where the river freezes every fall and \nstays frozen well into spring.\n  The proper functioning of the levy is vital to the town's economic \nviability and for protection against future flooding of the downtown \narea. My amendment should allow the Army Corp of Engineers to assume \nfinancial responsibility for a design deficiency in the project \nrelating to the interference of ice with pump operation so that there \nwill be no further and inappropriate cost to the Town.\n  My amendment calls for the Secretary of the Army to investigate the \nflood control project and formally determine whether the Secretary is \nresponsible. Since the Corps has already assumed responsibility for the \ndesign deficiency, the Secretary will then order the design deficiency \nto be corrected at 100 percent federal expense.\n  Once again, I thank the Chairs for their continued support for the \nlevy project in Ft. Fairfield over the years, and I am pleased that the \ntown will now have the assurance that their flooding problems are \nbehind them and can go forward with their economic development plans \nfor their downtown area.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nsubmitted by Senators Reid and Domenici be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1024) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I seek permission to speak for up to 10 \nminutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names: Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Nelson of Nebraska, and Mr. Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present. The clerk will call \nthe names of absent Senators.\n  The assistant legislative clerk resumed the call of the roll.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare now prepared to go to third reading on the energy and water \nappropriations bill. Senator Lott and I and Senator Domenici and others \nhave been working on what we will do following the completion of our \nwork on energy and water. Unless there is an objection, I think this \nwould be an appropriate time to complete our work on that bill. Senator \nLott and I will have further announcements as soon as we complete our \nwork on this particular bill.\n  At this time, it would be my suggestion we go to third reading and \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 1024\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers' \namendment be modified with the language I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 6, strike the period and insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That within the fund's \n     provision herein, $250,000 may be used for the Horseshoe \n     Lake, AR, feasibility study.''\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Provided \n     further, That the project for the ACF authorized by section 2 \n     of the Rivers and Harbor Act of March 2, 1945 (Public Law 79-\n     14; 59 Stat. 10) and modified by the first section of the \n     River and Harbor Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 635, Chapter 595), is \n     modified to authorize the Secretary, as part of navigation \n     maintenance activities to develop and implement a plan to be \n     integrated into the long term dredged material management \n     plan being developed for the Corley Slough reach as required \n     by conditions of the State of Florida water quality \n     certification, for periodically removing sandy dredged \n     material from the disposal area known as Site 40, located at \n     mile 36.5 of the Apalachicola River, and from other disposal \n     sites that the Secretary may determine to be needed, for the \n     purpose of reuse of the disposal areas, by transporting and \n     depositing the sand for environmentally acceptable beneficial \n     uses in coastal areas of northwest Florida to be determined \n     in coordination with the State of Florida: Provided further, \n     That the Secretary is authorized to acquire all lands, \n     easements, and rights of way that may be determined by the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the affected state, to be \n     required for dredged material disposal areas to implement a \n     long term dredge material management plan: Provided further, \n     That the long term management plan shall be developed in \n     coordination with the State of Florida no later than 2 years \n     from the date of enactment of this legislation: Provided \n     further, That, $5,000,000 shall be made available for these \n     purposes and $8,173,000 shall be made available for the \n     Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers Navigation.''\n\n\n                funding for beach replenishment projects\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished \nmanagers of the bill if they would consider a request that I and my \ncolleague from New Jersey have concerning the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to accommodate my colleagues from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from Nevada. Mr. President, I am \nvery pleased to see that the fiscal year 2002 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill makes appropriations for many important water \nresources projects throughout the country. In particular, the Army \nCorps of Engineers budget includes $1.57 billion in construction \nfunding for important dredging, flood control, and beach replenishment \nprojects, many of which are in my State.\n  We are extremely grateful that the subcommittee has provided New \nJersey with sorely needed funds. And while we understand that the \ncommittee has appropriated projects with limited funds, we ask that \nshould funds be made available during conference, that they would \nconsider funding beach replenishment new construction starts. There are \nseveral new start projects in my State which are in desperate need of \nfunding, and I would like to draw your attention to several of these \nprojects, and ask that the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee consider funding for these projects. I cannot stress how \nvital these projects are to the economies of my State, the region, and \nour Nation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, New Jersey's 127 miles of beaches are \nwide and inviting, dotted with sand dunes and boardwalks offset by a \nrollicking blue surf and white, warm sand. From Sandy Hook to Cape May \nPoint, one hundred and sixty million people visit New Jersey beaches \nper year. These visitors generate the bulk of the tourism industry in \nNew Jersey, which is the backbone of my State's economy. Spending by \ntourists totaled $26.1 billion in New Jersey in 1998, a 2 percent \nincrease from $25.6 billion in 1997. Clearly, our beaches are our \nlifeblood, and their health is paramount.\n  This year, there are five new start beach replenishment projects that \nare in critical need for Federal funding. These projects: the Lower \nCape May Meadows, the Brigantine Inlet to Great Delaware Bay \nCoastline--Oakwood Beach, the Delaware Bay Coastline--Villas and \nVicinity, are vital to fighting beach erosion and protecting the \ntourist economy for South Jersey. My fear is that if Federal funds are \nnot immediately directed to protect these beaches, they will literally \ndisappear in the future.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. While we recognize the difficulties involved in \nproviding funding for new starts, we cannot stress how important the \nconstruction phase for these projects begin as soon as possible. I \nwould like to note that all of these projects have been authorized by \nthe Water Resources Development Act.\n  The economy of the region depends directly upon the health of its \nbeaches. Unless construction begins in fiscal year 2002, I am concerned \nthat the economies of the beach-towns within the scope of these \nprojects will be seriously damaged.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senators from New Jersey and assure them that \nthe committee recognizes the importance of protecting our beaches \nthroughout the country.\n\n\n                     jennings randolph lake project\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to clarify that it is the \ncommittee's intent that the additional $100,000 provided in the Army \nCorps of Engineers' operations and maintenance account for the Jennings \nRandolph Lake project will be used to develop access to the Big Bend \nRecreation area on the Maryland side of the Jennings Randolph Lake \nimmediately downstream from the dam.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct. The committee has provided an \nadditional $100,000 for planning and design work for access to the Big \nBend Recreation Area located immediately downstream of the Jennings \nRandolph dam.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman for these assurances. There is\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\ngreat demand for additional camping, fishing, and white water rafting \nopportunities particularly in the area just below the dam, known as Big \nBend, and these funds will be very helpful in developing access to this \narea.\n\n\n                       great lakes drilling study\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada knows, the \nSenate adopted the Stabenow-Fitzgerald-Levin-Durbin amendment which \nwould require an Army Corps of Engineers study on drilling in the Great \nLakes and place a moratorium on any new drilling until Congress lifts \nit in the future.\n  It is clear that Congress has jurisdiction over Great Lakes drilling \nbecause it constitutes interstate commerce under the commerce clause of \nthe Constitution. This constitutes interstate commerce under the \nCommerce clause of the Constitution for several reasons. One reason is \nthat an environmental accident such as the release of crude oil into \nthe waters of one or more of the Great Lakes would negatively affect \nthe water quality, tourism and fishing industries and shorelines of \nmultiple Great Lakes states. Another reason is that oil and gas \nextracted from one Great Lakes states would be transported and sold in \nother states in the form of many products. It would also increase the \nnational supply of oil and gas.\n  For these reasons, there is not doubt that Congress has Federal \njurisdiction over drilling in the Great Lakes and can put a stop to it.\n  Would the distinguished Chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, and the author of this bill, agree with this \ninterpretation of the Commerce clause?\n  Mr. REID. I totally agree that Congress has jurisdiction over \ndrilling in the Great Lakes because it constitutes interstate commerce \nunder the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee.\n\n\n                        kootenai river sturgeon\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nover the control of water levels of the Kootenai River in and around \nBonners Ferry, ID, related to the Kootenai Sturgeon. The Kootenai River \nis directly influenced by the operations of the Libby Dam as operated \nby the Army Corps of Engineers. This area has also been defined as \ncritical habitat for the Kootenai Sturgeon.\n  Will the distinguished Senators from Nevada and New Mexico engage in \na colloquy with me concerning the Kootenai River Sturgeon?\n  Mr. REID. I will be pleased to engage in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As am I.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is in the final stages \nof the biological opinion reporting on the Kootenai Sturgeon. I feel \nthis document is severely flawed. In the assessment, the economic \nimpact is determined to have ``no effect'' because the area of study is \n11 miles of river bottom. As there is no economic activity on the river \nbottom, I understand the conclusion of the biological opinion. However, \nI believe the area studied by the economic impact should be the \ncommunities affected by any changes in the operations of the Kootenai \nRiver.\n  The biological opinion states that the river should be operated above \n1,758 feet to support increased flows for Kootenai Sturgeon. Various \nstudies exist that dispute this number as being correct. When the river \nis operated above an elevation of 1,758 feet, the water table in the \nsurrounding area rises. As a result, farmers in the area lose crops. I \nargue this action is a significant economic impact.\n  I feel the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service should examine a realistic \narea as part of their economic impact analysis--that is the area in \nwhich an economic impact occurs. Before decisions are made that \ndrastically affect communities, all of the factors should be \nconsidered.\n  Mr. REID. I feel that the issues the Senator from Idaho raises are of \na concern, and I want to work with him to see that a solution is found.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Endangered Species Act has also significantly \naffected areas of my State. I want to work with the Senator from Idaho \nto find a solution to this issue and provide help for the affected \ncommunities.\n\n\n             funding for the green brook sub-basin project\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2002 energy and water \nappropriations bill provides appropriations for many important water \nresources projects for the state of New Jersey. I understand that these \nappropriations were made with limited funds and I am deeply grateful \nfor the support the Committee has provided to many of my requests. \nHowever, there is an important New Jersey project that was not fully \nappropriated and we respectfully ask the managers that if funds should \nbe made available during conference, that they consider fully funding \nthe President's budget request for the Green Brook Sub-Basin.\n  As you may know, flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused \ntremendous damage to the state of New Jersey--especially to the town of \nGreen Brook and the surrounding region. It is estimated that the \nflooding caused $6 million of damage to the region alone. \nUnfortunately, the floods from Hurricane Floyd were not the first to \nhave struck the area. Records have shown that floods have continuously \nstruck this area as early 1903. Disastrous flooding to the basin in the \nsummer of 1971 and in the summer of 1973--in which six people were \nkilled.\n  The Green Brook Sub-Basic project, which is located in north-central \nNew Jersey and spans throughout three counties, began in 2000. The \nproject will construct flood levees and flood walls, bridge raisings, \nclosure structures, individual flood proofings, and buyouts. As you can \nimagine, the completion of this project will provide needed relief and \nbring economic revitalization to the region.\n  The House of Representatives has already fully funded the project for \nfiscal year 1002.\n  Mr. CORZNE. Mr. President, I support my colleague from New Jersey's \nrequest and on our behalf, we would like to raise an additional issue \nwith the project. We also urge that the Committee Report language that \ndirects the Secretary of the Army to implement the locally requested \nplan in the western portion of Middlesex County with regards to the \nGreen Brook Sub-Basin projects to be included in the Energy and Water \nconference report. Many of the local residents that are affected by the \nGreen Brook Sub-Basin project have expressed their interest in changing \nthe project to include buyouts for this area. The report language will \nimplement the change as well as provide lands for badly needed \nrecreation and as well as fish and wildlife habitat enhancement. We are \nsupport this language and the House has included similar language in \ntheir committee report.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I understand the difficulty the \nmanagers will have in providing additional funds for the Green Brook \nSub-Basin project. However, the full funding of this project will \nprovide stability and economic revitalization to this very important \nregion in the state of New Jersey.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senators from New Jersey and assure him that \nthe committee will closely review his request.\n\n\n               SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the fiscal year \n2002 appropriations Act for Energy and Water Development I wonder if \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada would answer a question regarding \nfunding for environmental infrastructure.\n  I would like to know if the Senator would be willing to consider in \nconference sewer infrastructure funding for Michigan projects. The need \nto invest in sewer infrastructure is an urgent one facing the people of \nMichigan and the Army Corps of Engineers is in a position to address \nthat need. The Army Corps has had many success stories throughout the \ncountry in assisting communities in upgrading their sewer \ninfrastructure. I would greatly appreciate the Committee's assistance \nin protecting water quality in Michigan by addressing this problem.\n  Mr. REID. We recognize the need to upgrade our aging infrastructure \nto protect water quality throughout the Nation. I can assure my friend \nthat we will carefully consider his request in conference if indeed the \nConference committee is able to fund construction new starts and \nenvironmental infrastructure projects at conference, as we have done in \nthe past.\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Nevada and the committee for their \nhard work in putting together this important legislation.\n\n\n                      south dakota water projects\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership and \ncooperation in providing funding in the fiscal year 2002 Energy and \nWater Appropriations bill for key South Dakota rural water projects and \npriorities. As chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, he has \nprovided funding above the President's request and the House approved \nlevel for the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Project and the Mid-Dakota Rural \nWater Project. Moreover, the Senator funded other important water \nprojects in South Dakota such as the Lewis and Clark Rural Water \nSystem. Indeed, his commitment will benefit many South Dakotans.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my colleague from South Dakota that I appreciate \nhis efforts to work with me on this bill. As a new member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I know the Senator is a leader in advocating \nincreased investments for rural water projects in your State. I also \nunderstand the importance of rural water projects to the citizens of \nSouth Dakota and I look forward to continued cooperation on these and \nother priorities.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his assistance and \nrecognition of South Dakota's rural water needs. Despite the high \npriority given to provide funding for these South Dakota water \nprojects, two critical items remain important to me as the Senate works \nto complete action on the FY02 Energy and Water Appropriations bill in \nits upcoming conference with the House of Representatives.\n  First, the Mid-Dakota Rural Water Project is in need of an increase \nin funding to ensure the timely delivery of safe, clean, and affordable \nwater to citizens and communities served by that project. Second, the \nJames River Water Development District--a subdivision of State \ngovernment in South Dakota--requires funding to complete an \nEnvironmental Impact Statement on authorized projects along the James \nRiver watershed before the JRWDD can commence continued channel \nrestoration and improvements authorized by section 401(b) of the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 4128).\n  I respectfully request the Chairman's committing to review \nopportunities in conference committee negotiations on the FY02 Energy \nand Water Appropriations bill to consider additional funding for the \nMid-Dakota Rural Water System and to consider funding for the JRWDD to \ncomplete an EIS.\n  Mr. REID. I express to Senator Johnson my desire to consider \nopportunities in conference committee negotiations on the FY02 Energy \nand Water Appropriations bill to increase funding for the Mid-Dakota \nRural Water Project and to fund the James River Water Development \nDistrict in South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                        ESTUARY RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the managers of he \nfiscal year 2002 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill on \nthe issue of funding for the Estuary Restoration Act. Along with \nSenators Warner, Lieberman, and Smith of New Hampshire, I have offered \nan amendment that would provide $2 million in funding for the \nimplementation of the Estuary Act. Enacted last year, this bipartisan \nlaw establishes the Estuary Habitat Restoration Program with the goal \nof restoring one million acres of estuary habitat. We understand the \nbudgetary constraints that the Appropriations Committee is operating \nunder as this bill is being considered by the Senate. It is my hope \nthat the managers can identify funding for the implementation of the \nEstuary Restoration Act during the conference with the House.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I commend Senators Chafee, Warner, Lieberman, and Smith \nof New Hampshire for their dedication to the issue. I will work with my \ncolleagues during the conference with the House to identify potential \nsources of funding for the Estuary Restoration Act.\n  Mr. REID. I concur with Senator Domenici. There is no objection on \nthis side of the aisle to the Senator from Rhode Island's request.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senators and look forward to working with the \ncommittee to provide funding for the restoration of our Nation's \nimportant estuary environments.\n\n\n                          Small Wind Projects\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, for recognizing the important role small wind projects \nplay in our energy future. As my colleague knows, the State of Vermont \nhas been looking at the use of small wind projects. I appreciate the \nefforts of my colleague to provide $500,000 for a small wind project in \nVermont.\n  Mr. REID. Small wind projects are an important source of energy for \nrural areas that often are not connected to the electricity grid. Both \nVermont and Nevada have a number of these areas that benefit from this \nreliable, sustainable, clean source of energy.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. To ensure that these systems, which have power \ncapacities of less than 100 kilowatts, continue to play an important \nrole, the committee recognized the need for a set aside for small wind \nprograms. It is correct that the committee believes that not less than \n$10 million shall be made available for new and ongoing small wind \nprograms?\n  Mr. REID. This is correct. The committee believes this research is \nimportant, and the Department of Energy should set aside no less than \n$10 million for these programs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleague for his support of these important \nsmall wind energy projects, and I thank him for has continued \nleadership in making sure that renewable energy will be a large part of \nour energy mix.\n\n\n                        TRANSMISSION RELIABILITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe electric energy systems and storage program that funds transmission \nreliability. Improving the reliability of our Nation's transmission \nsystem is absolutely critical. I note that while the President's budget \nrequest substantially cuts funding for this critical program, the \nSenate has increased the funding from approximately $52 million last \nyear to $71 million this year. Transmission reliability is critical to \nensure that our nation's electricity supply actually reaches states \nand, ultimately, the homes and businesses where it is needed. We have \nseen in California, New York, and elsewhere, that when we don't have \nsufficient supply and transmission capacity, we experience blackouts \nand brownouts that have significant detrimental impacts on our economy.\n  We need to use this money to test new technologies--specifically \nComposite Conductor wire--that have the ability to dramatically \nincrease the efficiency of existing transmission wires. This type of \nwire eliminates the need for new wires, new rights-of-way, and new \nconstruction, which eliminates siting and permitting problems and \nrelated potential environmental impacts. We need to actually test this \nwire in different climatic and weather conditions to determine the \nefficacy of using this technology on a larger scale. To this end, I \nwould suggest to the Subcommittee that it provide funds to actually \nconduct field tests to achieve these objectives.\n  Mr. REID. I agree that we need to conduct such field tests. I know \nthat the Senator from North Dakota would like a field test in North \nDakota, which would be extremely valuable, with the State's cold and \nwind conditions, to help determine the effectiveness of this \ntechnology. I will work with the Senator in conference to address his \nrequest to test this technology in the field.\n\n\n                       Renewable Energy Research\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I \ncommend him for his efforts to promote the advancement and progress of \nrenewable energy sources that will help to address our energy \nchallenges. He has been a leader of these efforts, which are bearing \nreal fruit.\n  This bill actually increases renewable energy research, development \nand deployment programs for fiscal year 2002 by $60 million over last \nyear. These increases will help speed the deployment of these cutting-\nedge technologies.\n  But because the House had not fully funded certain solar R \nprograms, the committee put its emphasis for solar programs on those \nprograms that had not fared as well in the other\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nChamber. These programs, the Concentrating Solar Power program, and the \nSolar Buildings program with its innovative Zero Energy Buildings \ninitiative, are now on solid footing. But the photovoltaics program, \nthe program that has led to dramatic advances in those solar electric \npanels that we see popping up on the roofs of homes and businesses \nacross the country--this program was not fully funded by the Committee. \nMuch of this funding goes to the National Renewable Energy Lab in \nGolden, Colorado.\n  I understand the committee hopes to accept the House number for PV \nprograms in conference, and I just want to give the Senator from Nevada \nan opportunity to speak to this issue.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from Colorado. Yes, it is our intention \nto seek the House funding level for photovoltaics in conference, and \npush for our funding level for CSP and solar buildings. All three solar \nprograms deserve increases from the current fiscal year, and we intend \nto see this through in conference. I thank the Senator for his work on \nthis issue and for being a friend of clean, renewable energy programs.\n\n\n           Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada for his \nleadership on the Appropriations Energy and Water Subcommittee. I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Nevada whether I am correct in my \nunderstanding that the reason the Metropolitan North Georgia Water \nPlanning District, a project that was one of my highest priorities \nbecause of its importance to the people of my State and its priority \nwith the Governor of Georgia, was not included in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee report was because of the subcommittee's \npolicy made pursuant to budgetary constraints that new start \nconstruction and/or environmental infrastructure water projects will \nnot be addressed until the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nAct is considered in conference committee?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Am I also correct in my understanding that when the \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act is considered by the \nconference committee that the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning \nDistrict Project will be considered for inclusion in the conference \nreport?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is correct that the Metropolitan North Georgia \nWater Planning District project will be considered for inclusion in the \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act conference report. I \nwill make every effort to accommodate my colleague.\n\n\n              Consortium for plant biotechnology research\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, is the senator from Nevada aware of an \nentity called the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research, a \nnational consortium of industries, universities and federal \nlaboratories that together support research and technology transfers?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am aware of the consortium and am familiar with the \ngood work and significant achievements that the consortium has produced \nfor the Department of Energy in the past.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I understand that the committee was unable to include it \nin the Solar Renewable Account during its consideration of the energy \nand water development appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. As the energy and water development bill moves into \nconference, I hope the Senate can identify additional funds in the \nSolar and Renewable Account or another appropriate research account for \nthe consortium so that it can continue its important work.\n  Mr. REID. The Senate will do all it can to find these funds for the \nconsortium as we work with the House conferees on the bill.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I commend my colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, for \nhis work on behalf of the consortium and state my support for the \nallocation of funding for the consortium in the energy and water \ndevelopment appropriations bill in conference. The consortium, of which \nthe university of Colorado is a member, has an astounding record of \nobtaining private sector matching support for its research activities \nand has done an amazing job of commercializing its research product. \nFor every dollar invested in the consortium, $2.20 worth of research \nhas been conducted with private sector matching funds--an impressive \n120 percent private sector match. Additionally, the consortium has \nmanaged to commercialize its research within an average of three years, \ncompared to an industry average of about 10 years. Again, I would like \nto state my support for funding for this unique and efficient national \nresearch institution.\n  Mr. REID. The committee is award of the good work the consortium has \nproduced with department of Energy funding over the past decade. The \nSenate will do its best to try and identify funding for the consortium \nwhile in conference with the House.\n\n\n                       gas cooled reactor systems\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as some Members may be aware, I have \nsupported the development of gas cooled reactor systems, both small and \nlarge, for the provision of electric power and useful heat for our \ncities. As currently envisioned, gas cooled reactors will be meltdown \nproof, create substantially less radioactive waste and will be more \nefficient than our current generation of reactors.\n  Currently, the Department of Energy is funding a joint U.S.-Russian \neffort to develop the Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor for the \npurpose of burning up surplus Russian weapons plutonium. This \ntremendously successful swords to plowshares project is making great \ntechnical progress and employs more than 500 Russian weapons scientists \nand nuclear engineers.\n  Although the GT-MHR unit built in Russia will be primarily for \nburning plutonium, that same meltdown proof reactor type can be easily \nconverted into a uranium burning commercial reactor for use around the \nglobe. Indeed, the Appropriations Committee's report notes that ``the \nUnited States must take full advantage of the development of this \nattractive technology for a possible next generation nuclear power \nreactor for United States and foreign markets''.\n  However, the committee's bill does not explicitly provide any dollars \nfor the commercialization of the GT-MHR design.\n  The senior Senator from New Mexico is a leader in nuclear energy and \nresearch. I want to ask my good friend, the Ranking Member of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee, the following question regarding the \ncommercialization of the GT-MHR: the ``Nuclear Energy Technologies'' \naccount in the bill provides $7 million for Generation IV reactor \ndevelopment and for further research on small, modular nuclear \nreactors. Given that the federal government is already making a \nsubstantial investment on the GT-MHR for non-proliferation purposes, \nand given the near-term promise of this reactor, doesn't it make sense \nthat at least one-half of the $7 million provided be used by the \nDepartment of Energy for GT-MHR commercialization efforts?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my friend from Alaska for his observations and \nfor his question. As the Senator knows, I too am a great fan of the \ndevelopment of the GT-MHR in Russia and indeed, I was the Senator that \ninitiated the first Federal funding for this program. The question is a \nfair one and I will have to say that his observations and the \nconclusion he draws from them are correct. I agree that a substantial \nportion of the $7 million in funding should indeed be put to good use \nin commercializing the GT-MHR which is being designed with great cost-\neffectiveness and success in Russia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my good friend from New Mexico for his response. \nSmall modular reactors which are of great potential importance to rural \nareas and hence of great interest to me. Last year, at my request, \nCongress provided $1 million for the Department of Energy to study the \nfeasibility of small modular nuclear reactors for deployment in remote \nlocations. That report is now done and in brief, the Department of \nEnergy has concluded that such reactors are not only feasible, but may \neventually be a very desirable alternative for many remote communities \nwithout access to clean, affordable power sources.\n  Importantly, one of the most desirable remote reactor types the \nDepartment examined was a reduced sized\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\nversion of the GT-MHR called the Remote Site Modular Helium Reactor. \nGiven the outstanding characteristics of this remote reactor as \nidentified in the Department's report and given that the Department is \nalready developing the basic technology via the Russian program, I \nbelieve the Department of Energy should focus on further developing the \nRS-MHR in the upcoming year.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                 NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY HARBOR NAVIGATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there are currently three major federally \nauthorized and sponsored navigation projects under construction in the \nPort of New York and New Jersey and a fourth in the preconstruction, \nengineering, and design phase. The projects that would deepen the \nArthur Kill Channel to 41 feet, the Kill van Kull Channel to 45 feet, \nthe Port Jersey and New York Harbor channels to 41 feet, are being \nbuilt. An overarching project called the New York-New Jersey Harbor \nNavigation project which would take these channels to 50-feet depths is \nin PED.\n  These projects are staggered in this fashion only because of the \norder in which they were authorized. I would ask my colleague from New \nJersey if there is any other reason for this segmentation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. There certainly is no policy reason. In fact, each \nconstituent project has passed a cost-benefit analysis, each has been \nshown to be in the federal interest, and each is subject to the \nappropriate cost-share consistent with Water Resource Development Act \npolicy. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will fund the \nnon-Federal share of each of these projects.\n  Since the Harbor Navigation Project was authorized last year, the \nArmy Corps and the Port Authority have been working to formulate a plan \nthat would allow these projects to be managed as one in order to \nprovide time and cost savings. They have recently concluded that doing \nthis could result in as much as $400 million in savings to the Federal \nTreasury.\n  But in order to achieve that savings, it is important that we begin \nlooking at joint management of these projects as soon as possible. I \nask the distinguished Chairman, if Senators Corzine, Clinton, Schumer \nand myself can demonstrate that the Army Corps could achieve \nsubstantial future Federal savings by jointly managing all four of \nthese projects, would he assist us in our efforts to secure conference \nreport language that would allow the Corps to manage these projects in \nthis manner?\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friends, the Senators from New York and \nNew Jersey, that I am appreciative of their desire to reduce the cost \nof major Army Corps projects. They know as well as I do that the Corps \nhas a $40 plus billion backlog of authorized projects. I am concerned \nabout a few aspects of this request, however. I am concerned that this \nrequest would have effects on the WRDA cost-share policy, which \nrequires greater non-federal contributions for navigation projects that \ngo deeper than 45 feet. I would not want the Army Corps to conclude \nthat it could apply the cost-shares for the Kill van Kull, Arthur Kill, \nor Port Jersey project to the effort to bring about 50-foot channel \ndepths, which require a larger non-federal contribution. I hope the \nSenators would understand that, as a member of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee, I could not support appropriations language \nthat would undermine the WRDA policy or the committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would respond to my friend, the distinguished \nchairman, that the report language we seek will be consistent with the \nWRDA policy regarding the appropriate cost-share for navigation \nproject. I would also say that we intend to secure the Army Corps' \nsupport as well as that of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee Chairman. We are merely raising this issue tonight because we \nhave not been able to settle this matter yet, and need some additional \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. In the interest of constructing these projects as quickly \nas possible and with the greatest savings to the American taxpayer, I \nwould respond to my colleague that we will be happy to consider any \nsuch conference report language. I urge him to get it to us as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. On behalf myself and the Senator from New York, I \nthank the chairman.\n\n\n                            mixed oxide fuel\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I drafted an amendment to the FY02 \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee to delay plutonium shipments to the \nSavannah River Site until the administration solidifies its commitment \nto South Carolina to treat weapons-grade material and move them off-\nsite. I understand this may be viewed as an extreme measure, but the \nresult of budget cuts to Fissile Materials Disposition programs by DOE \nforced the NNSA to abandon a concurrent dual track approach for \nplutonium disposition and to substitute a risky ``layered'' approach. \nDespite administration briefings and testimony before Congress, there \nremain serious concerns about the disposition strategy contemplated by \nDOE and significant risk to South Carolina to store these materials for \nan extended duration, maybe indefinitely, before they are processed.\n  I fully understand the DOE-wide implications of delaying the closing \nof Rocky Flats and empathize with my colleague from Colorado's keen \ninterest in closing the site. South Carolina, and other DOE-site \nstates, have been instrumental in assisting Colorado in meeting DOE \nmilestone to close the site ahead of schedule. South Carolina should \nhave a definite timetable for treating waste on site and an identified \npathway out, too, just like Colorado. I am pleased to have the \ncommitment of my colleagues from the Armed Services Committee to assist \nin addressing the outstanding issues with the fissile materials \ndisposition program. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I join my colleague, Senator Hollings, and express my \nconcern regarding recent developments in the Plutonium Disposition \nProgram. I thank him for bringing this discussion to the floor today.\n  The Plutonium Disposition Program, particularly the Mixed Oxide Fuel \nProgram is of critical importance to our Nation. There are invaluable \nnational security aspects, including the counter-proliferation mission. \nIn addition, the MOX program can be an important factor in addressing \nour Nation's energy needs.\n  I have had many conversations with administration officials on this \nmatter. I received personal assurances from the Secretary of Energy, \nwho stated MOX is his ``highest nonproliferation priority.'' Yet I am \nstill concerned the administration is not fully committed to the \nPlutonium Disposition Program, leaving South Carolina as a dumping \nground for our Nation's surplus nuclear weapons material.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for his remarks. I would appreciate \nSenator Thurmond's views on MOX as a primary option for plutonium \ndisposition. Would you also agree that South Carolina should also be \nprovided a concurrent back-up option to MOX?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senator for his question. While MOX should \nbe the primary disposition option, I do agree there should be a backup \nplan for disposing surplus plutonium. I will work with my colleagues to \nrequire the administration to guarantee a back-up plan.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator. I would inquire of my colleague on \nhis views on the cost of not proceeding. Would the Senator agree that \nnot dealing with the existing stockpiles of nuclear materials and \noxides found at DOE industrial and research sites will ultimately cost \nmore than the construction of the MOX facility and the Plutonium \nImmobilization Plant?\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator is correct, the status quo simply does not \nmake fiscal sense. It is my understanding that the cost of the two \nplants together is less than the cost of current storage requirements, \nover a comparable time period. In fact, according to a November 1996 \nDOE report entitled ``Technical Summary for Long Term Storage of \nWeapons-Useable Fissile Materials,'' building and operating the MOX \nplant over a 50-year period, is over $1 billion less than the costs of \nmaintaining the current infrastructure.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank my good friend, Senator Hollings, for allowing me \nto speak on matter and for compromising on his amendment regarding \nplutonium disposition. As the Senator\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\nknows, I was opposed to his original amendment and glad to see that a \ncompromise has been reached regarding this very important issue of \nfissile materials disposition. The Senator's original amendment would \nhave prohibited any funding for the transportation of surplus U.S. \nplutonium to the Savannah River Site until a final agreement was \nconcluded for primary and secondary disposition activities.\n  All members with a DOE site located in their State understand how \nsensitive these issues are to our constituents. But we also understand \nthe importance of the nationwide integration of sites to ensure that \nDOE can continue to meet all its needs and requirements.\n  Representing Colorado and Rocky Flats, I was concerned that this \namendment could have delayed the shipment of plutonium to SRS by at \nleast 1 year, delaying the scheduled 2006 closure date, costing at \nleast $300 million a year. As the ranking member of the Strategic \nSubcommittee on the Armed Services Committee, I was concerned that this \namendment could have interrupted the delicate balance of integration \nbetween all the sites by delaying shipments from Lawrence Livermore \nNational Laboratory, Hanford, the Mound Site in Ohio to SRS, possibly \ntriggering a chain reaction by other sites to deny SRS waste.\n  However, I definitely understand South Carolina's concerns regarding \nthe ability of SRS to properly dispose of DOE surplus plutonium. To my \ncolleagues from South Carolina, I strongly support the establishment of \na Mixed Oxide Fuel facility at SRS and will do all I can to assist in \nestablishing some form of backup capability at the site as well.\n  As one member who is sensitive to these concerns, I pledge to work \nwith my South Carolina colleagues on this very important issue, not \nonly for South Carolina, but also for the sake of the entire DOE \ncomplex.\n  I admire Senator Hollings' persistence on this matter and for working \nwith all of us who had concerns. I pledge to work not only with all \nmembers who have a DOE site to ensure a smooth and workable integration \nof sites regarding the treatment and disposal of waste. As chairman and \nranking member of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Reed and I will have an opportunity to address the \nplutonium disposition program as part of the FY02 National Defense \nAuthorization Bill. I again thank the Senator for this opportunity to \nexpress my concerns and gratitude.\n  Mr. REED. I thank my colleagues from South Carolina for raising this \nvery important issue. I also want to commend my colleague from Colorado \nfor working with senators from South Carolina on this matter. As the \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, \nI am very interested in ensuring that DOE sites are closed in a timely \nmanner and that the waste is treated and disposed of properly. I want \nto assure my colleagues that the Strategic Subcommittee will carefully \nexamine this issue as the Senate Armed Services Committee considers the \nFiscal Year 2002 Defense Authorization bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill is important to the Nation's energy resources, \nimproving water infrastructure, and ensuring our national security \ninterests. Let me first commend the managers of this bill, the \ndistinguished Chairman Senator Reid and Ranking Member Senator \nDomenici, for their hard work in completing the Senate bill in order to \nmove the appropriations process forward.\n  The bill provides funding for critical cleanup activities at various \nsites across the country and continues ongoing water infrastructure \nprojects managed by the Army Corp of Engineers and the Bureau of \nReclamation. The bill also increases resources for renewable energy \nresearch and nuclear energy programs that are critical to ensuring a \ndiverse energy supply for this Nation.\n  These are all laudable and important activities, particularly given \nthe energy problems facing our Nation. While I have great respect for \nthe work of my colleagues to complete the committee recommendations for \nthe agencies funded in this bill, I am also disappointed that the \nappropriators have once again failed to abide by a fair and responsible \nbudget process by inflating this bill with porkbarrel spending. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues have determined that their ability to \nincrease energy spending is just another opportunity to increase \nporkbarrel spending.\n  This bill is 5.8 percent higher than the level enacted in fiscal year \n2001, which is greater than the 4 percent increase in discretionary \nspending that the President wanted to adhere to.\n  In real dollars, this is $2.4 billion in additional spending above \nthe amount requested by the President, and $1.4 billion higher than \nlast year. So far this year, with just two appropriations bills \nconsidered, spending levels have exceeded the president's budget \nrequest by more than $3 billion.\n  A good amount of this increase is in the form of parochial spending \nfor unrequested projects. In this bill, I have identified 442 separate \nearmarks totaling $732 million, which is greater than the 328 earmarks, \nor $300 million, in the Senate bill passed last year.\n  I have no doubt that many of my colleagues will assert the need to \nexpend Federal dollars for their hometown Army Corps projects or to \nfund development of biomass or ethanol projects in their respective \nStates. If these projects had been approved through a competitive, \nmerit-based prioritization process or if the American public had a \ngreater voice in determining if these projects are indeed the wisest \nand best use of their tax dollars, then I would not object.\n  The reality is that very few people know how billions of dollars are \nspent in the routine cycle of the appropriations process. No doubt, the \ngeneral public would be appalled that many of the funded projects are, \nat best, questionable--or worse, unauthorized, or singled out for \nspecial treatment because of politics.\n  This is truly a disservice to the American people who rely on the \nCongress to utilize prudent judgement in the budget approval process.\n  Let me share a few examples of what the appropriators are earmarking \nthis year: additional $10 million for the Denali Commission, a regional \ncommission serving only the needs of Alaska; $200,000 to study \nindividual ditch systems in the state of Hawaii; earmark of $300,000 \nfor Aunt Lydia's Cove in Massachusetts; $300,000 to remove aquatic \nweeds in the Lavaca and Navidad Rivers in Texas; $3 million for a South \nDakota integrated ethanol complex; $2 million for the Sealaska ethanol \nproject; two separate earmarks, totaling $5 million, for gasification \nof Iowa Switch Grass; additional $2.7 million to pay for electrical \npower systems, bus upgrades and communications in Nevada; $500,000 to \nresearch brine waste disposal alternatives in Arizona and Nevada; and, \n$9.5 million to pay for demonstrations of erosion control in \nMississippi.\n  These are just a few examples from the 24-page list of objectionable \nprovisions I found in this bill and its accompanying report.\n  As I learned during the consideration of the Interior appropriations \nbill when my efforts failed to cut wasteful spending for a particular \nspecial interest project, an overwhelming majority of my colleagues \naccept and embrace the practice of porkbarrel spending.\n  I respect the work of my colleagues on the appropriations committee. \nHowever, I do not believe that the Congress should have absolute \ndiscretion to tell the Army Corps or the Bureau of Reclamation how best \nto spend millions of taxpayer dollars for purely parochial projects.\n  I repeat my conviction that our budget process should be free from \nsuch blatant and rampant porkbarrel spending. Unfortunately, to the \ndetriment of American taxpayers, the practice of porkbarrel spending \nhas advanced at light-speed in the last decade and shows no sign of \nabating.\n  Just look at the numbers.\n  We have witnessed an explosion of unrequested projects passed by \nCongress in the last decade. According to the Office of Management and \nBudget, there were 1,724 unrequested projects in 1993; 3,476 in 2000; \nand 6,454 unrequested projects this fiscal year.\n  We all know the direction this spending train is going. Come October, \nspending bills will be piled-up, frantic negotiations will ensue, a \ngrand deal will be struck, and guess what? Those spending caps we were \nsupposed to abide by will just fade away.\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\n  I hope I am wrong.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the \nMaterial Protection, Control, and Accounting, or MPC, program managed \nby the Department of Energy to better secure and protect nuclear \nweapons and materials in the former Soviet Union. I want to strongly \nurge the House-Senate conference committee for this bill to increase \nthe funding for this important initiative. I call upon the Senate \nconferees to join with our House colleagues in supporting a $190 \nmillion funding level for fiscal year 2002.\n  The MPC program is often referred to as the first line of defense \nin safeguarding Russian nuclear materials against potential diversion \nor theft. From the mundane, such as installing barbed wire fences \naround sites, to more sophisticated measures like implementing \ncomputerized material accounting systems to keep track of nuclear \nmaterials, the MPC program helps ensure that rogue regimes and \nterrorist groups do not have access to the most dangerous byproducts of \nthe cold war.\n  Let me make clear that this program has been considered an enormous \nsuccess. Various studies and reports have confirmed the cost \neffectiveness of this program. Simply put, it benefits both Russia and \nthe United States, as well as all the other former members of the \nSoviet Union.\n  But our current efforts may not be enough. A high-level bipartisan \nlevel headed by former Majority Leader Howard Baker and Lloyd Cutler \ndeclared earlier this year:\n\n       While the security of hundreds of tons of Russian material \n     has been improved under the MPC Program, comprehensive \n     security upgrades have covered only a modest fraction of the \n     weapons-usable material. There is no program yet in place to \n     provide incentives, resources, and organizational arrangement \n     for Russia to sustain high levels of security.\n\n  The Baker-Cutler panel goes on to recommend $5 billion in \nimprovements and upgrades to the MPC program over the next 8 to 10 \nyears to accomplish these objectives.\n  That may be too ambitious an objective given our current budget \nenvironment. At the very least, the Baker-Cutler report points to the \nneed to build upon, not cut back, existing funding for the MPC \nprogram. In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee in March, \nSenator, and now Ambassador, Baker offered a personal concern:\n\n       I am a little short of terrified at some of the storage \n     facilities for nuclear material and nuclear weapons; and \n     relatively small investments can yield enormous improvements \n     in storage and security. So, from my standpoint, that is my \n     first priority.\n\n  I share his well-grounded fear, and I hope my colleagues in both \nhouses will recognize the vital benefits that the MPC program \ncontributes to our national security.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nEnergy and Water Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002. I \nbelieve the Senate has addressed these very complex matters \nappropriately.\n  As we all know, this bill funds many significant projects. Of \nparticular significance to me is the critical funding this bill \nprovides for the clean-up activities at our Nation's Department of \nEnergy nuclear weapons sites and more specifically the Savannah River \nSite (SRS) in my hometown of Aiken, SC. I was disappointed by the \nadministration's proposed budget for these activities, and have \nindicated so publicly on numerous occasions. At SRS alone, the fiscal \nyear 2002 request was almost $160 million less than the previous year. \nThis bill provides an additional $181 million for these crucial cleanup \nactivities and should ensure that SRS will stay on schedule to meet its \nfuture regulatory commitments to the State of South Carolina as well as \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  While I am supportive of most elements of this bill there were some \nissues which concerned me. Specifically, the report which accompanies \nthis bill included a directive that the Department of Energy transfer \nthe Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT) project from the \nOffice of Defense Programs within the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration (NNSA) to the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and \nTechnology for inclusion in the Advanced Accelerator Applications \noffice.\n  I disagree with this proposal and will oppose such a move. First and \nforemost, this is an appropriations bill, not an authorization. The APT \nprogram was authorized in section 3134 of the Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 2000 as a defense program. I wholeheartedly support \nexploring additional scientific, engineering research, development and \ndemonstrations with this superb technology and I believe this work may \nyield dramatic advances. However, APT is and should remain a Defense \nProgram. Last year, the Department established a new Accelerator \nDevelopment effort. This office is ``Co-Chaired'' by the NNSA's Office \nof Defense Programs and the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear \nEnergy, Science and Technology. I have no objections of combining \nefforts at the Department of Energy where appropriate, however, the \nprimary mission of the APT is, as defined by law, to serve as a backup \nsource of tritium for our nation's strategic arsenal.\n  Finally, I would like to discuss the Fissile Materials Disposition \nPrograms as discussed in the bill. This bill correctly describes the \nexcess weapons grade plutonium in Russia as a ``clear and present \ndanger to the security of United States. . . .'' I believe it is in the \nbest interest of all Americans to move forward with this program \nexpeditiously. I am further pleased that the administration fully \nfunded the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility to be constructed at \nthe Savannah River Site. Unfortunately, I have recently heard some \ntroubling stories regarding the commitment of the White House to this \nimportant program.\n  The New York Times ran a story this Monday, July 16, 2001 entitled \n``U.S. Review on Russia Urges Keeping Most Arms Control,'' which \ngreatly concerned me.\n  According to the article, while most of the programs initiated in the \nprevious Administration will be retained, ``the White House plans to \noverhaul a hugely expensive effort to enable Russia and the United \nStates to each destroy 34 tons of stored plutonium. . . .'' Mr. \nPresident, what the White House is discussing here is the Mixed Oxide \nFuel Program, known as MOX. This facility is planned for the Savannah \nRiver Site.\n\n  As you likely already know, the MOX program has an invaluable \ncounter-proliferation mission. Thanks to an agreement with the Russian \nGovernment, signed last year, the MOX program will help take weapons \ngrade plutonium out of former Soviet stockpiles, and will also divert \nsuch materials from potentially falling into the hands of rogue \nnations, terrorists, or criminal organizations. In and of itself, this \nclearly makes the MOX program worth every penny. Earlier this year I \nasked Secretary of Energy Abraham where he stands on this program and \nhe responded that MOX is his ``highest nonproliferation priority.''\n  Beyond the important national security aspects of this program there \nare many domestic issues which must be considered in evaluating this \nprogram. From the standpoint of providing a much needed source of \nenergy, MOX makes good sense. Presently, there are quite literally tons \nof surplus nuclear weapons materials stored throughout the Department \nof Energy (DOE) industrial complex that could be processed in our MOX \nfacility and reintroduced as a fuel for commercial nuclear reactors. \nHere is the beauty of this program, once MOX is burned in selected \nreactors it is gone for good. It cannot be used for weapons ever again \nand there is no more need for storage.\n  Furthermore, I am convinced that not dealing with the existing \nstockpiles of nuclear materials and oxides that are found at the six \nDOE industrial and research sites will ultimately cost substantially \nmore than the construction of the MOX facility. According to the \npreviously mentioned news article, ``the administration insists it is \nstill exploring less expensive options.'' According to a November 29, \n1996 DOE report entitled Technical Summary for Long Term Storage of \nWeapons-Useable Fissile Materials, the costs of maintaining the current \ninfrastructure far exceeds the costs of building and operating the MOX \nplant according to the current plan. According to the report, the cost \nfor storage of plutonium in constant 1996 dollars is estimated to be \napproximately ``$380 million per year and the operating cost\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nfor 50 years of operation at approximately $3.2 billion. The cost is \ninsensitive to where the plutonium is stored at any one of the four \nsites.'' The status quo simply does not make fiscal sense.\n  Perhaps the most critical domestic consideration regarding the MOX \nprogram is that it creates a ``path out'' for materials currently being \nstored at SRS and awaiting processing as well as those materials that \ncould be shipped to the site and processed there in the future. South \nCarolina agreed to accept nuclear materials shipments into SRS based on \nthe understanding that an expeditious ``pathway out'' would exist. \nCanceling the Plutonium Disposition Program eliminates the ``path \nout.'' Neither I nor anyone else who represents South Carolina at the \nFederal or State level is willing to see the Savannah River Site become \nthe de facto dumping ground for the nation's nuclear materials. If the \n``path out'' for these materials disappears, then the ``path in'' to \nthe Savannah River Site is likely to become muddy. That is bad for \ncleanup nationwide.\n  Ambassador Howard Baker and Mr. Lloyd Cutler reached a series of \nconclusions in their recent report from the Russia Task Force, any one \nof which justifies aggressive support for the MOX program. However one \nstatement struck me as particularly poignant. Specifically, as stated \nin the report, ``the national security benefits to U.S. citizens from \nsecuring and/or neutralizing the equivalent of more than 80,000 nuclear \nweapons and potential weapons would constitute the highest return on \ninvestment in any current U.S. national security and defense program.''\n  I am concerned by the signals coming from the White House. I intend \nto ask President Bush to publicly support this initiative and put an \nend to my concerns as well as those of my colleagues and all of the \nstates involved.\n  In closing, this is a good bill and I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times \narticle in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 16, 2001]\n\n         U.S. Review on Russia Urges Keeping Most Arms Controls\n\n               (By Judith Miller with Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       A Bush administration review of American assistance to \n     Russia has concluded that most of the programs aimed at \n     helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear, chemical and \n     biological weapons are vital to American security and should \n     be continued, a senior administration official says. Some may \n     even be expanded.\n       But the White House wants to restructure or end two \n     programs: a $2.1 billion effort to dispose of hundreds of \n     tons of military plutonium and a program to shrink Russian \n     cities that were devoted to nuclear weapons development, and \n     to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists, the \n     official said in an interview on Friday. Both these programs \n     have been criticized in Congress.\n       The review also calls for a shift in philosophy from \n     ``assistance to partnership'' with Russia.\n       To do that, the official said, Russia would have to \n     demonstrate a willingness to make a financial and political \n     commitment to stop the spread of advanced conventional \n     weapons and to end its sale of nuclear and other military-\n     related expertise and technology to Iran and other nations \n     unfriendly to the United States.\n       One administration official said the issue of how to handle \n     Russia's sales of sensitive technology and expertise not only \n     to Iran, Iraq, Libya and others hostile to America was being \n     considered separately by the White House. No decisions have \n     been made yet.\n       But on those issues, it would be ``hard to create a \n     partnership if we think that Russia is proliferating,'' this \n     official added. ``It's not a condition; it's a fact of \n     life.''\n       Administration officials said the recommendation to extend \n     most Administration officials said the recommendation to \n     extend most nonproliferation programs was not conditioned \n     upon Russian acquiescence to the administration's \n     determination to build a nuclear missile shield.\n       The review covered 30 programs with an annual outlay of \n     some $800 million. They are a cornerstone of America's \n     scientific and military relationship with Russia. The \n     programs, involving mostly the Pentagon, the Energy \n     Department and the State Department, pay for the dismantling \n     of weapons facilities and the strengthening of security at \n     sites where nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are \n     stored.\n       President Bush is expected to discuss some of these \n     programs when he meets with President Vladimir V. Putin next \n     weekend. That meeting, in Genoa, Italy, is expected to focus \n     on American plans to build the missile shield, which the \n     Americans admit would violate a longstanding treaty between \n     the two nations.\n       The administration's endorsement of most of the \n     nonproliferation programs begun by the Clinton administration \n     will not surprise most legislators, given that the \n     administration is now trying to avoid being portrayed as \n     single-minded on national security matters in its pursuit of \n     a missile shield, and as unresponsive to European support for \n     arms control.\n       Officials said that although cabinet officials had \n     discussed the review's findings, no final decisions on the \n     recommendations would be made until Congress reacted to the \n     proposals. The administration has begun arranging to brief \n     key legislators on the results of its review, which began in \n     April and was conducted by an expert on Russia on loan from \n     the State Department to the National Security Council office \n     that deals with nonproliferation strategy. That office is \n     headed by Bob Joseph.\n       In interviews, administration officials said the White \n     House would not overlook Russian efforts to weaken the \n     programs by restricting access to weapons plants or by \n     erecting obstacles to meeting nonproliferation commitments. \n     ``We have a high standard for Russian behavior,'' one \n     official said.\n       The review has concluded that most of the $420 million \n     worth of the Pentagon's programs--called Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction--are ``effectively managed'' and advance American \n     interests.\n       The White House also intends to expand State Department \n     programs that help Russian scientists engage in peaceful work \n     through the Moscow-based International Science and Technology \n     Center, which the European Union and Japan also support, and \n     other institutions.\n       But some big-ticket programs whose budgets have already \n     been slashed or criticized on Capitol Hill are likely to be \n     shut down or ``refocused,'' the official said.\n       Though it is no longer very expensive, another program, the \n     Nuclear Cities Initiative, has already been scaled back by \n     Congress. It was begun in 1998 to help create nonmilitary \n     work for Russia's 122,000 nuclear scientists and to help \n     Russia downsize geographically and economically isolated \n     nuclear cities, where 760,000 people live.\n       Unhappy with both the cost and the Russian reluctance to \n     open these cities.\n       Unhappy with both the cost and the Russian reluctance to \n     open these cities fully to Western visitors, Congress has \n     repeatedly slashed money for the program. Under the Bush \n     review, the undefined ``positive aspects'' would be merged \n     into other programs, and most of the program closed.\n       The Clinton administration had begun the program to provide \n     civilian work for Russia's closed nuclear cities. The aim was \n     to prevent nuclear scientists there from leaving for Iraq, \n     Iran and other aspiring nuclear powers. Under the program, \n     the Russians would also have to expedite the closure of two \n     warhead-assembly plants and their conversion to civilian \n     production.\n       ``The administration will be missing an opportunity to shut \n     down two warhead production plants if it abandons the Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative,'' said Rose Gottemoeller, a senior Energy \n     Department official during the Clinton administration. The \n     administration says Russia plans to close those two \n     facilities in any event.\n       The White House also intends to overhaul a hugely expensive \n     effort to enable Russia and the United States each to destroy \n     34 tons of stored plutonium by building facilities in Russia \n     and the United States. The program, as currently structured, \n     will cost Russia $2.1 billion and the United States $6.5 \n     billion, at a minimum. The administration has pledged $400 \n     million and has already appropriated $240 million.\n       In February 2000, the Clinton administration wrested a \n     promise from Russia to stop making plutonium out of fuel from \n     its civilian power reactors as part of a research and aid \n     package. While Russia was supposed to stop adding to its \n     estimated stockpile of 160 tons of military plutonium by \n     shutting down three military reactors last December, Moscow \n     was unable to do so because the reactors, near Tomsk and \n     Krasnoyarsk, provide heat and electricity to those cities.\n       Critics said the original program was too costly and was \n     not moving forward. But supporters say the Bush \n     administration should try harder to solicit funds from \n     European and other governments before shelving the effort and \n     walking away from the accord.\n       The administration insists it is still exploring less \n     expensive options.\n       The administration has also deferred a decision on a \n     commitment to help Russia build facilities to destroy 40,000 \n     tons of chemical weapons, the world's such stockpile. The \n     first plant has been completed at Gorny, 660 miles southeast \n     of Moscow, but American assistance to build a second plant at \n     Shchuchye, 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, has been frozen \n     by Congress.\n       Many legislators have complained that the Russian have not \n     fully declared the total and type of chemical weapons they \n     made, and that they have put up too little of their own money \n     for the project.\n       In February, however, Russia announced that it had \n     increased its annual budget for destroying the weapons \n     sixfold, to $105 million, and presented a plan to begin \n     operating the first of three destruction plants. The \n     administration official said this reflected a ``significant \n     change'' in Russia's attitude towards commitments that \n     ``could have an impact on our thinking'' about the program.\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\n       The Russians hope to destroy their vast chemical stocks by \n     2012, a deadline.\n       The Russians hope to destroy their vast chemical stocks by \n     2012, a deadline that will require that they obtain a five-\n     year extension. But Moscow will not be able to meet even that \n     deferred deadline unless construction begins soon for a \n     destruction installation at Shchuchye.\n       The Clinton administration, after Congress slashed funds \n     for the project, lined up support from several foreign \n     governments.\n       Elisa Harris, a research fellow at the University of \n     Maryland and a former specialist on chemical weapons for \n     President Clinton's National Security Council, said the \n     destruction effort could falter unless the Bush \n     administration persuaded Congress to rescind the ban and \n     finally support the program.\n       Commenting on the review, Leon Fuerth, a visiting professor \n     of international affairs at George Washington University and \n     the national security adviser to former Vice president Al \n     Gore, said, ``By and large they are going to sustain what \n     they inherited, which is good for the country.''\n       But the senior Bush administration official said the review \n     did not endorse the Clinton approach. This administration, he \n     said, is determined to ``establish better and more cost-\n     efficient ways'' of achieving its nonproliferation goals and \n     integrating such programs into a comprehensive strategy \n     toward Russia. He said the White House planned to form a \n     White House steering group ``to assure that the programs are \n     well managed and better coordinated.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly with respect to \nthe nomination of Roger W. Ferguson to the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System. I understand later today at the appropriate \ntime we will be taking up the Ferguson nomination. As I understand it \nthat will be after the Graham nomination. This seems an opportune time \nto take a moment or two because, presumably, at the time we vote people \nmay be in somewhat of a hurry to draw our business to a conclusion.\n  The nomination of Roger Ferguson was reported out of the Banking \nCommittee on July 12 with one dissenting vote in the committee. He is \ncurrently a member of the Federal Reserve Board. This would be for \nanother term on the Board, a reappointment. He was nominated for \nanother term by President Clinton in 1999, but action was not taken on \nthat nomination so it simply remained pending, although he continued \nunder the applicable rules that govern membership on the Board of \nGovernors, to serve on the Board. In the first part of this year, \nPresident Bush resubmitted his nomination to the Senate for membership \non the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a term of \n14 years, which is the standard term for members of the Board of \nGovernors.\n  I simply want to say to my colleagues that we think Mr. Ferguson has \ndone a fine job as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System. He has assumed a number of areas of prime \nresponsibility in the workings of the Board. We think of the Board \nprimarily in terms of its monetary policy decisions, but of course the \nBoard has a whole range of other responsibilities that affect the \nfinancial system of the country. There are many day-to-day \nresponsibilities.\n  Roger Ferguson has been an integral part of the Board's activities. \nHe is spoken of very highly by those who watch the Board and by the \nmembers of the Board themselves, including the Chairman. He has also \nassumed a special responsibility to work on the question of diversity \nin the Federal Reserve System in terms of its employment and membership \npractices. In fact, at his hearing we asked him some questions on that \nsubject on the basis of a communication we had received from members of \nthe minority caucuses in the House of Representatives. He was quite \nforthcoming in his responses and underscored the effort they were \nmaking\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nin this area at the Federal Reserve. In response to these questions, he \nundertook to once again carefully review and examine Board policy and \nto intensify their efforts to ensure more diversity in the workings of \nthe Federal Reserve System.\n  I urge his confirmation to my colleagues. I very much hope, when he \ncomes before us for a vote, we will have very strong support for his \nreappointment to the Federal Reserve System.\n  We need to get these members into place at the Federal Reserve Board \nbecause there are a couple of vacancies there.\n  One of the Board of Governors also announced his intention to retire. \nThe President has announced his intention to nominate a couple of \nmembers. Those nominations have not yet been sent to us, thus we have \nnot yet received them.\n  In an effort to keep the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in \nsufficient number, I urge my colleagues to approve the Ferguson \nnomination when it comes before us later tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of John D. Graham \nof Massachusetts, to be Administrator of the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the information of Senators \ninterested in the schedule this evening, it is our intention to \ncomplete the debate on the two nominations. I know of no interest in \ndebate on the Ferguson nomination, but there is, of course, debate on \nthe Graham nomination.\n  Following completion of debate on the nominees, it is my expectation \nand determination to move to the legislative branch appropriations \nbill, and that would be the final piece of business to be completed \ntonight.\n  Tomorrow, it is my hope--and this matter has yet to be completely \nresolved--that we move to three judicial nominations and then proceed \nto the Transportation appropriations bill. We will have more to say \nabout that later in the evening.\n  For now, I hope we could begin the debate on the Graham nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7906-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2299\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

GRAHAM OF MASSACHUSETTS TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF \nTHE OFFICE OF INFORMATION AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT \n                          AND BUDGET--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nDr. John Graham for the position of Administrator of OMB's Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs.\n  On May 23, the Governmental Affairs Committee reported the nomination \nof Dr. Graham with a vote of 9-3 or 11-4, if you count proxies. The \nbipartisan vote included Republican members of the committee, as well \nas Senators Levin, Carper, and Carnahan. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join us in support of the confirmation of Dr. \nGraham.\n  The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, as we will \nrefer to it, was established in 1980 by the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nlegislation developed to address policy issues that Congress was \nconcerned were being neglected by the executive branch. OIRA is \nprimarily charged with being a leader on regulatory review, reducing \nunnecessary paperwork and red tape, improving the management of the \nexecutive branch, reviewing information policy, and guiding statistical \npolicy proposals.\n  The decisions and actions of the OIRA administrator are very \nimportant to the public and should be made by a particularly capable \nand dedicated individual. John Graham fits this profile.\n  John Graham has been a professor of policy and decision sciences at \nthe Harvard School of Public Health since 1985. He is the founder and \ndirector of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. He has worked with \nvarious Federal agencies through his research, advisory committees, and \nas a consultant. He holds a bachelor's degree in public affairs from \nDuke University and a Ph.D. in urban and public affairs from Carnegie \nMellon University with an emphasis on decision sciences.\n  In addition, the EPA funded his postdoctoral fellowship in \nenvironmental science and public policy, and he completed course work \nin research training and human health risk assessment.\n  In 1995, Dr. Graham was elected president of the International \nSociety\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nfor Risk Analysis, a membership organization of 2,000-plus scientists, \nengineers, and scholars dedicated to advancing the tools of risk \nanalysis.\n  We have received testimonials attesting to the credentials and \nintegrity of Dr. Graham from hundreds of esteemed authorities in the \nenvironmental policy, health policy, and related fields. William \nReilly, the former Administrator of EPA, said that ``over the years, \nJohn Graham has impressed me with his vigor, his fair-mindedness, and \nintegrity.''\n  Dr. Lewis Sullivan, former Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services said that ``Dr. Graham is superbly qualified to be the \nIORA administrator.''\n  Former OIRA Administrators from both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations have conveyed their confidence that John Graham is not \nan opponent of all regulation but, rather, he is deeply committed to \nseeing that regulation serves broad public purposes as effectively as \npossible.\n  Dr. Robert Leiken, a respected expert on regulatory policy at the \nBrookings Institution, stated that Dr. Graham is the most qualified \nperson ever nominated for the job of OIRA Administrator.\n  About 100 scholars in environmental and health policy and related \nfields joined together to endorse John Graham's nomination stating:\n\n       While we don't always agree with John or, for that matter, \n     with one another on every policy issue, we do respect his \n     work and his intellectual integrity. It is very regrettable \n     that some interest groups that disagree with John's views on \n     the merits of particular issues have chosen to impugn his \n     integrity by implying that his views are for sale rather than \n     confronting the merits of his argument. Dialog about public \n     policy should be conducted at a higher level.\n\n  Having dealt with this nomination for many months, I think that quote \nreally hits the nail on the head. Some groups oppose Dr. Graham because \nthey don't agree with his support for sound science and better \nregulatory analysis. But they have chosen to engage in attacks against \nhim instead of addressing the merits of his thinking.\n  It is especially unfortunate since this nominee has done so much to \nadvance an important field of thought that can help us achieve greater \nenvironmental health and safety protection at less cost.\n  While some groups oppose the confirmation of Dr. Graham, I believe \ntheir concerns have been addressed and should not dissuade the Senate \nfrom confirming Dr. Graham. For example, Joan Claybrook, the President \nof Public Citizen, has charged that Dr. Graham's views are \nantiregulation. Yet Dr. Graham's approach calls for smarter regulation \nbased on science, engineering, and economics, not necessarily less \nregulation. He has shown that we can achieve greater protections than \nwe are currently achieving.\n  Opponents have charged that Dr. Graham is firmly opposed to most \nenvironmental regulations. In fact, Dr. Graham and his colleagues have \nproduced scholarships that supported a wide range of environmental \npolicies, including toxic pollution control at coke plants, phaseout of \nchemicals that deplete the ozone layer, and low-sulfur diesel fuel \nrequirements. Dr. Graham also urged new environmental policies to \naddress indoor pollution, outdoor particulate pollution, and tax \ncredits for fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  Dr. Graham believes that environmental policy should be grounded in \nscience, however, and examined for cost-effectiveness. Dr. Graham and \nhis colleagues have also developed new tools for chemical risk \nassessment that will better protect the public against noncancer health \neffects, such as damage to the human reproductive and immune systems.\n  Dr. Graham's basic regulatory philosophy was adopted in the Safe \nDrinking Water Act amendments of 1996, a life-saving law that both \nDemocrats and Republicans overwhelmingly supported, including most of \nus here today.\n  Critics have claimed that Professor Graham seeks to increase the role \nof economic analysis in regulatory decisionmaking and freeze out \nintangible and humanistic concerns. This is inaccurate. In both of his \nscholarly writings, and in congressional testimony, Professor Graham \nrejected purely numerical monetary approaches to cost-benefit analyses. \nHe has insisted that intangible contributions, including fairness, \nprivacy, freedom, equity, and ecological protection be given way in \nboth regulatory analysis and decisionmaking.\n\n  Dr. Graham and the Harvard Center have shown that many regulatory \npolicies are, in fact, cost-effective, such as AIDS prevention and \ntreatments; vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella; \nregulations on the sale of cigarettes to minors; enforcement of \nseatbelt laws; the mandate of lead-free gasoline; and the phaseout of \nozone-depleting chemicals.\n  Critics also claimed that Professor Graham's views are extreme \nbecause he has indicated that public health resources are not always \nallocated wisely under existing laws and regulations. Yet this is not \nan extreme view. It reflects the thrust of the writings on risk \nregulation by Justice Stephen Breyer, for example--President Clinton's \nchoice for the Supreme Court--as well as consensus statements from \ndiverse groups such as the Carnegie Commission, the National Academy of \nPublic Administration, and the Harvard Group on Risk Management Reform.\n  Professor Graham made crystal clear at his confirmation hearing that \nhe will enforce the laws of the land, as Congress has written them. He \nunderstands that there is significant differences between the \nprofessor's role of questioning all ways of thinking and the OIRA \nAdministrator's role of implementing the laws and the President's \npolicy. I believe Dr. Graham will make the transition from academia to \nGovernment service smoothly, and that he will use his valuable \nexperience to bring more insight to the issues that confront OIRA every \nday.\n  A fair review of the deliberations of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and the entire record, lead me and many of my colleagues to \nconclude that Dr. John Graham has the qualifications and the character \nto serve the public with distinction.\n  A respected professor at the University of Chicago put it this way. \nHe says:\n\n       John Graham cannot be pigeonholed as conservative or \n     liberal on regulatory issues. He is unpredictable in the best \n     sense. I would not be surprised at all if in some settings he \n     turned out to be a vigorous voice for aggressive governmental \n     regulation. In fact, that is exactly what I would expect. \n     When he questions regulations, it is because he thinks we can \n     use our resources in better ways. It is because he thinks \n     that we can use our resources in ways that do not necessarily \n     meet the eye. On this issue, he stands as one of the most \n     important researchers and most promising public servants in \n     the Nation.\n\n  I urge prompt confirmation of John Graham.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before beginning my remarks, I would \nlike to have a clarification, if I can, as to the allocation of time in \nthis debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour under the control of Mr. \nLieberman, 3 hours under the control of Mr. Thompson, 2 hours under the \ncontrol of Mr. Durbin, 2 hours under the control of Mr. Wellstone, and \n15 minutes under the control of Mr. Kerry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I rise to speak in \nopposition to the nomination of John Graham for the position of \nAdministrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at \nOMB.\n  This is a rare experience for me. I think it is the first time in my \nSenate career, in my congressional career, where I have spoken out \nagainst a nominee and attempted to lead the effort to stop his \nconfirmation. I do this understanding that the deck is not stacked in \nmy favor. Many Members of the Senate will give the President his \nperson, whoever it happens to be, and that is a point of view which I \nrespect but disagree with from time to time. I also understand from the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee experience that the Republican side of \nthe aisle--the President's side of the aisle--has been unanimous in the \nsupport of John Graham, and that is understandable, both out of respect \nfor the nominee and the President himself.\n  Having said that, though, the reason I come to the floor this evening \nand the reason I asked for time in debate is because I believe this is \none of the most\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\ndangerous nominations that we are going to consider--dangerous in this \nrespect: Although the office which Mr. John Graham seeks is obscure by \nWashington standards, it is an extremely important office. Few people \nare aware of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and just \nhow powerful the office of regulatory czar can be. But this office, \nthis senior White House staff position, exercises enormous authority \nover every major Federal regulation the Government has under \nconsideration. Because of this, the OIRA Administrator must have a \ncommitment to evenhandedness, objectivity, and fair play in analyzing \nand presenting information about regulatory options.\n\n  Do you often sit and wonder, when you hear pronouncements from the \nBush White House, for example, on arsenic in drinking water and \nincreasing the acceptable level of arsenic in drinking water, who in \nthe world came up with that idea? There might be some business \ninterests, some industrial and corporate interests, who have a specific \nview on the issue and have pushed it successfully in the \nadministration. But somebody sitting in the Bush White House along the \nway said: That sounds like a perfectly sound idea. And so they went \nforward with that suggestion.\n  Of course, the public reaction to that was so negative that they have \nhad time to reconsider the decision, but at some time and place in this \nBush White House, someone in a position of authority said: Go forward \nwith the idea of allowing more arsenic in drinking water in the United \nStates.\n  I do not understand how anyone can reach that conclusion at all, \ncertainly not without lengthy study and scientific information to back \nit up, but it happened. My fear is, John Graham, as the gatekeeper for \nrules and regulations concerning the environment and public health, \nwill be in a position to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to \nsuggestions just like that from this day forward if he is confirmed.\n  I think it is reasonable for us to step back and say: If he has that \nmuch power, and we already have seen evidence in this administration of \nsome rather bizarre ideas when it comes to public health and the \nenvironment, we have a right to know what John Graham believes, what is \nJohn Graham's qualification for this job, what is his record in this \narea? That is why I stand here this evening.\n  I want to share with my colleagues in the Senate and those who follow \nthe debate the professional career of Mr. John Graham which I think \ngives clear evidence as to why he should not be confirmed for this \nposition.\n  Let me preface my remarks. Nothing I will say this evening, nothing I \nhave said, will question the personal integrity of John Graham. I have \nno reason to do that, nor will I. What I will raise this evening \nrelates directly to his professional experience, statements he has \nmade, views he holds that I think are central to the question as to \nwhether or not we should entrust this important and powerful position \nto him.\n  Some in the Governmental Affairs Committee said this was a personal \nattack on John Graham. Personal in this respect: I am taking his record \nas an individual, a professional, and bringing it to the Senate for its \nconsideration. But I am not impugning his personal integrity or his \nhonesty. I have no reason to do so.\n  I assumed from the beginning that he has done nothing in his \nbackground that will raise questions along those lines. I will really \nstick this evening to things he has said in a professional capacity, \nand in sticking to those things, I think you will see why many have \njoined me in raising serious questions about his qualifications.\n  On the surface, John Graham strikes some of my colleagues in the \nSenate as possessing the qualities of objectivity and evenhandedness we \nwould expect in this position. He is seen by many as eminently \nqualified for the position. After all, he is a leading expert in the \narea of risk analysis and has compiled a lengthy list of professional \naccomplishments.\n\n  I have heard from colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whom I \nrespect, that they consider him the right man for the job. So I think \nit is important for me this evening to spell out in specific detail why \nI believe that is not the case, why John Graham is the wrong person to \nserve as the Nation's regulatory czar.\n  Professor Graham's supporters painted a picture of him as evenhanded \nand objective. They say he supports environmental regulations as long \nas they are well drafted and based on solid information. My colleague, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, said as much in his opening statement.\n  A casual glance at Dr. Graham's record may lead one to conclude this \nis an accurate portrayal. As they say, the devil is in the details. A \ncareful reading of the record makes several things absolutely clear: \nDr. Graham opposes virtually all environmental regulations. He believes \nthat many environmental regulations do more harm than good. He also \nbelieves that many toxic chemicals--toxic chemicals--may be good for \nyou. I know you are wondering, if you are following this debate, how \nanyone can say that. Well, stay tuned.\n  John Graham favors endless study of environmental issues over taking \nactions and making decisions--a classic case of paralysis by analysis. \nDr. Graham's so-called objective research is actually heavily \ninfluenced by policy consideration, and he has had a built-in bias that \nfavors the interest of his industrial sponsors.\n  He has been connected with Harvard University, and that is where his \nanalysis has been performed, at his center. He has had a list of \nprofessional clients over the years.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of clients be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Unrestricted Grants to the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment\n\n       3M.\n       Aetna Life & Casualty Company.\n       Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.\n       Alcoa Foundation.\n       American Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n       American Chemistry Council.\n       American Crop Protection Association.\n       American Petroleum Institute.\n       Amoco Corporation.\n       ARCO Chemical Company.\n       ASARCO Inc.\n       Ashland Inc.

I thank the Chair. I will not go through all of the \ncompanies on this list. It reads like, as they say, a veritable list of \nwho's who of industrial sponsors in America: Dow Chemical Company, all \nsorts of institutes, the Electric Power Research Institute, oil \ncompanies, motor companies, automobile manufacturers, chemical \nassociations--the list goes on and on.\n  These corporate clients came to Professor Graham not to find ways to \nincrease regulation on their businesses but just for the opposite, so \nthat he can provide through his center a scientific basis for resisting \nGovernment regulation in the areas of public health and the \nenvironment.\n  I am an attorney by profession, and I understand that when there is \nbalance in advocacy you have an objective presentation: Strong \narguments on one side and strong arguments against, and then you try to \nreach the right conclusion. So I am not going to gainsay the work of \nDr. Graham in representing his corporate clients over the years, but it \nis important for us to put this in perspective.\n  If Dr. Graham is appointed to this position, his clients will not be \nthe corporations of America, his clients will be the 281 million \nAmericans who count on him to make decisions in their best interest \nwhen it comes to environmental protection and protection of the health \nof their families.\n  When we look at his professional background, it raises a question \nabout his objectivity. He has had little respect for the environmental \nconcerns of most Americans--concerns about toxic chemicals in drinking \nwater, pesticides in our food, or even the burial of radioactive waste. \nTo John Graham, these are not major concerns. In fact, as you will hear \nfrom some of his statements that I will quote, he believes they reflect \na paranoia in American culture.\n  Dr. Graham's supporters have taken issue with my categorizing his \nviews as antiregulatory. They say, and it has been said on the floor \nthis evening, John Graham supports environmental regulations: just look \nat the statements he has made about removing lead from gasoline. That \nwas said this evening: John Graham supports removing lead from \ngasoline.\n  I certainly hope so. And my colleagues know, it is true, John Graham \nhas stated clearly and unequivocally that he thought removing lead from \ngasoline was a good idea. Do my colleagues know when that decision was \nmade? Decades before John Graham was in any position to have impact on \nthe decision. It is a decision in which he had no involvement in any \nway whatsoever.\n  What has he done for the environment lately? What does he think of \nthe recent crop of environmental regulations? On this matter, his \nopinions are very clear. According to John Graham, environmental \nregulations waste billions, if not trillions, of taxpayers' dollars. \nAccording to John Graham, our choice of environmental priorities \nactually kills people through a process Mr. Graham calls ``statistical \nmurder,'' something that pops up in his work all the time.\n  According to John Graham, we should massively ship resources away \nfrom environmental problems such as toxic chemicals to more important \nactivities that he has identified, such as painting white lines on \nhighways and encouraging people to stop smoking.\n  This is a recent quote from Dr. Graham:\n\n       The most cost-effective way to save lives generally is to \n     increase medical treatment, and somewhat second, to curb \n     fatal injuries. Trying to save lives by regulating pesticides \n     or other toxins generally used up a lot of resources.\n\n  I can recall during the time we were debating the potential of a \nnuclear holocaust, there was a man named Richard Perle in the Reagan \nadministration who said he didn't think we should be that frightened \nbecause if we did face a nuclear attack, in his words, ``with enough \nshovels,'' we could protect ourselves.\n  When I read these words of Dr. Graham who says, ``The most cost-\neffective way to save lives generally is to increase medical treatment, \nand somewhat second, to curb fatal injuries,'' and then he says that \n``regulating pesticides and toxins uses up a lot of resources'' can you \nsee why I believe he has been dismissive of the basic science which he \nis going to be asked to implement and enforce in this office?\n  This quote is a little bit understated. In other documents, Mr. \nGraham refers to spending money on control of toxins as ``an outrageous \nallocation of resources.'' This captures the very heart of Graham's \nphilosophy. Environmental regulations to control toxic chemicals are an \nenormous waste of resources, in the mind of John Graham. It makes \nlittle sense, according to Graham, to focus on environmental problems. \nInstead, we should use our scarce public policy dollars for other more \nimportant issues.\n  Why does John Graham hold such strong views opposing environmental \nregulations? Because he believes toxic chemicals just are not that \ntoxic. Dr. Graham has said the so-called ``toxic chemicals'' may \nactually be good for us. I will read some of the transcript from his \nhearing on the whole question of dioxin.\n  Now, Dr. Graham supports these beliefs based on what he calls ``a new \nparadigm,'' the idea that there may well be an optimum dose for toxic \nchemicals or for other environmental hazards such as radiation. The \nidea behind this optimum dose theory is there is an exposure that is \ngood for people in small amounts even if the chemical or radiation is \nharmful in larger quantities.\n  In a conference on this new paradigm at which Graham was a featured \nspeaker, he urged his colleagues:\n\n       Advocates of the new paradigm need to move beyond \n     empiricism to explanation if we can explain why low doses are \n     protective, the prospects of a genuine scientific revolution \n     are much greater.\n\n  A scientific revolution inspired by John Graham.\n  Well, the obvious question I had of Mr. Graham when he came to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee was as follows:\n\n       Mr. Durbin: Dr. Graham, when I look at your resume, I'm \n     curious; do you have any degrees or advanced training in the \n     field of chemistry, for example?\n       Mr. Graham: No, sir.\n       Mr. Durbin: Biology?\n       Mr. Graham: No, sir.\n       Mr. Durbin: Toxicology?\n       Mr. Graham: No.\n       Mr. Durbin: What would you consider to be your expertise?\n       Mr. Graham: I have a Ph.D. in public affairs from Carnegie \n     Mellon, with an emphasis in the field of management science \n     called ``decision science.'' At the School of Public Health, \n     I teach analytical tools and decision science like risk \n     assessment, cost-effective analysis, and cost-benefit \n     analysis.\n       Mr. Durbin: No background in medical training?\n       Mr. Graham: No. I do have a postdoctoral fellowship funded \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency where I studied human \n     health risk assessment and had research experience in doing \n     human health risk assessment on chemical exposures.\n       Mr. Durbin: Does your lack of background in any of these \n     fields that I have mentioned give you any hesitation to make \n     statements relative to the danger of chemicals to the human \n     body?\n       Mr. Graham: I think I have tried to participate in \n     collaborative arrangements where I have the benefit of people \n     who have expertise in some of the fields that you have \n     mentioned.\n       Mr. Durbin: Going back to the old television commercial, \n     ``I may not be a doctor but I play one on TV,'' you wouldn't \n     want to assume the role of a doctor and public health expert \n     when it comes to deciding the safety or danger over the \n     exposure to certain chemicals, would you?\n       Mr. Graham: Well, I think our center and I personally have \n     done significant research\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\n     in the area of risk assessment of chemicals and oftentimes my \n     role is to provide analytical support to a team and then \n     other people on the team provide expertise, whether it be \n     toxicology, medicine, or whatever.\n\n  The reason I raise this is there is no requirement that a person who \ntakes this job be a scientist, a medical doctor, a chemist, a person \nwith a degree in biology or toxicology. That is not a requirement of \nthe job. And very few, if any, of his predecessors held that kind of \nexpertise.\n  But when you consider carefully what Mr. Graham has said publicly in \nthe field of science, you might conclude that he has much training and \na great degree in the field.\n  That is not the case. He has held himself out time and again, and I \nwill not go through the specifics here, and made dogmatic statements \nabout science that cannot be supported. And he wants to be the \ngatekeeper on the rules and regulations of public health and the \nenvironment in America.\n  Mr. Graham is, as I said earlier, trying to create a scientific \nrevolution but he acknowledges it is an uphill battle. Why do so few \nmainstream scientists buy into his theories? Because, says Graham, \nscience itself has a built-in bias against recognizing the beneficial \neffects of low-dose exposures to otherwise dangerous chemicals such as \ndioxin.\n  Scientific journals don't like to publish new paradigm results. In \nhis written works, Dr. Graham goes so far to say the current \nclassification scheme used by the EPA and others to identify cancer-\ncausing chemicals should be abolished and replaced with a scheme that \nrecognizes that all chemicals may not only not cause cancer but may \nactually prevent cancer, as well.\n  Perhaps he opposes environmental regulation because he is so \nconvinced that regulations generally do more harm than good. Some of \nthis harkens back, of course, to his new paradigm, his scientific \nrevolution. If we restrict toxic chemicals that are actually \npreventing, rather than causing, cancer, we wind up hurting, rather \nthan helping, the population at large, according to Dr. Graham. Think \nabout that. He is arguing that some of the things we are trying to \nprotect people from we should actually encourage people to expose \nthemselves to.\n\n  If he had scientific backing for this, it is one thing. He doesn't \nhave the personal expertise in the area and very few, if any, come to \nrally by his side when he comes up with the bizarre views.\n  He argues environmental regulations hurt us in other ways. They \nsiphon off resources from what he considers the real problem of \nsociety, and they introduce new risks of their own, so according to Dr. \nGraham the cure is worse than the disease. The side effects of \nenvironmental regulation are so problematic and many that he refers to \nthem as ``statistical murder.'' Our environmental priorities are \nresponsible for the statistical murder of tens of thousands of American \ncitizens every year, according to Mr. Graham.\n  Take his well-known example, and he has used it in writings of \nchloroform regulation. Mr. Graham estimates that chloroform regulation \ncosts more than $1 trillion to save a single life, $1 trillion. And he \nuses this in an illustration of how you can come up with a regulation \nthat is so expensive you could never justify it--$1 trillion to save \none life. What he doesn't say--and the EPA looked at his analysis--that \ncost of $1 trillion is over a period of time of 33,000 years. Just a \nlittle footnote that I think should have been highlighted. How can \npatently absurd numbers such as this make a contribution to cost-\nbenefit consideration?\n  There is a bigger problem. The chloroform regulation he refers to \ndoesn't exist and never did. I asked the Congressional Research Service \nto find out about this regulation on chloroform that Dr. Graham used as \nan example of statistical murder, where we will spend $1 trillion as a \nsociety to save one life. Find out where that took place.\n\n  Guess what. It doesn't exist. This is a hypothetical case study for \nan academic exercise. It is not a regulation. It was never proposed as \na regulation nor was it ever considered seriously by anyone. Someone \ninvented this scenario and John Graham seized on it as his poster child \nof how you can go to ridiculous extremes to protect people from \nenvironmental exposure.\n  Even when Dr. Graham studies the costs and benefits of actual \nenvironmental regulations, ones that are truly being considered, his \ncontroversial practice of ``discounting\" automatically trivializes the \nbenefits of environmental regulation.\n  We have been through this debate in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. There are people on the committee, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who say--and I think this is a perfectly reasonable \nstatement--before you put in a rule or regulation, find out what it is \ngoing to cost: What is the cost to society? What is the benefit? I \nthink that is only reasonable. There are certain things we can do to \nsave lives, but at such great expense, society could never bear that \nburden. The problem you have is in drawing up the statistics, in trying \nto quantify it, in saying what a life is worth and over what period of \ntime.\n  Dr. Graham gets into this business and starts discounting human lives \nin exactly the same way economists and business advisers discount \nmoney. A life saved or a dollar earned today, according to Dr. Graham, \nis much more valuable than a life saved or a dollar earned in the \nfuture. Dr. Graham's so-called scientific results led him to conclude \nthat when the Environmental Protection Agency says a human life is \nworth $4.8 million, by their calculations, they are 10 times too high. \nThat is Dr. Graham's analysis.\n  How many of us in this Senate Chamber today can honestly say they \nagree with Dr. Graham's discounting the value of a human life to 10 \npercent of the amount we have used to calculate many environmental \nregulations? That is a starting point. If you are representing \nindustrial clients who do not want to be regulated, who suggest \nenvironmental regulations and public health regulations are, frankly, \noutlandish, you start by saying lives to be saved are not worth that \nmuch.\n  Discounting may make sense when it comes to money, but it trivializes \nthe value of human lives and the lives of our next generation and \ncreates an automatic bias against environmental regulations meant to \nprovide protections over a long period of time.\n  I will be the first to admit there are inefficiencies in our current \nenvironmental regulations, but Professor Graham's research hasn't found \nthem. Instead, he consistently identified phantom costs of nonexistent \nregulations and for years referred to them as if they were the real \ncost of real environmental regulations. He has played a game with the \nfacts for his purposes, for his clients. But when it comes to the OMB, \nin this capacity it will be the real world where decisions you make \nwill literally affect the health and future of Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  He has introduced misleading information that has really distorted \nmany of the elements of an important policy debate. There are \norganizations that absolutely love research results that show billions \nof dollars being wasted by unnecessary environmental regulations--\ngroups such as the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, all of whom have made ample use of \nProfessor Graham's scientific studies, scientific revolution--\nstatistical murder; results to strengthen their antiregulatory \narguments.\n\n  To sum up Dr. Graham's belief, toxic chemicals can be good for you, \nenvironmental regulations can be very bad for you.\n  Not everyone accepts these beliefs, of course. What does Dr. Graham \nthink of those with a different set of priorities? In his mind, it is a \nsign of collective paranoia, a sign of pervasive weakness and self-\ndelusion that pervades our culture.\n  If you think I have overstated it, I think his own words express his \nsentiments more accurately. I would like to refer to this poster, \nquotes from Dr. Graham.\n  Interview on CNN, 1993:\n\n       We do hold as a society, I think, a noble myth that life is \n     priceless, but we should not confuse that with reality.\n\n  Dr. Graham said that. Then:\n\n       Making sense of risk: An agenda for Congress in 1996.\n\n  John Graham said:\n\n       The public's general reaction to health, safety and \n     environmental dangers may best be described as a syndrome of \n     paranoia and neglect.\n\n  ``Medical Waste News,'' that he has written for, in 1994:\n\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n\n       . . . as we've grown wealthier, we've grown paranoid.\n\n  Testimony to the House Science Committee in 1995:\n\n       We should not expect that the public and our elected \n     officials have a profound understanding of which threats are \n     real and which are speculative.\n\n  So the very institution to which we are being asked to confirm this \nman's nomination has been really dismissed by John Graham as not having \nsound understanding of threats that are real.\n  Then he goes on to say, in Issues in Science and Technology, in 1997:\n\n       It may be necessary to address the dysfunctional aspects of \n     U.S. culture. . . . The lack of a common liberal arts \n     education . . . breeds ignorance of civic responsibility.\n\n  So John Graham can not only portray himself as a doctor, a \ntoxicologist, a biologist, and a chemist, he can also be a sociologist \nand general philosopher. The man has ample talents, but I am not sure \nthose talents will work for America when it comes to this important \njob.\n  I would like to take a look at two issues in detail to give a clearer \npicture of Dr. Graham's approach to environmental issues of great \nconcern to the American people. I want to examine his record on \npesticides and on dioxin. It is not unreasonable to believe if his \nnomination is confirmed that John Graham will consider rules and \nregulations relating to these two specific items, pesticides and \ndioxin.\n  The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 passed Congress unanimously--\nand not just any session of Congress, the 104th Congress, one of the \nmost contentious in modern history, a Congress that could hardly agree \non anything. Yet we agreed unanimously to pass this important new food \nsafety law. A key purpose of the law was to provide the public with \nbetter protection against pesticides. In particular, the law aimed to \nprovide increased protections to our most vulnerable segment of the \npopulation, our children. President Clinton remarked that the Food \nQuality Protection Act would replace a patchwork of standards with one \nsimple standard: If a pesticide poses a danger to our children, then it \nwon't be in our food.\n  This groundbreaking legislation received the unanimous support of \nCongress. What does John Graham, Dr. John Graham, think about the \nimportance of protecting our children from pesticide residues on food? \nLet me tell you what he said in his work.\n\n       The Food Quality Protection Act suffers from the same \n     failings that mark most of our other environmental laws and \n     regulations. Our attempts at regulating pesticides and food \n     are a terrible waste of society's resources. We accept risks \n     from other technologies like the automobile, why should we \n     not accept risks from pesticides? When we regulate, or worse, \n     when we ban pesticides, we often wind up doing more harm than \n     good.\n\n  Let me tell you a case in point. I think it is an interesting one. It \nwas a book which Mr. Graham wrote called ``Risk versus Risk.'' This is \na copy of his cover. It was edited by John Graham and Jonathan B. \nWeiner.\n  I might also add the foreword was written by Cass Sunstein, who is a \nprofessor at the University of Chicago School of Law and has one of the \nletters of support which has already been quoted on the floor. He was a \ncolleague of Mr. Graham, at least in writing the foreword to this book. \nThis goes into the whole question of pesticides and danger. The thing I \nfind curious is this. On page 174 of this book, Mr. Graham, who is \nasked to be in charge of the rules and regulations relative to \npesticides, started raising questions about whether we made the right \ndecision in banning DDT--banning DDT. He says:\n\n       Many of the organophosphate pesticides that have been used \n     in place of DDT have caused incidents of serious poisoning \n     among unsuspecting workers and farmers who had been \n     accustomed to handling the relatively nontoxic DDT.\n\n  That is a quote--``relatively nontoxic DDT.''\n  I read an article the other day in the New Yorker which was about DDT \nand its discovery. Let me read a part of this article--I want to make \nsure of the sources quoted: Malcolm Gladwell, ``The Mosquito Killer,'' \nNew Yorker, July 2, 2001. If I am not mistaken, that is the same \ngentleman who wrote the book ``The Tipping Point,'' which I found very \ngood and recommend.\n  In his article about DDT, he says as follows:\n\n       Today, of course, DDT is a symbol of all that is dangerous \n     about man's attempts to interfere with nature. Rachel Carson, \n     in her landmark 1962 book ``Silent Spring,'' where she wrote \n     memorably of the chemical's environmental consequences, how \n     much its unusual persistence and toxicity had laid waste to \n     wildlife in aquatic ecosystems. Only two countries, India and \n     China, continue to manufacture the substance, and only a few \n     dozen more still use it.\n\n  In May, at the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, \nmore than 90 countries signed a treaty placing DDT on a restricted use \nlist and asking all those still using the chemical to develop plans for \nphasing it out entirely. On the eve of its burial, however, and at a \ntime when the threat of insect-borne disease seems to be resurging, it \nis worth remembering that people once felt very differently about DDT, \nand between the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the \n1960s, it was considered not a dangerous pollutant but a lifesaver.\n  Mr. Gladwell, in this article, in summarizing the history of DDT, \nreally points to the fact that those who have analyzed it around the \nworld, with the exception of India and China--some 90 nations--\nabandoned it. John Graham, who wants to be in charge of the rules and \nregulations on pesticides, the environment, and public health, wrote:\n\n       It was relatively nontoxic.\n  This is a man who wants to make a decision about pesticides and their \nimpact on the health of America.\n  According to Dr. Graham, it may have been an ill-advised decision to \ntake DDT off the market. He cites in this book that I quoted how DDT \nwas particularly effective in dealing with malaria. No doubt it was. \nBut it was decided that the environmental impact of this chemical was \nso bad that countries around the world banned it.\n  Let me offer some direct quotes from Dr. Graham from various reports \nhe has written over the years and from the many statements that he has \nmade.\n  Before I do that, I see my colleague, Senator Wellstone, is in the \nChamber. At this time, I would like to yield to him with the \nunderstanding that I can return and complete my remarks. I thank him \nfor joining me this evening. I will step down for a moment and return.\n  I yield to Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin. I am very proud \nto join him. I have a lot of time reserved tonight. I say to colleagues \nwho are here in the Chamber and who are wondering what our timeframe is \nthat I can shorten my remarks.\n  I am speaking in opposition to the nomination of Mr. John Graham to \nbe Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, \nwithin the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I believe the President should have broad latitude in choosing his \ncabinet. I have voted for many nominees in the past with whom I have \ndisagreed on policy grounds. I have voted for a number during this \nAdministration, and I'm sure I will vote for more nominees with whom I \ndisagree on policy, sometimes very sharply.\n  Mr. Graham has been nominated to a sensitive position: Administrator \nof the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). In this \nrole Mr. Graham would be in a position to delay, block or alter rules \nproposed by key federal agencies. Which agencies?\n  Let me give you some examples. One would be OSHA. This happens to be \nan agency with a mandate that is near and dear to my heart. Over the \nyears, I have had the opportunity to do a lot of community organizing, \nand I have worked with a lot of people who unfortunately have been \nviewed as expendable. They do not have a lot of clout--political, \neconomic, or any other kind. They work under some pretty uncivilized \nworking conditions.\n  The whole idea behind OSHA was that we were going to provide some \nprotection. Indeed, what we were going to be saying to companies--in \nfact, we did the same thing with environmental protection--is, yes, \nmaximize your profits in our private sector system. Yes, organize \nproduction the way you choose to do. You are free to do it any way you \nwant to, and maximize your profit any way you want to--up to the point \nthat you are killing workers, up to the point that it is loss of limbs, \nloss of lives, harsh genetic substances, and people dying early of \ncancer. Then you can't do it. Thank God, from the point\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\nof view of ordinary people, the Government steps in, I would like to \nsay, on our side.\n  We had a perfect example of that this year in the subcommittee that I \nchair on employment, safety, and training. I asked Secretary Chao to \ncome. She didn't come. I wanted to ask her about the rule on repetitive \nstress injury, the most serious problem right now in the workplace. It \nwas overturned. The Secretary said she would be serious about \npromulgating a rule that would provide protection for the 1.8 million \npeople, or thereabouts, who are affected by this. I wanted to know \nwhat, in fact, this administration is going to do.\n  So far it is really an obstacle.\n  As Administrator of OIRA, Mr. Graham can frustrate any attempt by \nOSHA to address 1.8 million repetitive stress injuries workers suffer \neach year, as reported by employers.\n  I will just say it on the floor of the Senate. I think it is \nabsolutely outrageous that rule was overturned. I see no evidence \nwhatsoever that this administration is serious about promulgating any \nkind of rule that would provide workers with real protection.\n  The Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA. The Louisville \nCourier Journal conducted a comprehensive investigation of illnesses \nsuffered by coal miners due to exposure to coal dust--workers who are \nsupposed to be protected by MSHA regulation. We urgently need vigorous \naction by MSHA.\n  As a matter of fact, I couldn't believe it when I was down in east \nKentucky in Harlan and Letcher Counties. I met with coal miners. That \nis where my wife, Sheila, is from. Her family is from there. I hate to \nadmit to colleagues or the Chair that I actually believed that black \nlung disease was a thing of the past. I knew all about it. I was \nshocked to find out that in east Kentucky many of these miners working \nthe mines can't see 6 inches in front of them because of the dust \nproblem.\n  Senator Durbin's predecessor, Senator Simon, worked on mine safety. \nIt was one of his big priorities.\n  Part of the problem is the companies actually are the ones that \nmonitor coal dust. MSHA has been trying to put through a rule--we were \nalmost successful in getting it through the last Congress--to provide \nthese miners with some protection.\n  From the point of view of the miners, they don't view themselves as \nexpendable.\n  The Food and Drug Administration regulates the safety of prescription \ndrugs for children, for the elderly, for all of us. The Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) regulates pollution of the water and air. For \nexample, EPA will determine what level of arsenic is acceptable in \nAmerican drinking water. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) \nis charged with the task of protecting us to the extent possible from \nsalmonella, foot and mouth disease, BSE and other food-borne illnesses.\n  These and other important Federal regulatory agencies exist to \nprotect Americans and to uphold standards that have been fought for and \nachieved over decades of struggle.\n  It is not true that people in Minnesota and people in the country are \nopposed to Government regulations on their behalf and on behalf of \ntheir children so that the water is not poisoned, so that the mines \nthey work in are safe, so that the workplace they work in is safe, so \nthat there are civilized working conditions, so that they don't have \ntoo much arsenic in the water their children drink, and so that the \nfood their children eat is safe. Don't tell me people in Minnesota and \nin the country aren't interested in strong regulation on behalf of \ntheir safety and their children's safety.\n  The Administrator of OIRA must be someone who stands with the \nAmerican public, someone who sees it as his or her mission to protect \nthe public interest. In my view, John Graham's evident hostility to \nregulation that protects the public interest, in particular his over-\nreliance on tools of economic analysis that denigrate the value of \nregulatory protections, is disqualifying.\n  This is particularly troublesome when it comes to workplace safety, \nfor example, because his approach flies in the face of statutory \nlanguage requiring OSHA--again I am fortunate to chair the subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over OSHA--to examine the economic feasibility of its \nregulations, as opposed to undertaking the cost/benefit analyses upon \nwhich he over-relies.\n\n  As the Supreme Court noted in the so-called Cotton Dust Case, \nembedded in the statutory framework for OSHA is Congress' assumption \n``that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the \nworkplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of \neliminating these problems.'' Instead of cost/benefit analyses to guide \nstandard setting, OSHA is statutorily bound to promulgate standards \n``which most adequately assur[e], to the extent feasible, on the basis \nof the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has \nregular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the \nperiod of his working life.''\n  In its 30 years of existence the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration has made its presence felt in the lives of tens of \nmillions of Americans at all levels of the workforce. OSHA and its \nrelated agencies are literally the last, best hope for millions of \nAmerican workers whose lives would otherwise be put on the line, simply \nbecause they need to earn a paycheck. Experience has shown, over and \nover, that the absence of strong government-mandated safeguards results \nin workplace exposure to everything from odorless carcinogens to \nmusculoskeletal stress to combustible grain dust to other dangers too \nnumerous to mention.\n  Since its founding, hundreds of thousands of American workers did not \ndie on the job, thanks to OSHA. Workplace fatalities have declined 50 \npercent between December of 1970 and December 2000, while occupational \ninjury and illness rates have dropped 40 percent.\n  Not surprisingly, declines in workplace fatalities and injuries have \nbeen most dramatic in precisely those industries where OSHA has \ntargeted its activities. For example, since OSHA came into existence, \nthe manufacturing fatality rate has declined by 60 percent and the \ninjury rate by 33 percent. At the same time, the construction fatality \nrate has declined by 80 percent and the injury rate by 52 percent.\n  It is not a coincidence that these two industries have received some \nof OSHA's closest attention. OSHA's role in assuring so far as possible \nthat every worker is protected from on-the-job hazards cannot be \ndenied.\n  Unfortunately, however, compared to the demand, there is still a \nwhole lot of work to be done. Indoor air quality, hexavalent chromium, \nberyllium, permissible exposure limits for hundreds of chemicals in the \nworkplace--this list goes on and on--not to mention repetitive stress \ninjuries. The unfinished agenda is huge. It is precisely this \nunfinished agenda that should give us pause in confirming, as head of \nOIRA, someone whose entire professional history seems aimed at \nfrustrating efforts to regulate in the public interest. That is my \ndisagreement. It is a different framework that he represents than the \nframework that I think is so in the public interest.\n  Let me just give one example: the chromium story.\n  Chromium is a metal that is used in the production of metal alloys, \nsuch as stainless steel, chrome plating and pigments. It is also used \nin various chemical processes and it is a component of cement used to \nmanufacture refractory bricks.\n  The first case of cancer caused by chromium was reported in 1890. \nSince then, the evidence that it causes cancer continued to grow. \nChromium has been declared a carcinogen by the EPA, the National \nToxicology Program, and the International Agency for Research on \nCancer.\n  In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 200,000 to 390,000 workers \nwere exposed to hexavalent chromium in the workplace--200,000 to \n390,000. Lung cancer rates among factory workers exposed to hexavalent \nchromium are almost double the expected cancer rate for unexposed \nworkers. Lung cancer rates for factory workers exposed to hexavalent \nchromium are also double the expected cancer rate for unexposed \nworkers.\n  OSHA has known the risks associated with exposure to this dangerous \ncarcinogen since its inception but has failed to act. OSHA's \nassessment, conducted by K.S. Crump Division of ICG Kaiser, was that \nbetween 9 percent and\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\n34 percent of workers exposed at half the legal limit for a working \nlifetime would contract lung cancer as a result of this exposure.\n  On April 24, 2000, OSHA published its semiannual agenda, which \nanticipated a notice of proposed rulemaking would be published in June \n2001. If confirmed as Administrator of OIRA within the Office of \nManagement and Budget, however, John Graham's actions could affect \nOSHA's stated willingness to undertake a proposed rule this year, as \nthe agency has finally promised and as is urgently needed.\n  I will finish by just giving a few examples of how Mr. Graham could \nnegatively impact the process.\n  No. 1, reduce OSHA's ability to collect information in support of a \nnew standard.\n  To develop a new hexavalent chromium standard, OSHA would likely need \nto survey scores of businesses for information about their use of the \nchemical and about workplace exposures. During the committee hearing on \nhis nomination, Graham said that he supports requiring the federal \nagencies to do cost-benefit analyses of information requests sent to \nindustry in preparation for a rulemaking. Under the Paperwork Reduction \nAct, before an information request can be sent to ten entities or more, \nit must be approved by OMB. Because it is very difficult to judge the \nvalue of the information being collected prior to receiving it, Graham \ncould use the paperwork clearance requirement to tangle up the agency \nin justifying any information requests needed to support a new rule on \nchromium.\n  No. 2, insist upon a new risk assessment, despite compelling evidence \nthat chromium poses a cancer risk.\n  OSHA has conducted its own risk assessment of chromium and reviewed \nnumerous studies documenting that workers working with or around the \nchemical face considerable increased risk of lung cancer. But it is \nlikely that Graham could exercise his power at OMB to require a new \nrisk assessment of hexavalent chromium, which could further delay the \nissuance of a rule.\n  Graham has supported requiring every risk-related inquiry by the \nfederal government to be vetted by a panel of peer review scientists \nprior to its public release, which would be costly and create \nsignificant delays in the development of new regulations. He has argued \nthat the risk assessments done by the federal agencies are flawed, and \nthat OMB or the White House should develop its own risk assessment \noversight process. This would allow economists to review and possibly \ninvalidate the findings of scientists and public health experts in the \nagencies.\n  No. 3, flunk any rule that fails a stringent cost-benefit test.\n  Graham is a supporter, for example, of strict cost-efficiency \nmeasures, even in matters of public health. Because he views regulatory \nchoices as best driven by cost-based decisionmaking, the worthiness of \na rule is determined at least partly by the cost to industry of fixing \nthe problem. This is the opposite of an approach that recognizes that \nworkers have a right to a safe workplace environment.\n  The OSHA mission statement is ``to send every worker home whole and \nhealthy every day.''\n  Under the law as it now stands, OSHA is prohibited from using cost-\nbenefit analysis to establish new health standards. Instead, OSHA must \nset health standards for significant risks to workers at the maximum \nlevel that the regulated industry, as a whole, can feasibly achieve and \nafford. This policy, set into law by the OSHA Act, recognizes the \nrights of workers to safe and healthful workplaces, and provides far \nmore protection to workers than would be provided by any standards \ngenerated under a cost-benefit analysis.\n  Putting John Graham in the regulatory gatekeeper post would create a \ngrave risk that OSHA protections, such as the hexavalent chromium \nstandard, will not be set at the most protective level that regulated \nindustry can feasibly achieve. We know from his own statements that \nJohn Graham will require OSHA to produce economic analyses that will \nuse antiregulation assumptions, and will show protective regulations to \nfail the cost-benefit tests.\n  It is true that OSHA is technically authorized to issue standards \nthat fail the cost-benefit test. However, it would be politically \nnearly impossible for an agency to issue a standard that has been \nshown, using dubious methodologies, to have net costs for society.\n\n  Unfortunately, although I would like nothing better than to be proven \nwrong, I fear this is not a farfetched scenario. And let there be no \nquestion--such steps would absolutely undermine Congress' intent when \nit passed the Occupational Health and Safety Act 30 years ago.\n  Let me quote again from the Supreme Court's Cotton Dust decision:\n\n       Not only does the legislative history confirm that Congress \n     meant ``feasible'' rather than ``cost-benefit'' when it used \n     the former term, but it also shows that Congress understood \n     that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, \n     yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a \n     safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the \n     costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business. \n     Senator Yarborough, a cosponsor of the [OSH Act], stated: \n     ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that \n     is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in \n     America.''\n  There is one final point I want to make. I will tell you what really \ntroubles me the most about this nomination. And let me just kind of \nstep back and look at the bigger picture, which really gives me pause.\n  The essence of our Government--small ``d'' democracy--is to create a \nframework for the protection of the larger public as a whole. I believe \nin that. And I believe a majority of the people believe in that. It is \nthe majority's commitment to protect the interests of those who cannot \nprotect themselves that sets this great Nation apart from others. That \nis the essence of our democratic way of life. That is the core of this \ncountry's incredible heritage.\n  But there are a series of things happening here in the Nation's \nCapitol--stacked one on top of another--that fundamentally undermine \nthe capacity of our Government to serve this purpose of being there for \nthe public interest. I think we have a concerted effort on the part of \nthis administration--and I have to say it on the floor of the Senate--\nand its allies to undermine the Government's ability to serve the \npublic interest.\n  First, there was a stream of actual or proposed rollbacks of \nregulations designed to protect the health and well-being of the people \nof this country--arsenic in drinking water, global warming emissions, \nergonomics--or repetitive stress injuries in the workplace, drilling in \nthe wilderness, energy efficiency standards--it goes on and on.\n  Then there was the tax cut, making it absolutely impossible for us to \nprotect Social Security and Medicare, or to do near what we should do \nfor children or for the elderly, for the poor or for the vulnerable, \nfor an adequate education or for affordable prescription drugs--no \nway--in other words, to fund Government, to do what Government is \nsupposed to do, which is to protect the interests of those who cannot \nprotect themselves.\n  And then, finally, the administration seeks to place in key \ngatekeeper positions individuals whose entire professional careers have \nbeen in opposition to the missions of the agencies they are now being \nnominated to advance.\n  I am troubled by this. I think people in the country would be \ntroubled by this if they really understood John Graham's background and \nthe power of his position and, unfortunately, the capacity not to do \nwell for the public interest. This is unacceptable. This is a \nconcerted, comprehensive effort to undermine our Government's ability \nto protect and represent the interests of those who don't have all the \npower, who don't have all the capital.\n  The goal is clear: Roll back the regulations that they can. That is \nwhat this administration is about: Defund government programs and place \nin pivotal positions those with the will and the determination to block \nnew regulations from going forward--new regulations that will protect \npeople in the workplace, new regulations that will protect our \nenvironment, new regulations that will protect our children from \narsenic in the drinking water, new regulations that will protect the \nlakes and the rivers and the streams, new regulations that will make \nsure the food is safe for our children. This is not acceptable. We \nshould say no. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating \nthis nomination.\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\n  I include as part of my statement a letter in opposition from former \nSecretary of Labor Reich and other former agency heads.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 17, 2001.\n     Re John D. Graham nomination.\n\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Democrat, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We write as former federal regulators in \n     response to the nomination of John D. Graham, Ph.D., to \n     direct the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). As OIRA \n     Administrator, Dr. Graham would oversee the development of \n     all federal regulations and he would help shape federal \n     regulatory policy. His decisions will have profound effects \n     on the health, welfare, and environmental quality of all \n     Americans. We are concerned by many of Dr. Graham's expressed \n     views and past actions as Director of the Harvard Center for \n     Risk Analysis, and encourage the committee to conduct a \n     thorough investigation into Dr. Graham's suitability for this \n     position.\n       Since the early 1980s, both Republican and Democratic \n     Presidents have issued Executive Orders granting the OIRA \n     Administrator exceptionally broad authority to approve, \n     disapprove, and review all significant executive agency \n     regulations. In addition, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, \n     the OIRA Administrator has the responsibility to approve and \n     disapprove agency information collection requests, which \n     agencies need to evaluate emerging public health and \n     environmental threats. These powers give the OIRA \n     Administrator a considerable role in determining how \n     important statutes are implemented and enforced.\n       In his written work and testimony before Congress, Dr. \n     Graham has repeatedly argued for an increased reliance on \n     cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis in the \n     regulatory process. We agree that economic analysis generally \n     plays an important role in policy making. But increasing the \n     role that economic analysis plays in rulemaking threatens to \n     crowd out considerations of equal or perhaps greater \n     importance that are harder to quantify and to put in terms of \n     dollars--for example, what is the dollar value of making \n     public spaces accessible so a paraplegic can participate \n     fully in community activities? How should we quantify the \n     worth of protecting private medical information from \n     commercial disclosure? Why is the value of preventing a child \n     from developing a future cancer worth only a small fraction \n     of the value of preventing her from dying in an auto \n     accident? How do you quantify the real value of a healthy \n     ecosystem?\n       In addition, we are concerned that Dr. Graham may have \n     strong views that would affect his impartiality in reviewing \n     regulations under a number of statues. He has claimed that \n     many health and safety statutes are irrational because they \n     do not allow the agencies to choose the regulatory option \n     that maximizes economic efficiency where doing so would \n     diminish public protections. He has repeatedly argued, in his \n     written work and testimony before Congress, that requirements \n     to take the results of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness \n     analyses into account could supercede congressional mandates \n     that do not permit their use, such as some provisions of the \n     Clean Air Act. [John D. Graham, ``Legislative Approaches to \n     Achieving More Protection Against Risk at Less Cost,'' 1997 \n     Univ. of Chi. Legal Forum 13, 49.] It is important to assure \n     that he can in good conscience carry out the will of Congress \n     even where he has strong personal disagreements with the law.\n       We are also concerned about Dr. Graham's independence from \n     the regulated community. At the Harvard Center for Risk \n     analysis, Dr. Grahams' major source of funding has been from \n     unrestricted contributions and endowments of more than 100 \n     industry companies and trade groups, many of which have \n     staunchly opposed the promulgation and enforcement of health, \n     safety and environmental safeguards. At HCRA, Dr. Graham's \n     research and public positions against regulation have often \n     been closely aligned with HCRA's corporate contributors. In \n     coming years these same regulated industries will be the \n     subject of federal regulatory initiatives that would be \n     intensively reviewed by Dr. Graham and OIRA. It is thus fair \n     to question whether Dr. Graham would be even-handed in \n     carrying out his duties, including helping enforce the laws \n     he has criticized. Might he favor corporations or industry \n     groups who were more generous to his Center? Will he have \n     arrangements to return to Harvard? Is there an expectation of \n     further endowments from regulated industries? There is the \n     potential for so many real or perceived conflicts of \n     interest, that this could impair his ability to do the job.\n       We urge the Government Affairs Committee to conduct a \n     thorough inquiry into each of these areas of concern. We \n     believe that the health, safety and quality of life of \n     millions of Americans deserves such an appropriate response. \n     Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Robert B. Reich, Former Secretary of Labor; Ray Marshall, \n           Former Secretary of Labor; Edward Montgomery, Former \n           Deputy Secretary of Labor; Charles N.

Charles Fox, Former \n           Assistant Administrator for Water, Environmental \n           Protection Agency; David Hawkins, Former Administrator, \n           for Air Noise and Radiation, Environmental Protection \n           Agency; Joan Claybrook, Former National Highway Traffic \n           Safety Administration; Anthony Robbins, Former \n           Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety \n           and Health.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There are any number of former Federal regulators who \nhave signed on, along with former Secretary Reich. One paragraph:\n\n       In his written work and testimony before Congress, Dr. \n     Graham has repeatedly argued for an increased reliance on \n     cost-benefit and cost effectiveness analysis in the \n     regulatory process. We agree that economic analysis plays an \n     important role in policy making. But increasing the role that \n     economic analysis plays in rulemaking threatens to crowd out \n     considerations of equal or perhaps greater importance that \n     are harder to quantify and to put in terms of dollars--for \n     example, what is the dollar value of making public spaces \n     accessible so a paraplegic participate fully in community \n     values? How should we quantify the worth of protecting \n     private medical information from commercial disclosure? Why \n     is the value of preventing a child from developing a future \n     cancer worth only a small fraction of the value of preventing \n     her from dying in an auto accident? How do you quantify the \n     real value of a healthy ecosystem?\n\n  That is what is at issue here. Did you notice the other day the \nreport about how children are doing better but not with asthma? Where \nis the protection going to be for these children? In this cost-benefit \nanalysis, the thing that is never looked at is the cost to the workers \nwho suffer the physical pain in the workplace. What about the cost of a \nworker who has to quit working and can't support his family because he \nhas lost his hearing or because of a disabling injury in the workplace? \nWhat about people who have years off their life and end up dying early \nfrom cancer when they shouldn't have, but they were working with these \ncarcinogenic substances? What about the cost to children who are still \nexposed to lead paint who can't learn, can't do as well in school? What \nabout the cost to all of God's children when we don't leave this Earth \nbetter than the way we found it? We are all but strangers and guests in \nthis land. What about the cost of values when we are not willing to \nprotect the environment, we are not willing to be there for our \nchildren?\n  I believe Senators should vote no. Frankly, the more people in the \ncountry who find out about this agenda of this administration, they are \ngoing to find it to be extreme and harsh and not in the national \ninterest and not in their interest and not in their children's \ninterest. This nomination is a perfect example of that.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague Senator \nThompson for yielding to me. I will be brief.\n  I have heard our colleagues. I heard part of Senator Wellstone's \nstatement. He said he thought Mr. Graham would be extreme, out of the \nmainstream, as far as regulating a lot of our industries. I totally \ndisagree.\n  I am looking at some of the people who are stating their strong \nsupport for Dr. John Graham. I will just mention a couple, and I will \ninclude for the Record a couple of their statements. One is former EPA \nAdministrator William Reilly. No one would ever call him extreme. He \nsaid that John Graham has ``impressed me with his rigor, fairmindedness \nand integrity.'' Dr. Lewis Sullivan, former Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, said ``Dr.\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\nGraham is superbly qualified to be the OIRA administrator.''\n  Former administrators from both Democrat and Republican \nadministrations conveyed their confidence that John Graham ``is not an \n'opponent' of all regulation but rather is deeply committed to seeing \nthat regulation serves broad public purposes as effectively as \npossible.''\n  I looked at this letter. It is signed by Jim Miller and Chris DeMuth, \nWendy Gramm, all Republicans, but also by Sally Katzen, who a lot us \ngot to know quite well during a couple of regulatory battles, and John \nSpotila, both of whom were administrators during President Clinton's \nreign as President. They served in that capacity. They said he is \nsuperbly qualified.\n  Dr. Robert Leiken, a respected expert on regulatory affairs at the \nBrookings Institution said that Dr. Graham is ``the most qualified \nperson ever nominated for the job.'' That is a lot when you consider \npeople such as Chris DeMuth and Wendy Gramm, Sally Katzen and others, \nall very well respected, both Democrats and Republicans. If you had \nstatements by people who have served in the job, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, when you have people who have been former heads of EPA--\nincidentally, when we passed the clean air bill, I might mention, \nAdministrator Reilly--when they are strongly in support of him, they \nsay he is maybe the most qualified person ever, that speaks very highly \nof Dr. Graham.\n  If I believed all of the statements or thought that the statements \nwere accurate that claim he would be bad for the environment, and so \non, I would vote with my colleagues from Illinois and Minnesota. I \ndon't happen to agree with that. It just so happens that several former \nAdministrators don't agree with it either.\n  Dr. Graham is supported by many people who are well respected. He is \nmore than qualified. I believe he will do an outstanding job as OIRA \nAdministrator.\n  I urge our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to give him an \noverwhelming vote of support.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Thompson and Senator Levin, for \nallowing me to speak.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letters I \nreferenced.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 27, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Thompson and Lieberman: I am writing to \n     support the nomination of John Graham to head OMB's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n       Throughout a distinguished academic career, John has been a \n     consistent champion for a risk-based approach to health, \n     safety and environmental policy. He is smart, he has depth, \n     and he is rigorous in his thinking. I think that he would \n     bring these qualities to the OIRA position and would help \n     assure that the rules implementing our nation's health and \n     environmental laws are as effective and as efficient as they \n     can be in achieving their objectives.\n       There is a difference between Graham's work at Harvard's \n     Center on Risk Analysis and the responsibilities which he \n     would exercise at OIRA/OMB, and I think he understands that. \n     At Harvard, he has concentrated on research about the \n     elements of risk and their implications for policymakers, as \n     well as on communicating the findings. At OMB, the charge \n     would be quite different, involving the implementation of \n     laws enacted by Congress, working with the relevant federal \n     agencies--in short, taking more than cost-effectiveness into \n     account.\n       I have no doubt that you and your colleagues on the \n     Committee will put tough questions to him during his \n     confirmation hearing and set forth your expectations for the \n     position and his tenure should he be confirmed by the Senate. \n     And I expect he will give the reassurances you require, of \n     impartial and constructive administration of OIRA, and of \n     avoiding the stalemates that have characterized OIRA-EPA \n     relations, for example, in years past. The position at OIRA \n     is fraught with potential for conflict and obstruction, but \n     the advent of a thoroughgoing professional who has committed \n     his career to the analysis and exposition of risk should be \n     seen as positive. In sum, my interactions over the years with \n     John Graham have impressed me with his rigor, fairmindedness \n     and integrity.\n       With every good wish,\n           Sincerely yours,\n     William K. Reilly.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson, \n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Joe Lieberman,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Lieberman: The undersigned \n     are former administrators of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which was established within the \n     Office of Management and Budget by the Paperwork Reduction \n     Act of 1980. We are writing to urge prompt and fair-minded \n     Senate review of Professor John D. Graham's nomination to be \n     OIRA Administrator.\n       The ``R'' in OIRA involves the regulatory aspects of the \n     Office. These are in an important part of the OIRA \n     Administrator's overall responsibilities. The five of us--\n     like the Presidents we worked for--have differing views of \n     the appropriate role of government regulation in the economy \n     and society. All of us, however, came to appreciate three \n     essential features of regulatory policy during our tours at \n     OIRA.\n       First, regulation has come to be a highly important \n     component of federal policy-making, with significant \n     consequences for public welfare. Second, the importance of \n     regulatory policy means that individual rules should be \n     subject to solid, objective evaluation before they are \n     issued. Third, the regulatory process should be open and \n     transparent, with an opportunity for public involvement, and \n     final decisions should be clearly and honestly explained. In \n     our view, objective evaluation of regulatory costs and \n     benefits, and open and responsive regulatory procedures, \n     serve the same purpose: to avert policy mistakes and undue \n     influence of narrow interest groups, and to ensure that \n     federal rules provide the greatest benefits to the widest \n     public.\n       We believe that John Graham understands and subscribes to \n     these principles. His professional field, risk assessment, \n     lies at the heart of many of the most important health, \n     safety, and environmental rules. Despite some of the \n     criticisms of Professor Graham's work that have appeared \n     since his nomination was announced, we are confident that he \n     is not an ``opponent'' of all regulation but rather is deeply \n     committed to seeing that regulation serves broad public \n     purposes as effectively as possible.\n       The Senate's role in the appointment process is a critical \n     one, and Professor Graham's nomination merits careful \n     scrutiny and deliberation in the same manner as other senior \n     Executive Branch appointments. At the same time, the \n     President is entitled to the services of qualified appointees \n     as soon as possible--and this is a particularly important \n     factor today, when many regulatory issues of great public \n     importance and heated debate are awaiting decision by the \n     President's political officials. We therefore urge prompt and \n     fair-minded Senate review of Professor Graham's nomination.\n           Respectfully,\n     James C. Miller III.\n     Christopher DeMuth.\n     Wendy L. Gramm.\n     Sally Katzen.\n     John Spotila.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from \nMichigan. I ask how much time he would require?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Perhaps 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at the heart of this debate on the \nnomination of John Graham to be Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs is the issue of cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment in agency rule making. Some of the groups \nopposed to this nomination, I believe, are concerned that Dr. Graham \nwill live up to his promise and actually require agencies to do \ncompetent and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments \nof proposed rules. I hope he will. The goal of competent cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment is to ensure that the public will be able \nto get the biggest bang for its buck when it comes to federal \nregulation and that the requirements agencies impose to protect the \nenvironment and public health and safety will do more to help than to \nhurt. That is what we should all want.\n  I have been at odds over the past 20 years with some of my closest \nfriends in the environmental, labor, and consumer movements over this \nnotion of cost-benefit analysis. I have supported legislation to \nrequire cost-benefit analysis by agencies when issuing regulations \nsince I first came to the Senate because, while I believe Government \ncan make a positive difference in people's lives, I also know that \nGovernment can waste money on a good cause.\n  When we waste money on lesser needs, when we waste our resources on\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nthings where the benefits do not justify the costs, it seems to me that \nwe, at a minimum, have an obligation to tell the public why we are \nregulating them. If we don't do that, if we do not take the time to \nanalyze benefits, analyze costs, and explain why, if benefits don't \njustify the costs, we are regulating, then we jeopardize public support \nfor the very causes that so many of us came here to fight for--the \nenvironment, health, and safety, including workplace safety.\n  I came out of local government. I fought hard for housing programs, \nprograms to clean up the environment, neighborhood protection programs, \npublic safety programs. I spent a good part of my life in local \ngovernment fighting for those programs. Too often, I found my Federal \nGovernment wasting resources and failing to achieve the very ends which \nthose programs were supposed to achieve. Too often. When that happens, \nwe jeopardize public support for the very programs of which we profess \nto be so supportive. When we waste dollars--in whatever the program \nis--on things which cannot be justified, as when we spend thousands of \ndollars with OSHA regulations, as we used to do before some of us got \ninvolved in getting rid of hundreds of OSHA regulations that made no \nsense, when we spent money telling people in OSHA regulations that when \nclimbing a ladder you had to face forward, that doesn't protect public \nhealth. It doesn't protect workplace safety; it wastes resources on \nthings that are useless, and it brings disrepute to the regulatory \nprocess--a process I believe in. I don't make any bones about that. I \nbelieve in regulation.\n  We need regulation to protect people against abuse, to protect their \nhealth and safety. But we don't do that if we waste money and if we are \nnot willing to at least ask ourselves: What are the benefits of a \nproposed regulation? What are the costs of a proposed regulation? Do \nthe benefits justify the costs? And if they don't, why are we \nregulating then?\n  I have fought on this floor against regulatory reform measures which \nI thought went too far. I have filibustered against regulatory reform \nmeasures on this floor which I thought went too far, and which, in \nfact, would have required that agencies do some things which I thought \nthey should not have to do. For instance, we had a regulatory reform \nbill here which said, even though the law said you could not consider \nthe cost, you would have to do it anyway. No, I don't buy that. If the \nlaw says you may not consider cost, that is the law of the land and \nthat must be enforced, and no regulatory reform bill should override \nthat legislative intent.\n  By the way, I have also opposed measures which said you have to \nquantify benefits. As my good friend from Minnesota points out, there \nare hundreds of benefits which cannot be quantified, at least in terms \nof dollars. You cannot say what the value of a life is. We don't know \nthe value of a life. We don't know the value of a beautiful, \nunrestricted view in a national park. We don't know the value, in \ndollars, of a child who is disabled being able to get to a higher floor \nbecause of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We cannot put a dollar \nvalue on those benefits. And we should not. But we should weigh the \nbenefit of that and ask ourselves whether or not, with the same \nresources, we can get more kids a better education, or more kids to a \nhigher floor in a building--not to quantify in dollars those benefits, \nbut to know what those benefits are.\n  If we spend a billion dollars to save a life, if that is my loved \none's life, it is worth it. But if we can spend that same billion \ndollars and save a thousand lives, or 10,000 lives, do we not want to \nknow that before we spend a billion dollars? Is that not worth knowing? \nAre we afraid of knowing those facts? Not me. I am not afraid of \nknowing those facts. I think we want to know those facts.\n  We should want to know the costs and benefits of what we propose to \ndo. The people who should want to know them the most are the people who \nbelieve in regulation as making a difference, because if the same \namount of resources can make a greater difference, people who believe \nin regulation should be the first ones to say let's do more with the \nsame resources, let's not waste resources.\n  We know that effective regulatory programs provide important benefits \nto the public. We also know from recent studies that some of our \nregulations cost more than the benefits they provide, and that cost-\nbenefit analysis when done effectively can result in rules that achieve \ngreater benefits at less cost.\n  OMB stated in their analysis of costs and benefits of federal \nregulations in 1997, ``The only way we know to distinguish between the \nregulations that do good and those that cause harm is through careful \nassessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs.'' In a well-\nrespected analysis of 12 major EPA rules and the impact of cost-benefit \nanalysis on those rules, the author, Richard Morgenstern, former \nAssociate Assistant Administrator of EPA and a visiting scholar at \nResources for the Future, concluded that in each of the 12 rule \nmakings, economic analysis helped reduce the costs of all the rules and \nat the same time helped increase the benefits of 5 of the rules. Report \nafter report acknowledges the importance of good cost-benefit analysis \nand risk assessment for all agencies.\n  Yet some of the groups that support regulations to protect public \nhealth and safety appear to be threatened by cost-benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment. They seem to fear it will be used as an excuse to ease \nup on otherwise tough standards. But I think to fear cost-benefit \nanalysis and risk assessment is to fear the facts, and when it comes to \nthese vitally important issues of the environment and public health and \nworker safety, we shouldn't be afraid of the facts. We shouldn't be \nafraid to know whether the approach an agency may want to take to \nsolving an environmental or public health problem is not as effective \nas another approach and one that may even be less expensive.\n\n  Justice Stephen Breyer wrote about the value of cost-benefit analysis \nin his book called ``Breaking the Vicious Circle.'' He describes one \nexample of the need for cost-benefit analysis in what he calls ``the \nproblem of the last 10 percent.'' It was written by Justice Breyer when \nhe served on the First Circuit Court of Appeals:\n\n       He talks about a case ``. . . arising out of a ten-year \n     effort to force cleanup of a toxic waste dump in southern New \n     Hampshire. The site was mostly cleaned up. All but one of the \n     private parties had settled. The remaining private party \n     litigated the cost of cleaning up the last little bit, a cost \n     of about $9.3 million to remove a small amount of highly \n     diluted PCBs and ``volatile organic compounds'' . . . by \n     incinerating the dirt. How much extra safety did this $9.3 \n     million buy? The 40,000-page record of this ten-year effort \n     indicated (and all the parties seemed to agree) that, without \n     the extra expenditure, the waste dump was clean enough for \n     children playing on the site to eat small amounts of dirt \n     daily for 70 days each year without significant harm. Burning \n     the soil would have made it clean enough for the children to \n     eat small amounts daily for 245 days per year without \n     significant harm. But there were no dirt-eating children \n     playing in the area, for it was a swamp. Nor were dirt-eating \n     children likely to appear there, for future building seemed \n     unlikely. The parties also agreed that at least half of the \n     volatile organic chemicals would likely evaporate by the year \n     2000. To spend $9.3 million to protect nonexistent dirt-\n     eating children is what I mean by the problem of ``the last \n     10 percent.''\n\n  That was Justice Breyer speaking. As I have indicated, I have tried \nfor the last 20 years just to get consideration of costs and benefits \ninto the regulatory process. I have worked with Senator Thompson most \nrecently, and I worked with Senators Glenn and Roth and Grassley in \nprevious Congresses. Each time we have tried, we have been defeated, I \nbelieve, by inaccurate characterizations of the consequences of the use \nof cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment.\n  That is what is happening, I believe, with Dr. Graham's nomination. \nDr. Graham's nomination presents us with the question of the value of \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment in agency rule making once \nagain. That's because Dr. Graham's career has been founded on these \nprinciples. He believes in them. So do I. And, Dr. Graham sees cost-\nbenefit analysis not as the be-all and end-all in regulatory \ndecisionmaking; rather, like many of us, he sees it as an important \nfactor to consider. Dr. Graham supported the regulatory reform bill \nSenator Thompson and I sponsored in the last Congress--which was also \nsupported by Vice President Gore--that would require an agency to \nperform a cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment and\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nstate to the public whether the agency believes, based on that \nanalysis, that the benefits of a proposed regulation justify the costs. \nIf the agency believes they don't, then the agency would be required to \ntell the public why it has decided to regulate under those \ncircumstances. It doesn't hold an agency to the outcome of a strict \ncost-benefit analysis. It doesn't diminish an agency's discretion in \ndeciding whether or not to issue a regulation. It does mandate, though, \nthat the agency conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and, \nwhere appropriate, risk assessment before it issues a proposed rule. I \nbelieve that is a reasonable, fair and appropriate standard to which to \nhold our federal agencies accountable. And of course our bill also \nrequired that in doing cost-benefit analysis agencies take into account \nboth quantifiable and nonquantifiable benefits, a principle in which \nDr. Graham firmly believes.\n  So how do Dr. Graham's opponents attack him? They attack him by \nsaying his science has been influenced by the donors to his Center and \nthat he supports industry in its opposition to environmental, health \nand safety regulation. And they attack him by taking many of his \nstatements out of context to create what appears to be an extremist on \nthe role of environmental and health regulation but which is really a \nfabricated character that doesn't reflect reality. I think Dr. Graham \nis a fair, thoughtful, and ethical person who believes in the value of \ncost-benefit analysis and risk assessment as tools we can and should \nuse for achieving important public policy decisions. I believe Dr. \nGraham has also found it useful to be provocative when it comes to \nunderstanding risk, in an effort to shake us out of our customary \nthinking and see risks in a practical and real-life dimension.\n\n  Let me first discuss the allegation of bias with respect to funding \nsources. When various groups have questioned John Graham's \nindependence, they have suggested that his science has been skewed by \nhis corporate sponsorship. Frank Cross, Professor of Business and Law \nat the University of Texas, said ``this criticism is unwarranted, \nunfair and inconsistent with the clear pattern and practice of most (if \nnot all) similarly situated research centers.'' Yes, Dr. Graham's \ncenter received significant sums of money from corporate sponsors. But \nit also established a conflict of interest policy in line with Harvard \nUniversity School of Public Health's conflict of interest policy, \nrequiring peer review of research products disseminated publicly by the \nCenter and a complete disclosure of all sponsors. The policy requires \nthat any restricted grants received by the Center adhere to all \napplicable Harvard University rules including the freedom of the \nCenter's researchers to design projects and publish results without \nprior restraint by sponsors. I asked Dr. Graham a number of questions \non this subject during our committee hearing and found his answers to \nbe forthright and satisfactory. Dr. Graham confirmed for the record \nthat he has never delayed the release of the results of his studies at \nthe request of a sponsor, never failed to publish a study at the \nrequest of a sponsor, and never altered a study at the request of a \nsponsor. Moreover, there are numerous studies where the conclusions Dr. \nGraham or the Center reached were contrary to the interests of the \nCenter's sponsors.\n  The other line of attack against Dr. Graham is taking Dr. Graham's \nstatements out of context, to unfairly paint him as an extremist, and I \nwould like to go over just a few examples where this has happened.\n  Opponents say, ``[John Graham] has said that dioxin is an \nanticarcinogen'' and that he said that ``reducing dioxin levels will do \nmore harm than good.''\n  Those are quotes. Standing alone, that sounds pretty shocking, but \nlet's look at what John Graham actually said. The issue came up while \nDr. Graham was participating as a member of the EPA's Science Advisory \nBoard, Dioxin Reassessment Review Subcommittee, when the subcommittee \nwas reviewing EPA's report on dioxin. Here is what he said during one \nof the meetings:\n\n       (T)he conclusion regarding anticarcinogenicity . . . [in \n     the EPA report on dioxin] should be restated in a more \n     objective manner, and here's my suggestive wording, ``It is \n     not clear whether further reductions in background body \n     burdens of [dioxin] will cause a net reduction in cancer \n     incidence, a net increase in cancer incidence, or have no net \n     change in cancer incidence.'' And I think there would be also \n     merit in stating not only that [dioxin] is a carcinogen--\n\n  That is John Graham speaking--\n\n       And I think there would be also merit in stating not only \n     is dioxin a carcinogen, but also I would put it in a category \n     of a likely anticarcinogen using the draft guidelines in \n     similar kinds of criteria that you have used as \n     classifying it as a carcinogen.\n\n  He said this at another point in the meeting: ``I'd like to frame \nit''-- referring to a subcommittee member's comment--``in a somewhat \nmore provocative manner in order to stimulate some dialogue.''\n  He discusses two studies that look at different levels of dioxin and \nidentified some anticarcinogenic effects. Dr. Graham said the \nfollowing:\n\n       If, as body burdens of dioxin decline the adverse effects \n     disappear more rapidly than the adaptive or beneficial \n     effects, and this is as suggested by certain experimental \n     data both the Pitot study I mentioned and the Kociba study. \n     As the dose comes down, the adverse effects go away faster \n     than the anticarcinogenic effects. Then it's possible that \n     measures to reduce current average body burdens of dioxin \n     further could actually do more harm for public health than \n     good.\n\n  ``Possible,'' ``if,'' as two studies suggest. I want to repeat that. \n``If'' something occurs, as two studies--not his--two studies \n``suggest,'' then it is ``possible'' that at low levels there are \nanticarcinogenic effects. That is what he said in the meeting.\n  Then he went on to say the following:\n\n       The alternative possibility which EPA emphasizes is that \n     the adverse effects outweigh these beneficial or adaptive \n     effects. And I think that they're clearly right at the high \n     doses. For example, total tumor counts are up so even if \n     there's some anticarcinogenicity in there, the overall tumor \n     effects are adverse. The question is, what happens when the \n     doses come down.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for 7 additional minutes. I do not know what \ntime agreement we are under. What is the time agreement? What are the \nconstraints?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee controls 3 hours, \nof which there are 150 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield an additional 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Graham has consistently said, as he stated in the \nabove quotations, dioxin is a known carcinogen. What he went on to \nsuggest as an EPA subcommittee member is that there be an additional \ncomment, supported by two studies, that very low levels of dioxin may \nreduce the risk of cancer, calling for full disclosure about two \nstudies. It turns out, Mr. President, that in the final report of that \nEPA subcommittee, his suggestions were adopted.\n  The final report--not his, but the EPA subcommittee--says:\n\n       There is some evidence that very low doses of dioxin may \n     result in decreases in some adverse responses, \n     including cancer . . .\n\n  That may sound absurd to us, but we are not experts--at least I am \nnot an expert--and it seems to me that where you have somebody of this \nreputation who, as part of an EPA subcommittee, points to two studies \nwhich he says suggests that it is possible that at low levels dioxin \ncould actually be an anticarcinogen, and then the EPA subcommittee \nactually adopts that suggestion, for that to be characterized that he \nthinks dioxin is good, or something similar to that, is a serious \nmischaracterization of what happened.\n  I am not in a position to defend the dioxin studies, nor am I arguing \nthe substance of their outcome. I am pointing out, however, that Dr. \nGraham, when he discussed this point, wasn't making it up; he was \nbringing two scientific studies to the attention of the EPA \nsubcommittee, and in the final review report by the EPA Science \nAdvisory Panel, Dr. Graham's suggestion and the two studies to which he \nrefers are mentioned.\n  Who would have thought in the year 2000 that cancer victims would be \ntaking thalidomide and actually seeing positive results. That is \ncounterintuitive to me. I was raised believing thalidomide to be the \nworst, deadly substance just about known. The idea that last year \npeople would be taking thalidomide as an anticarcinogen is surely\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\ncounterintuitive to me, but we must not be afraid of knowing cost-\nbenefits. It must not strike fear in our hearts, those of us who \nbelieve that regulation can make such a positive difference in the \nlives of people.\n  We should not be terrorized by labels, by characterizations which are \nnot accurate. We should, indeed, I believe more than anybody, say: We \nwant to know costs and benefits. We do not want to quantify the value \nof a human life. That is not what this is about. We should not quantify \nin dollars the value of a human life. It is invaluable--every life.\n  There is no dollar value that I can put on any life or on limb or on \nsafety or on access. But we should know what is produced by a \nregulation and what is the cost of that regulation and what resources \nwe are using that might be better used somewhere else to get greater \nbenefits and still then make a judgment--not be prohibited from \nregulating, but at least know cost-benefit before we go on.\n  Lets look at another issue where John Graham has been quoted out of \ncontext by his critics. Critics say that Dr. Graham has said that the \nrisk from pesticides on food is ``trivial.'' In January 1995, Dr. \nGraham participated in a National Public Radio broadcast discussing \nupcoming congressional hearings on regulatory reform. At the time, he \nwas attempting to bring to light the importance of risk-based \npriorities, the importance of identifying and understanding the most \nserious risks vis a vis less significant risks. In putting this comment \nin the right context, lets look at what he actually said:\n\n       It [the federal government] suffers from a syndrome of \n     being paranoid and neglectful at the same time. We waste our \n     time on trivial risks like the amount of pesticides residues \n     on foods in the grocery store at the same time that we ignore \n     major killers such as the violence in our homes and \n     communities.\n\n  It was a provocative statement, and Dr. Graham did refer to pesticide \nresidues as ``trivial,'' but it was done in the context of a larger \ndiscussion of overall risks. Dr. Graham was making a statement to make \npeople think about risk-based priorities. Dr. Graham has consistently \nstated that since we have limited funds, there should be ``explicit \nrisk-based priority setting'' of regulations. In other words, we have \nto make smart choices and strongly supported decisions and we need full \ndisclosure of the differing risks to do this.\n  Dr. Graham's statements from an op-ed that he wrote for the Wall \nStreet Journal on the merits of conducting cost-benefit analysis have \nalso been mischaracterized. Critics say that John Graham has said that \nbanning pesticides that cause small numbers of cancers is ``nutty.'' In \nthe op-ed, Dr. Graham was opining on the adequacy of EPA's risk \nassessments supporting proposals to ban certain pesticides. Dr. Graham \npoints out that the EPA did not look at all the costs and benefits \nassociated with banning or not banning certain pesticides. He wrote:\n\n       Pesticides are one example of the problem at EPA. EPA chief \n     Carol Browner has proposed banning any pesticide that poses a \n     theoretical lifetime cancer risk to food consumers in excess \n     of one in a million, without regard to how much pesticides \n     reduce the cost of producing and consuming food. (The best \n     estimates are that banning all pesticides that cause cancer \n     in animals would raise the price of fruits and vegetables by \n     as much as 50%). This is nutty. A baby's lifetime risk of \n     being killed on the ground by a crashing airplane is about \n     four in a million. No one has suggested that airplanes should \n     be banned without regard to their benefits to consumers.\n\n  Dr. Graham was making the point that we do not live in a risk-free \nworld and that some risks are so small that while they sound bad, \nrelatively speaking, they are minor compared to other risks we live \nwith every day. Dr. Graham believes we should consider all the facts, \nthat we should disclose all the costs and benefits associated with \nproposed regulations so we make smart common sense decisions.\n  Dr. Graham writes in the same article that ``One of the best cost-\nbenefit studies ever published was an EPA analysis showing that several \ndollars in benefits result from every dollar spent de-leading \ngasoline.'' His critics don't quote that part.\n  Continuing with the pesticides issue, critics say that Dr. Graham has \nsaid that ``banning DDT might have been a mistake.'' This is not what \nDr. Graham said. He actually said:\n\n       Regulators need to have the flexibility to consider risks \n     to both consumers and workers, since new pesticide products \n     that protect consumers may harm workers and vice versa. For \n     example, we do not want to become so preoccupied with \n     reducing the levels of pesticide residues in food that we \n     encourage the development and use of products that pose \n     greater dangers to farmers and applicators. As an example, \n     consider the pesticide DDT, which was banned many years ago \n     because of its toxicity to birds and fish. The substitutes to \n     DDT particularly organophosphate products, are less \n     persistent in food and in the ecosystem but have proven to be \n     more toxic to farmers. When these substitutes were \n     introduced, a number of unsuspecting farmers were poisoned by \n     the more acutely toxic substitutes for DDT.\n\n  These statements were part of Dr. Graham's testimony for a joint \nhearing on legislative issues pertaining to pesticides before the \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the House \nSubcommittee on Health and Environment in September 1993. Dr. Graham \nwas addressing his concerns on the lack of disclosure and review of the \ncosts and benefits associated with the proposal of certain pesticides \nregulations. To properly show where Dr. Graham is on the pesticide \nissue, let me quote Dr. Graham's summary comments on risk analysis he \nmade at that hearing. Dr. Graham testified:\n\n       Pesticides products with significant risks and negligible \n     benefits should be banned. Products with significant benefits \n     and negligible risks should be approved. We should not give \n     much attention to products whose risks and benefits are both \n     negligible. When the risks and benefits are both significant, \n     the regulator faces a difficult value judgement. Before \n     approving use of a pesticide, the regulator should certainly \n     assure himself or herself that promising alternatives of the \n     pesticide are not available. If they are not, a conditional \n     registration may be the best course of action--assuming that \n     the benefits to the consumer are significant and the health \n     risks are acceptable (even if non-negligible). There is \n     nothing unjust or unethical about a society of consumers who \n     subject themselves to some degree of involuntary risk from \n     pesticide use in exchange for consumer benefits. If possible, \n     its preferable to let each consumer make this judgement. But \n     our society certainly accepts a considerable amount of \n     (irreducible) involuntary risk from automobiles and electric \n     power production in exchange for the substantial benefits \n     these technologies offer the consumer.\n\n  In other words, Dr. Graham is saying that risks need to be disclosed \nand weighted based on the level of risk to make a fair decision. We \nneed to have full disclosure and consideration of all the costs and \nbenefits to make smart common sense decisions. In that same testimony, \nDr. Graham also said:\n\n       Each year thousands of poisonings occur to pesticide users, \n     often due to application and harvesting practices that \n     violate safety precautions. Recent studies suggest that the \n     rates of some types of cancer among farmers may be associated \n     with the frequency of herbicide use. It is not yet known \n     whether or not these associations reflect a cause-and-effect \n     relationship. Congress should examine whether EPA's recent \n     occupational health rule is adequate to protect the health of \n     farmworkers and applicators.\n\n  But his opponents don't mention those statements.\n  Dr. Graham was criticized in a recent op-ed for saying that our \nnation is overreacting ``in an emotional gush'' to school shootings at \nplaces such as Columbine High School. But the Sunday New York Times \narticle in which those words are quoted, has a completely different \ncontext. It is an article about real dangers for teenagers, and whether \nschools are now dangerous places to be. The article notes that while \nhomicide is the second leading cause of death among youngsters, \naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ``fewer \nthan 1 percent of the child homicides occur in or around schools.'' The \narticle quotes Dr. Jim Mercy, associate director for science in the \ndivision of violence prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, as saying, ``The reality is that schools are very safe \nenvironments for our kids.'' Later on in the article the other risks to \nadolescents are discussed and that's where Dr. Graham comes in. The \narticle says:\n\n       When public health experts look at risks to young people, \n     homicides, which account for 14 percent of all deaths among \n     children, come in second. The biggest threat is accidents, \n     primarily car crashes, which are responsible for 42 percent \n     of childhood deaths. Dr. Graham of Harvard says there is a \n     danger to the ``emotional gush'' over Littleton: ``It diverts \n     energies from the big risks that adolescents face, which are \n     binge drinking, traffic crashes, unprotected sex''.\n\n  The last mischaracterization I would like to discuss relates to Dr. \nGraham's\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\nwork on cell phones. Dr. Graham's critics say that he has said that \n``there is no need to regulate the use of cell phones while driving, \neven though this causes a thousand additional deaths on the road each \nyear.'' The Executive Summary of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis \n(HCRA) report, entitled, ``Cellular Phone Use While Driving: Risks and \nBenefits'' states that there is a risk of using a cell phone while \ndriving, although the level of that risk is uncertain. It states:\n\n       The weight of scientific evidence to date suggests that use \n     of a cellular phone while driving does create safety risks \n     for the driver and his/her passengers as well as other road \n     users. The magnitude of these risks is uncertain but appears \n     to be relatively low in probability compared to other risks \n     in daily life.\n\n  Look at the stated objective of the cell phone study. The report \nstates, ``The information in this report does not provide a definite \nresolution of the risk-benefit issue concerning use of cellular phones \nwhile driving. The objective of the report is to stimulate greater \nscientific and public policy discussion of this issue.'' Dr. Graham \nstates up-front that the study is promoting further discussion and \nresearch on the issue of cell phone use. The report also does not \ncompletely rule out the need for regulation; it states that further \nstudy is necessary. The Executive Summary states:\n\n       Cellular phone use while driving should be a concern of \n     motorists and policymakers. We conclude that although there \n     is evidence that using a cellular phone while driving poses \n     risks to both the drivers and others, it may be premature to \n     enact substantial restrictions at this time. Indecision about \n     whether cellular phone use while driving should be regulated \n     is reasonable due to the limited knowledge of the \n     relative magnitude of risks and benefits. In light of this \n     uncertainty, government and industry should endeavor to \n     improve the database for the purpose of informing future \n     decisions of motorists and policymakers. In the interim, \n     industry and government should encourage, through vigorous \n     public education programs, more selective and prudent use \n     of cellular phones while driving in order to enhance \n     transport safety.\n\n  Here, as is in the other examples, Dr. Graham is recommending that \nall data be considered so we can make a smart, common sense decision on \nany proposed regulation. There is no doubt that as a college professor, \nDr. Graham has made some provocative statements on different issues. \nAnd I don't agree with all of the statements or considerations he has \nmade, but, I do believe, these statements are within the context of \nreasonable consideration of the risks and that he has made these \nstatements to promote free thinking to generate thoughts and ideas so \nwe can make the best decisions.\n  Mr. President, I don't take any pleasure today in opposing some of my \ngood friends and colleagues on a matter about which they appear to care \nso much. They have characterized the nomination of John Graham as a \nthreat to our progress in protecting the environment, consumer safety \nand the safety of the workplace. If I believed that, I would vote \n``no'' in an instant. But, contrary to what has been said by his \nopponents, I find John Graham to be a balanced and thoughtful person. \nSo do other individuals in the regulatory field whom I respect. Dr. \nGraham has received letters of support from, among others, former EPA \nAdministrator and now head of the Wilderness Society, William Reilly; \nfive former OIRA Administrators from both Republican and Democratic \nAdministrations; 95 academic colleagues; Harvey Fineberg, the Provost \nof Harvard College, numerous Harvard University professors, and Cass \nSunstein, University of Chicago Law Professor. Professor Sunstein has \nwritten a particularly compelling letter of support which I would like \nto read.\n  Dr. Graham has supported common sense, well-analyzed regulations \nbecause they use resources wisely against the greatest risks we face. \nThat is the best way to assure public support for health and safety \nregulatory programs. I think Dr. Graham will serve the public well as \nAdministrator of OIRA, and I look forward to working with him on these \nchallenging issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nletter from Professor Sunstein.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         .The University of Chicago,\n\n\n                                               The Law School,\n\n                                      Chicago, IL, March 28, 2001.\n     Senator Joseph Lieberman,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: I am writing to express the \n     strongest possible support for John Graham's nomination to be \n     head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. \n     This is an exceptional appointment of a truly excellent and \n     nonideological person.\n       I've known John Graham for many years. He's a true believer \n     in regulatory reform, not as an ideologue but as a charter \n     member of the ``good government'' school. In many ways his \n     views remind me of those of Supreme Court Justice, and \n     Democrat, Stephen Breyer (in fact Breyer thanks John in his \n     most recent book on regulation). Unlike some people, John is \n     hardly opposed to government regulation as such. In a number \n     of areas, he has urged much more government regulation. In \n     the context of automobile safety, for example, John has been \n     one of the major voices in favor of greater steps to protect \n     drivers and passengers.\n       A good way to understand what John is all about is to look \n     at his superb and important book (coauthored with Jonathan \n     Wiener), Risk vs. Risk (Harvard University Press). A glance \n     at his introduction (see especially pp. 8-9) will suffice to \n     show that John is anything but an ideologue. On the contrary, \n     he is a firm believer in a governmental role. The point of \n     this book is to explore how regulation of some risks can \n     actually increase other risks--and to ensure that government \n     is aware of this point when it is trying to protect people. \n     For example, estrogen therapy during menopause can reduce \n     some risks, but increase others at the same time. What John \n     seeks to do is to ensure that regulation does not \n     inadvertently create more problems than it solves. John's \n     concern about the possible problems with CAFE standards for \n     cars--standards that might well lead to smaller, and less \n     safe, motor vehicles--should be understood in this light. \n     Whenever government is regulating, it should be alert to the \n     problem of unintended, and harmful, side effects. John has \n     been a true pioneer in drawing attention to this problem.\n       John has been criticized, in some quarters, for pointing \n     out that we spend more money on some risks than on others, \n     and for seeking better priority-setting. These criticisms are \n     misplaced. One of the strongest points of the Clinton/Gore \n     ``reinventing government'' initiative was to ensure better \n     priority-setting, by focusing on results rather than red-\n     tape. Like Justice Breyer, John has emphasized that we could \n     save many more lives if we used our resources on big problems \n     rather than little ones. This should not be a controversial \n     position. And in emphasizing that environmental protection \n     sometimes involves large expenditures for small gains, \n     John is seeking to pave the way toward more sensible \n     regulation, not to eliminate regulation altogether. In \n     fact John is an advocate of environmental protection, not \n     an opponent of it. When he criticizes some regulations, it \n     is because they deliver too little and cost too much.\n       John has also been criticized, in some quarters, for his \n     enthusiasm for cost-benefit analysis. John certainly does \n     like cost-benefit analysis, just like President Clinton, \n     whose major Executive Order on regulation requires cost-\n     benefit balancing. But John isn't dogmatic here. He simply \n     sees cost-benefit analysis as a pragmatic tool, designed to \n     ensure that the American public has some kind of account of \n     the actual consequences of regulation. If an expensive \n     regulation is going to cost jobs, people should know about \n     that--even if the regulation turns out to be worthwhile. John \n     uses cost-benefit analysis as a method to promote better \n     priority-setting and more ``bang for the buck''--not as a way \n     to stop regulation when it really will do significant good.\n       I might add that I've worked with John in a number of \n     settings, and I know that he is firmly committed to the law--\n     and a person of high integrity. He understands that in many \n     cases, the law forbids regulators from balancing costs \n     against benefits, or from producing what he would see as a \n     sensible system of priorities. As much as anyone I know, John \n     would follow the law in such cases, not his own personal \n     preferences.\n       A few words on context: I teach at the University of \n     Chicago, in many ways the home to free market economics, and \n     I know some people who really are opposed to regulatory \n     programs as such. As academics, these people are excellent, \n     but I disagree with them strongly, and I believe that the \n     nation would have real reason for concern if one of them was \n     nominated to head OIRA. John Graham is a very different sort. \n     He cannot be pigeonholed as ``conservative'' or ``liberal''; \n     on regulatory issues, he's unpredictable in the best sense. I \n     wouldn't be at all surprised if, in some settings, he turned \n     out to be a vigorous voice for aggressive government \n     regulation. In fact that's exactly what I would expect. When \n     he questions regulation, it is because he thinks we can use \n     our resources in better ways; and on this issue, he stands as \n     one of the most important researchers, and most promising \n     public servants, in the nation.\n       From the standpoint of safety, health, and the environment, \n     this is a terrific appointment, even an exciting one. I very \n     much hope that he will be confirmed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cass R. Sunstein.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have speakers in support. I see my \nfriend from Connecticut. In the interest of balance, if the Senator \ndesires time, I yield. Not my time, of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Tennessee for \nhis graciousness and fairness. I yield myself up to 15 minutes from the \ntime I have under the prevailing order.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of John Graham to administer the Office \nof Information and Regulatory Affairs, known as OIRA, is an important \nnomination, although the office is little known. I say that because the \noffice, though little known, has a far reach throughout our Government. \nIt particularly has a significant effect on a role of Government that \nis critically important and cherished by the public. That is the \nprotective role. This responsibility, when applied to the environment \nor the health and safety of consumers and workers, is worth a vigorous \ndefense. It is a role which the public wants and expects the Government \nto play. I fear it is a role from which the present administration \nseems to be pulling away. It is in that context I view this nomination.\n  With that in mind, I have weighed Dr. Graham's nomination carefully. \nI have reviewed his history and his extensive record of advocacy and \npublished materials. I listened carefully to his testimony before the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I did so, inclined, as I usually am, to \ngive the benefit of the doubt to the President's nominees. In this \ncase, my doubts remained so persistent and the nominee's record on \nissues that are at the heart of the purpose of the office for which he \nhas been nominated are so troubling that I remain unconvinced that he \nwill be able to appropriately fulfill the responsibilities for which he \nhas been nominated. I fear in fact, he might--not with bad intentions \nbut with good intentions, his own--contribute to the weakening of \nGovernment's protective role in matters of the environment, health, and \nsafety. That is why I have decided to oppose Dr. Graham's nomination.\n  Let me speak first about the protective role of Government. Among the \nmost essential duties that Government has is to shield our citizens \nfrom dangers from which they cannot protect themselves. We think of \nthis most obviously in terms of our national security or of enforcement \nof the law at home against those who violate the law and commit crimes. \nBut the protective function also includes protecting people from \nbreathing polluted air, drinking toxic water, eating contaminated food, \nworking under hazardous conditions, being exposed to unsafe consumer \nproducts, and falling prey to consumer fraud. That is not big \ngovernment; that is responsible, protective government. It is one of \nthe most broad and supportive roles that Government plays.\n  OIRA, this office which Dr. Graham has been nominated to direct, is \nthe gatekeeper, if you will, of Government's protective role. OIRA \nreviews major rules proposed by agencies and assesses information on \nrisk, cost, benefits, and alternatives before the regulations can go \nforward. Then if the Administrator of OIRA finds an agency's proposed \nrule unacceptable, they return the rule to the agency for further \nconsideration. That is considerable power.\n  This nominee would continue the traditional role but charter a \nfurther, more ambitious role by declaring that he intends to involve \nhimself more in the front end of the regulatory process, I assume. That \nis what he said before our committee. I assume by this he meant he will \ntake part in setting priorities in working with agencies on regulations \neven before they have formalized and finalized their own ideas to \nprotect the public.\n\n  So his views on regulation are critically important, even more \nimportant because of this stated desire he has to be involved in the \nfront end of the process. It also means he could call upon the agencies \nto conduct time-consuming and resource-intensive research and analysis \nbefore they actually start developing protections needed under our \nenvironmental statutes.\n  Some others have referred to this as paralysis by analysis; in other \nwords, paralyzing the intention, stifling the intention of various \nagencies of our Government to issue regulations which protect the \nenvironment, public health, safety, consumers, by demanding so much \nanalysis that the regulations are ultimately delayed so long they are \nstifled.\n  OIRA, looking back, was implicated during earlier administrations in \nsome abuses that both compromised the protective role of Government and \nundermined OIRA's own credibility. There was a history of OIRA \nreviewing regulations in secret, without disclosure of meetings or \ncontext with interested parties. Rules to protect health, safety, and \nthe environment would languish at OIRA, literally, for years. I am not \nmaking that up. Regulations would be stymied literally for years with \nno explanation. Then OIRA would return them to the agencies with many \nrequired changes, essentially overruling the expert judgment of the \nagencies, which not only compromised the health and safety of the \npublic which was unprotected by those regulations for all that time but \nalso frustrated the will of Congress which enacted the laws that were \nbeing implemented by those regulations.\n  To be fair, of course, it is too soon to say whether similar problems \nwill occur at OIRA during the Bush administration, and Dr. Graham \nhimself expressed a desire to uphold the transparency of decisionmaking \nat OIRA. However, the potential for abuse remains. That is particularly \nso for delaying the process, with question after question, while the \npublic remains unprotected.\n  Let me turn directly to Dr. Graham's record. In the hearing on his \nnomination, Dr. Graham acknowledged, for instance, his opposition to \nthe assumptions underlying our landmark environmental laws --that every \nAmerican has a ``right'' to drink safe water and breathe clean air. \nIndeed, Dr. Graham has devoted a good part of his career to arguing \nthat those laws mis-allocate society's resources, suggesting we should \nfocus more on cost-benefit principles, which take into consideration, I \nthink, one view of the bottom line, but may sacrifice peoples' right to \na clean and healthy environment and a fuller understanding of the \nbottom-line costs involved when people are left unprotected. Dr. Graham \nhas written generally, for example, that the private sector should not \nbe required to spend as much money as it does on programs to control \ntoxic pollution, that he believes, on average, are less cost-effective \nthan medical or injury-prevention efforts, where presumably more money \nshould be spent. But why force us to make such a choice when both are \nnecessary for the public interest?\n\n  Dr. Graham has said society's resources might be better spent on \nbicycle helmets or violence prevention programs than on reducing \nchildren's exposure to pesticide residues or on cutting back toxic \npollution from oil refineries. This is the kind of result that his very \ntheoretical and I would say, respectfully, impractical, cost-benefit \nanalysis produces. Bicycle helmets save lives, and violence is bad for \nour society. But the problem is that Dr. Graham's provocative \ntheorizing fails to answer the question of how to protect the health \nof, for instance, the family that lives next to the oil refinery or in \nthe neighborhood. His rational priority setting may be so rational that \nit becomes, to those who don't make it past the cost-benefit analysis, \ncruel or inhumane, although I know that it is not his intention.\n  Dr. Graham sought to allay concerns by explaining that his \nprovocative views were asserted as a university professor, and that in \nadministering OIRA he would enforce environmental and other laws as \nwritten. I appreciate his assurances. But for me, his long-standing \nopinions and advocacy that matters of economy and efficiency supersede \nthe environmental and public health rights of the citizenry still leave \nme unsettled and make him an unlikely nominee to lead OIRA.\n  Dr. Graham's writings and statements are controversial in their own \nright, but they are all the more so in light of the actions the Bush \nAdministration has already taken with regard to protective regulations. \nIt began with the so-called Card memo--written by the President's Chief \nof Staff, Andrew Card--which delayed a number of protective regulations \nissued by the Clinton administration. The Card memo was followed by a \nseries of troubling\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\ndecisions--to reject the new standard for arsenic in drinking water; to \npropose lifting the rules protecting groundwater against the threat of \ntoxic waste from ``hard-rock'' mining operations on public lands; to \nreconsider the rules safeguarding pristine areas of our national \nforests; and to weaken the energy-efficiency standard for central air \nconditioners.\n  So his views are disconcerting. In the context of this administration \nand the direction in which it has gone, they are absolutely alarming.\n  We have received statements from several respected organizations \nopposing this nomination. I do at this time want to read a partial list \nof those because they are impressive: the Wilderness Society, the \nLeague of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the National Resources \nDefense Council, Public Citizen, National Environmental Trust, OMB \nWatch, AFL-CIO, American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, American Rivers, Center for Science and the Public Interest, \nDefenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Friends of the \nEarth, Greenpeace, Mineral Policy Center, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, the United Auto \nWorkers, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, \nThe United States Public Interest Research Group.\n  We have received, Members of this body, letters from many of these \norganizations and others urging us to oppose this nomination. We have \nalso received letters against the nomination from over 30 department \nheads and faculty members at medical and public health schools across \nthe United States, from numerous other scholars in the fields of law, \neconomics, science, and business, and from former heads of Federal \ndepartments and agencies that have been referred to earlier in this \ndebate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these various letters of opposition to \nDr. Graham's nomiantion be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    OMB Watch,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2001.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to express our opposition to \n     President Bush's nominee to head OMB's Office of Information \n     and Regulatory Affairs, John Graham. We believe Dr. Graham's \n     track record raises serious concerns that warrant your \n     careful consideration. In particular:\n       As director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which \n     is heavily funded by corporate money, Dr. Graham has been a \n     consistent and reliable ally of almost any industry seeking \n     to hold off new regulation. As OIRA administrator, Dr. Graham \n     will sit in ultimate judgment over regulation affecting his \n     former allies and benefactors. This gives us great concern \n     that OIRA will take a much more activist role in the \n     rulemaking process, reminiscent of the 1980s when the office \n     came under heavy criticism from Congress from continually \n     thwarting crucial health, safety, and environmental \n     protections. At a minimum, this raises serious concerns about \n     his independence, objectivity, and neutrality in reviewing \n     agency rules.\n       In critiquing federal regulation, Dr. Graham has employed \n     questionable analytical methods that have the inevitable \n     effect of deflating benefits relative to costs. For example, \n     he's downplayed the health risks of diesel engines, as well \n     as second-hand smoke, and argued against a ban on highly \n     toxic pesticides (all after receiving funds from affecting \n     industries). As administrator of OIRA, Dr. Graham will be in \n     position to implement these analytical methods, which would \n     not bode well for health, safety, and environmental \n     protections.\n       In pushing his case for regulatory reform, Dr. Graham has \n     often invoked a study he conducting with one of his doctoral \n     students. ``[B]ased on a sample of 200 programs, by shifting \n     resources from wasteful programs to cost-effective programs, \n     we could save 60,000 more lives per year in this country at \n     no additional cost to the public sector or the private \n     sector,'' Dr. Graham told the Governmental Affairs Committee \n     on Sept. 12, 1997. Senators clearly took this to mean \n     existing regulatory programs. Yet in fact, most of the 200 \n     ``programs'' were never actually implemented, as Lisa \n     Heinzerling, a professor at Georgetown Law Center has \n     recently pointed out. This includes 79 of the 90 \n     environmental ``regulations,'' which, not surprisingly, were \n     scored as outrageously expensive. Despite repeated \n     misrepresentations of his study by the press and members of \n     Congress, Dr. Graham has never bothered to correct the \n     record. In fact, he has perpetuated the myth by continually \n     using the study to criticize our real-world regulatory \n     system.\n       Dr. Graham has promoted the view that cost-benefited \n     analysis should be the determinative criteria in deciding \n     whether a rule goes forward. This position is frequently at \n     odds with congressional mandates that place public health \n     considerations as the preeminent factor in rulemaking \n     deliberations. For instance, Dr. Graham was recently part of \n     an amicus brief filed before the Supreme Court that argued \n     EPA should consider costs in devising clean air standards \n     (currently costs are considered during implementation), which \n     the Court unanimously rejected. We are concerned that as \n     regulatory gatekeeper, Dr. Graham would elevate the role of \n     cost-benefit analysis in ways Congress never intended.\n       Dr. Graham has little to no experience with information \n     issues, which have taken on even greater importance with the \n     advent of the intent. OIRA was created in 1980 by the \n     Paperwork Reduction Act, which gives the office chief \n     responsibility for overseeing information collection, \n     management, and dissemination. We fear that information \n     policy will suffer with Dr. Graham at the helm, and that he \n     is more likely to focus on regulatory matters--his natural \n     area of interest and expertise. Ironically, Congress has \n     never asked OIRA to review agency regulations. This power \n     flows from presidential executive order.\n       Dr. Graham's track record does not demonstrate the sort of \n     objectivity and dispassionate analysis that we should expect \n     from the next OIRA administrator. Indeed, he has demonstrated \n     a consistent hostility to health, safety, and environmental \n     protection--once telling the Heritage Foundation that \n     ``[e]nvironmental regulation should be depicted as an \n     incredible intervention in the operation of society.'' Dr. \n     Graham's nomination threatens to bring back the days when \n     OIRA acted as a black hole for crucial public inspections. \n     Accordingly, this nomination deserves very careful scrutiny \n     and should be opposed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Gary D. Bass,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n     Re: Oppose the nomination of Dr. John Graham to be OIRA \n         administrator.\n\n                                                    July 17, 2001.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and \n     the press.\n       LCV opposes the nomination of Dr. John D. Graham to direct \n     the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in \n     the Office of Management and Budget. The Administrator of \n     OIRA plays an extremely powerful role in establishing \n     regulatory safeguards for every agency of our government. \n     This position requires a fair and even-handed judge of the \n     implications of regulatory policies: John Graham's record \n     makes him an unsuitable choice for this important position.\n       OIRA is the office in the Executive Office of the President \n     through which major federal regulations and many other \n     policies must pass for review before they become final. The \n     office has great leeway in shaping proposals it reviews or \n     holding them up indefinitely. One of the principal ways in \n     which OIRA influences rulemakings is through its use of risk \n     assessment and cost-benefit analysis. Graham has a \n     perspective on the use of risk assessment and cost-benefit \n     analysis that would greatly jeopardize the future of \n     regulatory policies meant to protect average Americans. He \n     advocates an analytical framework that systematically \n     reinforces the worst tendencies of cost-benefit analysis to \n     understate benefits and overstate costs. As head of OIRA, he \n     would be in a position to impose this approach throughout the \n     government.\n       Graham's approach has led him to challenge--either directly \n     or through his support of others who use the approach--some \n     of the most valuable environmental requirements that exist, \n     including regulations implementing the Clean Air Act and the \n     Food Quality Protection Act. He has used comparative risk \n     assessments to rank different kinds of risk and to argue that \n     society should not take actions to reduce environmental risks \n     as long as there are other risks that can be reduced more \n     cheaply. His approach makes no distinction between risks that \n     are assumed voluntarily and those that are imposed \n     involuntarily.\n       Graham's considerable financial support from industry \n     raises serious questions about potential conflicts of \n     interest and his ability to be truly objective. His close \n     ties to regulated industry will potentially offer these \n     entities an inside track and make it difficult for Dr. Graham \n     to run OIRA free of conflicts of interests and with the \n     public good in mind.\n       For these reasons, we strongly urge you to oppose the \n     nomination of Dr. Graham to be the Administrator of OIRA. \n     LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on these issues in compiling LCV's 2001 Scorecard. If \n     you need more information, please call Betsy Loyless in my \n     office at 202/785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                 National Environmental Trust,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: I am writing on behalf of the \n     National Environmental Trust (NET) to urge your opposition to \n     the nomination of John Graham to head OMB's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs. As Ranking Member on the \n     Senate Government Affairs Committee, Mr. Graham's scheduled \n     to come before you at a confirmation hearing on May 16, 2001.\n       Mr. Graham's approach to regulation includes heavy reliance \n     on business friendly ``risk analysis'' and ``cost-benefit \n     analysis'' creating a higher barrier for agencies to overcome \n     in order to issue a rule other than the one which is most \n     ``cost effective''. Furthermore, Mr. Graham is hostile to the \n     very idea of environmental regulation. In 1996, Graham told \n     political strategists at the Heritage Foundation that \n     ``environmental regulation should be depicted as an \n     incredible intervention in the operation of society.'' He has \n     also stated that support for the regulation of chemicals in \n     our water supply shows the public's affliction with ``a \n     syndrome of paranoia and neglect.'' (``Excessive Reports of \n     Health Risks Examined,'' The Patriot Ledger, Nov. 28, 1996, \n     at 12.)\n       We are also greatly concerned that Mr. Graham is being \n     considered for this position given the Harvard Center for \n     Risk Analysis' record of producing reports that strongly \n     match the interests of those businesses and trade groups that \n     fund them. For instance a 1999 Risk Analysis Center report \n     found that banning older, highly toxic pesticides would lower \n     agricultural yields and result in an increase in premature \n     childhood deaths, because food production would be hampered. \n     This widely criticized report was funded by the American Farm \n     Bureau Federation, which opposes restrictions on pesticides.\n       In 1999, Mr. Graham supported the Regulatory Improvement \n     Act of 1999 (S. 746). The late Senator John Chafee, then \n     chairman of the Senate Environmental and Public Works \n     Committee promised to vehemently oppose this bill due to its \n     omnibus approach to ``regulatory reform''. Under S. 746, \n     regulations would have been subject to just the type of cost-\n     benefit analysis and risk assessments that Mr. Graham \n     advocates, across the board, regardless of the intent of the \n     proposed regulation. This bill was strongly opposed by \n     environmental, consumer, and labor groups.\n       For these reasons and more, Mr. Graham's appointment to the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB \n     represents a serious threat to public health and \n     environmental protections. Please oppose his nomination to \n     head OIRA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Philip F.

Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Governmental Affairs \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Minority Member \n     Lieberman. I am writing on behalf of the over 400,000 members \n     of the Natural Resources Defense Council to make clear our \n     strong opposition to the nomination of Dr. John D. Graham to \n     direct the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget. We encourage \n     you to very carefully consider his anti-regulatory record and \n     controversial risk management methodology during your \n     confirmation proceedings.\n       The Administrator of OIRA plays an extremely powerful role \n     in establishing regulatory safeguards for every agency of our \n     government. This position requires a fair and even-handed \n     judge of the implications of regulatory policies. Upon close \n     review, we believe that you will agree that John Graham's \n     record makes him an unsuitable choice for this important \n     position.\n       Dr. Graham possesses a decision-making framework that does \n     not allow for policies that protect public health and the \n     environment. He has consistently applied controversial \n     methodology based on extreme and disputable assumptions \n     without full consideration of benefits to public health and \n     the environment. Graham's record puts him squarely in \n     opposition to some of the most important environmental and \n     health achievements of the last two decades. His record of \n     discounting the risks of well-documented pollutants raises \n     questions about his ability to objectively review all \n     regulatory decisions from federal agencies.\n       Complicating matters further, John Graham and his \n     colleagues at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis have been \n     handsomely rewarded by industry funders who oppose \n     regulations protective of public health and the environment \n     and have directly benefited from Dr. Graham's work. These \n     relationships form a disturbing pattern that makes it very \n     difficult to imagine how Dr. Graham could effectively run \n     this office free of conflicts of interests and with the \n     public view in mind.\n       Dr. Graham's inherently biased record clearly demonstrates \n     that he is not an objective analyst of regulatory policies \n     and would not be a proper choice for this position. We \n     therefore strongly urge you to oppose the nomination of Dr. \n     Graham to be the Administrator of OIRA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John H. Adams,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Dirksen \n         Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to convey the opposition of \n     the AFL-CIO to the nomination of John D. Graham, Ph.D. to \n     direct the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \n     (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n       As Administrator of OIRA, Dr. Graham would be the \n     gatekeeper for all federal regulations. In our view, Dr. \n     Graham, with his very strong anti-regulatory views, is simply \n     the wrong choice to serve in this important policy making \n     position.\n       For years as Director of the Harvard Center for Risk \n     Analysis, Dr. Graham has repeatedly taken the position that \n     cost and economic efficiency should be a more important, if \n     not the determinative consideration, in settling standards \n     and regulations. He has argued for the use of strict cost-\n     benefit and cost-efficiency analysis, even though for many \n     workplace safety and environmental regulations, such analyses \n     are not appropriate or possible or are explicitly prohibited \n     by the underlying statute. If Dr. Graham's views dictated \n     public policy, workplace regulations on hazards like benzene \n     and cotton dust would not have been issued because the \n     benefits of these rules are hard to quantify and are \n     diminished because they occur over many years. Similarly, \n     regulations pertaining to rare catastrophic events such as \n     chemical plant explosions or common sense requirements like \n     these for lighted exit signs couldn't pass Dr. Graham's \n     strict cost-benefit test.\n       In enacting the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the \n     Clean Air Act and other safety and health and environmental \n     laws, Congress made a clear policy choice that protection of \n     health and the environment was to be the paramount \n     consideration in setting regulations and standards. Dr. \n     Graham's views and opinions are directly at odds with these \n     policies.\n       We are also deeply concerned about Dr. Graham's close ties \n     to the regulated community. The major source of Dr. Graham's \n     funding at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis has been from \n     companies and trade associations who have vigorously opposed \n     a wide range of health, safety and environmental protections. \n     Much of Dr. Graham's work has been requested and then relied \n     upon by those who seek to block necessary protections.\n       Given Dr. Graham's extreme views on regulatory policy and \n     close alliance with the regulated communities, we are deeply \n     concerned about his ability to provide for a fair review of \n     regulations that are needed to protect workers and the \n     public. If he is confirmed, we believe that the development \n     of important safeguards to protect the health and safety of \n     workers across the country would be impeded.\n       Therefore, the AFL-CIO urges you to oppose Dr. Graham's \n     confirmation as Administrator of the Office of Information \n     and Regulatory Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I write to express our strong opposition to the \n     nomination of John D. Graham, Ph.D. to serve as director of \n     the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at \n     the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n       As gatekeeper for all federal regulations, the \n     Administrator of OIRA has an enormous impact on the health \n     and safety of workers and the public. Yet Dr. Graham's record \n     as Director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis \n     demonstrates that he would minimize consideration of worker \n     and public health in evaluating rulemaking and instead rely \n     almost exclusively on considerations of economic efficiency.\n       Dr. Graham's approach to regulatory analysis frequently \n     ignores the benefits of federal regulation, indicating that \n     reviews under his leadership will lack balance. His anti-\n     regulatory zeal causes us to question whether he will be able \n     to implement regulations that reflect decisions by Congress \n     to establish health, safety and environmental protections. We \n     are also deeply concerned that Dr. Graham's extreme views and \n     close alliance with regulated entities will prevent the OIRA \n     from providing a fair review of regulations that are needed \n     to protect workers and the public.\n       For the foregoing reasons, we urge you to oppose Dr. \n     Graham's confirmation as Administrator of the Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chair, Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman Thompson: On May 17, 2001, the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs is holding a hearing on the nomination \n     of John Graham to head the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Analysis of the Office of Management and Budget. \n     On behalf of 1.3 million active and retired UAW members and \n     their families, we urge you to oppose the nomination of John \n     Graham. In this critical job, he would oversee the \n     promulgation, approval and rescission of all federal \n     administrative rules protecting public health, safety, and \n     the environment as well as those concerning economic \n     regulation. We believe his extreme positions on the analysis \n     of public health and safety regulations render him unsuited \n     for this job.\n       The UAW strongly supports Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration standards to protect against workplace \n     hazards. We are also concerned about clean air, clean water, \n     toxic waste, food, drug and product safety, and consumer \n     protection rules. The OIRA serves as the gatekeeper for these \n     standards and rules as well as for government collection of \n     information on which to base public health protections.\n       The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which John Graham \n     founded, has been the academic center for the deconstruction \n     of our public health structure. Mr. Graham and his colleagues \n     have advocated the full range of obstruction of new public \n     protections: cost-benefit, cost-per-lives saved, comparative \n     risk analysis, substitution risk, and so-called ``peer \n     review'' which would give regulated industries a privileged \n     seat at the table before the public could comment on a rule. \n     Mr. Graham has testified before Congress in favor of imposing \n     such obstacles on all public health agencies and all public \n     health laws. His academic work is entirely in support of this \n     agenda as well.\n       It already takes decades to set a new OSHA standard. Our \n     members and their families need stronger public health \n     protections, and Mr. Graham has demonstrated his opposition \n     to such protections. We are concerned that, with Mr. Graham \n     as the head of OIRA, public health and safety regulations \n     will be further delayed, protections on the book now will be \n     jeopardized, and the interests of workers and consumers will \n     not be given adequate weight.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to vote against the \n     nomination of John Graham to head OIRA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 13, 2001\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Shortly, the Senate will consider the \n     nomination of John Graham for a position as the regulatory \n     czar at the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory \n     Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). \n     We are writing to call your attention to the threat that \n     Graham's nomination poses to the environment, consumer \n     safety, and public health, and to urge his rejection by the \n     committee.\n       Graham's appointment to OIRA would put the fox in charge of \n     the henhouse. His agenda is no secret. Over the past decade, \n     Graham has amply demonstrated his hostility--across the \n     board--to the system of protective safeguards administered by \n     the federal regulatory agencies. In 1996, Graham told an \n     audience at the Heritage Foundation that ``environmental \n     regulation should be depicted as an incredible intervention \n     in the operation of society.''\n       Graham has repeatedly advocated for sweeping regulatory \n     rollback bills that would trump the statutory mandates of all \n     the regulatory agencies. He would also impose rigid, cost-\n     benefit analysis criteria well beyond that which has been \n     used in previous administrations, virtually guaranteeing that \n     many new regulations will fail to see the light of day. \n     Moreover, his special White House clearance procedures may \n     make it likely that virtually any agency response to public \n     health hazards, such as the Surgeon General's pronouncements \n     on the dangers of tobacco use, will not be made. At OMB, \n     Graham would undoubtedly be the new master of ``paralysis by \n     analysis.''\n       Grahm has represented himself as a neutral academic \n     ``expert'' from the Harvard School of Public Health when \n     testifying before Congress and speaking on risk issues to the \n     media. In fact, as our investigative report indicates, his \n     Harvard-based Center accepts unrestricted funding from over \n     100 major industrial, chemical, oil and gas, mining, \n     pharmaceutical, food and agribusiness companies, including \n     Kraft, Monsanto, Exxonmobil, 3M, Alcoa, Pfizer, Dow Chemical \n     and DuPont.\n       As just one example of the connections between his funding \n     and his agenda, in the early 1990s Graham solicited money for \n     his activities from Philip Morris, while criticizing the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's conclusion that second-hand \n     smoke was a Class A carcinogen. In short, Graham has long \n     fostered deep roots throughout an entire network of corporate \n     interests that are hostile to environmental and public health \n     protections, who would expect to call upon his sympathy at \n     OIRA.\n       A major area of controversy between Congress and the Reagan \n     and Bush I administrations concerned the use of back channels \n     in the OIRA office by major corporations and trade \n     associations to delay, eviscerate or block important public \n     health protections that federal agencies had promulgated \n     following Congress' statutory authorization and open \n     government procedures. The head of OIRA should be an honest \n     broker, reviewing regulatory proposals from federal agencies \n     and deferring to agency expertise on most scientific and \n     technical matters. Inviting Graham to head that office, given \n     his close connections to broad sectors of the regulated \n     industries, would signal a return to back-door intervention \n     by special interests.\n       We urge you to read the attached report detailing Graham's \n     shoddy scholarship and obeisance to his corporate funders, \n     and to vigorously oppose his nomination to OIRA. As a start, \n     Congress should request full access to Graham's and the \n     Harvard Center for Risk Analysis' funding records and records \n     as to speaking and consulting fees from the industries that \n     he could not be charged with regulating.\n       Graham's confirmation would constitute a serious threat to \n     our tradition of reasonable and enforceable health, safety \n     and environmental safeguards, and should be rejected.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joan Claybrook,\n       President, Public Citizen.\n     Frank Clemente,\n       Director, Public Citizen, Congress Watch.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         UFCW,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of the 1.4 million \n     members of the United Food and Commercial Workers \n     International Union (UFCW), I am writing to express our \n     opposition to President Bush's nomination of John D. Graham, \n     Ph.D., to head the Office of Management and Budget's Office \n     of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).\n       As Administrator of OIRA, Dr. Graham would be the \n     gatekeeper for all federal regulations, including those \n     dealing with environmental protection, workplace safety, food \n     and drug safety, and consumer safety. He has consistently \n     viewed cost-benefit analysis as the determinative criteria in \n     deciding whether a rule goes forward--a position that is \n     frequently at odds with congressional mandates that place \n     public health considerations as the preeminent factor in \n     rule-making deliberations. In addition to our concerns \n     regarding the fairness of Dr. Graham, we have strong concerns \n     about his extreme versions of regulatory reform, which the \n     Senate has considered but never approved and which we sought \n     to defeat.\n       Furthermore, we are also concerned with Dr. Graham's close \n     ties to industry. As Director of the Harvard Center for Risk \n     Analysis, he has received financial support from more than \n     100 corporations and trade associations over the last 12 \n     years. At the same time, Dr. Graham has produced numerous \n     reports, given testimony, and provided media commentary that \n     directly benefited those who have funded the Center, which \n     include food processors, oil and chemical companies, and \n     pharmaceutical industries. In addition, many of these \n     companies have staunchly opposed new regulatory initiatives \n     and have been leading proponents of extreme regulatory \n     reform.\n       Dr. Graham's track record does not demonstrate the sort of \n     objectivity and dispassionate analysis that we should expect \n     from the next OIRA Administrator. Given his extreme views on \n     regulatory policy, and his close ties with the regulated \n     communities, we are deeply concerned about his ability to \n     provide for a fair review of regulations that are needed to \n     protect workers and the public.\n       For these reasons, the UFCW urges you to oppose \n     confirmation of John D. Graham, Ph.D., as Administrator of \n     the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas H. Dority,\n     International President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              U.S. Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: The U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. \n     PIRG), as association of state-based organizations that are \n     active in over 40 states, urges that you oppose the \n     nomination of Dr. John Graham to the Office of Management and \n     Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), \n     and that you support closer scrutiny of his suitability to \n     lead OIRA. As Administrator of OIRA, Dr. Graham could use a \n     closed-door process to stop much-needed protections prior to \n     any public debate, and to construct regulatory procedures \n     that would weaken consumer, environmental or public health \n     protections contemplated by any federal agency.\n       Dr. Graham has a long history of espousing highly \n     controversial and academically suspect positions against \n     protections for consumers, public health, and the \n     environment. He also has a history of taking money from\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\n     corporations with a financial interest in the topics on which \n     he writes and speaks. Unfortunately, this pattern of \n     soliciting money from polluting corporations, taking \n     controversial positions that are favorable to his \n     benefactors, and failing to fully disclose conflict of \n     interests calls into question his fitness to be the \n     Administrator of OIRA.\n       Dr. Graham's positions are based on theories of risk \n     assessment that fall far outside of the mainstream, and in \n     fact, are contrary to positions taken by esteemed academics \n     and scientists. Widespread opposition to Dr. Graham's \n     nomination from well-respected professionals is indicative of \n     his unbalanced approach. Indeed, eleven professors from \n     Harvard (where Dr. Graham is employed) and 53 other academics \n     from law, medicine, economics, business, public health, \n     political science, psychology, ethics and the environmental \n     sciences drafted letters of opposition to Dr. Graham's \n     nomination. These experts all concluded that Dr. Graham is \n     the wrong person to supervise the nation's system of \n     regulatory safeguards.\n       Overwhelming opposition to Dr. Graham reflects deep concern \n     regarding his pattern of pushing controversial and \n     unsupported theories, combined with his failure to disclose \n     financial conflicts of interests. In constructing his \n     positions on regulatory affairs, Dr. Graham has employed \n     dubious methodologies and assumptions, utilized inflated \n     costs estimates, and failed to fully consider the benefits of \n     safeguards to public health, consumers and the environment. \n     Dr. Graham has used these tools when dealing with the media \n     to distort issues related to well-established dangers, \n     including cancer-causing chemicals (such as benzene), the \n     clean up of toxic waste sites (including Love Canal), and the \n     dangers of pesticides in food. In each instance, Mr. Graham's \n     public statements failed to include an admission that he was \n     being paid by corporate interests with a financial stake in \n     rulemaking related to those topics.\n       Widespread opposition to Dr. Graham is buttressed by the \n     unquestioned need for a balanced leader at OIRA. This office \n     is the gatekeeper of OMB's regulatory review process, and \n     dictates the creation and use of analytical methodologies \n     that other agencies must employ when developing protections \n     for public health, consumers, and the environment. In his \n     role as gatekeeper, Dr. Graham will have the ability to stop \n     much-needed protections before they ever see the light of \n     day. In his role as director of analysis, he will be able to \n     manipulate agency rulemakings--without Congressional approval \n     or adequate public discussion--by issuing new OMB policies \n     that force other agencies to conform to his narrow and highly \n     controversial philosophy. This could result in a weakening of \n     current protections, and a failure to create adequate future \n     safeguards.\n       OIRA needs a fair and balanced individual at its helm. A \n     review of Dr. Graham's record demonstrates an unmistakable \n     pattern of placing the profits of polluters, over protections \n     for public health, the environment, and consumers. In the \n     interests of balance and accountability, we urge you to \n     oppose Dr. Graham's nomination, and to support on-going \n     Congressional efforts to carefully scrutinize his record.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gene Karpinski,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. As a Senator reviewing a President's nominee, \nexercising the constitutional advice and consent responsibility we have \nbeen given, I always try not to consider whether I would have chosen \nthis nominee because it is not my choice to make. However, it is my \nresponsibility to consider whether the nominee would appropriately \nfulfill the responsibilities of this office; whether I have sufficient \nconfidence that the nominee would do so to vote to confirm him.\n  Where we are dealing, as we are here, with what I have described as \nthe protective role of government, where people's safety and health and \nthe protection of the environment is on the line, I approach my \nresponsibility with an extra measure of caution because the \nconsequences of confirming a nominee who lacks sufficient commitment to \nprotecting the public health and safety through protective regulations \nare real and serious to our people and to our principles.\n  Dr. Graham, in the meetings I have had with him, appears to me to be \nan honorable man. I just disagree with his record and worry he will not \nadequately, if nominated, fulfill the responsibilities of this office.\n  So taking all of those factors into account, I have reached the \nconclusion that I cannot and will not support the nomination of Dr. \nGraham to be the Director of OIRA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had spoken to Senator Durbin and Senator \nThompson. I ask unanimous consent that all time but for 1 hour on this \nnomination be yielded back and that there be, following the conclusion \nof that debate, which would be evenly divided between Senator Thompson \nand Senator Durbin, with Senator Thompson having the ability to make \nthe final speech--he is the mover in this instance--following that, \nthere will be 1 hour evenly divided and we will have a vote after that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, if I could ask Senator \nThompson, could we agree that in the last 10 minutes before debate \ncloses we each have an opportunity to speak, with Senator Thompson \nhaving the final 5 minutes?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to wholeheartedly support \nthe nomination of Dr. John Graham to be Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs within the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  I view the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or, OIRA, as \na key office in the Federal Government. It is charged, among other \nthings, with ensuring that cost-benefit analyses are completed on major \nFederal rules.\n  Fortunately, President Bush has nominated an individual who has the \nexperience, the knowledge and the integrity to uphold the mission of \nOIRA and who will be a first-rate Administrator.\n  Dr. John Graham is a tenured professor at Harvard University. He has \npublished widely, has managed the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis at \nthe Harvard School of Public Health, and is considered a world-renowned \nexpert in the field of risk analysis.\n  When I was active in the National Governors' Association, I had the \npleasure of meeting Dr. Graham and hearing his testimony about risk \nassessment and cost benefit analysis. He is, by far, one of the most \nqualified people ever to be nominated for this position.\n  As my colleagues know, I served as Governor of Ohio for 8 years. I \nknow what it's like to operate in an environment of scarce resources \nwhere tough choices have to be made on resource allocation among a \nstate's various programs.\n  In many instances, new federal regulations have a habit of costing \nstate and local governments tremendous sums of money to implement. That \nis why it is so important to have an OIRA Administrator who understands \nthe significance of sound regulations and the usefulness of cost-\nbenefit analysis when determining how federal regulations will be \napplied to our state and local governments.\n  As one who was very involved in the development of the passage of the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, I believe it is important that \nthe OIRA Administrator work to encourage agencies to consult with State \nand local governments while developing new Federal rules. OIRA is an \nenforcer of UMRA and a protector of the principle of federalism.\n  It is important that OIRA produces accurate cost-benefit analyses for \nmajor Federal regulations. For governments, businesses, and those \nconcerned with protecting the environment, accurate accounting of the \ncosts and benefits of Federal regulations is a critical tool in \nformulating both public and private decisions.\n  And accurately assessing risks, costs and benefits is what John \nGraham has done successfully throughout his career, and he will bring \nthis experience to OIRA as its Administrator.\n  Given his background and his years of experience, I am confident that \nDr. Graham will bring a reasoned approach to the federal regulatory \nprocess.\n  Dr. Graham is widely respected and his nomination has received \nsupport from many of his colleagues and public health officials at \nHarvard, from numerous business groups, from dozens of academics, from \nlabor unions such as the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and \nfrom environmental advocates such as former Environmental Protection \nAgency Administrator William Reilly.\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\n  Robert Litan, a Democrat who heads economic studies for the Brookings \nInstitution, has said that Graham ``is the most qualified person ever \nnominated for the job.''\n  John Graham is so well-qualified for this job that the last five OIRA \nadministrators, Democrats and Republicans alike, wrote to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on May 3rd, saying that ``We are \nconfident that [John Graham] is not an `opponent' of all regulation but \nrather is deeply committed to seeing that regulation serves broad \npublic purposes as effectively as possible.''\n  These five individuals know what it takes to be an effective \nAdministrator because they have done the job themselves. In their view, \nDr. Graham has the skills and he has the qualifications to be a \nresponsible steward of the public interest.\n  I agree with their assessment.\n  John Graham makes objective analyses. He throws the ball right over \nthe plate, contrary to what some of my colleagues have said about his \nrecord this evening. Dr. Graham has a distinguished record. He makes \nwell-reasoned judgments about the use of public resources.\n  For example, Dr. Graham has supported additional controls on outdoor \nparticulate pollution while also highlighting the need to give some \npriority to indoor air quality.\n  The American Council on Science and Health has stated that ``the \ncomparative risk methods that Professor Graham and his colleagues have \npioneered have been particularly useful to our organization and others \nin efforts to highlight the health dangers of smoking.''\n  Maria New of Cornell University Medical School has stated that \n``Graham has dedicated his life to pursuing cost-effective ways to save \nlives (and) prevent illness. . . .''\n  According to Cass Sunstein, a Professor at the University of Chicago \nLaw School, ``. . . [Graham] is seeking to pave the way toward more \nsensible regulation, not to eliminate regulation. In fact [Graham] is \nan advocate of environmental protection, not an opponent of it.''\n  And the American Trauma Society has concluded that, ``Graham cares \nabout injury prevention and has made many important and significant \ncontributions to the field of injury control.''\n  Before I conclude, I would like to raise one other point about John \nGraham's nomination.\n  There has been strong support for Dr. Graham's nomination from a \nvariety of sources. However, there have also been some criticism of Dr. \nGraham and the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis regarding their \ncorporate funding. I see this criticism as totally unfounded.\n  While some corporate funding has been provided to the Harvard Center, \nwhat is generally not revealed is the fact that Federal agencies also \nfund Dr. Graham's work.\n  Moreover, John Graham and the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis have \nfinancial disclosure policies that go beyond even that of Harvard \nUniversity.\n  The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis has a comprehensive disclosure \npolicy, with the Center's funding sources disclosed in the Center's \nAnnual Report and on their Web Site.\n  You just turn on your computer, get in their Web site, and it is all \nthere for everyone to see. They do not hide one thing.\n  If reporters, activists, or legislators want to know how the Harvard \nCenter is funded, the information is publicly available. It is well \nknown that the Harvard Center has substantial support from both private \nand public sectors.\n  The Harvard Center also has an explicit, public conflict-of-interest \npolicy, and as for Dr. Graham, he has a personal policy that goes \nbeyond even Harvard's as he does not accept personal consulting income \nfrom companies, trade associations, or other advocacy groups.\n  We should publicly thank individuals such as Dr. Graham who are \nwilling to serve our Nation, even when they are put through our intense \nnomination process. I know this has been very hard on his family.\n  As my mother once said, ``This too will pass.''\n  I am sure my colleagues will see through the smokescreen that is \nbeing put out here this evening by some of my colleagues.\n  Dr. Graham has answered his critics. It is now time for the Senate to \nget on with the business of the people. It is time to confirm Dr. \nGraham as the next Administrator of OIRA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over and speak on this \nnomination for several reasons.\n  One, OIRA is an office I know something about. My wife held this \nposition during the Reagan administration. It is a very powerful \nposition. It is the M in OMB. If there is one position in Government \nwhere we want someone who understands cost-benefit analysis and who is \ncommitted to rationality, it is at OIRA.\n  As I have listened to Dr. Graham's critics, it strikes me that, first \nof all, there is a broad misunderstanding about what cost-benefit \nanalysis is. Cost-benefit analysis is not the dollars of cost versus \nthe dollars of benefits. Cost-benefit analysis is when you are a kid \nand you climb over this wall and your momma comes out and says, Phil, \nget off that wall; so you weigh, A, you are liable to get a beating if \nyou do not do it; B, you might fall off and break your neck; or, C, \nSally is next door and might see you on the wall and figure that you \nactually are cool. And you weigh that in a rational way and decide \nwhether to get off the wall. That is cost-benefit analysis.\n  In reality, what Dr. Graham's opponents object to is rationality. \nThat is what they object to. If there is a garbage dump in the middle \nof the desert that no one has been close to in 50 years, they object to \nthe fact that someone will stand up and say, ``We could probably do \nmore for child safety by improving traffic safety, by buying helmets \nfor people who ride bicycles than by going out in the desert and \ndigging up this garbage dump.''\n  They object to that statement because it is rational. And they are \nnot rational. They want to dig up that garbage dump not because it \nmakes sense in a society with limited resources, not because it is a \nbetter use than sending kids from poor neighborhoods to Harvard \nUniversity--a better use of money than that--but it is because it is \ntheir cause.\n\n  Let me also say there is something very wrong with the idea that \nsomeone who takes the scientific approach is dangerous in terms of \nsetting public policy. It seems to me that you can agree or disagree \nwith the finding, but the fact that somebody tries to set out \nsystematically what are the benefits of an action, and what are the \ncosts of an action, and puts those before the public in a public \npolicymaking context--how can society be the loser from that? It seems \nto me society must be the winner from that process.\n  Let me make two final points.\n  First of all, I take strong exception to this criticism, which I \nthink is totally unfair, that Dr. Graham, in his center at Harvard \nUniversity, is somehow tainted because corporate America is a supporter \nof that center--along with the EPA, the National Science Foundation, \nthe Center for Disease Control, the Department of Agriculture, and \nnumerous other sources of funding. Where do you think money comes from? \nWho do you think supports the great universities in America? Corporate \nAmerica supports the great universities.\n  I have to say, I think there is something unseemly about all these \nself-appointed public interest groups. I always tell people from my \nState: Anybody in Washington who claims to speak for the public \ninterest, other than I, be suspicious. But these self-appointed public \ninterest groups, where do they get their money from? They don't tell \nyou. You don't know where their money comes from. Harvard University \ntells you, and they are corrupted. All of these self-appointed special \ninterest groups don't tell you where their money comes from, and they \nare pure. How does that make any sense?\n  Finally, let me just say I have heard a lot of good speeches in this \nSenate Chamber, and have heard many weak ones, and given some of them, \nbut I congratulate our colleague, Senator Levin. Senator Levin is one \nof our smartest Members in the Senate. I\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nhave often heard him make very strong statements, but I have never \nheard him better than he was tonight. I think there has been no finer \ndebate in this Senate Chamber, certainly in this Congress, than Carl \nLevin's statement tonight. It was a defense of rationality. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  The opposition to Dr. John Graham of Harvard University is opposition \nto rationality in setting public policy, because there are many people \nwho believe--I do not understand it, but they believe it--that there \nare some areas where rationality does not apply, that rationality \nshould not apply in areas such as the environment and public safety. I \nsay they should because the world operates on fixed principles and we \nneed to understand it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I appreciate the Chair's indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \ndefenders of John Graham this evening. I listened very carefully to \nCarl Levin, the Senator from Michigan. I respect him very much. It is a \nrare day when Senator Carl Levin and I disagree on an important issue \nsuch as this, but we do disagree.\n  Senator Levin, Senator Voinovich, Senator Gramm, and others have come \nto this Chamber and have talked about the fact that when you enact a \nrule or regulation in America to protect public health or the \nenvironment or workers' safety, you should take into consideration the \ncost of that rule. I do not argue with that at all. You cannot argue \nwith that. There has to be some rationality, as the Senator from Texas \nsays, between the rule and the perceived protection and result from it.\n  I do not quarrel with the fact that John Graham is capable of \nunderstanding the value of a dollar. What I quarrel with is the \nquestion of whether he is capable of understanding the value of sound \nscience and the value of human life. That is what this is all about. \nWhen you make this mathematical calculation--which he makes as part of \nhis daily responsibilities at his center for risk studies; he can make \nthat mathematical calculation; I am sure he can; we can all make it--\nthe question is, What do you put into the calculation?\n  Let me give you an example. People have come to this Chamber to \ndefend John Graham, but very few of them have tried to defend what he \nhas said on the record throughout his public career.\n  Here he is quoted in a magazine called Priorities, in 1998:\n\n       The evidence on pesticide residues on food as a health \n     problem is virtually nonexistent. It's speculation.\n\n  John Graham, in 1998: Pesticides on food as a health problem is \nvirtually nonexistent; speculation.\n  We asked him the same question at the hearing. He took the same \nposition. He backed off a little bit, but he does not believe that \npesticides on food present a health hazard.\n  Let's look at the other side of the ledger. You decide whether these \npeople are credible people or whether, as the Senator from Texas has \nsuggested, they have their own special interest at stake.\n  Here is one. Here is a really special interest group, the National \nAcademy of Sciences. They released a study entitled ``Pesticides in the \nDiets of Infants and Children'' in 1993. They concluded:\n\n       Changes needed to protect children from pesticides in diet.\n\n  Not John Graham, the gatekeeper for the rules of public health in \nAmerica, he doesn't see it; the National Academy of Sciences does.\n  Take a look at Consumers Union. I read the Consumers Union magazine. \nI think it is pretty credible. And they go straight down the center \nstripe. They tell you about good products and bad ones. That is why \nthey are credible and we buy their magazines.\n  In their report of February 1999 entitled ``Do You Know What You're \nEating,'' they said:\n\n       There is a 77% chance that a serving of winter squash \n     delivers too much of a banned pesticide to be safe for a \n     young child.\n\n  Well, obviously, the Consumers Union knows nothing about risk \nanalysis. They don't understand John Graham's idea of the world, his \nscientific revolution, his paradigm.\n  John Graham said: Pesticides on food? Virtually nonexistent as a \nhealth problem--not to the Consumers Union. They got specific: Winter \nsquash, young children, 77-percent chance that they will have a serving \nof pesticide they should not have in their diet.\n  How can a man miss this? How can John Graham, who has spent his \nprofessional life in this arena, miss this? This is basic. And he wants \nto go to OMB and decide what the standards will be for pesticides in \nfood for your kids, my grandson, and children to come, for generations?\n  Do you wonder why I question whether this is the right man for the \njob?\n  Here is the last group--another ``special interest'' group--the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Here is what they said:\n\n       EPA's risk assessment showed that methyl parathion could \n     not meet the FQPA [Food Quality Protection Act] safety \n     standard. . . . The acute dietary risk to children age one to \n     six exceeded the reference dose (or amount that can be \n     consumed safely over a 70-year lifetime) by 880%.\n\n  Methyl parathion--this was applied to crops in the field. After we \ncame out with this protective legislation, they had to change its \napplication so it did not end up on things that children would consume.\n  The EPA knew it. The National Academy of Sciences knew it. The \nConsumers Union knew it. But John Graham, the man who is being \nconsidered this evening, he did not know it. So what minor job does he \nwant in the Bush administration? The last word at the OMB on rules and \nregulations on the environment and public health and safety. That is \nwhy I oppose his nomination.\n  I at this point am prepared to yield the floor to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I do not know if there will be a request at this point \nfrom the Senator from Nevada, but I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to Senator Thompson. The \nSenator from Massachusetts wishes to speak for up to 15 minutes. The \nway we have been handling this is, whatever time is used on this side \nwould be compensated on the other side. So I ask unanimous consent for \nan additional 15 minutes for this side. And for the information of \neveryone, maybe everyone will not use all the time because there are \npeople waiting around for the vote. But I ask unanimous consent there \nbe an additional 30 minutes for debate on this matter, equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority whip and \nthe Senator from Tennessee for his courtesy. I will try not to use all \nthat time. I cannot guarantee it.\n  I obviously rise to discuss the nomination of John Graham. Having \nserved now for a number of years as chairman or ranking member, in one \nrole or the other, of the Committee on Small Business, I have watched \nfirsthand and listened firsthand to the frustration of a great many \nbusiness owners dealing with Federal regulation. I think all of us have \nheard these arguments at one time or another.\n  I have obviously also witnessed, as many of you have, how needlessly \ncomplex and redundant regulations can stifle economic growth and \ninnovation and also how regulation that was designed for a large \ncorporate entity is often totally incompatible with small firms.\n  Always the intention of the underlying rule or law is sound, whether \nit is protecting the environment or public health or worker safety or \nconsumers, but too often the implementation becomes excessive, \noverzealous, onerous, restrictive and, in the end, it is harmful.\n  Recognizing this problem, I have supported a range of efforts to \nensure that regulations are reasonable, cost effective, market based, \nand business friendly. In particular, I supported the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct. Since its passage, the RFA has played an increasingly important \nrole in protecting our Nation's small businesses from the unintended \nconsequences of Government regulation.\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\n  Additionally, with the passage of SBREFA, small businesses have been \ngiven valuable new tools to help ensure that their special needs and \ncircumstances are taken into consideration. The RFA and SBREFA, if used \nas intended, work to balance the very real need of our Federal agencies \nto promulgate important and needed regulations with those of small \nbusiness compliance costs. They can differ substantially from those of \nlarge business cousins.\n  The Small Business Administration reports that these laws I just \nmentioned have saved over $20 billion in regulatory compliance costs \nbetween 1998 and 2000 alone without sacrificing needed safeguards.\n  On the other side of the ledger, though, I also believe very strongly \nthat the Federal Government has a responsibility to protect the \nenvironment, public health, consumers, and workers. It was 6 years ago \nthat I joined with others in the U.S. Senate to oppose the enactment of \na bill that was incorrectly called the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform \nAct, a bill which, for many of us who looked at it closely and examined \nwhat were good intentions, we determined would have undermined \nimportant Federal protections.\n  I listened to the Senator from Texas a moment ago ask how society can \nbe the loser for looking at cost-benefit. I support looking at cost-\nbenefit. I support looking at the least-intrusive, most effective, \nleast-cost solution to a number of enforcement measures which we seek \nto put in place.\n  But to answer the question of the Senator from Texas, how can society \nbe a loser, the answer is very simple. Society can be a loser when \npeople bring you a bill such as the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act \nthat pretended to do certain things but actually, both in intent and \neffect, would have done an enormous amount of damage to the regulatory \nscheme.\n  The reason society can be a loser, in answer to the question of the \nSenator from Texas, is that if you apply the wrong standards, if you \napply the wrong judgments about how you make your cost analysis, you \ncan completely skew that analysis to obliterate the interests of \nhealth, of the environment, of workers, and of consumers.\n\n  Some of my colleagues may have forgotten that there are people in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives who voted against the Clean Air \nAct, who voted against the Clean Water Act, who voted against the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. There are people who have voted against almost \nevery single regulatory scheme that we seek to implement in the \ninterest of protecting clean water, clean air, hazardous waste, and a \nhost of others. There has long been a movement in this country by those \npeople who have most objected to those regulations in the first place \nto create a set of criteria that empower them, under the guise of \nreform, to actually be able to undermine the laws that they objected to \nin the first place. That is how society can be a loser, a big loser.\n  In point of fact, what came to us called the Comprehensive Regulatory \nReform Act was, in fact, the planks of the Contract with America, \nchampioned by Speaker Newt Gingrich, that began with the premise that \nthey wanted to undo the Clean Water Act altogether. When we looked at \nthis act and began to read through it very closely, we learned that \nwhat was purported to be a straightforward attempt to streamline the \nregulatory process and ensure that Federal and private dollars were \nspent efficiently and to consider the costs as well as benefits of \nFederal safeguards, while that may have been the stated purpose, that \nwould not have been the impact of that legislation.\n  In fact, I stood on the floor of the Senate with a group of \ncolleagues who defined those differences, and we stopped that \nlegislation. It would have upended Federal safeguards impacting clean \nair, clean water, public health, workers, air travel, cars, food, \nmedicine, and potentially every other area regulated for the common \ngood.\n  It did this by creating a complex scheme of decisional criteria, \ncost-benefit analysis, and judicial review that skewed the entire \nprocess away from the balance that we tried to seek in the regulatory \nreform that many of us have talked about.\n  I am in favor of regulatory reform. Do I believe there are some \nstupid environmental laws that have been applied in stupid ways by \noverzealous bureaucrats? The answer is yes, I do. Does it make sense to \napply exactly the same clean air standard of a large powerplant to \nsmaller entities, and so forth? I think most people would agree there \nare ways to arrive at a judgment about cost and analysis that is fair.\n  In working on that legislation, I saw how the regulatory process \nunder the guise of regulatory reform can be weakened to the point that \nthe laws of the Congress that we have enacted to protect the public \nwould be effectively repealed. It is partly because of the work that I \ndid at that time that I join my colleague from Illinois and others. I \ncongratulate my colleague from Illinois for his steadfast effort. We \nknow where we are on this vote, but we also know where we are in what \nis at stake.\n  I have serious concerns with this nomination because during that \nperiod of time, this nominee strongly supported and helped draft the \nregulation that I just described and other omnibus regulatory rollback \nmeasures that I strongly opposed in the 104th Congress.\n  As Administrator, Dr. Graham will be in a position to profoundly \nimpact a wide range of issues and to execute administratively some of \nthe failed proposals that he has supported previously legislatively.\n  We all understand what this office is. We understand that OMB \nDirector Daniels has already signaled the amount of increased power \nthat Dr. Graham will have over his predecessor in the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Let me give an example of one of the ways this would have an \ninfluence. The way in which these rules can be obviously skewed to \naffect things is clear in the work that we have already seen of Dr. \nGraham. For instance, his approach to risk assessment and cost-benefit \nanalysis, in my judgment, has been weighed, if you look at it \ncarefully, against a fair and balanced judgment of what also ought to \nbe measured about public health and environmental protection itself.\n  For instance, he focuses on the age of a person saved by a particular \nsafeguard. In doing so, he argues that the life of an elderly person is \ninherently less valuable than that of a younger person and thus less \nworthy of protection.\n  Now, I don't know how many Americans want to make a judgment about \ntheir family, their grandmother, or grandfather on that basis. But if \nyou weight it sufficiently, you could come out with a judgment on cost \nthat clearly diminishes the level of protection. In addition to that, \nyou make a judgment that people who die in the future are deemed less \nvaluable than people who die in the present.\n  The doctor has neglected benefits from avoided injury alone, such as \nthe prevention after nonfetal adverse health effects or ecological \ndamage. These are things many of us believe ought to be weighted as a \ncomponent in the balance, and they are not. That is how you wind up \nskewing the consequences.\n  I am not telling you that it is inherently wrong, if you want to make \na hardnosed statistical judgment, but I am saying that when the value \nof life, health, and our environment are discounted too far, then even \nreasonable protections don't have a prayer of passing muster under any \nsuch analysis.\n  I am concerned that Dr. Graham's preferred methodology in this area, \nsuch as comparative risk analysis, would make it extraordinarily \ndifficult for a new generation of safeguards to be approved under his \nor anybody else's tenure.\n  In addition, Dr. Graham made his views known on a range of issues, \nand it is apparent that if the past is a prelude to the future, he \nwould be hostile to a number of important public safeguards. For \nexample, he argued against the EPA's determination that dioxin is \nlinked to serious health problems--a hypothesis that EPA's Deputy \nAssistant Administrator for Science called ``irresponsible and \ninaccurate.'' Those are the words of the Deputy Administrator of EPA.\n  In 1999, Dr. Graham's center published a report funded by the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation that concluded that banning certain \nhighly toxic pesticides would actually increase the loss of life \nbecause of disruptions to the food supply caused by a\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nshortage of pesticides to protect crops. If anybody thinks that is an \nanalysis on which we ought to base the denial of regulations, I would \nbe surprised.\n  However, the report also ignored readily available, safer \nsubstitutes. Dr. Graham's center concluded that the EPA overestimated \nthe benefits of clean air protections because most acute air pollution \ndeaths occur among elderly persons with serious preexisting cardiac \nrespiratory disease. Under Dr. Graham's approach, the benefits would be \nlowered to reflect his view that older citizens are worth less in raw \neconomic terms.\n  Dr. Graham's center issued a study funded by AT Wireless \nCommunications that argued against a ban on using cellular phones while \ndriving. An independent 1997 study published in the New England Journal \nof Medicine found that the risk of car crashes is four times greater \nwhen a driver uses a cell phone.\n  In 1995, while debating the merits of the Comprehensive Regulatory \nReform Act, I said then that I was prepared to embrace a legitimate \neffort to streamline and improve the regulatory process. We worked very \nhard to find a compromise to do that. I believe that with SBREFA and \nother measures we have made good progress. I still believe we can make \nmore progress. But I am deeply concerned that the record suggests this \nbalance that we look for, which we want to be sensitive and fair, would \nbe absent with this nominee.\n  In closing, let me acknowledge the fact that Dr. Graham is from my \nhome State of Massachusetts. My office has been contacted by residents \nwho support and residents who oppose this nomination. I have deep \nrespect for many of those who took the time to discuss this with me and \nmy office. I am grateful for friends of mine and friends of Dr. \nGraham's who have suggested that I should vote for him. I note that I \nwas contacted by several individuals from Harvard University, which is \nhome to Dr. Graham's center. I heard both points of view. I thank each \nand every person who took the time to contact my office. I intend to \ncast my vote absolutely not on personal terms at all but exclusively on \nthe experience I had with the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act and \nbased on what I believe is an already-declared intention and a declared \nwillingness of this administration to disregard important safeguards \nwith respect to the environment.\n  I would like to see a nominee who has a record of a more clear \nbalance, if you will, in the application of those laws. I thank the \nChair for the time, and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois controls 25 minutes. \nThe Senator from Tennessee has 31 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I don't know if a UC \nis necessary, but I would be prepared to reduce the amount of remaining \ntime if he will join me. I suggest--and he can amend it if he would \nlike--that we ask unanimous consent that we each have 10 minutes and I \nam given 5 minutes to close and you are given 5 minutes to close. \nUnless you have other speakers, I would like to make that request.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object, I ask my friend, are you \nsuggesting a total of 15 minutes on each side?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, if we can keep to the \ntime we have agreed to, in about a half hour we should reach a vote. I \nalso thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, for joining \nme in opposing this nomination.\n  I will tell you about dioxin. I am not a scientist, and I don't \npretend to be. I am a liberal arts lawyer who has practiced politics \nand political science for a long time. But let me tell you what I have \nlearned about dioxin.\n  Dioxin is a highly toxic and deadly chemical. According to the \nNational Toxicology Program at the National Institutes of Health, \ndioxin is the ``most toxic manmade chemical known.'' It is not just \nvery toxic--extremely toxic--it is the most toxic chemical human beings \nknow how to create. It is not manufactured deliberately. There are no \ncommercial uses for it. It is a waste product, a contaminant, the most \ndeadly manmade toxic chemical in existence. And astonishingly, small \namounts of dioxin can kill people and animals.\n  One of the insidious features of dioxin is your body accumulates it, \nand over time it can reach a toxic level. The World Health Organization \nand the NIH brand it as a ``human carcinogen.'' If a man came before us \nand asked to be in charge of the OMB, which rules on safety for the \npublic health and environmental standards of chemicals and pesticides \nand residues, you would think there would be no doubt in his mind about \nthe danger of dioxin. There doesn't seem to be a doubt in the minds of \nany credible scientist.\n  John Graham, the man we are considering this evening, not only \ndoesn't question the toxicity of dioxin; he actually thinks it has \nmedicinal qualities. Let me read what John Graham, the nominee before \nus this evening, has said about dioxin, the most dangerous chemical \ncreated by the human race known today:\n\n       It's possible that measures to reduce current average body \n     burdens of dioxin further could actually do more harm for \n     public health than good.\n\n  That is interesting. Then he goes on to say:\n\n       I think there would be also merit in stating not only that \n     TCDD (dioxin) is a carcinogen, but also I would put it in the \n     category of a likely anti-carcinogen.\n\n  Where did he say that? Was that a casual statement that someone \npicked up on a tape recorder? No. It was a statement to the EPA Science \nAdvisory Board on November 1 and 2 of the year 2000. John Graham, \ngatekeeper, rules and regulations, protecting American families from \nhealth risks--he thinks dioxin, the most dangerous chemical known to \nman, a known carcinogen, actually stops cancer.\n  Let's see what others have said.\n  The National Institutes of Health: ``Dioxin is a known human \ncarcinogen.''\n  EPA: ``The range for cancer risk indicates about a ten-fold higher \nchance than estimated in EPA's earlier assessment, in terms of the \ndamage and danger.''\n  EPA: ``The promulgation of this theory--\n  They are referring to the statement by Mr., Dr., Professor John \nGraham.\n  ``The promulgation of this theory that dioxin is an anti-carcinogen \nhypothesis is irresponsible and inaccurate.''\n  That John Graham, whom President Bush's wants to put in a position to \njudge questions of public health and safety, who has said on the record \nand he acknowledges he is not a chemist, not a biologist, he is not a \ntoxicologist, not a medical doctor, could stand before the EPA's \nScience Advisory Board and tell them dioxin could stop cancer is almost \nincredible. It is incredible he would be nominated for this job after \nhe said it. That is what we face this evening.\n\n  People have come before us and said it is all about measuring the \ndollar value of rules and regulations with the risk involved. Let me \nrepeat, I do not quarrel with that premise, but I do believe the person \nmaking the measurement should be engaged in sound science, and in this \nsituation we have a man with advanced degrees in public policy who goes \naround telling us that dioxin, the most dangerous chemical created on \nthe Earth, can cure cancer.\n  I do not know how we can really look at that statement and this \nnomination and ignore the simple fact. Why would he say things such as \nthat? Because he has made his life work representing corporate \ninterests, industries, and manufacturers who want to reduce the \nstandards when it comes to environmental protection. He has been in \nStates such as Louisiana, Alabama, and Maine testifying on behalf of \none of his major clients, the paper industry--which, incidentally, \ndischarges dioxin from paper mills--saying you should not be that \nconcerned about dioxin. He is a chorus of one in that belief.\n  Thank goodness the State of Maine rejected his point of view and said \nthat they would have zero tolerance for dioxin, despite John Graham's \narguments to the contrary.\n  In his testimony for these companies, Graham stated:\n\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\n\n       Based on a comparison of breast cancer screening programs \n     and other cancer prevention programs, dioxin standards \n     ``would be a poor investment in cancer prevention.''\n\n  That is what it comes down to. He does not want to get into this \nargument on the merits of dioxin, and cancer, other than these few \noutrageous statements. He says there is a better way to spend the \ndollars. In Maine and other States they were trying to decide what is a \nsafe amount of dioxin that we might release in streams that may \naccumulate in the fish or the children who eat the fish or the people \nwho drink the water. He could find a way out for his corporate clients.\n  Thank goodness the State of Maine rejected his point of view. The New \nYork Times said it came out with the toughest standards in the Nation \nwhen it came to protecting the people of Maine from dioxin \ncontamination.\n  The same man who said pesticides on fruits and vegetables were not a \npublic health hazard, the same man who finds in dioxin some medical \nmerit, wants to now be the last word in Washington on rules and \nregulations on safety and public health.\n  Excuse me; I think President Bush can do better; I think America can \ndo better, better than this man.\n  A lot of people have talked about the endorsements he received. No \ndoubt he has. We received a letter originally sent to Senator Thompson \non May 17, 2001, from those who are members of the faculty who work \nwith John Graham and know of him at Harvard University, and others who \nhave worked with him in the past. This group which signed the letter \nincludes Dr. Chivian, director of the Center for Health and the Global \nEnvironment at Harvard Medical School, who shared the 1985 Nobel Peace \nPrize, and the list goes on and on, from Johns Hopkins to the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, dean of the School of \nPublic Health at UCLA. What do they have to say about John Graham?\n\n       It is a cardinal rule of scientific research to avoid at \n     all costs any conflict of interest that could influence \n     the objectivity of one's findings. This rule takes on \n     added significance in the context of biomedical and public \n     health research, for peoples' lives are at stake.\n       For more than a decade, John Graham, Director of the Center \n     for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health and \n     candidate for position of Director of the Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of \n     Management and Budget, has repeatedly violated this rule. \n     Time and again, Professor Graham has accepted money from \n     industries while conducting research and policy studies on \n     public health regulations in which those same industries had \n     substantial vested interests. Not surprisingly, he has \n     consistently produced reports, submitted testimony to the \n     Congress, and made statements to the media that have \n     supported industry positions, frequently without disclosing \n     the sources of his funding.\n\n  They give some examples:\n  Soliciting money from Philip Morris while criticizing the EPA's risk \nassessment on the dangers of secondhand smoke;\n  Greatly overestimating the costs of preventing leukemia caused by \nexposure to benzene in gasoline while accepting funds from the American \nPetroleum Institute;\n  Downplaying EPA's warnings about cancer risk from dioxin exposure \nwhile being supported by several major dioxin producers, including \nincinerator, pulp, and paper companies;\n  While simultaneously talking on cell phones in research underwritten \nby a $300,000 grant by AT Wireless communications.\n  Major spokesman before Congress on behalf of industries' ``regulatory \nreform'' agenda, while being supported by large grants of unrestricted \nfunds from chemical, petroleum, timber, tobacco, automobile--\nautomobile--electric power, mining, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing \nindustries.\n  They continue:\n\n       We, the undersigned, faculty members at schools of medicine \n     and public health across the United States, go to great pains \n     to avoid criticizing a colleague in public. Indeed, in most \n     circumstances we would rejoice over the nomination of a \n     fellow public health professional for a senior position. . . \n     . Yet, in examining the record of John Graham, we are forced \n     to conclude there is such a persistent pattern of conflict of \n     interest, of obscuring and minimizing dangers to human health \n     with questionable cost-benefit analyses, and of hostility to \n     governmental regulation in general that he should not be \n     confirmed for the job. . . .\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). The Chair advises the Senator \nfrom Illinois he has 5 minutes remaining.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in listening to the criticism of Dr. Graham and the \nimplicit suggestion that he is a little less than a menace to society \nand that his opinions are for sale, my first reaction is that it is a \nvery bad reflection on Harvard University that has let this kind of \nindividual roam the streets for the last 15 years. They obviously are \nnot aware of what he is doing.\n  It makes me wonder also why a professor at the University of Chicago \nLaw School would say ``in emphasizing that environmental protection \nsometimes involves large expenditures for small gains, Graham is \nseeking to pave the way with more sensible regulation.''\n  I wonder, in listening to why former EPA Administrator Mr. Reilly \nwould say: Graham would help ensure the rules implementing our \nenvironmental laws are as effective and efficient as they can be in \nachieving their objectives.\n  I am wondering in light of this man's ridiculous notions concerning \nscientific matters, matters of chemistry, for example, which we \nacknowledge we do not know anything about--we are not experts--we \ncriticize him for not being an expert in his area; we criticize this \nPh.D. scientist from Harvard for not knowing his subject matter, then \nwe launch into a rendition of his deficiencies for his scientific \nanalysis.\n  Mr. President, we are wading in way over our heads in criticizing Dr. \nGraham for his scientific analysis based upon excerpts, based upon \nfalse characterizations, based upon unfair characterizations of what he \nhas said and what he has done, and we will deal with some of those.\n  Again, I wonder if there is any semblance of truth of this man who \nhas headed up the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, who has been \nassociated with Harvard for 15 years, who has received the endorsements \nof Democrats and Republicans alike, who has received the endorsements \nof the last two people who served in this position, who are from the \nClinton administration, who has received endorsements from some of the \nforemost authorities in the areas involved, who has received \nendorsements from noted scientists from around the country, and I \nwonder why the dean of academic affairs for the Harvard School of \nPublic Health would say that Dr. Graham is an excellent scientist who \nhas encouraged rationality in the regulatory process.\n  I wonder why a professor at Rollins School of Public Health would \nsay: Often these public health issues are approached in a partisan way, \nbut Dr. Graham is dedicated to using careful analysis to weigh the \ncosts and benefits, et cetera. Dr. Hemmingway, director of Harvard \nInjury Control Research Center: Dr. Graham's interest is in improving \nthe Nation's health in the most cost-effective manner.\n  I am wondering how all these people could be so wrong. You are going \nto find people who disagree with anybody, and I respect that people \nhave differences of opinion. I wish it were sufficient to argue on the \nbasis of those differences of opinion, on the basis of the science that \nis involved to the extent that we can, as nonscientists, but instead of \ndoing that, what we are being introduced to here is an unfair \nrendition, what I would call basically a know-nothing kind of approach \nto a very complex series of scientific decisions with which we are \ndealing, and placing an unfair characterization on them.\n\n  I guess the one dealt with the most is dioxin. We would be led to \nbelieve that Dr. Graham's statements with regard to dioxin are \noutrageous. Why? Not because of any scientific knowledge we have or \nthat has been presented on the floor of the Senate but because \neverybody knows dioxin is a bad thing. If he says any amount of it is \nnot carcinogenic, he must not know what he was talking about.\n  I was looking at the testimony that Dr. Graham gave before our \ncommittee. He was asked by Senator Durbin:\n\n       Do you believe that exposure to dioxin can increase your \n     likelihood of cancer?\n       Mr. Graham: Thank you for reminding me. I think that at \n     high doses in laboratory animals, there is clear evidence \n     that dioxin causes cancer.\n\n  Then he says:\n\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\n\n       In humans, I think the database is more mixed and difficult \n     to interpret.\n\n  With regard to the low levels of dioxin not being carcinogenic, I \nrefer to the Science Advisory Board. Their conclusion is as follows: \nThere is some evidence that very low doses of dioxin may result in \ndecreases in some adverse responses, including cancer, but can produce \nother adverse effects at the same or similar doses.\n  The Science Advisory Board panel recommends that the totality of \nevidence concerning this phenomenon continues to be evaluated by the \nagencies as studies become available.\n  This consensus conclusion by the panel is almost exactly in accord \nwith Mr. Graham's stated position at the public meeting: the other \nadverse effects at the very low doses we are talking about are \nnoncancerous. He is trying to be a responsible scientist.\n  By placing so much emphasis on the low doses, we, because of the \ncancer issue, are missing the boat on the noncancer problems that \ndioxin causes. I don't have enough time to go into all of the detail on \nthis, but I think we can see how unfair the characterization has been \nwith regard to this complicated issue. We have a counterintuitive \nsituation that Senator Levin pointed out with regard to thalidomide. \nWho would think doctors today would prescribe thalidomide under certain \ncircumstances?\n  At a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing a couple of days ago, a \ncouple of scientists attending from the National Academy of Sciences \nhad just done a study on global warming. They pointed out certain \naerosols released into the atmosphere, which we all know is a bad \nthing, can actually have a cooling effect in the atmosphere. We are all \nconcerned about global warming, and this has a cooling effect. Does \nthis mean we need to release a lot of additional aerosol? Of course \nnot. It does not mean that. It is a scientific fact that needs to be \ntaken into consideration.\n  I am sure, somewhere, if ever nominated for office, their opponents \nwill take that statement from our hearings yesterday saying that these \nidiots believe we ought to be releasing aerosols in the atmosphere \nbecause it can have a cooling effect. I hope that does not happen. \nUnfortunately, it is sometimes the cost of public service today.\n  It is pointed out this man is anti-EPA and that some official \nsomewhere at some time in the EPA has disagreed with his assessment. \nEPA partially funded this man's education. EPA contracts with him to do \nwork, as we speak--not since he has been nominated. The center at \nHarvard has been hired by EPA to do work.\n\n  I should rest my case at that point. Of course, we never do when we \nshould, so I will continue that fine tradition. I do have another point \nto make, in all seriousness, that is what this is about, which is Dr. \nGraham has been caught up in the debate over cost-benefit analysis. \nThere are certain people in this country--I am sure their intentions \nare noble--who band together, who believe all regulations are good by \ndefinition; that there should be no questions asked about those \nregulations; that we should not take into account possible costs to \nsociety, whether they be tangible costs in dollars and cents or \nintangible costs; should not take into account whether resources could \nbe better used for more significant environmental problems; should not \ntake into account unintended consequences or any of those things; and \nthat no one should ever bring up anything that challenges the common \nwisdom with regard to these issues, and we should only listen to \nsciences and promote the regulations.\n  When times like this come about, they band together and pull excerpts \ntogether to try to defeat people who want to bring rationality to the \nregulatory process.\n  I think they harm sensible, reasonable legislation, where moderate, \nreasonable people certainly want to protect us, protect this country, \nand protect our citizens, but, at the same time, know we are not doing \nour citizens any favor if we are using our resources in a way not most \nproductive.\n  For example, it is proven we have been spending money on regulations \npertaining to water, when the real risk was not being addressed. Some \nof the money should have been placed elsewhere in our water program.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think that is what has happened. It has to be \nrecognized we make the cost-benefit tradeoffs all the time. If we \nreally wanted to save lives at the exclusion of consideration of cost \nto society, we would take all the automobiles off the streets and not \nallow anybody to drive. We know the examples, I am sure, all of us, by \nheart. Or we would make people drive around in tanks instead of \nautomobiles.\n  There are tradeoffs we have to make. They need to be done in the full \ncontext of the political discourse by responsible people with proven \nrecords. I suggest that is the nominee we have before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, the Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA, within the Office of \nManagement and Budget has the important duty of reviewing the \nregulations issued by all Executive Branch agencies. These regulations \nare critical to environmental protections, worker safety, public \nhealth, and a host of other issues. I have carefully reviewed the \ncredentials of Dr. John Graham for this position and his testimony \nbefore the Governmental Affairs Committee. I support Dr. Graham's \nnomination to be the Administrator of OIRA.\n  Dr. Graham brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this \nposition, including the use of cost-benefit analysis as a tool in \nevaluating regulations. As my colleagues know, the Clinton \nadministration issued an Executive Order requiring the use of cost-\nbenefit analysis to inform regulatory decision-making. I have no \nobjections to the use of cost-benefit analysis as long as it is not \ncarried too far. After all, we should not implement regulations if the \ncosts of compliance grossly exceed the benefits the regulation would \nproduce. It is appropriate for cost-benefit analysis to be one factor, \nbut not the exclusive factor, in making regulatory decisions. Dr. \nGraham's testimony indicates that he shares this approach.\n  While I may not agree with Dr. Graham's application of cost-benefit \nanalysis in every instance, I believe that President Bush is entitled, \nwithin the bounds of reason, to have someone in this position that \nshares his approach to governing. In my view, Dr. Graham falls within \nthis criteria.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nconfirmation of John D. Graham to be Administrator of the Office of \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs.\n  Dr. Graham has been a Professor of Policy & Decision Sciences at the \nHarvard School of Public Health since 1991, and is the Director of the \nHarvard Center for Risk Analysis. Prior to that, he was an assistant \nprofessor and then associate professor at Harvard. Graham holds a B.A. \nin Economics and Politics from Wake Forest University, an M.A. in \nPublic Affairs from Duke University, and a Ph.D. in Urban and Public \nAffairs from Carnegie-Mellon University where he was an assistant \nprofessor for the 1984-1985 academic year. Given OIRA responsibility's \nfor ensuring that government regulations are drafted in a manner that \nreduces risk without unnecessary costs, Dr. Graham's qualifications to \nhead the agency are unquestionable.\n  Since his nomination, he has come under fire for his work at the \nHarvard Center for Risk Analysis. Some who have opposed Dr. Graham have \ncharged that he and the Center have a pro-business bias. Typically, \nthose same people who oppose Dr. Graham, also oppose the use of \ncomparative risk as one of many tools to be used in determining \nenvironmental policy. That is unfortunate, because the use of science \nand cost/benefit analysis is vital if we are to adequately focus \nresources on our most challenging environmental concerns.\n  I believe risk analysis and comparative risks give us much needed \ninformation to better understand the potential consequences and \nbenefits of a range of choices. We all recognize that there aren't \nenough resources available to address every environmental threat. The \nFederal Government, States, local communities, the private sector, and \neven environmental organizations all have to target their limited \nresources on the environmental problems that present the greatest \nthreat to human\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\nhealth and the environment. Our focus, therefore, is, and should be, on \ngetting the biggest bang for the limited bucks.\n  Comparative risk is the tool that enables us to prioritize the risks \nto human health and the environment and target our limited resources on \nthe greatest risks. It provides the structure for decision-makers to: \nOne, identify environmental hazards; two, determine whether there are \nrisks posed to humans or the environment; and three, characterize and \nrank those risks. Risk managers can then use that analysis to achieve \ngreater environmental benefits.\n  Last year, as the Chairman of the Environment & Public Works \nCommittee, I held a hearing on the role of comparative risk in setting \nour policy priorities. During that hearing, we heard how many states \nand local governments are already using comparative risk assessments in \na public and open process that allows cooperation, instead of \nconfrontation, and encourages dialogue, instead of mandates. States are \nsetting priorities, developing partnerships, and achieving real results \nby using comparative risk as a management tool. They are using good \nscience to maximize environmental benefits with limited resources. I \nbelieve we should encourage and promote these successful programs.\n\n  It is important that this nation have someone like Dr. Graham to lead \nthe OIRA. We must use reliable scientific analysis to guide us in our \ndecision making process when it comes to environmental regulations. Dr. \nGraham's resume and record proves that he is the optimal person to head \nthe office that will be making many of those decisions. Every person, \nRepublican and Democrat, who has held the position of OIRA \nAdministrator, except for two who are now federal judges and prohibited \nfrom doing so, have urged Senate action on his behalf. They state in a \nletter to the Committee Chairman and Ranking Member that, ``we are \nconfident that [Dr. Graham] is not an `opponent' of all regulation but \nrather is deeply committed to seeing that regulation serves broad \npublic purposes as effectively as possible.''\n  I am a strong proponent of protecting and preserving our \nenvironment--my record proves that fact. I am also a strong believer \nthat we must use sound science, comparative risk analysis and cost/\nbenefit in making environmental decisions. Science, not politics, \nshould be our guide. We must focus our efforts in a manner that assures \nthe maximum amount of environmental protection given the resources \navailable. Scientific analysis allows us to make good decisions and \ndetermine where to focus our resources to ensure that our health and a \nclean environment are never compromised.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support John Graham for \nAdministrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm \nJohn Graham to be the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs at the Office of Management and Budget. Though I will vote for \nMr. Graham, much of the information that has been presented during the \nnominations process to the Governmental Affairs Committee by labor, \nenvironmental and public health organizations and other respected \nacademics creates concerns regarding this nominee and I want to share \nmy views on the concerns that have been raised.\n  The individual charged with the responsibility to head OIRA will \nindirectly set the direction of our national policies for our natural \nresources, labor and safety standards. I have tried, as a member of \nthis body, to cast votes and offer legislation that fully reflects the \nimportance and lasting legacy of America's regulatory decisions. I also \nhave another tradition to defend and uphold. I have committed myself to \na constructive role in the Senate's duty to provide advice and consent \nwith respect to the President's nominees for Cabinet positions. I \nbelieve that the President should be entitled to appoint his own \nadvisors. I have evaluated Presidential nominees with the view that, \nexcept in rare of cases, ideology alone should not be a sufficient \nbasis to reject a Cabinet nominee. Mr. Graham is not a nominee for a \nCabinet post. The Office of Management and Budget, OMB, is housed \nwithin the Executive Office of the President, making Mr. Graham one of \nthe President's closest advisors. I believe that the President should \nbe accorded great deference by the Senate on the appointment of this \nadvisor.\n  During the nominations process, I have been disturbed to learn of the \nfears that Mr. Graham will not live up to his responsibility to fully \nimplement regulatory protections. I am particularly troubled by \nconcerns that he may allow special interests greater access to OMB, and \ntherefore greater influence in OMB's deliberations. The concerns that \nhave been raised are that Mr. Graham will allow special interests \nanother opportunity to plead their case during final OMB review of \nregulations and may permit changes to be made to regulatory proposals \nthat those interests were unable to obtain on the merits when the \nregulations were developed and reviewed by the federal agency that \nissued them. I also have been concerned about allegations that Mr. \nGraham's background might cloud his judgement and objectivity on a \nnumber of regulatory issues and place him at odds with millions of \nAmericans including members of the labor, public interest and \nconservation community and with this Senator.\n  During the 1980s, OIRA came under heavy criticism for the way in \nwhich it conducted reviews of agency rules. The public was concerned \nthat agency rules would go to OIRA for review and sometimes languish \nthere--for years in some cases--with little explanation to the public. \nRather than a filter for regulation, it became a graveyard.\n  Shortly after taking office, President Clinton responded to this \nproblem by issuing Executive Order 12866. This order set up new \nguidelines for transparency--building on a June 1986 memorandum by \nformer OIRA Administrator Wendy Gramm--that have helped bring \naccountability to OIRA.\n  With my vote for this nominee, I am calling for a commitment from \nhim. I believe that it is essential that he maintain this transparency, \nand even strengthen it, in this Administration. Mr. Graham, having been \nthe center of a controversial nominations proceeding, should be the \nfirst to call for letting sunshine disinfect OIRA under his watch.\n  At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, the new OMB Director Mitch Daniels expressed general support \nfor transparency and accountability, but refused to endorse \nspecifically key elements of President Clinton's executive order. At \nthat time, Mr. Daniels would only commit to work with the Committee \nshould the Administration decide to alter Executive Order 12866.\n  Now that President Bush has nominated John Graham as administrator of \nOIRA, and he is being confirmed today, this Senate must receive more \nspecific assurances regarding transparency and accountability. OIRA is \nan extremely powerful office that has the power to approve or reject \nagency regulations. This makes it critical that OIRA's decision-making \nbe open to public scrutiny. I agree strongly with the sentiments \nexpressed in today's Washington Post editorial:\n\n       . . . conflicts of interest must be taken seriously if \n     there is to be any chance of building support for more \n     systematic cost-benefit efforts. At a minimum, the experts \n     who carry out these analyses need to disclose their financial \n     interests (as Mr. Graham's center did), and analysts with \n     industry ties should not dominate government advisory panels. \n     There may be room for dispute as to what constitutes `ties'--\n     should an academic who accepted a consultancy fee 10 years \n     ago be viewed as an industry expert?--but conflict-of-\n     interest rules should err on the strict side.\n\n  The Post editorial continues,\n\n       Mr. Graham's acceptance of industry money opened him to \n     opportunistic attacks from those who favor regulation almost \n     regardless of its price. The lesson is that those who would \n     impose rigor on government must observe rigorous standards \n     themselves. Even apparent conflicts of interest can harm the \n     credibility of the cost-benefit analyses that Mr. Graham \n     champions.\n  In the days following his confirmation, Mr. Graham should \naggressively affirm OIRA's public disclosure policies and make clear \nthe office's continued commitment to transparency. Executive Order \n12866 requires that OIRA maintain a publicly available log containing \nthe status of all regulatory actions, including a notation as to \nwhether Vice Presidential and Presidential consideration was requested, \na notation of all written communications between OIRA and outside \nparties, and the dates and names of individuals involved in all \nsubstantive oral\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\ncommunications between OIRA and outside parties. Moreover, once a \nregulatory action has been published or rejected, OIRA must make \npublicly available all documents exchanged between OIRA and the issuing \nagency during the review process. Mr. Graham must continue this \ndisclosure policy, and he should expand it to make the information more \nwidely accessible, and make the logs available through the Internet.\n  Executive Order 12866 gives OMB 90 days to review rules. OMB may \nextend the review one time only for 30 days upon the written approval \nof the OMB Director and upon the request of the agency head. Mr. Graham \nshould make clear that OIRA will stick to this time frame for reviews. \nMoreover, OMB has invested in making this 90 day clock an action that \ncan be tracked by the public, which must continue. Currently, the OMB \nweb site documents when a rule is sent to OIRA, the time it took to act \non the rule, and the OMB disposition. Mr. Graham has the ability to \nimprove the public's access to this information by making the web site \nsearchable by agency, rule, and date, rather than posting the \ninformation in simple tabular form.\n  Executive Order 12866 requires OMB to provide a written explanation \nfor all regulations that are returned to the agency, ``setting forth \nthe pertinent provision of the Executive Order on which OIRA is \nrelying.'' OIRA must continue to provide written justification for \nreturned rules, and Mr. Graham should consider expanding this policy to \nrequire written justification for any modifications that are made to a \nrule.\n  Mr. Graham must take particular care in the area of communications \nwith outside interests and set the tone for OIRA staff actions in this \nregard. Executive Order 12866 directs that only the administrator of \nOIRA can receive oral communications from those outside government on \nregulatory reviews. Mr. Graham should continue this standard and be \nstringent that this standard be employed for all personnel working in \nOIRA. Present policy directs OIRA to forward an issuing agency all \nwritten communications between OIRA and outside parties, as well as \n``the dates and names of individuals involved in all substantive oral \ncommunications.'' Moreover, affected agencies are also to be invited to \nany meetings with outside parties and OIRA. These are important \nprocedures that protect the integrity of our regulatory system.\n  Beyond this, however, Mr. Graham should rigorously guard against \ncontacts that present the appearance of a conflict of interest. He is \nentering into a position that will, in many ways, act as judge and jury \nfor the fate of proposed regulations. He should, like those arbiters, \nguard carefully his objectivity and his appearance of objectivity.\n  I have reviewed these procedural issues because they are critical to \nmaintaining public confidence in OIRA's functioning. I hope that Mr. \nGraham will be mindful of my concerns, and that he will embrace his \nduty to take into account the future and forseeable consequences of his \nactions. I also hope that he will be guided by the knowledge that this \nSenator will scrutinize those consequences, and will look very \ncarefully at the question of special interest access to OMB at every \nappropriate time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Dr. John \nGraham to be Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory \nAnalysis at the Office of Management and the Budget. Dr. Graham has \nbeen a leader in the nonpartisan application of analytical tools to \nregulations in order to ensure that such rules really do what \npolicymakers intend and that they represent the most effective use of \nour Government's limited resources.\n  As a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and founder of \nthe Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, Dr. Graham has devoted his life \nto seeing that regulations are well crafted and effective--and that \nthey help ensure that our world is truly a safer and cleaner place.\n  The alleged ``conflicts of interest'' argued by some of Dr. Graham's \nopponents are clearly baseless. The Harvard Center has some of the \nstrictest conflict of interest rules in academia, and Dr. Graham has \ncomplied fully with them. It is absurd to suggest that the bare fact of \ncorporate research sponsorship creates a conflict. By that standard, \nmost of the studies produced in America's universities and colleges are \nworthless, and few academics can ever again be found suitable for \npublic office. Dr. Graham's critics miss their mark.\n  I have had the opportunity to receive input from many knowledgeable \nsources about Dr. Graham's nomination. One of these is Maine State \nToxicologist Andrew Smith. Dr. Smith studied with Dr. Graham at \nHarvard, and subsequently served as a staff scientist at an \norganization opposed to the Graham nomination. He has told us, however, \nthat Dr. Graham approaches regulatory analysis with an open mind and is \n``by no means an apologist for anti-regulation.'' Even a quick glance \nat Dr. Graham's record bears this out.\n  Like other members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I do not \nneed to rely solely on second-hand information about Dr. Graham. I \nmyself was able to work with Dr. Graham on regulatory reform \nlegislation that had strong bi-partisan support. My personal experience \nin working with him confirms that what his supporters say is true: he \nhas the experience, integrity, and intelligence to be an excellent \nAdministrator the Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis has \never had.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should vote to confirm John Graham.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns \nregarding the President's nominee to head the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget--John Graham.\n  This office oversees the development of all Federal regulations. The \nperson who leads it holds the power to affect a broad array of public \nhealth, worker safety and environmental protections.\n  While John Graham has impressive professional credentials, his body \nof work raises serious questions concerning his ability to assume the \nimpartial posture this job demands.\n  To do it, this nominee would be required to put aside his passionate \nand long-standing opposition to public health, worker safety and \nenvironmental protections.\n  As any of us who have felt passionately about an issue know, this is \noften difficult--if not impossible--to do.\n  It might be like asking me to argue against nuclear safety controls \nand protections. I can tell you I couldn't do it.\n  And my concern today is that John Graham will not be able to put \naside his passionate and long-held views opposing those protections.\n  As some of my colleagues have outlined, the nominee has argued in his \nwritings that certain regulations are not cost-effective and don't \nprotect the public from real risks.\n  He makes that judgment based upon radical assumptions about what a \nhuman life is worth--assumptions that fail to account for the benefits \nof regulation. His assumptions are well outside of the mainstream.\n  The nominee concludes that those who fail to reallocate government \nresources to other more cost-effective actions are, in his words, \nguilty of ``statistical murder.''\n  And who did John Graham find to be guilty of statistical murder--\nopponents of Yucca Mountain.\n  This is what the nominee had to say about it:\n\n       The misperception of where the real risks are in this \n     country is one of the major causes of what I call statistical \n     murder. . . . We're paranoid about . . . nuclear waste sites \n     in Nevada, and that preoccupation diverts attention from real \n     killers.\n\n  Can Nevadans rely upon John Graham to impartially weigh decisions \nregarding Yucca Mountain when he views their concerns as ``paranoid'' \nand considers measures to address those concerns through public health \nprotections as equivalent to murder?\n  And the nominee's strong views aren't limited to Yucca Mountain.\n  He holds strong views in opposition to many other public health, \nenvironmental and worker safety protections broadly supported by my \ncolleagues and the American people--from reducing dioxin levels to \nprotecting children from toxic pesticides.\n  My concerns about those views are also informed by the context in \nwhich we weigh his nomination today.\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\n  Beginning with the Card Memorandum issued the day after President \nBush's inauguration--which placed important public health, worker \nsafety and environmental protections on hold--we have seen one \nimportant public protection after another eroded.\n  By sending up a nominee who has dedicated the better part of his \ncareer to fighting those broadly supported protections, the President \nsends an unfortunate signal that the public health and environmental \nrollback is not at an end.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am voting today against the nomination \nof Dr. John Graham to head the Office of Information and Regulatory \nAffairs, OIRA, at the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I do not take this action lightly. I respect the tradition that \ndeference should be given to a President's nominations for posts within \nan administration. Nevertheless, it is the role of the Senate to \nprovide advice and consent to the President, and I take this \nresponsibility seriously as well.\n  OIRA is a little known department that has some of the most sweeping \nauthority in the Federal Government. It is the gatekeeper for all new \nregulations, guiding how they are developed and whether they are \napproved. Its actions affect the life of every American, everyday.\n  The director of this office must have unquestioned objectivity, good \njudgement and a willingness to ensure that the laws of the Nation are \ncarried out fairly and fully. I regret to say that Dr. Graham's record \nhas led me to conclude that he cannot meet these high standards.\n  Dr. Graham currently heads the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, and \nin this capacity he has produced numerous studies analyzing the costs \nand benefits of Federal regulations. These studies raise serious and \ntroubling questions about the way in which Dr. Graham would carry out \nhis duties.\n  First and foremost, I am concerned that Dr. Graham has consistently \nignored his own conflicts-of-interest in the studies he has conducted, \nand that he had not demonstrated an ability to review proposed \nregulations in an evenhanded manner. Time after time, he has conducted \nstudies of regulations affecting the very industries providing him with \nfinancial support. Virtually without fail, his conclusions support the \nregulated industry.\n  Dr. Graham downplayed the risks of second-hand smoke while soliciting \nmoney from Philip-Morris. He overestimated the cost of preventing \nleukemia caused by exposure to benzene in gasoline while accepting \nfunds from the American Petroleum Institute. He even downplayed the \ncancer risk from dioxin exposure while being supported by several major \ndioxin producers.\n  This last item is perhaps the most troubling of all. Virtually since \nentering Congress, I have fought on behalf of the victims of Agent \nOrange who have suffered from cancer and other terrible illnesses due \nto their exposure to dioxin. There is absolutely no question that this \nchemical is a known carcinogen with many devastating health effects. \nYet remarkably, with funding from several dioxin producers, Dr. Graham \nsuggested that exposure to dioxin could actually protect against \ncancer.\n  I also question the analytical methods Dr. Graham uses in his \nstudies. He contends that the cost of regulations should be the primary \nfactor we consider, instead of the benefits they provide for health or \nsafety. This position is totally inconsistent with many of our basic \nhealth, workplace safety and environmental laws. After all, we may be \nable to calculate the value of putting a scrubber on a smokestack, but \nhow do you assign a value to a child not getting asthma? We can \ncalculate the value of making industries treat their waste water, but \nwhat is the value of having lakes and streams in which we can swim and \nfish?\n  If Dr. Graham brings this way of thinking to OIRA, I can only \nconclude that it will lead to a profound weakening of the laws and \nregulations that keep food safe, and our air and water clean. As over \ntwo dozen of Dr. Graham's colleagues in the public health community \nwrote, ``We are forced to conclude that there is such a persistent \npattern of conflict of interest, of obscuring and minimizing dangers to \nhuman health with questionable cost-benefit analyses, and of hostility \nto governmental regulation in general that [Dr. Graham] should not be \nconfirmed for the job of Director of the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs.''\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, of all the people who live in America who \nmight have been considered for this position, I find it curious this \nman, John Graham, is the choice of President Bush to head up a \nsensitive office, this office which literally will make a decision on \nrules and regulations which will have an impact on families not only \ntoday but for generations to come.\n  During the course of this debate, we have come to the floor and \nspelled out how Mr. John Graham has been more than just a person making \na mathematical calculation about the cost of a regulation and whether \nit is warranted. He has held himself out to have scientific knowledge \nabout things that are, frankly, way beyond his education. He is a \nperson who has written in one of his books with the forward by Cass \nSunstein, who has been quoted at length on the floor here supporting \nMr. Graham, that he thinks in comparison to today's fertilizers, DDT is \nrelatively nontoxic.\n  Of course, that is a view that has been rejected not only by the \nWorld Health Organization but by 90 nations, and banned with only two \nnations in the world making DDT.\n  For John Graham, there is doubt. He sees no health hazard on \npesticides for fruit and vegetables, but the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Institutes of Health, Consumers Union, and \nothers say he is just plain wrong.\n  We have heard and read his statements on dioxin, which the Senator \nfrom Tennessee has valiantly tried to reconstruct here so they do not \nsound quite as bad, but it is the most dangerous toxic chemical known \nto man, and John Graham, the putative nominee here, thinks it has \nmedicinal qualities. He is alone in that thinking. The EPA said his \nstatement was irresponsible and inaccurate. They read it, too. He did \nnot have his defense team at work there. They just read it and said \nfrom a scientific viewpoint it was indefensible.\n  What is this all about? What is the bottom line? Why is this man \nbeing nominated? Don't take my word for it. Go to the industry sources \nthat watch these things like a hawk: the Plastic News, the newsletter \nof the plastic industry in America, May 7, 2001, about Mr. Graham:\n\n       He could lend some clout to plastics in his new job. The \n     job sounds boring and inside the beltway, but the office can \n     yield tremendous behind-the-scenes power. It acts as a \n     gatekeeper of Federal regulations ranging from air quality to \n     ergonomics. It has the power to review them and block those \n     if it chooses to. The Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, which \n     Graham founded and directed until Bush nominated him, gets a \n     significant part of its $3 million annual budget from \n     plastics and chemical companies. The Center's donor list \n     reads like a who's who of the chemical industry.\n\n  And they go on to list some of the sponsors of Dr. Graham's \ninstitute.\n  Graham is well thought of by the plastics industry. A person from the \nindustry said the Bush administration intends to make this office more \nimportant than it was in the Clinton administration, elevating it to \nits intended status.\n  They have a big stick. If the President in office allows them to use \nit and if they have someone in office who knows how to use it. How \nwould they possibly use it?\n\n  Do you remember arsenic in drinking water, how the administration \nscrambled away from it as soon as they announced it, and the American \npeople looked at it in horror and disgust, that they would increase the \ntolerance levels of arsenic in drinking water? During the course of the \nGovernmental Affairs hearing, we asked Dr. Graham, who tells us all \nabout DDT and pesticides and dioxin, what he thought about arsenic. He \nsaid he didn't have an opinion.\n  Let me give you a direct quote. I want the Record to be complete on \nexactly what he said here. I asked him:\n\n       You have no opinion on whether arsenic is a dangerous \n     chemical?\n\n  Professor Graham replied:\n\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\n\n       I haven't had any experience dealing with the arsenic \n     issue, neither the scientific level nor the cost-\n     effectiveness level of control.\n\n  You have an open mind, my friend. Give him this job and he will have \nan open mind about arsenic in drinking water. He has an open mind about \npesticides on fruits and vegetables. He has an open mind about dioxin \nand its medicinal purposes. He has an open mind about the future of DDT \nin comparison with other chemicals. And this is the man we want to put \nin control, the gatekeeper on rules and regulations about public health \nand safety and the environment?\n  That is why I have risen this evening to oppose this nomination. I \nthank my colleagues and all those who participated in this debate. I \nappreciate their patience. I know we have gone on for some time, but \nthis much I will tell you. If Mr. Graham is confirmed, and it is likely \nhe will be, he can rest assured that many of us in this Senate will be \nwatching his office with renewed vigilance. To put this man in charge \nof this responsibility requires all of us who care about public health \nand safety and environmental protection to stay up late at night and \nread every word, to watch what is going on.\n  We don't need any more arsenic in drinking water regulations. We \ndon't need to move away from environmental protection. We don't need to \nsecond-guess the medical experts on the dangers of pesticide residues \non fruits and vegetables and the danger of dioxin. We need sound \nscience and objectivity, and, sadly, John Graham cannot bring them to \nthis position, and that is why I will vote no on his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, let's listen to the scientists on the \nScience Advisory Board to which the Senator referred.\n\n       Dr. Dennis Passionback:\n       I think John's point [meaning John Graham] is what you \n     thought his point was, Mort, and that is in several studies \n     and hypotheses over the years that there are some hormonic \n     beneficial effects associated with dioxin and related \n     chemicals for certain disease influences. Of course that is \n     at very low dose of course.\n\n  These are scientists. It is easy for the rhetoric to get out of hand \nhere, and I want to try to do my part to not engage in escalating, but \nI find some of the statements attributed to this man amazing. I think \nour colleagues know better. I think the letters of endorsement and the \npublic endorsements belie this. I think the reflection on Harvard \nUniversity is unfair. It is not uncommon for centers doing work similar \nto Harvard's center to receive 40 to 60 percent of their funding from \nthe private sector.\n  I think what we have here is just a back and forth with regard to a \nman whose opponents are desperately trying to undermine this \nnomination. I think we have here a question concerning public service \nand whether or not we are going to get decent people to come into these \nthankless jobs to do them if we are going to see the confluence of \nscientific work on the one hand and the political process on the other \nproduce such an ugly result.\n  I think we need to ask ourselves that question. I think we need to \nask ourselves also whether or not we want to have these decisions based \nupon sound scientific analysis, one that is endorsed by all of the \npeople who endorsed Dr. Graham, and say that analysis, that sound \nanalysis that will work to our benefit.\n  I have a chart of all the areas where lead and gasoline, sludge, \ndrinking water--where Dr. Richard Morganstern, economic analyst at the \nEPA, has shown where cost-benefit analysis, the kind that Dr. Graham \nproposes, has been beneficial both from a cost standpoint and \nincreasing benefits. Let's not get into an anti-intellectual no-nothing \nkind of mode here and try to label these fine scientists and this fine \ninstitution with labels that do not fit and are not deserved.\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues will vote for this nomination.\n  Mr. REID. Is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh).

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1172) making appropriations for the Legislative \n     Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent request \nwhich was just allowed regarding procedures for the remainder of the \nevening, I will give a brief summary of this bill.\n  I am pleased to present to the Senate the fiscal year 2002 \nlegislative branch appropriations bill, as reported by the full \ncommittee.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd for his support and the high priority he has \nplaced on this bill. He has provided an allocation which has ensured we \ncould meet the highest priorities in the bill. In addition, I wish to \nthank the ranking member of the full Committee Senator Stevens who has \nbeen actively involved in and very supportive of this bill.\n  I am grateful to my ranking member, Senator Bennett, for his \nimportant role in this process and his excellent stewardship of this \nsubcommittee for the past 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  The fact is that this bill bears the imprint of Senator Bennett and \nhis hard work in keeping an eye on this particular appropriations bill. \nI was happy to join him in bringing this bill to the floor. I couldn't \nhave done it without him. I appreciate all of his assistance.\n  The bill before you today totals $1.94 billion in budget authority \nand $2.03 billion in outlays. This is $103 million--5.6 percent--over \nthe fiscal year 2001 enacted level and $104 million or 5 percent below \nthe request level.\n\n  The bill includes $1.1 billion in title I, Congressional Operations, \nwhich is $88 million below the request and $123 million above the \nenacted level.\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\n  For title II, other agencies, a total of $848 million is included, \n$15 million below the request and $20 million below the enacted level.\n  The support agencies under this subcommittee perform critical \nfunctions enabling Congress to operate effectively. We have sought to \nprovide adequate funding levels for these agencies--particularly the \nLibrary of Congress, the General Accounting Office, the Capitol Police, \nand the Congressional Budget Office.\n  For the Library of Congress and the Congressional Research Service, \nthe bill includes $443 million. While this is $66 million below the \nenacted level, the decrease is attributable to last year's one-time \nappropriation for the digital preservation project.\n  The recommendation for the Library will enable the Congressional \nResearch Service to hire staff in some critical areas--particularly \ntechnology policy.\n  In addition, a significant increase is provided for the National \nDigital Library within the Library of Congress, including information \ntechnology infrastructure and support to protect the investment that \nhas been made in digital information.\n  Also in the Library's budget is additional funding to reduce the Law \nLibrary arrearage, funding for the newly- authorized Veterans Oral \nHistory Project, and funds to support the preservation of and access to \nthe American Folklife Center's collection.\n  For the General Accounting Office, a total of $419 million is \nincluded. This level will enable GAO to reach their full authorized \nstaffing level. The total number of employees funded in this \nrecommendation is 3,275 which would put GAO at their fiscal year 1999 \nlevel and is well below their fiscal year 1995 staffing level of 4,342 \nFTE.\n  A total of $125 million is provided for the Capitol Police. This is \nan increase of $19 million over the enacted level. This will provide \nfor 79 additional officers above the current level, which conforms with \nsecurity recommendations, as well as related recruitment and training \nefforts.\n\n  It will also provide comparability for the Capitol Police in the pay \nscales of the Park Police and the Secret Service-Uniformed Division so \nthe Capitol Police are able to retain their officers.\n  The Architect of the Capitol's budget totals $177 million, \napproximately $8 million above the enacted level, primarily for \nadditional worker-safety and financial management-related activities.\n  We have sought to trim budget requests wherever appropriate and where \nwe have identified problem areas. The most significant difference from \nthe budget request is a reduction of $67 million from the Architect of \nthe Capitol--$42 million of which is attributable to postponement of \nthe Capitol Dome project pursuant to the request of the Architect.\n  We have appropriated money for the painting of the Dome to preserve \nit. We believe that we can get into this important building project in \nanother year or so.\n  We have also recommended some very strong report language within the \nArchitect's budget, directing them to improve their management with \nparticular attention to worker safety, financial management, and \nstrategic planning. I am very troubled by the Architect's operation and \nintend to work to make much-needed changes. I hope this language sends \na strong message to the Architect that we expect major overhauls of \nthis agency--especially in the areas of worker safety and financial \nmanagement.\n  We have made it clear to the Architect of the Capitol that the rate \nof worker injury is absolutely unacceptable in the Architect of the \nCapitol, which is four times the average rate of the Federal \nGovernment. This must end, and we will work to make it end.\n  Also included is approximately $6 million for the Botanic Garden, \nwhich is to open in November 2001.\n  For the Government Printing Office, a total of $110 million is \nincluded, of which $81 million is for Congressional printing and \nbinding. The amount recommended will provide for normal pay and \ninflation-related increases.\n  For the Senate a total of $603.7 million is included. This represents \nan increase of $81.7 million above the current level and $14 million \nbelow the request.\n  Of the increase, $24 million is needed to meet the Senate funding \nresolution, another $24 million is associated with information \ntechnology-related activities such as the digital upgrade and studio \ndigitization of the Senate recording studio, and the balance is \nattributable primarily to anticipated increases for agency \ncontributions and cost-of-living adjustments.\n  This is a straight-forward recommendation and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  With respect to the manager's amendment, it includes a provision on \nbehalf of Senator Bingaman, adding $1 million to GAO's budget for a \ntechnology assessment pilot project, offset by a $1 million reduction \nin the Architect of the Capitol's budget. It also includes authority \nfor the Architect to lease a particular property for the Capitol \nPolice, for a vehicle maintenance facility, and technical corrections.\n  I thank two staffers who worked tirelessly on this bill. I thank \nCarolyn Apostolou with the Appropriations Committee. I thank her very \nmuch for the continuity which she has shown working first for Senator \nBennett, and now for myself; and Pat Souters on my personal staff. I \nthank Chip Yost for his contribution to this as well.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois has been very \ngenerous in his comments. I thank him for his generosity. He is being a \nbit modest because he took over the subcommittee with great vigor and \nhas moved ahead on those portions of this bill in which he has a \nparticular interest. That was demonstrated in both the report language \nand the priorities of the bill.\n  I congratulate him for the way he handled his stewardship of this \nparticular assignment.\n  This is not the most glamorous subcommittee on the Appropriations \nCommittee. But in some cases, it may be the most fun because we get to \ndeal with people who interact with the Senate all of the time.\n  The Senator from Illinois has my thanks and congratulations on the \nwork he has done. I will not review the specifics of the bill that he \nhas gone over. I will point out that I think the increases he has cited \nare appropriate.\n  This bill has my full support. One of the items that is in the bill \nthat the press has expressed great interest about is the million \ndollars that we put in for the Visitors Center. The million dollars is \nobviously not adequate to begin the Visitors Center. But since the \nHouse didn't put in anything, this becomes a placeholder for us to \ndiscuss an appropriation for the Visitors Center when we get to \nconference. I think the Congress needs the Visitors Center. The current \nschedule calls for it to be done prior to the inauguration of the next \nPresident, whether it be a reelection or a new election in January of \n2005. That is the tight time schedule, and it will not yield. We will \nhave an inauguration in the Capitol in January of 2005, whether the \nVisitors Center is done or not.\n  We had conversations with the Architect of the Capitol about that \nduring his hearing. We need to get on with that as quickly as we can.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Durbin as he leads us in the \neffort to see to it that we get the proper funding and the proper \ndirection to see that the Visitors Center comes to pass in a timely \nfashion.\n  I am grateful to Senator Durbin for addressing the requirement of GAO \nto make an updated evaluation of the feasibility of consolidating all \nof the Capitol Hill Police forces. They are the Capitol Police that \nprotects us. They are the Library police. They are the Government \nPrinting Office police. Then there is the Supreme Court Police Force.\n  The question is, what kind of efficiency could be gained by having \nall of them coordinated to produce some cost savings? That is a \nquestion that I have been addressing for some time. I appreciate \nSenator Durbin's willingness to support the GAO study to look in that \ndirection.\n  All in all, it has been a pleasure to work with Senator Durbin and a \ndelight to help put this bill together with him.\n  I thank the staff that have toiled late into many nights to put this \nbefore us today.\n\n[[Page S7936]]\n\n  I urge the Senate to adopt it.

I have asked for that limited time only realizing the \nlateness of the hour.\n  This amendment would establish a relatively small fund of $3 million \nto pay for notices sent to residents of small counties when a Senator \ncomes to that county to have a town meeting.\n  Town meetings are in the greatest tradition of American democracy. \nBut they have fallen into disuse in the Senate for a number of reasons. \nOne reason is that it is very tough for Senators to go out and face \nconstituents and listen to a variety of complaints and defend a \nSenator's voting record. It is more comfortable to stay inside the \nbeltway.\n  But there is another reason; that is, the mail accounts are \ninadequate to provide for all of the funds necessary.\n  For my State alone, it would cost about three-quarters of a million \ndollars. My total budget is a little over $2 million for all of my \noffice expenses. This is an effort to start on what I think could be a \nvery important project.\n  It provides only for notices in small counties under 50,000 \npopulation. It is possible in Pennsylvania, illustratively, to cover \nthe big cities and the suburban counties for television and newspapers. \nBut if you take the northern tier of Pennsylvania, or the southern \ntier, or some of the counties, you simply can't get there unless you go \nthere.\n  If a Senator is to go there, the only way you could tell people that \nyou are coming is if you send them a simple postal paper notice--not \neven a name or address--just to every resident.\n  I had anticipated that perhaps a lively debate on this subject might \nhave taken an hour or two.\n  But when I saw that the legislative appropriations bill was going to \nbe listed this evening at about 9:30, I added three magic words to this \namendment, and they are, ``subject to authorization.'' I know the \nSenator from Illinois is opposed to the amendment; the Senator from \nUtah is in favor of the amendment. We will present this matter, on \nanother occasion, to the Rules Committee. But it is my understanding \nthat pursuant to practice, if it passes the Senate, it is not subject \nto conference. I do not want to have an amendment accepted and then \ndropped in conference. That frequently happens.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains of my 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator retains 2 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Chair has advised me, through staff, I \nhave 32 seconds remaining of my initial 5 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 60 seconds, for a total of 92 seconds to \nreply to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am not going to object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will accept this amendment this evening, \nbut as I made it clear to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I do not \nbelieve this is necessary. We appropriated about $8 million a year for \nSenate mailing, and the Senators did not use it. They returned $4 \nmillion.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has suggested that we need an \nadditional $3 million when we are returning $4 million. I do not quite \nunderstand it.\n  I think there is adequate money to send out town meeting notices for \nany Senator who wishes to do so. Many Senators, including some who are \nin this Chamber, who will go unnamed, did not even use their mailing \naccount last year. They left almost $100,000 in the account. And they \nare suggesting we need to put more money on the table for mailing.\n  I believe in townhall meetings. I had over 400 as a Congressman, and \nI support them as a Senator.\n  I am going to, of course, allow this amendment to go forward without \nobjection. I will tell you, as a member of the Rules Committee, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania has a job to do to convince me to support it \nthere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am prepared to undertake that job. And if the Senator \nfrom Illinois does not understand why I am offering this amendment, let \nme explain it to him.\n  It would cost, to circulate in Pennsylvania, $735,000, which will be \nabout a third of my budget. We have a grave crisis in America where \npeople think that Members of Congress are up for sale.\n  Campaign finance reform has been a heated subject in this Chamber and \nin the House Chamber. It is necessary to have fundraisers, and you \ncannot deny that the people who come to fundraisers have access. But I \nfind that the best answer to that is to tell my constituents that I go \nto all the counties in Pennsylvania--67 counties. It is onerous. It is \nvery worthwhile in many respects.\n  It is very refreshing to get outside the beltway, to find out what \npeople are thinking about in upstate Pennsylvania; and to say that \npeople will get a notice that Arlen Specter is coming to town, and you \ncan come there, you do not have to buy a ticket. You can listen to a \nshort speech, about 5 minutes on an hour, and the balance of the hour \nis for questions and answers. That way you have participatory \ndemocracy.\n  So it is a partial answer to the problem of fundraisers which we \nhold. I think it would be great if this sort of financing would \nencourage Senators to go out and do town meetings, and I intend to \npursue this in the Rules Committee. This is just a start. Let's see how \nit works. My instinct is that most of the $3 million will not be used. \nAnd while it is first-come-first-serve, you cannot spend a lot of money \nfor the postal patron postcards going to people in counties with \na population of under 50,000.\n\n  I thank the managers for accepting this amendment. I think it can \nprove very beneficial to the Senators and, more importantly, to \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If that is all the debate, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1027.\n  The amendment (No. 1027) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up the managers' amendment which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 1026.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Unless the Senator from Utah wants to speak to it, I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1026.\n  The amendment (No. 1026) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                         information technology\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to express my concerns to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Legislative Branch appropriations \nsubcommittee about the information technology capabilities of the \nSenate.\n  I am particularly concerned that the e-mail and networking systems of \nthe Senate do not allow Senators and their staffs to take advantage of \nthe latest in technology innovations. For example, the cc:mail e-mail \nsystem employed by the offices of every Senator is no longer even \nsupported by the company that developed it. It is an antiquated system \nthat makes remote access slow and cumbersome, and does not allow for \nthe use of wireless e-mail.\n  At this time, the Sergeant of Arms is looking at a January 2002 \nrollout of a modernized system that will bring the Senate into the 21st \nCentury. This bill contains substantial increases in spending for the \nIT Support Services Division of the Sergeant of Arms. It is my \nunderstanding that some of this increase will be used for other \npurposes. Therefore, I ask the chairman and ranking member what portion \nof these increases will be used for the upgrade of the e-mail system?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill includes $1.8 million for the maintenance and \nsupport of the new e-mail system that is to be implemented beginning in \nJanuary 2002. In addition, there is $6 million available in the current \nfiscal year that will be used for the rollout of the new system, \nincluding the necessary hardware and software.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator from Illinois is correct, and I support the \nfunding for the replacement of the cc:mail system.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \ncommitment to the upgrade. After two years of delays, I urge them to \nmonitor the Sergeant of Arms to see that the system is upgraded as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist) \nand the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the \nunanimous consent request, Senator Thompson and I each have a minute \nbefore the vote; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, John Graham has had a distinguished \ncareer. He has been head of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis for \nthe last 15 years and has been called the ``best-qualified person'' who \nhas come down the road for this position by Bob Leiken of the Brookings \nInstitution.\n  Some people don't like scientific facts that don't comport with their \nideology, even if it is supported in the scientific community. He has \nbeen criticized, he has had selected excerpts taken from his works, and \nhe has been unfairly characterized.\n  They have taken complex scientific issues and even though they might \nbe\n\n[[Page S7938]]\n\ncounterintuitive for many of us, they are supported by the scientific \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, the merging of scientific analysis and the political \nprocess sometimes is not a pretty picture, and this one has not been \neither. But I suggest there have been a lot of people asleep on the job \nand very negligent if this gentleman is not qualified and has really \nadhered to some of the views attributed to him.\n  Leaders of public policy in this country: scientists, academics, \nDemocrats and Republicans, the last two Democrats who have held this \nposition, support this man. I suggest a strong vote for him is merited, \nand I sincerely urge that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if my colleagues followed the debate this \nevening, they know John Graham's views on science really are not in the \nmainstream by any stretch. He has made statements that pesticide \nresidues on fruits and vegetables are not a public hazard. He has some \ntheory described as irresponsible and inaccurate: Dioxin somehow cures \ncancer and does not cause cancer.\n  He questions whether or not DDT should have been banned, and this is \nthe man who will be in charge of the agency which has the last word on \nrules and regulations for public health and safety and environmental \nprotection.\n  We can do better in America.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Roger Walton Ferguson, \nJr., of Massachusetts, to be a Member of the Board of Governors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I urge Members to approve the \nnomination. Mr. Ferguson has been serving on the Federal Reserve Board \nand was nominated by President Clinton. His nomination was resubmitted \nby President Bush. The committee reported out overwhelmingly in favor \nof his nomination. I urge his approval.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, unfortunately I must rise today to oppose \nthe nomination of Roger Ferguson to be a member of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve.\n  I usually don't vote against presidential nominees. I believe, in \nmost cases, that we should defer to the president and allow him to \nappoint his own people.\n  However, there are times when I am forced to stand up and to vote \nagainst the president. I do not enjoy doing this, but I have no doubt \nthat I will be making the right vote for Kentucky and the nation.\n  Roger Ferguson is a very accomplished man. He is quite qualified to \nbe a Federal Reserve Governor.\n  He is currently vice chairman. But I cannot, in good conscience, \nsupport his nomination for a 14-year term.\n  It is not Dr. Ferguson's qualifications that concern me; it is his \njudgment that does.\n  Right now we are in an economic slowdown. The evidence was there last \nSeptember. But Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve did not act \nin September.\n  They did not act in October.\n  They did not act in November.\n  They did not act in December.\n  They did finally act in January.\n  Since then, the Fed, to its credit, has continued to move the federal \nfunds rate, cutting it 6 times. But the damage has already been done.\n  What concerns me about Dr. Ferguson is the response he gave to me in \nthe Banking Committee when I asked him this question: ``Hindsight being \n20/20, do you think the Fed waited too long to reduce the target \nfederal funds rate?''\n  Dr. Ferguson's response was: ``No, sir. Even with 20/20 hindsight, I \ndo not believe that to be the case.''\n  Mr. President, I simply can't understand that answer. Knowing what we \nknow now, it just doesn't make sense.\n  During that time last year, practically every single economic \nindicator was headed straight down.\n  The markets, especially the NASDAQ were dropping, causing wealth to \nbe taken out of the economy. Corporations were announcing layoffs, not \njust dot-coms, but companies like GE.\n  The index of leading economic indicators started to fall. And \nconsumer confidence started dropping. And GDP slowed markedly.\n  Anyone I've talked to since then, now says that, looking back, it's \npretty clear that the Fed was slow at the switch in recognizing and \nreacting to the warning signs.\n  Six rate cuts this year is clear evidence of this. That's the most in \nsuch a short period of time in decades, and shows just how precarious a \nposition our economy was in.\n  We're still having trouble turning the corner, and even now there are \nwarning signs that our economic slowdown is causing a ripple effect \naround the globe.\n  Who knows what would have happened if the Fed had cut rates sooner. \nIf Dr. Ferguson is confirmed, I'm afraid we probably never will.\n  That truly worries me.\n  I am afraid that he is looking over his shoulder already, and is \nconcerned about how the Fed Chairman is going to react to his remarks.\n  I think Dr. Ferguson was afraid to criticize the chairman and to \nupset the apple cart.\n  But I believe that we need strong, independent Fed Governors who are \nwilling to challenge the status quo and to make the hard call.\n  I am afraid that Dr. Ferguson does not fit this bill.\n  We do not need Alan Greenspan clones who will never question the \nchairman, who will never take the contrary view.\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\n  What we need are Fed nominees who will be independent. We need \nnominees who will stand up to the chairman if they believe he is wrong.\n  I do not believe Dr. Ferguson will assert that independence. I \nbelieve his answer to my question in the Banking Committee proves that.\n  For this reason, I reluctantly vote ``no'' on the nomination of Dr. \nRoger Ferguson, to a 14-year term as a member of the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope everyone recognizes the tremendous \ntragedy we sadly heard of yesterday in Baltimore. A train derailed in a \ntunnel. The fire is still burning. The hydrochloric acid is still \nleaking from that tank. Last night, the city of Baltimore, one of the \nlargest cities in America, was closed down. The Baltimore Orioles were \nin the middle of a doubleheader. They stopped the game and sent \neverybody home.\n  The reason I mention this is there has been a mad clamor about the \nnuclear power industry and shipping nuclear waste. The nuclear industry \ndoesn't care where it goes, although they are focused on Nevada for the \npresent time. I think everyone needs to recognize that transporting \nhazardous materials is very difficult. If people think hydrochloric \nacid is bad--which it is--think about how bad nuclear waste is. A speck \nthe size of a pinpoint would kill a person. We are talking about \ntransporting some 70,000 tons of it all across America.\n  I hope before everybody starts flexing their muscles about the \nreestablishment of nuclear power in this country that we recognize \nfirst there has to be something done with the dangerous waste \nassociated with nuclear power.\n  It is estimated that some 60 million people live within a mile of the \nroutes that may be proposed for transporting this nuclear waste by \ntrain or truck. Not to mention the problems related to terrorism, which \nwe have discussed at some length on this floor in previous debates.\n  We should leave nuclear waste where it is. Eminent scientists say it \nis safe. It could be stored onsite in storage containers for a fraction \nof the cost of a permanent repository. It would be much less dangerous. \nIt could be stored relatively safely for 100 years, the scientists say. \nDuring that period of time, we might develop a breakthrough idea as to \nwhat could be done safely with these spent fuel rods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7939-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7939-S7940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RADIATION EXPOSURE CLAIMS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about a \ngroup of Americans, some of whom are in my State. Some are in Arizona. \nSome are in Wyoming. Some are in Connecticut. These people have only \none thing in common: they are the beneficiaries of an American law that \nis called RCRA, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. A number of us \nwere part of getting that law passed. It was a recognition that there \nwere certain Americans, including uranium miners and some others, who \nvery well might have been overexposed to low-level radiation when they \nwere mining in uranium mines that weren't aerated--where they did not \nhave enough air conditioning and not enough clean air. They may have \nvery well during their lives breathed in radiation and contracted \nserious illnesses. Some might have died. Some may today be suffering \nfrom cancer or other diseases.\n  In any event, this law was passed. It was kind of heralded as a very \ngood commitment by the Government and very simple. You didn't have to \nget a lawyer for these claims. It was limited to $100,000 in exchange \nfor making it simple and setting some standards: You can come in and \nprove your case. You could probably prove your claim in a relatively \nshort period of time.\n  Lo and behold, if Congress put the money up, you would get your \ncheck. You could get it as a widow. You could get it as one who was \nsick. You could get it as anyone entitled to it under the statute. It \nworked pretty well for a while.\n  Then something very ghastly happened for the beneficiaries. Pretty \nsoon, they started going to the Justice Department which has charge of \nthese claims and asking them for money.\n  The Justice Department told this growing group of Americans: We don't \nhave any money.\n  They said: What do you mean? Here is the law.\n  They said: Well, Congress didn't put up the money. We ran out. So you \nwill not be worried, why don't we give you an IOU. Here is your \nassurance that the Government says it owes you $100,000.\n  These people started coming to see their Senators--not only me but \nSenator Bingaman and other Senators--saying, time is passing. I am \ngetting sicker. I may even die, and I have an IOU from this great big \nAmerican Government. Why can't they pay me?\n  Let me say in this Chamber that it is embarrassing to say it even \nhere, but it is more embarrassing to say it to the victims. There is a \nbig series of discussions going on between committees --even \nappropriations subcommittees--as to which one ought to appropriate the \nmoney.\n  In the meantime, no money is appropriated. People walk around with \nthe IOUs filing their claims, and they are working on them day by day. \nAnd another law passes. It is for a larger group of Americans who come \nin to adjudicate their claims for exposure to low-level radiation. It \nis for radiation where we had uranium in a Richmond,\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nVA, mine or perhaps in Paducah, KY, and various places in Ohio. For \nthis larger group of people, those claims are still being worked.\n  We say: Well, time has passed, and maybe these claims should be a \nlittle higher. So they are awarded $150,000 if they can prove the claim \nthat they are either totally disabled or are an heir.\n  Congress in that case--coming out of a different committee--made that \nprogram an entitlement. Even the occupant of the Chair, who is a new \nSenator, would understand that those claims are paid without anybody \nappropriating it--just like the Social Security check or your veterans \ncheck.\n  Here is one group of Americans filing their claims. Some of them are \nalready adjudicated; we stamp out a check, while over here another \ngroup of Americans carry around IOUs.\n  A number of Senators have been working on this issue. A number of \nHouse Members have been working on it. My friend, Senator Bingaman, has \nbeen working on it.\n  But essentially our last opportunity to cease the embarrassment and \ndo something half fair was to put language in the supplemental \nappropriations bill that would see to it that for any claims already \nfinished where people are carrying around the IOUs, or any that are \ncompleted for the rest of this year, there is money for them. We \nprovided that in the Senate bill on supplemental appropriations.\n  Frankly, we even had to find a way to pay for it because it had to be \nbudget neutral. So we found a way to pay for it. I did, out of a \nprogram I started a few years ago. I said: It is not being used, so \ncancel it so we have room.\n\n  Today, at about 10:30, 11 o'clock this morning, after a number of \ndays of conferring, the House-Senate committee on that bill approved \nit. It should come back before us very soon and get approval. It has \nlanguage in it that says whatever amount of money is needed for those \nholding those IOUs and for those finishing up their claims by the end \nof this fiscal year, they will have the money in the Justice Department \nto pay it.\n  I say to the Senate, I know it is difficult, unless you have this \nproblem, for you to be as concerned as I or those in my particular \nregion. But I thought maybe I should tell the whole Senate because it \nis time they know that this is a festering embarrassment.\n  Is it solved? No. The appropriations bill that is going to put in \nmoney for next year only carries a small amount of money because it \nexpects, as does the President in his budget, to convert this program \nto an automatic payment program called a mandatory or an entitlement. \nBut we have not been able to get that done yet.\n  So I have said it for a second reason. I hope the committees that are \nconsidering it--and I will do my best to go see the committees to make \nmyself understood, and take with me whatever evidence I need to \nconvince the chairmen and ranking members they ought to make this an \nentitlement. But in the meantime, the people who have claims right up \nuntil the end of this year will get paid. It will take a couple weeks, \nso they should not be coming into our offices saying thank you yet, nor \nshould they come in and ask where is the money. They just have to wait \na little while. It takes a little bit of time.\n  I thought, since we see them and we hear them, that maybe I should \nlet the Senate vicariously hear them--you can't see them, but you can \nhear them through me.\n  What we have to do is not let another year pass because this is a \nproblem, whether or not you come from a State that has ``down-winders'' \nand/or uranium miners; this carries with it some very serious kinds of \novertones for the U.S. Government. You create a program. You tell \npeople: We have been sorry for you up until now, but we will give you a \nlittle claim here--$100,000--and then, when you prove it up, you will \ntake it, and you no longer have any claims, and we have said that we \nhave paid you. It is just not right that you do not do it, just not \nright.\n  It is growing. The newspeople are starting to carry it. I guess they \nare starting to carry: ``Congress finally puts up the money today.'' \nThat is good. But I hope there is a lingering interest in how we fix \nit. It should not be that 6 months into next year somebody exposed to \nlow-level radiation at one of America's uranium enrichment plants \nproves their claim and gets an automatic check, but yet you have these \npeople who might have worked 35 years ago, for 20 years, in a \nnonaerated uranium mine, where the U.S. Government, even through its \nheralded Atomic Energy Commission, which I know a lot about, made a \nmistake with reference to the quality of air in the mines--where \nacknowledgements were made many years later; and it is hard to get the \nacknowledgement, but we finally got it--yet a mistake was made.\n  So I thought it would be good, while we had nothing to do in this \nSenate Chamber, that maybe we could spread this story of what has \nhappened and say thank you to the Appropriations Committee for the \nemergency measure today. And we look forward to one of our committees \npassing a bill that will make these few remaining people who are \nentitled to it know they will get their money when their claim is \nadjudicated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7940-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7940-S7942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JACKIE M. CLEGG\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I seek recognition to express a deep \nappreciation for the dedicated service of Jackie M. Clegg as first Vice \nPresident and Vice Chair of the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates.\n  As I think many of my colleagues are aware, Jackie's 4-year term at \nthe Eximbank will be concluding on tomorrow, July 20. As chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I note our \ncommittee's gratitude and, indeed, the gratitude of the Senate for the \nmany extraordinary contributions she has made to the Export-import Bank \nduring her tenure.\n  Jackie spent more than 8 years in a series of senior positions at the \nEximbank, devoting herself tirelessly to the agency's mission of \nsupporting U.S. exporters and sustaining American jobs. She first \njoined the Eximbank in April of 1993, served as special assistant, \nchief of staff and vice president for congressional and external \naffairs, prior to her nomination, in May of 1997, to be first Vice \nPresident and Vice Chair of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Her exceptionally effective service at the Eximbank was a logical \noutgrowth of her extensive legislative staff career in the Congress. \nShe worked for more than a decade as the legislative assistant for \nforeign policy, trade, and national security issues, for Senator Jake \nGarn of her home State of Utah, as an associate staff member to the \nAppropriations Committee, and later as a professional staff member on \nthe Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on \nInternational Finance and Monetary Policy.\n  It thus came as no surprise to us in the Congress when Jackie \nskillfully led the bank's efforts on its reauthorization legislation in \n1997.\n  The legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in the \nCongress and set the stage for the agency's excellent work on behalf of \nU.S. exporters during her term.\n  We on the Banking Committee have had the benefit of Jackie's wise \ncounsel on export and trade matters for several years. She has an acute \nsense of the relationship among Federal agencies, Congress, foreign \ngovernments, and the business community.\n  In her travels on the Bank's behalf, and in her speeches, Jackie has \nraised awareness of the critical nature that international trade and \ntrade finance can play in improving the lives of our citizens. Jackie \nhas also devoted herself to improving the management of the Eximbank \nand its responsiveness to staff concerns. She has helped shepherd the \nBank towards increased automation as a means of better fulfilling its \nobjective of satisfying the needs of small business. She has served as \nboth an institutional memory and a trailblazer--traits not often found \nin the same person.\n  The board of directors of the Eximbank today adopted a resolution \nexpressing its appreciation and thanks to Jackie for her distinguished \nservice to the Bank.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed \nin the Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for those of us who have supported and\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nworked with the Eximbank, it is a loss that Jackie Clegg has chosen to \nleave public office at this time. We recognize, however, she has a \nspecial reason for moving on, and many of us have already extended our \ncongratulations to Jackie and our colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, as they start a family. But I want to \nthank her before she leaves office for her outstanding service to the \nNation through her many contributions to the work of the Export-Import \nBank of the United States.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Export-Import Bank of the United States Resolution\n\n       Whereas Jackie M. Clegg has served with distinction as \n     First Vice-President and Vice Chairman of the Export-Import \n     Bank of the United States since June 17, 1997; and\n       Recognizing, that she has spent more than eight years in a \n     series of senior positions at the Ex-Im Bank, devoting \n     herself to the agency's mission of supporting U.S. exporters \n     and sustaining American jobs; and\n       Recognizing further, that her success at the Ex-Im Bank is \n     a logical outgrowth of her extensive U.S. Senate staff \n     career, including more than a decade of work as a legislative \n     assistant for foreign policy, trade, national security, \n     banking, and appropriations issues; and\n       Recognizing further, that she led the Bank's efforts on its \n     reauthorization legislation in 1997, which received \n     overwhelming bipartisan support in the Congress and has made \n     it possible for the Bank to serve better the needs of U.S. \n     exporters, earning her the admiration and respect of numerous \n     Members of Congress, the Executive Branch, and the exporting \n     community; and\n       Recognizing further, that she demonstrated leadership and \n     creativity as the Bank tackled critical issues such as \n     resolving international financial challenges, balancing the \n     need for environmental protection with promoting business \n     opportunities, and increasing trade opportunities for small \n     businesses, particularly those owned by women, minorities, \n     and Americans who live in rural areas; and\n       Recognizing further, that she devoted herself to enhancing \n     the quality of life for the Bank's career staff through \n     innovation and a commitment to training, advancement, and \n     empowerment; and\n       Recognizing further, that she has brought great credit to \n     the Bank and succeeded in raising awareness of the agency and \n     its mission, thereby expanding exporting opportunities for \n     American companies and enhancing their competitiveness in the \n     global marketplace; and\n       Recognizing further, that her intelligence, dedication, \n     warmth, and leadership have earned her the friendship, \n     affection, and respect of Export-Import Bank colleagues at \n     all levels of the agency;\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved. That the Directors of the \n     Bank, individually and on behalf of the entire Bank, hereby \n     express their sincerest appreciation and thanks to Jackie M. \n     Clegg for her distinguished service to the Bank and extend to \n     her best wishes in all future endeavors.\n\n     John E. Robson,\n       President and Chairman.\n     Dan Renberg,\n       Director.\n     D. Vanessa Weaver,\n       Director.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator's \nmorning business time be extended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I also have gotten to know Jackie \nClegg. I met Jackie when she was a staff person for Senator Garn on the \nAppropriations Committee. She would come and be at his side and was his \nvoice and ears on that committee--an important committee on which he \ndid so well for the State of Utah. I got to know her better when she \nwent to the Eximbank. We think of the Bank--I always did--as being \nsomething that was done in places other than in the United States. But \nshe was kind and professional enough to do a meeting in Las Vegas for \nme of the Eximbank. There was tremendous interest of Las Vegas \nbusinesspeople in what that Bank could do and could not do. People were \nbrought to a meeting in Las Vegas, and I can say it was one of the most \nsuccessful of that type of meeting I have ever held.\n  She will be missed. Of course, being chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and having worked in the area a long time, you certainly \nunderstand, having worked so closely with her, more than most of us how \nimportant that Bank is. I appreciate the Senator mentioning Jackie very \nmuch. However, I am very confident that her new role, as important as \nher old role was, will be even more important. I know she is looking \nforward to it. She will be a great mother, and I look forward to seeing \nher with her new baby in just a few months.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. REID. May I say also, while I have the Senator's attention, I say \nto my friend, the senior Senator from Maryland, I have been so \nimpressed in watching what is taking place in Baltimore in the last 24 \nhours--almost exactly 24 hours now--to see the work of professionals \nthere with the terrible tragedy that took place in the tunnel. I am \nconfident that the Senator is as impressed as I am with the great work \nbeing done by the people from Maryland and Baltimore, and the other \nentities of which I am not totally aware, in averting a disaster that \ncould have been much worse.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. They are still working on that \nproblem. It has not been fully resolved yet. I received a message from \nMayor O'Malley that the fire is still smoldering. But they have had \nterrific intergovernmental cooperation throughout in trying to address \nthis pressing issue. We are hopeful that it will be resolved soon. The \ntunnel is a mile and a half long, and so they are pulling these cars \nout of the tunnel--decoupling them and pulling them out. So that \nprocess is still underway, but we hope it can be carried through to \ncompletion without worsening of conditions.\n  Mr. REID. This points out how dangerous it is to transport hazardous \nmaterials. Certainly, this is a clear indication of how dangerous it \nreally is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The other thing--if the Senator will yield for a \nminute--I think it points out the need for us to make investment in our \nNation's infrastructure. We have been trying for a long time to get a \nreal commitment at the Federal level, to be matched at the State and \nlocal level, for operating infrastructure. I think it is something we \nneed constantly to keep in mind and not lose sight of. We are making a \nnumber of these budget priorities, including sweeping tax cuts, for \nexample, and at the same time all across the country we are being \nchallenged by major needs in terms of the Nation's infrastructure. This \nis an obvious instance of transportation infrastructure and \ncommunications. I hope we will be able to come to grips with that issue \nand make a major national commitment with respect to upgrading the \nNation's infrastructure.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to hold a hearing next week on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. I am now the subcommittee \nchair on the committee with jurisdiction over this country's \ninfrastructure. The first hearing I am going to do is going to be \ninvolved with the mayors of major cities in the United States, to have \nthem start telling us what some of our major urban cities need. We are \ntremendously deficient in what we have not done to help cities and, of \ncourse, other parts of our country.\n  This is not a problem that developed today. We have been ignoring \nthis for far too long. The Senator is absolutely right. We now are \nlooking at budgetary constraints that make it very difficult for us to \naddress some of the most grievous things facing this country as relates \nto infrastructure. That is one of the reasons I am holding this \nhearing. We can no longer hide our head, bury our heads in the sand, \nand say they don't exist. These problems exist. The Senator is so \nright, and the Public Works Committee is going to start addressing this \nnext week.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I commend the Senator for that initiative. I think it \nis extremely important. I think we have to get across the understanding \nthat these public investments in infrastructure are essential to the \nprivate sector activity. In other words, there is a relationship \nbetween making available a first-class public infrastructure--for \nexample, transportation--and the ability then of the private sector to \nefficiently carry out its business. I think we need to perceive it in \nthose terms because people come out and say you are just talking about \nmaking a public expenditure, but this is a public expenditure with \nwide-ranging consequences and implications for the effective working of \nthe private sector of the economy.\n  Mr. REID. I will finally say to my friend, you are so right. Some of \nthe people who want to spend less money than anyone else are the so-\ncalled market-oriented people. The fact is, Adam Smith, in his book \n``Wealth of Nations,'' in 1776, said that governments\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nhad certain responsibilities, and one of those responsibilities is \nthings about which we are speaking, things we cannot do for ourselves. \nOnly governments can do roads, highways, bridges, dams, sewers, water \nsystems. So we go right back to the basic book of the free enterprise \nsystem, and that is what we are talking about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7942-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7942-S7944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY, OPEC, AND ANTITRUST LAW\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly this afternoon, in the absence of any activity on the pending \nlegislation, and in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, to discuss a subject which was talked about at the energy \ntown meeting which Vice President Cheney had in Pittsburgh on Monday of \nthis week, July 16.\n  At that time, I had an opportunity to address very briefly a number \nof energy issues. I talked about the possibility of action under the \nU.S. antitrust laws against OPEC which could have the effect of \nbringing down the price of petroleum and, in turn, the high prices of \ngasoline which American consumers are paying at the present time.\n  I have had a number of comments about people's interest in that \npresentation. I only had a little more then 3 minutes to discuss this \nOPEC issue and some others. I thought it would be worthwhile to comment \non this subject in this Senate Chamber today so that others might be \naware of the possibility of a lawsuit against OPEC under the antitrust \nlaws.\n  I had written to President Clinton on April 11 of the year 2000 and \nhad written a similar letter to President George Bush on April 25 of \nthis year, 2001, outlining the subject matter as to the potential for a \nlawsuit against OPEC. The essential considerations involved whether \nthere is sovereign immunity from a lawsuit where an act of state is \ninvolved, and the decisions in the field make a delineation between \nwhat is commercial activity contrasted with governmental activity. \nCommercial activity, such as the sale of oil, is not something which is \ncovered by the act of state doctrine, and therefore is not an activity \nwhich enjoys sovereign immunity.\n  There have also been some limitations on matters involving \ninternational law, as to whether there is a consensus in international \nlaw that price fixing by cartels violates international norms. In \nrecent years, there has been a growing consensus that such cartels do \nviolate international norms, so that now there is a basis for a lawsuit \nunder U.S. antitrust laws against OPEC and, beyond OPEC, against the \ncountries which comprise OPEC.\n  After writing these letters to President Clinton and President Bush, \nI found that there had, in fact, been litigation instituted on this \nprecise subject in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nAlabama, Southern Division, in a case captioned ``Prewitt Enterprises, \nInc. v. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.'' In that \ncase, neither OPEC nor any of the other countries involved contested \nthe case, and a default judgment was entered by the Federal court, \nwhich made some findings of fact right in line with the issues which \nhad been raised in my letters to both Presidents Clinton and Bush.\n  The court found that OPEC had conspired to implement extensive \nproduction cuts, that they had established quotas in order to achieve a \nspecific price range of $22 to $28 a barrel, and that the cost to U.S. \nconsumers on a daily basis was in the range of $80 to $120 million for \npetroleum products. That is worth repeating. The cost to U.S. consumers \nwas $80 to $120 million daily.\n  The court further found that OPEC was not a foreign state. The court \nalso found that the member states of OPEC, although not parties to the \naction, were coconspirators with OPEC, and that the agreement entered \ninto by the member states of OPEC was a commercial activity, and the \nstates, therefore, did not have sovereign immunity for their actions.\n\n  The court further found that the act of state doctrine did not apply \nto the member states and that OPEC's actions were illegal ``per se'' \nunder the Sherman and Clayton Acts.\n  The court then issued an injunction, which is legalese for saying \nOPEC could no longer act in concert to control the volume of the \nproduction and export of crude oil.\n  The court found that the class of plaintiffs was not entitled to \nmonetary damages because they were what is called ``indirect \npurchasers.'' That is a legal concept which is rather involved which I \nneed not discuss at this time. But the outline was established, and the \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law were established by the Federal \ncourt that indeed there was a cartel, there was a conspiracy in \nrestraint of trade, U.S. laws were violated, U.S. consumers were being \nprejudiced, and an injunction was issued.\n  Then, a unique thing occurred. After the court entered its default \njudgment and injunction, OPEC entered a special appearance in the case, \nand asked the court to dismiss the case. Three nations, who were not \nparties to the case--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Mexico--then sought \nleave of the court to file ``amicus'' briefs in support of OPEC's \nmotion to dismiss, which means, in effect, that they wanted to assist \nOPEC in defending the matter. I think it is highly significant that \nthose nations, which are characteristically and customarily oblivious \nand indifferent and seek to simply ignore U.S. judicial action, had a \nchange of heart and decided to come in.\n  They must have concluded that an injunction by Federal court was \nsomething to be concerned about. I think, in fact, it is something to \nbe concerned about.\n  In an era where we are struggling with an extraordinarily difficult \ntime of high energy costs, with real concerns laid on the floor of the \nSenate about where additional drilling ought to be undertaken, about \nthe problems with fossil fuels, about our activities to try to find \nclean coal technology to comply with the Clean Air Act, at a time when \nwe are looking for renewable energy sources such as air and wind and \nhydroelectric power, there is a long finger to point at the OPEC \nnations which are conspiring to drive up prices in violation not only \nof U.S. law but in violation of international law.\n  This is a subject which ought to be known to people generally. It \nought to be the subject of debate, and it ought to be, in my opinion, \nbeyond a class action brought into the Federal court by private \nplaintiffs, which is something that the Government of the United States \nof America ought to consider doing as has been set forth in the letters \nwhich I sent to President Clinton last year and to President Bush this \nyear.\n  It is especially telling when we have Kuwait gouging American \nconsumers, after the United States went to war in the Persian Gulf to \nsave Kuwait. It is equally if not more telling that Saudi Arabia \nengages in these conspiratorial tactics at a time when we have over \n5,000 American men and women in the desert outside of Riyadh. I have \nvisited there. It is not even a nice place to visit, let alone a nice \nplace to live, in a country where Christians can't have Christmas trees \nin the windows and Jewish soldiers don't wear the Star of David for \nfear of being the victims of religious persecution; and Mexico, a party \nto these practices, notwithstanding our efforts to be helpful to the \nGovernment of Mexico.\n  But fair is fair. Conspiracies ought not to be engaged in. Price \nfixing ought not to be engaged in. If there is a way within our laws to \nremedy this, and I believe there is, that is something which ought to \nbe considered.\n  I am not unmindful of the tender diplomatic concerns where every time \nan issue is raised, we worry about what one of the foreign governments \nis going to do, what Saudi Arabia is going to do--that we should handle \nthem with ``silk gloves'' only. But when American consumers are being \ngouged up to $100 million a day on petroleum products, this is \nsomething we ought to consider and, in my judgment, we ought to act on.\n  We have seen beyond the issue of antitrust enforcement a new era of \ninternational law, with the War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague \nprosecuting war criminals from Yugoslavia, and now former President \nMilosevic is in custody. We also have the War Crimes Tribunal at \nRwanda. A new era has dawned where we are finding that the \ninternational rule of law is coming into common parlance. That long arm \nof\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nthe law, I do believe, extends to OPEC, and there could be some very \nunique remedies for U.S. consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print my letter to President Bush, dated \nApril 25, 2001, in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.\n     President George Walker Bush.\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In light of the energy crisis and the \n     high prices of OPEC oil, we know you will share our view that \n     we must explore every possible alternative to stop OPEC and \n     other oil-producing states from entering into agreements to \n     restrict oil production in order to drive up the price of \n     oil.\n       This conduct is nothing more than an old-fashioned \n     conspiracy in restraint of trade which has long been \n     condemned under U.S. law, and which should be condemned under \n     international law.\n       After some research, we suggest that serious consideration \n     be given to two potential lawsuits against OPEC and the \n     nations conspiring with it:\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       (1) A suit in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust \n     law.\n       A strong case can be made that your Administration can sue \n     OPEC in Federal district court under U.S. antitrust law. OPEC \n     is clearly engaging in a ``conspiracy in restraint of trade'' \n     in violation of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1). The \n     Administration has the power to sue under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 4 \n     for injunctive relief to prevent such collusion.\n       In addition, the Administration has the power to sue OPEC \n     for treble damages under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. \n     15a), since OPEC's behavior has caused an ``injury'' to U.S. \n     ``property.'' After all, the U.S. government is a consumer of \n     petroleum products and must now pay higher prices for these \n     products. In Reiter v. Sonotone Corp, 442 U.S. 330 (1979), \n     the Supreme Court held that the consumers of certain hearing \n     aides who alleged that collusion among manufacturers had led \n     to an increase in prices had standing to sue those \n     manufacturers under the Clayton Act since ``a consumer \n     deprived of money by reason of allegedly anticompetitive \n     conduct is injured in `property' within the meaning of [the \n     Clayton Act].''\n       One issue that would be raised by such a suit is whether \n     the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (``FSIA'') provides \n     OPEC, a group of sovereign foreign nations, with immunity \n     from suit in U.S. courts. To date, only one Federal court, \n     the District Court for the Central District of California, \n     has reviewed this issue. In International Association of \n     Machinists v. OPEC, 477 F. Supp. 553 (1979), the Court held \n     that the nations which comprise OPEC were immune from suit \n     in the United States under the FSIA. We believe that this \n     opinion was wrongly decided and that other district \n     courts, including the D.C. District, can and should \n     revisit the issue.\n       This decision in Int. Assoc. of Machinists turned on the \n     technical issue of whether or not the nations which comprise \n     OPEC are engaging in ``commercial activity'' or \n     ``governmental activity'' when they cooperate to sell their \n     oil. If they are engaging in ``governmental activity,'' then \n     the FSIA shields them from suit in U.S. courts. If, however, \n     these nations are engaging in ``commercial activity,'' then \n     they are subject to suit in the U.S. The California District \n     Court held that OPEC activity is ``governmental activity.'' \n     We disagree. It is certainly a governmental activity for a \n     nation to regulate the extraction of petroleum from its \n     territory by ensuring compliance with zoning, environmental \n     and other regulatory regimes. It is clearly a commercial \n     activity, however, for these nations to sit together and \n     collude to limit their oil production for the sole purpose of \n     increasing prices.\n       The 9th Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in \n     Int. Assoc. of Machinists in 1981 (649 F.2d 1354), but on the \n     basis of an entirely different legal principle. The 9th \n     Circuit held that the Court could not hear this case because \n     of the ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a U.S. \n     court will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute \n     which would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign state.\n       The 9th Circuit itself acknowledged in its Int. Assoc. of \n     Machinists opinion that ``The [act of state] doctrine does \n     not suggest a rigid rule of application,'' but rather \n     application of the rule will depend on the circumstances of \n     each case. The Court also noted that, ``A further \n     consideration is the availability of internationally-accepted \n     legal principles which would render the issues appropriate \n     for judicial disposition.'' The Court then quotes from the \n     Supreme Court's opinion in Banco Nacional de Cuba v. \n     Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964): ``It should be apparent that \n     the greater the degree of codification or consensus \n     concerning a particular area of international law, the more \n     appropriate it is for the judiciary to render decisions \n     regarding it, since the courts can then focus on the \n     application of an agreed principle to circumstances of fact \n     rather than on the sensitive task of establishing a principle \n     not inconsistent with the national interest or with \n     international justice.''\n       Since the 9th circuit issued its opinion in 1981, there \n     have been major developments in international law that impact \n     directly on the subject matter at issue. As we discuss in \n     greater detail below, the 1990'a have witnessed a significant \n     increase in efforts to seek compliance with basic \n     international norms of behavior through international courts \n     and tribunals. In addition, there is strong evidence of an \n     emerging consensus in international law that price fixing by \n     cartels violates such international norms. Accordingly, a \n     court choosing to apply the act of state doctrine to a \n     dispute with OPEC today may very well reach a different \n     conclusion than the 9th Circuit reached almost twenty \n     years ago.\n       (2) A suit in the International Court of Justice at the \n     Hague based upon ``the general principles of law recognized \n     by civilized nations.''\n       In addition to such domestic antitrust actions, we believe \n     you should give serious consideration to bringing a case \n     against OPEC before the International Court of Justice (the \n     ``ICJ'') at the Hague. You should consider both a direct suit \n     against the conspiring nations as well as a request for an \n     advisory opinion from the Court through the auspices of the \n     U.N. Security Council. The actions of OPEC in restraint of \n     trade violate ``the general principles of law recognized by \n     civilized nations.'' Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \n     ICJ, the Court is required to apply these ``general \n     principles'' when deciding cases before it.\n       This would clearly be a cutting-edge lawsuit, making new \n     law at the international level. But there have been exciting \n     developments in recent years which suggest that the ICJ would \n     be willing to move in this direction. In a number of \n     contexts, we have seen a greater respect for and adherence to \n     fundamental international principles and norms by the world \n     community. For example, we have seen the establishment of the \n     International Criminal Court in 1998, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994, and the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1993. Each of \n     these bodies has been active, handing down numerous \n     indictments and convictions against individuals who have \n     violated fundamental principles of human rights.\n       Today, adherence to international principles has spread \n     from the tribunals in the Hague to individual nations around \n     the world. The exiled former dictator of Chad, Hissene Habre, \n     was indicted in Senegal on changes of torture and barbarity \n     stemming from his reign, where he allegedly killed and \n     tortured thousands. This case is similar to the case brought \n     against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet by Spain on \n     the basis of his alleged atrocities in Chile. At the request \n     of the Spanish government, Pinochet was detained in London \n     for months until an English court determined that he was too \n     ill to stand trial.\n       While these emerging norms of international behavior have \n     tended to focus on human rights than on economic principles, \n     there is one economic issue on which an international \n     consensus has emerged in recent years--the illegitimacy of \n     price fixing by cartels. For example, on April 27, 1988, the \n     Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued \n     an official ``Recommendation'' that all twenty-nine member \n     nations ``ensure that their competition laws effectively halt \n     and deter hard core cartels.'' The recommendation defines \n     ``hard core cartels'' as those which, among other things, fix \n     prices or establish output restriction quotas. The \n     Recommendation further instructs member countries ``to \n     cooperate with each other in enforcing their laws against \n     such cartels.''\n       On October 9, 1998, eleven Western Hemisphere countries \n     held the first ``antitrust Summit of the Americas'' in Panama \n     City, Panama. At the close of the summit, all eleven \n     participants issued a joint communique in which they express \n     their intention ``to affirm their commitment to effective \n     enforcement of sound competition laws, particularly in \n     combating illegal price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market \n     allocation.'' The communique further expresses the intention \n     of these countries to ``cooperate with one another . . . to \n     maximize the efficacy and efficiency of the enforcement of \n     each country's competition laws.''\n       The behavior of OPEC and other oil-producing nations in \n     restraint of trade violates U.S. antitrust law and basic \n     international norms, and it is injuring the United States and \n     its citizens in a very real way. We hope you will seriously \n     consider judicial action to put an end to such behavior.\n       We hope that you will seriously consider judicial action to \n     put an end to such behavior.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Herb Kohl.\n     Strom Thurmond.\n     Mike DeWine.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will not include my letter to President Clinton, dated \nApril 11, 2000, because the two letters are largely the same.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the first caption page of the \ncase entitled ``Prewitt Enterprises v.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues \nin the United States Senate on the work of the bicameral congressional \ndelegation which I chaired that participated in the Tenth Annual \nSession of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe, OSCE PA, hosted by the French Parliament, \nthe National Assembly and the Senate, in Paris, July 6-10, 2001. Other \nparticipants from the United States Senate were Senator Hutchison of \nTexas and Senator Voinovich of Ohio. We were joined by 12 Members of \nthe House of Representatives: cochairman Smith of New Jersey, Mr. \nHoyer, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. McNulty, Mr. Hastings of Florida, \nMr. King, Mr. Bryant, Mr. Wamp, Mr. Pitts, Mr. Hoeffel and Mr. \nTancredo.\n  En route to Paris, the delegation stopped in Caen, France and \ntraveled to Normandy for a briefing by General Joseph W. Ralston, \nCommander in Chief of the U.S. European Command and Supreme Allied \nCommander Europe, on security developments in Europe, including \ndevelopments in Macedonia, Kosovo, and Bosnia- Herzegovina as well as \ncooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia.\n  At the Normandy American Cemetery, members of the delegation \nparticipated in ceremonies honoring those Americans killed in D-Day \noperations. Maintained by the American Battle Monuments Commission, the \ncemetery is the final resting place for 9,386 American servicemen and \nwomen and honors the memory of the 1,557 missing. The delegation also \nvisited the Pointe du Hoc Monument honoring elements of the 2d Ranger \nBattalion.\n  In Paris, the combined U.S. delegation of 15, the largest \nrepresentation by any country in the Assembly was welcomed by others as \na demonstration of the continued commitment of the United States, and \nthe U.S. Congress,\n\n[[Page S7945]]\n\nto Europe. The central theme of OSCE PA's Tenth Annual Session was \n``European Security and Conflict Prevention: Challenges to the OSCE in \nthe 21st Century.''\n  This year's Assembly brought together nearly 300 parliamentarians \nfrom 52 OSCE participating States, including the first delegation from \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia following Belgrade's suspension from \nthe OSCE process in 1992. Seven countries, including the Russian \nFederation and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, were represented at \nthe level of Speaker of Parliament or President of the Senate. \nFollowing a decision taken earlier in the year, the Assembly withheld \nrecognition of the pro-Lukashenka National Assembly given serious \nirregularities in Belarus' 2000 parliamentary elections. In light of \nthe expiration of the mandate of the democratically elected 13th \nSupreme Soviet, no delegation from the Republic of Belarus was seated.\n\n  The inaugural ceremony included a welcoming addresses by the OSCE PA \nPresident Adrian Severin, Speaker of the National Assembly, Raymond \nForni and the Speaker of the Senate, Christian Poncelet. The French \nMinister of Foreign Affairs, Hubert Vedrine also addressed delegates \nduring the opening plenary. The OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Romanian \nForeign Minister Mircea Geoana, presented remarks and responded to \nquestions from the floor.\n  Presentations were also made by several other senior OSCE officials, \nincluding the OSCE Secretary General, the High Commissioner on National \nMinorities, the Representative on Freedom of the Media, and the \nDirector of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human \nRights.\n  The 2001 OSCE PA Prize for Journalism and Democracy was presented to \nthe widows of the murdered journalists Jose Luis Lopez de Lacalle of \nSpain and Georgiy Gongadze of Ukraine. The Spanish and Ukrainian \njournalists were posthumously awarded the prize for their outstanding \nwork in furthering OSCE values.\n  Members of the U.S. delegation played a leading role in debate in \neach of the Assembly's three General Committees--Political Affairs and \nSecurity; Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment; and \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions. U.S. sponsored \nresolutions served as the focal point for discussion on such timely \ntopics as ``Combating Corruption and International Crime in the OSCE \nRegion,'' a resolution I sponsored; ``Southeastern Europe,'' by Senator \nVoinovich; ``Prevention of Torture, Abuse, Extortion or Other Unlawful \nActs'' and ``Combating Trafficking in Human Beings,'' by Mr. Smith; \n``Freedom of the Media,'' by Mr. Hoyer; and, ``Developments in the \nNorth Caucasus,'' by Mr. Cardin.\n  Senator Hutchison played a particularly active role in debate over \nthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the General Committee on Political \nAffairs and Security, chaired by Mr. Hastings, which focused on the \nEuropean Security and Defense Initiative.\n  An amendment I introduced in the General Committee on Economic \nAffairs, Science, Technology and Environment on promoting social, \neducational and economic opportunity for indigenous peoples won \noverwhelming approval, making it the first ever such reference to be \nincluded in an OSCE PA declaration. Other U.S. amendments focused on \nproperty restitution laws, sponsored by Mr. Cardin, and adoption of \ncomprehensive non-discrimination laws, sponsored by Mr. Hoyer.\n  Amendments by members of the U.S. delegation on the General Committee \non Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions focused on the \nplight of Roma, by Mr. Smith; citizenship, by Mr. Hoyer; and Nazi-era \ncompensation and restitution, and religious liberty, by Ms. Slaughter. \nDelegation members also took part in debate on the abolition of the \ndeath penalty, an issue raised repeatedly during the Assembly and in \ndiscussions on the margins of the meeting.\n  While in Paris, members of the delegation held an ambitious series of \nmeetings, including bilateral sessions with representatives from the \nRussian Federation, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the United \nKingdom, and Kazakhstan. Members met with the President of the French \nNational Assembly to discuss diverse issues in U.S.-French relations \nincluding military security, agricultural trade, human rights and the \ndeath penalty. A meeting with the Romanian Foreign Minister included a \ndiscussion of the missile defense initiative, policing in the former \nYugoslavia, and international adoption policy.\n  Staff of the U.S. Embassy provided members with an overview of U.S.-\nFrench relations. Members also attended a briefing by legal experts on \ndevelopments affecting the right of individuals to profess and practice \ntheir religion or belief. A session with representatives of U.S. \nbusinesses operating in France and elsewhere in Europe provided members \nwith insight into the challenges of today's global economy.\n  Elections for officers of the Assembly were held during the final \nplenary. Mr. Adrian Severin of Romania was re-elected President. \nSenator Jerahmiel Graftstein of Canada was elected Treasurer. Three of \nthe Assembly's nine Vice-Presidents were elected to three-year terms: \nAlcee Hastings, U.S.A., Kimmo Kiljunen, Finland, and Ahmet Tan, Turkey. \nThe Assembly's Standing Committee agreed that the Eleventh Annual \nSession of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly will be held next July in \nBerlin, Germany.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7945-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN AND GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just last year the Congress passed and \nPresident Clinton signed into law the Violence Against Women Act of \n2000. The law instituted welcome changes in Federal criminal law \nrelating to stalking, domestic abuse and sex offense cases. In \naddition, VAWA 2000 created programs to prevent sexual assaults on \ncollege campuses, establish transitional housing for victims of \ndomestic abuse and enhance protections for elderly and disabled victims \nof domestic violence.\n  The importance of the Violence Against Women Act should not be \nunderestimated. However, if we are to comprehensively address this \nissue, we cannot ignore the impact of gun violence on women. According \nto studies cited by the Violence Policy Center, in 1998, in homicides \nwhere the weapon was known, 50 percent of female homicide victims were \nkilled with a firearm. Of those murdered women, more than three \nquarters were killed with a handgun. And that same year, for every one \ntime that a woman used a handgun to kill in self-defense, 101 women \nwere murdered by a handgun.\n  While the firearms industry markets gun to women--asserting that \nowning a gun will make women safer--the statistics support the point \nmade by Karen Brock, an analyst with the Violence Policy Center, \n``Handguns don't offer women protection; they guarantee peril.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7945-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred February 21, \n1997 in Atlanta, GA. A bomb exploded at a gay nightclub and another \nbomb was found outside the club during the investigation. Packed with \nnails, the bomb exploded in the rear patio section of the lounge \nshortly before 10 p.m. Two people were treated for injuries resulting \nfrom the flying shrapnel. An extremist group called ``Army of God'' \nclaimed responsibility for the bomb.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7945-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7945-S7946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IN RECOGNITION OF THE HMONG SPECIAL GUERRILLA UNITS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend members of the Lao-Hmong \nAmerican Coalition, Michigan Chapter, their friends and supporters will \ngather in my home State of Michigan to pay\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\ntribute to thousands of courageous Hmongs who selflessly fought \nalongside of and in support of the United States military during the \nVietman War. The efforts of the Hmong Special Guerrilla Units were \nunknown to the American public during the conflict in Vietnam, and the \n6th Annual Commemoration of the U.S. Lao-Hmong Special Guerrilla Units \nVeterans Recognition Day is part of the important effort to acknowledge \nthe role played by the Hmong people in this war.\n  Ms. STABENOW. My colleague from Michigan is correct in stating that \nHmong Special Guerrilla Units played an important role in assisting US \nefforts in the Vietnam conflict, often times at great sacrifice to \nthemselves. From 1961 to 1975 it is estimated that about 25,000 young \nHmong men and boys were fighting the Communist Lao and North \nVietnamese. The Hmong Special Guerrilla Units were known as the United \nStates' Secret Army, and their valiant efforts ensured the safety and \nsurvival of countless U.S. soldiers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. Hmong Special Guerrilla Units \nactively supported the United States, and risked great loss of life to \nsave downed United States pilots and protect our troops. While the \nSpecial Guerrilla Units may have operated in secret, their efforts, \ncourage and sacrifices have been kept secret for far too long. The word \nHmong means ``free people,'' and celebrations such as this \ncommemoration will raise awareness of the loyalty, bravery and \nindependence exhibited by the Hmong people.\n  Ms. STABENOW. It is important that the sacrifices made by the Hmong \npeople are honored by all Americans. These rugged people, from the \nhills of Laos, paid a great cost because of their love of freedom and \ntheir support of the United States. It is estimated that over 40,000 \nHmong died during the Vietnam War. Thousands more were forced to flee \nto refugee camps, and approximately 60,000 Hmongs immigrated to United \nStates.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As the Senator from Michigan knows, thousands of Hmongs \nimmigrated to the United States after the Vietnam War. The transition \nto life in the United States has not always been easy, but the Hmong \ncommunity has grown and is prospering. There are nearly 200,000 Hmong \nin the United States, and many of them live in our home State of \nMichigan. It is important that those who fought in the Special \nGuerrilla Units are honored for their actions. These units, like all \nthose who served the cause of freedom, must know that we appreciate the \ngreat sacrifices made by the Special Guerrilla Units.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would concur with my good friend that events such as \nthe 6th Annual Commemoration of U.S. Lao-Hmong Special Guerrilla Units \nVeterans Recognition Day play an important role in honoring these \ncourageous veterans. This celebration will also educate future \ngenerations of Americans about the sacrifices made by this independent \nand freedom loving people. I know that my Senate colleagues will join \nme, and my colleague from the State of Michigan, in commending the \nHmong Special Guerrilla Units for their bravery, sacrifice, and \ncommitment to freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7946-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDonna Centrella, a very special woman whom I met 2 years ago during my \ncampaign in New York. Donna died on Monday after a long, brave battle \nwith ovarian cancer.\n  I first met Donna in September 1999, when I visited Massena Memorial \nHospital in Massena, NY. Donna had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer \nin August, but did not have health insurance to cover her treatment. \nMiraculously, she found a doctor who would treat her without insurance \nand she was able to afford care through a variety of State programs.\n  Perhaps even more astounding was her doctor's statement that she was \nactually better off without managed care coverage because he could \nbetter treat her that way. Without HMO constraints, they were free to \nmake the decisions about the best procedures to follow for her \ntreatment and care--her doctor could keep her in the hospital as long \nas needed and he would not have to get preapproval for surgery.\n  I have retold Donna's unbelievable story many times since meeting \nthis extraordinary woman. Hers is a story that underscores the profound \nneed in this country for immediate reform of the way we provide health \ncoverage to our citizens. We owe it to patients like Donna to sign \npatients protections into law as soon as possible to ensure that we can \nprovide the best medical treatment possible to everyone who needs it.\n  We have lost an ally, but I have faith that we will not lose the \nfight for greater patient protections. It saddens me greatly that Donna \nwill not be here to see it happen. She was an amazing soul whose \ndetermination and strength will never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7946-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LANCE CPL.

Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a North \nDakota family that exemplifies the spirit of rural life and all that it \ncontributes to our Nation. The Strand family, of Regan, ND, will this \nweek celebrate 100 years on the family farm.\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\n  Andrew and Anna Strand arrived in North Dakota in 1901, brought by \nemigrant train to Wilton, ND. Then, with only a team of horses, a \nwagon, a walking breaking plow, a disc, and a drill, Andrew and Anna \nset about making a home in the small community of Regan.\n  From those meager beginnings, Anna and Andrew raised a family of six \nchildren and, just like thousands of other North Dakotans at that time, \nthey built a successful family farm and did the hard work that \neventually carved hardy communities from the prairie.\n  Today, the Strand family farm is still being farmed by Andrew and \nAnna's grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Four generations of \nStrands have lived and worked on the land over the past century. As \nanyone who knows will tell you, farming is hard work. And the Strand \nfamily has kept that farm going through everything from the Great \nDepression to droughts and floods. The family survived even the leanest \nyears, times in the early part of the last century when there was only \none good paying crop out of every 7 years.\n  While some have stayed to continue to work the land, others in the \nStrand family have built lives and careers that contribute to our \nState, regional, and national life in a variety of other ways. Andrew \nand Anna's descendants have worked in healthcare, education, music, \npublic affairs, and agribusiness, to name only a few.\n  Anna and Andrew's children left their mark on our society in a \nprofound way. Einar Strand helped build the United Nations building in \nNew York. Norton was involved in the agriculture industry throughout \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana. Alice became the \nhead administrator at Ballard Hospital in Seattle, WA. Both Arthur and \nBarney, worked the land as their father before them. Today, Barney, \nJr., and his son Richard continue the tradition of farming on the \noriginal Strand homestead.\n  The Strand family also contributed to community life in many ways. In \nthe early days, when help was needed in the fledgling community, the \nStrand family was there; helping the local doctor on his daily rounds \nduring the influenza outbreak of 1918, helping to build the first local \nschoolhouse, building township roads and more.\n  Families like the Strand demonstrate the importance of preserving the \nfamily farm and our rural communities. They also remind us that family \nfarms produce more than the food that feeds our Nation and the world. \nFamily farms also produce hardy, enduring families that make our \ncommunities and our Nation strong.\n  I congratulate them as they celebrates this 100-year anniversary of \nlife on the family farm, and extend the hope that the Strand family \nwill continue the tradition that Andrew and Anna started a century \nago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF CORNERSTONES COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IN THE 2001 \n                     SMITHSONIAN FOLKLIFE FESTIVAL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Over the \nlast century, Indians fans have seen their team win two World Series \nand five American League Pennants. One of my most vivid baseball \nmemories is the 1954 World Series, which I attended with my dad when I \nwas seven years old.\n  I think the inaugural Indians manager, James McAleer, would have been \nproud to lead the Tribe teams of the past five years in their string of \nfive Central Division Titles and two World Series appearances. The \nIndians claim 22 players in the Hall of Fame, including the following:\n\n       Nap Lajoie, Tris Speaker, Cy Young (1937); Jesse Burkett \n     (1946); Bob Feller (1962); Elmer Flick, Sam Rice (1963); Stan \n     Coveleski (1969); Lou Boudreau (1970); Satchel Paige (1971); \n     Early Wynn (1972); Ralph Kiner (1975); Bob Lemon (1976); Joe \n     Sewell, Al Lopez (1977); Addie Joss (1978); Frank Robinson \n     (1982); Hoyt Wilhelm (1985); Gaylord Perry, Bill Veeck \n     (1991); Phil Niekro (1997); Larry Doby (1998).\n\n  Additionally, the Indians have retired the numbers of six players, \nincluding:\n\n       Bob Lemon (21); Earl Averill (3); Lou Boudreau (5); Larry \n     Doby (14); Mel Harder (18); Bob Feller (19).\n\n  Adding to these accomplishments, by the end of the 2000 season, the \nteam had racked up 7,896 total wins. Also, the Indians are just one of \nfour American League teams to spend their entire history in one city. \nThe Indians have been loyal to their fans, and the fans have, in turn, \nbeen loyal to their team. After Jacob's Field was built in 1994, fans \nresponded by selling out 455 consecutive games. And, the Indians led \nMajor League Baseball in attendance last year for the first time since \n1948.\n  The Indians are a treasure for the City of Cleveland and the State of \nOhio, but I also believe the Indians hold a larger significance for \nAmerica. Walt Whitman once wrote that baseball was ``America's game . . \n. it belongs as much to our institutions, fits into them as \nsignificantly as our Constitution's laws . . . and it is just as \nimportant in the sum total of our historic life.'' I think Whitman had \nit absolutely right. Baseball is a vital part of our American culture, \nand for 100 years, the Cleveland Indians have served as an outstanding \nambassador for the sport of baseball.\n  I congratulate the Cleveland Indians on a century of rich history, \nloyal fans, and great success. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin wishing the Indians the best of luck in the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7947-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7947-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in execution session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7947-5", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7947-S7948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2500.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to muscular \n     dystrophy; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, Current federal funding for research on muscular \n     dystrophy is insufficient given the disease's prevalence and \n     severity, and this level of support does little to promote \n     advances in research and treatment of the disease; and\n       Whereas, The term muscular dystrophy encompasses a large \n     group of hereditary muscle-destroying disorders that appear \n     in men, women, and children of every race and ethnicity, with \n     the most common disorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, first \n     appearing in early childhood or adolescence; and\n       Whereas, Furthermore, since genetic mutations may be a \n     factor in any incidence of muscular dystrophy, anyone could \n     be a carrier, and no family is immune from the possibility of \n     the disease afflicting one of its members; and\n       Whereas, While the prognosis for individuals afflicted with \n     a muscular dystrophy disorder varies according to patterns of \n     inheritance, the age of onset, the initial muscles attached, \n     and the progression of the disease, Duchenne muscular \n     dystrophy is the most common fatal childhood genetic disease; \n     and\n       Whereas, Because muscular dystrophy varies widely from one \n     disorder to another, continuing research is important to \n     understanding the disease, treating it, and working toward \n     its prevention and cure; and\n       Whereas, Congressional funding for research by the National \n     Institutes of Health on Duchenne and Becker muscular \n     dystrophy does not reflect the severity of this disease, the \n     importance of finding a cure, or the potential benefits that \n     research in this area could have on other similar disorders; \n     and\n       Whereas, To save lives and improve the quality of life for \n     those already afflicted by this disease, it is imperative \n     that the federal government take the initiative to increase \n     funding for the research of Duchenne and Becker muscular \n     dystrophy and, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     increase funding for research by the National Institutes of \n     Health for the treatment and cure of Duchenne and Becker \n     muscular dystrophy; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United states \n     congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-125. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to NAFTA; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, While the North American Free Trade Agreement \n     (NAFTA) has boosted the economy in Texas and the nation, the \n     increase in heavy truck traffic has caused excessive wear on \n     county and city roads that lie within the border commercial \n     zone; and\n       Whereas, According to the Texas Border Infrastructure \n     Coalition more than 77 percent of United States-Mexico trade \n     passes through the Texas border region annually; in 1999 this \n     amounted to 4.4 million trucks crossing the Texas-Mexico \n     border carrying $127.6 billion worth of commerce; and\n       Whereas, Many of these trucks exceed the weight limits \n     imposed by both federal and state law, causing extensive \n     damage to public roads and bridges, especially the ``off-\n     system'' roads that are maintained by counties and \n     municipalities, most of which are not designed to handle \n     these heavy commercial trucks; and\n       Whereas, The Texas Department of Transportation estimates \n     that there are more than 17,000 miles of load-posted roadways \n     in Texas; many of these roadways are Farm-to-Market roads \n     that were built in the 1940s and 1950s using design standards \n     for a legal weight limit of 48,000 pounds, or approximately \n     60 percent of the weight of some of the heavier trucks today; \n     and\n       Whereas, There are approximately 7,250 deficient bridges on \n     off-system roads in Texas, and while the Texas Department of \n     Transportation is in the process of upgrading these bridges, \n     the scope of the bridge rehabilitation required means that, \n     at current funding levels and practices, it could take \n     decades to complete the undertaking, assuming no more bridges \n     become deficient; it is important, therefore, that trucks be \n     weighed before they are permitted to operate in the \n     commercial border zone, so as not to cause further \n     infrastructure damage; and\n       Whereas, In addition to contributing to the destruction of \n     transportation infrastructure, overweight trucks pose safety \n     hazards for other vehicles sharing the roads; the University \n     of Michigan Transportation Research Institute estimates that \n     as the weight of a truck goes from 65,000 to 80,000 pounds, \n     the risk of an accident involving a fatality increases by 50 \n     percent; and\n       Whereas, County and city governments within the commercial \n     border zone would benefit greatly from having additional \n     weigh stations situated in their jurisdictions and additional \n     law enforcement officers to conduct weight inspections of \n     commercial vehicles traveling on roads that they maintain; \n     and\n       Whereas, While the entire nation benefits from NAFTA, the \n     local governments along the Texas-Mexico border must bear the \n     high cost of overweight truck inspections and repairing \n     damage to the roads resulting from the increase in heavy \n     commercial vehicle traffic on the off-system roads; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby urge the United States Congress to create a federal \n     category under the NAFTA agreement, for NAFTA traffic-related \n     infrastructure damage, to provide counties and municipalities \n     with funding for commercial vehicle weigh stations within the \n     20-mile commercial border zone; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-126. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to border \n     ports of entry and high-priority transportation corridors; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, The current presidential administration has \n     indicated that it will allow Mexican trucks at least partial \n     access to U.S. highways beyond the commercial border zone \n     that was established in 1993 to limit the movement of Mexican \n     trucks until certain basic infrastructure and safety concerns \n     had been addressed; and\n       Whereas, The opening of the Texas border to Mexican trucks \n     will unfairly impact the three border transportation \n     districts in Pharr, Laredo, and El Paso without a \n     commensurate increase in the commitment of money by the \n     federal government; and\n       Whereas, The Texas Senate Special Committee on Border \n     Affairs was given several study charges during the 1999-2000 \n     interim, including assessing the long-term intermodal \n     transportation needs of the Texas-Mexico border region, \n     evaluating the planning and capacity resources of the three \n     Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) border districts, \n     and overseeing the implementation of federal and state one-\n     stop inspection stations to expedite trade and traffic; and\n       Whereas, The senate committee reported that Texas border \n     crossings account for approximately 80 percent of United \n     States-Mexico truck traffic, but the state is awarded only 15 \n     percent of the federal funds allocated for trade corridors; \n     information from TxDOT indicates that Texas receives \n     considerably less than its fair share of discretionary funds \n     allocated by the federal government; recent estimates by \n     TxDOT indicate that, even though Texas is the second largest \n     state in the nation, the state currently receives only 49 \n     cents on the dollar in federal highway discretionary program \n     funds; and\n       Whereas, The border ports of entry are the primary gateway \n     for commerce for Texas and the nation but have become an \n     economic choke point as a result of the staggering volume of \n     traffic they must handle; in 1997, more than 2.8 million \n     trucks crossed into and from Mexico; and\n       Whereas, In July 1999, the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     reported that NAFTA-related traffic along the border region \n     has taxed the local and regional transportation \n     infrastructure and that the resulting lines of traffic, which \n     can run up to several miles during peak periods, are \n     associated with air pollution caused by idling vehicles; and\n       Whereas, The GAO also cited federal and local officials' \n     concerns about congestion affecting safety around the ports \n     of entry and noted that congestion can have a negative impact \n     on businesses that operate on a just-in-time schedule and \n     rely on regular cross-border shipments of parts, supplies, \n     and finished products; and\n       Whereas, The senate committee reported that in the last \n     decade total northbound truck crossings, from Mexico into \n     Texas, increased by 215.8 percent, while vehicle crossings \n     increased by 59 percent and pedestrian crossings by 18.5 \n     percent; in that same period, southbound truck crossings from \n     Texas to Mexico increased by 278.1 percent to 2.1 billion \n     crossings, vehicle crossings by 53.9 percent to 37.9 million \n     crossings, and pedestrian crossings by 30.8 percent to \n     18.5 million crossings; and\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\n       Whereas, According to some estimates, heavy truck traffic \n     is expected to increase by 85 percent during the next three \n     decades and severely degrade existing roads and bridges; \n     according to TxDOT officials, one fully loaded 18-wheel truck \n     causes as much damage as 9,600 cars; with such a significant \n     increase of trade and cross-border activity in the border \n     ports of entry and the border transportation districts, state \n     and federal leaders have cause for concern about whether the \n     current infrastructure can continue to support Texas' \n     economic growth and, in particular, trade with Mexico; and\n       Whereas, The Texas Department of Economic Development \n     (TDED) reported last year that Mexico is Texas' largest \n     export destination and has been a chief contributor to the \n     state's export growth; in 1999, exports to Mexico accounted \n     for 45.5 percent of the state total and were valued at $41.4 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, The TDED has concluded that Texas accounts for \n     20.8 percent of the total U.S. exports to the North American \n     market, largely because of very high export levels to Mexico; \n     in recent years, Mexico has become the nation's second \n     largest market, and Texas' ties to Mexico are the primary \n     contributors to the state's high share of overall U.S. \n     exports; and\n       Whereas, The comptroller of public accounts of the State of \n     Texas has reported that exports account for 14 percent of our \n     gross state product, up from six percent in 1985; in 1999, \n     $100 billion in two-way truck trade passed through the Texas-\n     Mexico border; NAFTA economic activity has tripled on the \n     border, and trade with Mexico accounts for one in every five \n     jobs in Texas; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United states \n     and the president of the United States, in light of the \n     proposed change in federal policy that will further open the \n     border areas to Mexican truck travel, to recognize the unique \n     planning, capacity, and infrastructure needs of Texas' border \n     ports of entry and the high-priority transportation \n     corridors; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Legislature request the congress \n     and the president to recognize the impact of this policy by \n     earmarking $3 billion to fund the construction of one-stop \n     federal and state inspection facilities that are open 24 \n     hours per day along the Texas border region, as well as to \n     fund infrastructure improvements and construction projects at \n     border ports of entry; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Legislature urge the congress to \n     rectify the funding imbalance that Texas has historically \n     experienced from the federal government, as evident in the \n     fact that, although Texas handles 80 percent of all NAFTA-\n     related traffic and is the second largest state in the \n     nation, it has been awarded only 15 percent of the federal \n     funds allocated for high-priority trade corridors; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Legislature request that the \n     congress and the president also increase the percentage in \n     federal discretionary money that Texas has historically \n     received by earmarking $4 billion for critical NAFTA-related \n     planning, capacity, and right-of-way acquisition needs and $3 \n     billion for immediate construction, maintenance, and planning \n     needs for rural roadways that are impacted by NAFTA-related \n     traffic, as well as those of emerging NAFTA-related \n     corridors;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the legislature of the State of Texas relative to the removal \n     of trade, financial, and travel restrictions relating to \n     Cuba; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 54\n\n       Whereas, The relationship between the United States and \n     Cuba has long been marked by tension and confrontation; \n     further heightening this hostility is the 40-year-old United \n     States trade embargo against the island nation that remains \n     the longest-standing embargo in modern history; and\n       Whereas, Cuba imports nearly a billion dollars' worth of \n     food every year, including approximately 1,100,000 tons of \n     wheat, 420,000 tons of rice, 37,000 tons of poultry, and \n     60,000 tons of dairy products; these amounts are expected to \n     grow significantly in coming years as Cuba slowly recovers \n     from the severe economic recession it has endured following \n     the withdrawal of subsidies from the former Soviet Union in \n     the last decade; and\n       Whereas, Agriculture is the second-largest industry in \n     Texas, and this state ranks among the top five states in \n     overall value of agricultural exports at more than $3 billion \n     annually; thus, Texas is ideally positioned to benefit from \n     the market opportunities that free trade with Cuba would \n     provide; rather than depriving Cuba of agricultural products, \n     the United States embargo succeeds only in driving sales to \n     competitors in other countries that have no such \n     restrictions; and\n       Whereas, In recent years, Cuba has developed important \n     pharmaceutical products, namely, a new meningitis B vaccine \n     that has virtually eliminated the disease in Cuba; such \n     products have the potential to protect Americans against \n     diseases that continue to threaten large populations around \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, Cuba's potential oil reserves have attracted the \n     interest of numerous other countries who have been helping \n     Cuba develop its existing wells and search for new reserves; \n     Cuba's oil output has increased more than 400 percent over \n     the last decade; and\n       Whereas, The United States' trade, financial, and travel \n     restrictions against Cuba hinder Texas' exports of \n     agricultural and food products, its ability to import \n     critical energy products, the treatment of illnesses \n     experienced by Texans, and the right of Texans to travel \n     freely; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     consider the removal of trade, financial, and travel \n     restrictions relating to Cuba; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM--128. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the \n     addition of 18 federal judges and commensurate staff to \n     handle the current and anticipated caseloads along the United \n     States-Mexico border, to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, The strategy of the United States Department of \n     Justice to reduce crime along the United States border by \n     focusing on illegal immigration, alien smuggling, and drug \n     trafficking generated an explosion in arrests by agents from \n     the United States Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, and the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service at border checkpoints; and\n       Whereas, In 1999, the five federal southwestern judicial \n     districts along the border, including two in Texas, received \n     27 percent of all criminal case filings in the United States \n     while the other 73 percent were spread among the country's \n     remaining 84 federal district courts; and\n       Whereas, From 1996 to 1997, the total number of federal \n     criminal cases filed in the Western and Southern districts of \n     Texas doubled, and from 1997 to 1999, the number of drug \n     cases filed in the Western District of Texas increased 64 \n     percent and 100 percent in the Southern District of Texas; \n     and\n       Whereas, Judicial resources in the five southwestern border \n     districts have increased by only four percent, and since \n     1990, congress has not approved any new judges for the \n     Western District of Texas, which leads the nation in the \n     filing of drug cases; and\n       Whereas, As a result of the federal courts being inundated \n     by this unprecedented number of new drug and illegal \n     immigration indictments, the federal authorities no longer \n     prosecute offenders caught with less than a substantial \n     amount of contraband; these cases are instead referred to the \n     local district attorneys in the border counties of Texas to \n     prosecute; and\n       Whereas, As a result, local governments in the border \n     counties, who are among the poorest in the United States, are \n     being overwhelmed with the costs involved in prosecuting and \n     incarcerating federal criminals; and\n       Whereas, The annual cost to prosecute these federal \n     criminal cases ranges from $2.7 million to approximately $8.2 \n     million per district attorney jurisdiction, and it is \n     anticipated that the total cost will reach $25 million per \n     year; and\n       Whereas, The federal government has infinitely more \n     resources than state and local governments and in turn must \n     shoulder a larger portion of the financial burden; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     authorize an additional 18 federal judges and commensurate \n     staff to handle the current and anticipated caseloads along \n     the United States-Mexico border and to fully reimburse local \n     governments for the costs incurred in prosecuting and \n     incarcerating federal defendants; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the Senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-129. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n     of Texas relative to federal and state controlled emission \n     sources; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 35\n\n       Whereas, Air pollution has a potentially serious impact on \n     the health of many Americans, including a majority of the \n     nearly 21 million residents of the State of Texas, and is a \n     matter of concern to both federal and state governments, \n     which share a responsibility to clean up the environment and \n     protect the public health; and\n       Whereas, In metropolitan areas where the problem is most \n     severe, achieving federally mandated reductions in the \n     emission of certain pollutants within the time lines \n     established by the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) will be possible only through an appropriate \n     combination of federal, state, and local actions, including \n     not only stringent local and state emission controls but also \n     the timely implementation of federal controls; and\n       Whereas, Emissions may be regulated by either the state's \n     environmental regulation agency or the federal government, \n     depending on their origin; and\n       Whereas, For example, emissions from an industrial \n     facility, such as a utility company or petroleum refinery, \n     are subject to state regulations, while gasoline and diesel \n     fuel standards and emissions from aircraft, airport ground \n     support equipment, automobiles, trucks, marine engines, and \n     locomotives are all federally controlled; and\n       Whereas, Under recent federal action, the EPA will require \n     buses and commercial trucks to produce 95 percent less \n     pollution than today's buses and trucks and will require the \n     amount of sulfur in diesel fuel to be reduced by 97 percent; \n     these measures alone are expected to cut air pollution by as \n     much as 95 percent; and\n       Whereas, At issue is the fact that the low-sulfur diesel \n     fuel provisions will not go into effect before 2006, and \n     diesel fuel engine manufacturers will have flexibility in \n     meeting the new emission standards due to phase in between \n     2007 and 2010; the slow rate of turnover among commercial \n     fleets means that these federal emission control measures \n     will likely have little effect until several years after \n     that, when a sufficient number of these trucks and buses are \n     in operation; and\n       Whereas, Currently, the State of Texas has nine \n     metropolitan areas that either have been designated as \n     nonattainment areas by the EPA or are close to exceeding the \n     National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for one or \n     more of the regulated pollutants; these nonattainment or \n     near-nonattainment areas have been given strict time lines \n     for their emission reduction efforts based on the severity of \n     pollution in the area; and\n       Whereas, Because of the lengthy time line for the reduction \n     of emissions from federally controlled sources, the federally \n     mandated attainment date for some NAAQS nonattainment regions \n     in Texas, such as the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area, will \n     arrive long before the effects of federal air quality \n     improvement efforts can be realized; and\n       Whereas, Texas is forced to require state-controlled \n     emission sources to make significant reductions in pollution \n     in a relatively short period of time while federally \n     controlled sources continue to contaminate the state's \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, The incongruence in the federal and state time \n     lines for emission reductions places an undue burden on the \n     state to lower air pollution significantly enough to be in \n     attainment with the NAAQS without a corresponding decrease in \n     emissions from any of the myriad federally controlled \n     emission sources; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     require federally controlled emission sources to reduce their \n     emissions by the same percentages and on the same schedule as \n     state-controlled sources; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-130. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the federal \n     regulation relating to the three-shell limit and the magazine \n     plug requirement found in 50 C.F.R. Section 20.21; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 28\n\n       Whereas, During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the \n     harvesting of migratory game birds for subsequent resale, or \n     ``market hunting,'' was widespread, and this wasteful method \n     led to federal regulations to eliminate the practice in all \n     50 states; and\n       Whereas, One regulation adopted to curtail this practice \n     limits the number of shells a shotgun can hold to no more \n     than three and requires shotgun magazines to have a plug to \n     effect the three-shell limit; and\n       Whereas, In the ensuing years, additional regulations have \n     been enacted to protect migratory game birds, such as the \n     current federal and state daily or seasonal bag limits that \n     regulate the number of game birds that can be killed or \n     possessed by a hunter, making the three-shell limit and the \n     magazine plug requirement unnecessary and archaic; and\n       Whereas, Enforcing outdated regulations wastes limited law \n     enforcement resources that could be better utilized enforcing \n     other hunting laws, such as bag limits; and\n       Whereas, A game bird wounded by a third shot that cannot \n     subsequently be killed by a fourth shot suffers an inhumane \n     death and is a waste of game resources; and\n       Whereas, The greater frequency of loading a shotgun \n     necessitated by the three-shell limit creates a safety hazard \n     for the hunter; and\n       Whereas, Because migratory game birds can be protected by \n     other federal and state regulations, the enforcement of the \n     three-shell limit and magazine plug requirement is no longer \n     necessary and should be discontinued; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     repeal the federal regulation relating to the three-shell \n     limit and the magazine plug requirement found in 50 C.F.R. \n     Section 20.21; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to the \n     congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-131. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to designating \n     threatened species and critical habitat for the Arkansas \n     River shiner; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 51\n\n       Whereas, Under rules adopted on November 23, 1998, the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service of the United States Department of the \n     Interior listed the Arkansas River shiner (Notropis girardi), \n     a minnow whose present range includes portions of the \n     Canadian River in Texas, as a threatened species pursuant to \n     the federal Endangered Species Act; and\n       Whereas, Subsequent rules adopted on April 4, 2001, which \n     follow from policy reconsideration stipulated in an agreed \n     settlement order, designate 1,148 miles of river segments in \n     the Arkansas River basin--including over 100 miles of the \n     Canadian River in Oldham, Potter, and Hemphill counties in \n     Texas--as critical habitat for the species; and\n       Whereas, This state's Parks and Wildlife Department \n     recommended against listing the Arkansas River shiner as an \n     endangered or even threatened species because such a listing \n     was scientifically unsound and unnecessary; and\n       Whereas, The Fish and Wildlife Service refused to enter a \n     Memorandum of Understanding concerning recovery of the \n     Arkansas River shiner with the states of Texas and Oklahoma, \n     yet in its recent rule adoption notice concedes that ideally \n     a recovery plan should precede critical habitat designation; \n     and\n       Whereas, Its designation, which becomes effective on May 4, \n     2001, includes a portion of the Canadian River that makes up \n     the headwaters of Lake Meredith, and as such could \n     potentially interfere with the reservoir's water supply and \n     flood control functions; and\n       Whereas, Critical habitat designation enhances the \n     likelihood that the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as \n     amended, might be used as a vehicle for direct regulation of \n     Texas groundwater and surface water use by the federal \n     government or the federal courts; and\n       Whereas, Notwithstanding its recent final rule adoption, \n     the Fish and Wildlife Service states that it continues to \n     solicit additional public comments on the issue toward \n     possible new approaches to recovery planning; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby urge the United States Department of the Interior to \n     reconsider the necessity of designating the Arkansas River \n     shiner as a threatened species and the necessity of \n     designating critical habitat in Texas for the Arkansas River \n     shiner; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     urge the Parks and Wildlife Department and the Office of the \n     Attorney General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that \n     portions of the Canadian River in Texas be designated as \n     critical habitat only to the extent that such designation is \n     absolutely necessary, scientifically justifiable, and \n     economically prudent; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the secretary of the \n     interior, to the president of the United States, to the \n     speaker of the house of representatives and the president of \n     the senate of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to the congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward an \n     official copy of this resolution to the executive director of \n     the Parks and Wildlife Department and to the attorney general \n     of Texas.\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-132.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to amending \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by \n     PL 106-230; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 77\n\n       Whereas, In an attempt to enact meaningful campaign finance \n     reform legislation, the 106th Congress of the United States \n     passed the Full and Fair Political Activities Disclosure Act \n     (Public Law 106-230), which imposed notification and \n     reporting requirements on political organizations claiming \n     tax-exempt status under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code; and\n       Whereas, Public Law 106-230 took effect July 1, 2000, four \n     days after its introduction; the rapidity of its passage \n     through congress reflected the lawmakers' sense of urgency to \n     act, but it also suggests that adequate time was not provided \n     for deliberation of the full ramifications of certain \n     provisions; and\n       Whereas, The goal of this legislation was to respond to \n     certain political organizations, known as ``stealth PACs,'' \n     that were able to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money \n     for political advocacy without having to disclose the sources \n     and amounts of donations, all while enjoying tax-exempt \n     status; and\n       Whereas, While the Texas Legislature supports the laudable \n     goal of holding all participants in the political process \n     accountable to the public, the members of this body believe \n     that this well-intentioned Act has had unintended \n     consequences and has adversely affected individuals and \n     organizations beyond its original intent; and\n       Whereas, Public Law 106-230 imposes duplicative and \n     burdensome federal reporting and disclosure requirements on \n     local and state candidates, their campaign committees, and \n     local and state political parties that already are required \n     to file detailed reports with their respective state election \n     officials; and\n       Whereas, These requirements have created a paperwork \n     nightmare for entities that are clearly outside the intended \n     scope of PL 106-230 without significantly adding to the body \n     of information available to the public; and\n       Whereas, A remedy in the form of an exemption for those \n     entities or an exception for information reported and filed \n     elsewhere with state officials would not violate the \n     intention of enforcing public accountability, since the \n     individuals and organizations affected already are required \n     to report and disclose to the state the same information that \n     PL 106-230 now requires them to report to the Internal \n     Revenue Service; nor would it be unprecedented, since a \n     similar exemption already exists for candidates, campaign \n     committees, and party organizations engaged in federal \n     elections, who are required by FECA to report that \n     information to the Federal Election Commission; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     amend provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \n     added by PL 106-230, to exempt state and local political \n     committees that are required to report to their respective \n     states from notification and reporting requirements imposed \n     by PL 106-230; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-134. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature relative to providing tax credits to \n     individuals buying private health insurance; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, Almost 90 percent of all health insurance is paid \n     for by and through employer programs, providing the majority \n     of American workers with affordable access to health care; \n     and\n       Whereas, Generous federal tax code provisions that make \n     employee contributions to employer-provided health insurance \n     fully deductible from federal individual income taxes allow \n     employees participating in such plans to purchase the \n     coverage they need in a cost-effective manner; and\n       Whereas, Some employers benefit from the health insurance \n     they provide since the tax code also allows them to deduct \n     the cost of the health insurance they offer employees from \n     their corporate income taxes as a business expense; and\n       Whereas, Not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to \n     participate in an employer-provided health plan, and those \n     who purchase private health insurance do not receive tax \n     breaks of any kind; for these individuals, a dollar in pretax \n     wages may buy only 50 cents' worth of health insurance after \n     federal, state, and local taxes are taken out; and\n       Whereas, Congress has responded to this issue with the 1999 \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act, which gives a 60 percent tax \n     deduction for insurance expenses to those who are self-\n     employed; this deduction is scheduled to rise to 100 percent \n     by 2003; and\n       Whereas, For individuals who purchase private health \n     insurance and bear the full cost of a policy without the \n     benefit of an employer's contributions, this deduction does \n     little to make that private insurance affordable, since tax \n     deductions provide a less substantial tax break than tax \n     credits; while a tax deduction is subtracted from a person's \n     income when calculating taxes, a tax credit is subtracted \n     from the person's bottom line of taxes owed; and\n       Whereas, Tax credits will give consumers more choice in \n     health plans because employees would no longer be limited to \n     insurance offered by employers; furthermore, consumers who \n     bought their own private health insurance could maintain \n     their coverage even if they changed jobs without any lapse in \n     coverage; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     provide tax credits to individuals buying private health \n     insurance; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-135. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to amending \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow for the issuance \n     of tax-exempt bonds for the purpose of financing air \n     pollution control facilities nonattainment areas; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 226\n\n       Whereas, The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area is \n     classified as a serious nonattainment area and the Beaumont-\n     Port Arthur (BPA) area is classified as a moderate \n     nonattainment area for the one-hour ozone standard and both \n     are likely to be classified as nonattainment areas for the \n     proposed eight-hour ozone standards and for the particulate \n     matter 2.5 standards, should those standards be reinstated; \n     and\n       Whereas, The State of Texas recently submitted revisions of \n     its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the HGB and BPA areas \n     the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     outlining measures that will be taken in order to achieve \n     compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards \n     for ozone; and\n       Whereas, For the HGB and BPA areas to be classified as in \n     attainment for ozone, the regions must make significant \n     reductions in air containment emissions from several types of \n     sources, including industrial point\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\n     sources such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants; and\n       Whereas, Strategies aimed at controlling industrial \n     emissions target specific industries and facilities, \n     requiring them to bear up front the high costs of installing \n     emission control technologies; and\n       Whereas, While pollution control technologies can be \n     effective in reducing emissions, the technology that many \n     companies are required to purchase by the ozone SIP can cause \n     a tremendous financial strain on an individual entity and \n     affect entire industries; and\n       Whereas, Some industries, including agricultural, chemical \n     production, gasoline terminals, and oil and natural gas \n     production and petroleum refineries, must purchase costly \n     maximum achievable control technology in order to be in \n     compliance with the ozone SIP; and\n       Whereas, The Texas Gulf Coast has a crude operatable \n     capacity of 3.462 barrels of refined petroleum products per \n     calendar day, i.e. 84.6 percent of the Texas total and 21.9 \n     percent of the U.S. total; and\n       Whereas, The HGB area is home to more than 400 chemical \n     plants employing more than 38,200 people and the BPA area is \n     home to numerous chemical plants and industrial operations \n     employing more than 20,000 people; and\n       Whereas, The Houston Gulf Coast has nearly 49 percent of \n     the nation's base petrochemicals manufacturing capacity; this \n     is more than quadruple the manufacturing capacity of its \n     nearest U.S. competitor; and\n       Whereas, Many of the commodities produced in this area are \n     distributed throughout the nation, yet, while the entire \n     country benefits from the petroleum refining and \n     petrochemical industries, these industries must bear the up-\n     front costs of environmental compliance while faced with \n     global competition without significant federal assistance; \n     and\n       Whereas, Currently, the federal government authorizes the \n     issuance of tax-exempt facility bonds to finance the \n     building of installations that are used for the public \n     good, such as airports, water plants, sewage and solid \n     waste systems, and some hazardous waste facilities; \n     however, since 1986, such bond issues have no longer been \n     authorized for air pollution control facilities; and\n       Whereas, The reduction of air pollution clearly benefits \n     all residents of the state, and air contaminant emission \n     reductions are mandated by the federal government in \n     nonattainment areas; given the severity of the up-front \n     financial costs that are to be incurred in order to reduce \n     the air contaminant emissions in Texas nonattainment areas, \n     restoring the previous provision that allowed the issuance of \n     tax-exempt facility bonds to finance air pollution control \n     facilities would significantly enhance the ability of regions \n     such as the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and Beaumont-Port \n     Arthur areas to meet applicable National Ambient Air Quality \n     Standards and avoid future sanctions; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow for the \n     issuance of tax-exempt facility bonds for the purpose of \n     financing air pollution control facilities in nonattainment \n     areas and to provide that such tax-exempt facility bonds \n     issued during the years of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, or 2007 \n     for the construction of such air pollution control facilities \n     not be subject to the volume cap requirements; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-136. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to \n     establishing a separate Federal Medical Assistance Percentage \n     for the Texas-Mexico border region; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 214\n\n       Whereas, The Texas-Mexico border region suffers from an \n     inadequate medical infrastructure that has led to disparities \n     in access to health care between the border region and the \n     rest of the state; and\n       Whereas, Statewide in 1998, there was an average of 270 \n     Medicaid-eligible patients for every physician participating \n     in the Medicaid program, but in the border counties where \n     there were participating physicians, the number of eligible \n     patients per physician ranged from a low of 416 in El Paso \n     County to a high of 1,361 in Starr County; in two counties, \n     Presidio and Zapata, there were no participating physicians \n     at all to serve the Medicaid-eligible population; and\n       Whereas, The border region historically has had high \n     patient-to-physician ratios, resulting in limited access to \n     health care services and reduced utilization rates for these \n     services; in addition, the availability of medical care in \n     Mexico may also reduce utilization rates for the region; and\n       Whereas, Low utilization rates along the border create a \n     distorted assessment of the actual demand for services and \n     inappropriately drive down the capitated reimbursement rates \n     for both Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (CHIP); and\n       Whereas, The average per-recipient reimbursement for the \n     border region is 16 percent less than the statewide average, \n     which creates a disincentive for health care providers to \n     locate and provide services to Medicaid clients in the \n     region; furthermore, low reimbursement rates complicate \n     already limited access to health care as existing providers \n     either leave the program or limit their participation; and\n       Whereas, Current Medicaid and CHIP reimbursement rates \n     simply trap the Texas-Mexico border counties in a cycle of \n     limited access to care, low utilization rates, and low \n     reimbursement rates, all of which further damage the medical \n     infrastructure of the region and create greater barriers to \n     health care access for Medicaid and CHIP clients; and\n       Whereas, The unique issues facing the border may not be \n     apparent when evaluations of the state as a whole mask \n     discrepancies between the border and the rest of the state; \n     calculating the federal share of the state's Medicaid costs, \n     or the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), using \n     the state's per capita income may not provide an accurate \n     assessment of the border region's needs; and\n       Whereas, Establishing a separate FMAP for the border region \n     would recognize these unique circumstances and allow current \n     state Medicaid funding in the region to draw down additional \n     federal funds that would help eliminate the reimbursement \n     disparity; and\n       Whereas, Unless this disparity is resolved, the region will \n     continue to suffer from an inadequate health care \n     infrastructure that is unable to address the medical needs of \n     the border residents; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     establish a separate Federal Medical Assistance Percentage \n     for the Texas-Mexico border region; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-137. A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the SS \n     Leopoldville; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 201\n\n       Whereas, On Christmas Eve 1944, while carrying American \n     soldiers of the 66th Infantry Division to reinforce Allied \n     troops fighting the Battle of the Bulge, the SS Leopoldville \n     was sunk in the English Channel by a U-boat torpedo, \n     resulting in the loss of 763 members of the 262nd and 264th \n     regiments, including 35 Texans; and\n       Whereas, The underwater grave, located five and a half \n     miles off the coast of Cherbourg, France, cradles to this day \n     the remains of 493 unrecovered and entombed American \n     servicemen who have been honored by monuments erected across \n     the United States in their memory; and\n       Whereas, World War II combat and wreckage locations, \n     including many at sea, have fallen prey to plunderers and \n     looters who, in seeking souvenirs and commercial reward, have \n     desecrated the memory of our valorous combatants and their \n     final resting places; and\n       Whereas, The wreckage of the SS Leopoldville is threatened \n     by the practice of divers who descend to remove such \n     artifacts as brass, portholes, and other parts of the ship \n     and who, if unchecked, may begin to extract the personal \n     effects and military equipment of the deceased and in so \n     doing disturb the sanctity of their burial site; and\n       Whereas, The State of New York has issued a proclamation in \n     memory of the victims of the SS Leopoldville, and at least a \n     dozen like measures have been passed by other states to \n     commemorate the men who lost their lives in this tragedy and \n     to ensure that they continue their silent rest in dignity; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby honor the American servicemen who were lost when the \n     troopship SS Leopoldville was sunk by an enemy torpedo on \n     December 24, 1944; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas Legislature respectfully \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to take \n     appropriate action to prevent further desecration of the SS \n     Leopoldville or any of its contents; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to \n     the congress with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-138. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Texas relative to the \n     Minerals Management Service plan to proceed with the Outer\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\n     Continental Shelf Lease Sale 181; to the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 34\n\n       Whereas, A strong domestic oil and gas industry is vitally \n     important to the United States economy and national defense; \n     and\n       Whereas, This nation's domestic oil and gas production has \n     decreased by 2.7 million barrels per day during the last 13 \n     years, a 17 percent decline, at the same time that domestic \n     consumption of oil has increased by more than 14 percent; and\n       Whereas, Currently, the United States imports approximately \n     55 percent of the oil needed for the American economy, while \n     the demand for refined petroleum products is projected to \n     increase by more than 35 percent and the demand for natural \n     gas is projected to increase by more than 45 percent over the \n     next two decades; and\n       Whereas, Much of the nation's greatest potential for future \n     domestic production lies in areas that are currently off \n     limits to oil and natural gas exploration and development, \n     including areas under congressional or presidential moratoria \n     in the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), where vast \n     amounts of oil and natural gas may be available for \n     extraction; and\n       Whereas, For the first time since 1988, the Minerals \n     Management Service, a bureau of the United States Department \n     of the Interior that manages the nation's oil, gas, and other \n     mineral resources in the OCS, has proposed an OCS lease sale \n     for the eastern Gulf of Mexico, in the portion of the Gulf \n     100 miles southwest of the Florida Panhandle and 15 miles \n     south of the Alabama coastline; the bureau's tentative \n     schedule calls for bid opening and reading in December 2001; \n     and\n       Whereas, The oil and gas industry has demonstrated that it \n     can be a good steward of the environment while operating in \n     the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, Oil and gas production from this area of the Gulf \n     of Mexico would help offset current domestic energy \n     production declines and assist the nation in meeting future \n     energy demand; and\n       Whereas, Numerous positive economic benefits for the State \n     of Texas have been created by oil and gas industry activities \n     in the Gulf, and many of the exploration and production \n     companies that would participate in the OCS Lease Sale 181 \n     are headquartered in Texas as are many of the oil field \n     supply and service companies that would benefit by increased \n     activities; and\n       Whereas, The economic benefits that would result from oil \n     and natural gas exploration, development, and production of \n     leases acquired in OCS Lease Sale 181 would continue to \n     benefit the State of Texas and all the states bordering the \n     Gulf of Mexico; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 77th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby declare support for the Minerals Management Service \n     plan to proceed with the Outer Continental Shelf Lease Sale \n     181 for the eastern Gulf of Mexico scheduled for December 5, \n     2001; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the Director of the \n     Minerals Management Service, to the Secretary of the \n     Interior, to the President of the United States, to the \n     speaker of the house of representatives and the president of \n     the senate of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to the Congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United States of America.\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7955-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, without \n     amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

A bill to authorize a program of assistance to improve \ninternational building practices in eligible Latin American countries; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill improve building safety in Latin America, increase the cost-\neffectiveness of our disaster relief assistance, and, most importantly, \nsave lives. As many of us know, throughout the last decade, the people \nof Latin America have been the victims of numerous natural disasters \nthat have resulted in death, property damage, and destruction. Indeed, \nin the last three years the continent has been ravaged by Hurricane \nMitch, earthquakes in El Salvador and Peru, and horrendous rains and \nmudslides. These disasters have exacted a tremendous toll on the \nregion, causing over 12,000 deaths, $40 billion in damage, and numerous \ninjuries.\n  The cost to rebuild following these disasters is prohibitive and \nplaces a tremendous burden on the already struggling emerging economies \nof Latin America. To mitigate this cost, the United States has \nfrequently released disaster relief funds to help affected countries \nrecover the injured, maintain order, and rebuild their infrastructure. \nFor example, the combined assistance released by the United States \nfollowing Hurricane Mitch and the recent earthquakes totals over $1.2 \nbillion. I fully support these appropriations, and believe that we have \na duty to assist our neighbors and allies when they are confronted with \nnatural disasters. I do, however, believe that we can make this \nassistance more cost-effective in the long run, while saving lives.\n  As I stated, I fully support offering U.S. monetary assistance to \nrebuild following natural disasters. However, because much of Latin \nAmerica does not utilize modern, up-to-date building codes, much of \nthis assistance goes to waste. For example, following the earthquakes \nin El Salvador in 1986, the United States provided $98 million dollars \nto rebuild that country. Most of the reconstruction was done by local \nSalvadoran contractors, and these structures were not built to code. \nNow, 15 years later, following the most recent earthquakes in El \nSalvador, the United States offered over $100 million dollars in aid. \nHad reconstruction in 1986 been done to code, undoubtedly the cost of \nthe most recent earthquake would have been lower in both monetary value \nand lives.\n  To remedy this problem, and encourage safe, modern building practices \nin countries that need them the most, I introduce today, with my \ncolleagues Senator Lieberman and Senator Sessions, the Code and Safety \nfor the Americas, CASA Act. The CASA Act would authorize the \nexpenditure of $3 million over two years from general foreign aid funds \nto translate the International Code Council family of building codes, \nwhich are the standard for the United States, into Spanish. \nFurthermore, it would provide funding for the International Code \nCouncil's proposal to train architects and contractors in El Salvador \nand Ecuador in the proper use of the code. By educating builders and \nproviding them the necessary code for their work in their own language, \nit is only a matter of time before we will begin to see safer buildings \nin the region, and a return on our investment. The United States spent \nover $10 million in body bags, temporary tent housing, and first aid \nalone following the recent earthquake in El Salvador. For a \ncomparatively modest sum, $3 million, we can reduce the need for this \ntype of aid by attacking the problem of shoddy building before it \nbegins.\n  In addition, after this program has been implemented in El Salvador \nand Ecuador, it could easily be replicated in other Latin American \ncountries at low cost, requiring only funding for the training program. \nWhile we want to start this program on a small scale, I am confident \nthat other countries will request similar training programs in the \nfuture. In fact, other countries have already asked to be considered \nfor a future expansion of the program. The Inter-American Development \nBank and UN have expressed interest in this idea, and are potential \ncandidates to provide partial funding of any future expansion. Given \nthis interest, it is highly likely that, in the future, a public-\nprivate partnership can be constructed to expand this program to Peru, \nGuatemala, and the rest of Spanish-speaking Latin America. Also, we \ncannot forget the valuable contributions that American volunteer \norganizations such as the International Executive Service Corps can \nmake to this program in the long-run.\n  This legislation is supported by architects, contractors, and public \nofficials both in the United States and in Latin America. Students of \narchitecture in Latin America want to be taught proper standards and \ncode application, and local governments have requested the code in \nSpanish. So, this is not a case of the ``ugly'' America imposing its \nwill on Latin America. We have been asked to share this lifesaving code \nwith our Southern neighbors and, indeed, the number of requests from \ndifferent countries has been staggering.\n  In short, this legislation will save lives, lessen the damage caused \nby future disasters, and illustrate our good will toward our Latin \nAmerican allies while proving to be cost-effective for the United \nStates through decreased aid following future disasters. For a detailed \nanalysis of the problem, and this solution, I wish to draw my \ncolleagues attention to an article by Steven Forneris, an American \narchitect living in Ecuador, that appeared in ``Building Standards'' \nmagazine. In it, Mr. Forneris argues the value of this proposal from \nhis position at the front lines in Ecuador. He clearly and eloquently \noutlines why Latin America needs building code reform, and why it is in \nthe best interests of the United States to involve itself in this \nendeavor.\n  The CASA Act is common-sense legislation that will dramatically \nimprove the lives of citizens of our hemisphere, and represents a real \nchance for American leadership in the Hemisphere at very little cost. I \nhope that my colleagues will join me in this humanitarian effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Forneris' article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From Building Standards, March-April 2001]\n\n             Is It Wrong To Ask for Help on Building Codes?\n\n                         (By Stephen Forneris)\n\n       I work in the field of architecture, part of the time in \n     the City of Guayaquil, Ecuador, and the other part of the \n     time in New York State. Like everyone involved in this \n     profession, one of my chief responsibilities is to guard the \n     health, safety and welfare of my clients. The architects I \n     work with in New York do this by following the International \n     Codes promulgated by the International Code Council (ICC). \n     When working as an architect myself in the small Latin \n     American nation of Ecuador, which simply does not have the \n     resources to develop a complete building code of its own, I \n     am left with a set of very limited and woefully inadequate \n     codes.\n       Ecuador developed its current code 20 years ago by \n     translating portions of 1970s versions of the American \n     Concrete Institute ``Building Code Requirements for \n     Reinforced Concrete and the Uniform Building Code'' (UBC). \n     While a noble effort at the time, it is antiquated by today's \n     standards. The adopted provisions only address structural \n     design requirements and the code does not provide for any \n     general life-safety design concerns such as fire and egress. \n     In 1996, the president of Ecuador signed a bill to develop a \n     new code, but it will take years before it is fully complete \n     and will still only consider structural design requirements. \n     So what does this\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n     have to do with the United Nations or the U.S. Government?\n       As part of its International Decade for Natural Disaster \n     Reduction program, the United Nation's Risk Assessment Tools \n     for Diagnosis of Urban Areas Against Seismic Disasters \n     (RADIUS) project conducted a study of Guayaquil. The RADIUS \n     team determined there to be a 53-percent chance that a \n     magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake will strike within 200 \n     miles of the city in the next 50 years. An estimated 26,000 \n     fatalities would result, along with approximately 90,000 \n     injuries severe enough to require hospitalization. \n     Projections indicate that up to 75 percent of the local \n     hospitals would be non-operational and 90,000 people left \n     homeless. Power would be out for up to three weeks, \n     telephones inoperable and roads impassable for two months, \n     running water cut off for three months, and sewage systems \n     unusable for a year. All told, damage from the tragedy is \n     expected to exceed one billion U.S. dollars . . . and \n     Guayaquil, which is situated in a zone of high seismic \n     activity that stretches from Chile to Alaska, is not even the \n     most vulnerable of Ecuador's cities.\n       I watched news of the recent earthquakes in El Salvador and \n     India with apprehension, knowing that it is only a matter of \n     time before Guayaquil joins the ranks of these horrific human \n     disasters. My colleagues in New York and I are shocked at \n     what those poor people must be going through and are proud \n     that our government is doing its part to help. We are a kind \n     people at our core, and the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) has given El Salvador $8,365,777 and \n     India $12,595,631 in assistance. I have to wonder, though, if \n     the U.S. government has been able to allocate nearly $21 \n     million over the past few months for international disaster \n     relief, should it not be possible to get funding to mitigate \n     the effects of future disasters like these?\n       In 1999, James Lee Witt, then director of the U.S. Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) stated: ``At FEMA, we're \n     working to change the way Americans think about disasters. \n     We've made prevention the focus of emergency management in \n     the United States, and we believe strong, rigorously enforced \n     building codes are central to that effort.'' In 1999, FEMA \n     signed an agreement with ICC to encourage states to adopt and \n     enforce the International Building Code (IBC). As the U.S. \n     government has turned to an aggressive program of domestic \n     prevention, it only seems logical to apply this philosophy \n     in its projects abroad.\n       Guayaquil, and all of Latin America for that matter, needs \n     our help right now. The FEMA-endorsed International Codes \n     arguably provide the best mitigation for natural disasters \n     available in the world, and ICC representatives have informed \n     me that they have a team ready to translate them into \n     Spanish. If USAID is capable of providing such quick and \n     significant funding for plastic sheets, water jugs, hygiene \n     kits, food assistance, etc., why not consider funding \n     translation of the International Codes for a fraction of that \n     cost?\n       In February of this year, The Associated Press reported \n     that USAID had agreed to provide an additional $3 million to \n     El Salvador for emergency housing. Less than a month later, \n     President Bush pledged $100 million more in aid, which El \n     Salvador's President Francisco Flores has stated will be used \n     to reconstruct basic infrastructure and housing in the \n     country. It is worth recalling that only 15 years ago the \n     U.S. government provided El Salvador reconstruction funds \n     totaling $98 million after a smaller earthquake. This brings \n     the total to more than $200 million in less than 20 years, \n     yet the people of El Salvador are no safer because their \n     homes still do not meet any of the generally accepted U.S. \n     building code standards.\n       I have to wonder what kind of message we are sending to \n     developing countries? Have we created a ``disaster lottery'' \n     in which needed aid comes only after images of devastation \n     flash across the evening news? If so, South America alone \n     stands to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in disaster \n     relief over the next few years. In contrast, code \n     translation, certification and training would greatly reduce \n     the risk in the region for much less. What we need to do is \n     think about saving lives now. It is sad to think that it may \n     be easier to get coffins in which to bury the dead than the \n     building codes that would save many of those same people's \n     lives. It is my hope that the U.S. and United Nations, \n     motivated by compassion, foresight and simple economics, can \n     help provide all of Latin America with the truly vital and \n     life-protecting building codes the region urgently needs.\n\n\n                               References\n\n       Jaime Argudo. ``Radius Study'' IIFIUC Guayaquil Ecuador, \n     University Catolica de Santiago de Guayaquil, page 8.\n       U.S. Agency for International Development website. \n     www.usaid.gov. 2/26/01.\n       James Lee Witt, Director of U.S. Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, remarks to the International Code Council, \n     9/13/99, St. Louis, MO.\n       Julie Watson, ``El Salvador Seeks Aid after Quake'', 2/15/\n     01.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for marginal domestic oil and natural gas well production \nand an election to expense geological and geophysical expenditures and \ndelay rental payments; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an energy \nbill I am re-introducing this year, marginal well tax credits. I am \nproud to introduce the Hutchison-Breaux-Collins Marginal Well \nPreservation Act of 2001.\n  As we look to long-term solutions to the high cost of gasoline, \nelectricity and home heating oil, marginal well tax incentives are \ncritical to increasing supply and retaining our energy independence. \nOur crisis of volatile fuel prices in the U.S. has led this year to \nhistorically high gasoline prices, airline ticket surcharges for rising \njet fuel costs, and expected problems with high home heating oil costs \nthis coming winter. This problem is real, it is growing, and it demands \na response from Congress to join with the Administration to find a \ncomprehensive, long-term solution.\n  Senators representing all regions of the country, including the \nNortheast and Midwest have a common interest: to make the United States \nless susceptive to the volatility of world oil markets by reducing \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil. I understand that when the price \nof home heating oil spikes in the Northeast, it hurts those Senators' \nconstituents. They understand when the price of oil falls below $10 a \nbarrel, as it did just over two years ago, and we lose 18,000 jobs as \nwe did in Texas, that hurts my constituents. We understand that these \nare merely two sides of the same coin: growing dependence on foreign \noil.\n  In fact, at the heart of my legislation is the goal of reducing our \nimports of foreign oil to less than 50 percent by the year 2010. While \nit is incredible to me that we have let America slide into greater than \n55 percent dependence today, from the 46 percent dependence we saw in \n1992, nevertheless a goal of producing at least half of our oil needs \nright here in the United States is a laudable and, I believe, an \nachievable one.\n  The core problem with our growing dependence on foreign oil is an \nunderutilized domestic reserve base of both crude oil and natural gas. \nIn 1992, we imported 46 percent of our oil needs from overseas. It is \nequally important to realize that in 1974, when America was brought to \nher knees by the OPEC oil embargo, we imported only 36 percent of our \noil. Today, as I mentioned, we stand at over 55 percent imports. While \nit is true that OPEC controls less, in percentage terms, of the world \noil market than it did in 1974, if the major oil producing countries of \nthe world were ever to get their collective act together, they cold not \nonly wreak havoc with the American economy, they could literally shut \nit down. As the sole remaining superpower in the world, and as the \ncountry with an economy that is the envy of the industrialized world, \nthis threat to our economic as well as our national security is simply \nand totally unacceptable.\n  We simply must take steps today to increase the amount of oil and \nnatural gas we produce right here at home. It is estimated that, in \ntotal, the United States possesses as much as 160 billion barrels of \noil and as many as 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. This is \nenough to fuel the U.S. economy for at least 60 years without importing \na single drop of foreign oil. While shutting-off foreign oil completely \nmay not be realistic, it is realistic to utilize our reserves much more \nthan we do today.\n  Believe it or not, much of this oil and gas could be produced in \nareas where it is being produced today and has for decades that is not \nenvironmentally sensitive. That is why I have advocated for tax \nincentives that would make it economically feasible for production to \ncontinue and actually increase in areas largely where production takes \nplace today. Much of this production is from so-called ``marginal'' \nwells, those wells that produce less than 15 barrels of oil and less \nthan 90 thousand cubic feet of natural gas per day.\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\n  Many of these wells are so small that, once they close, they never \nreopen. There were close to 500,000 such wells across the U.S. \nTogether, they have the capacity to produce 20 percent of America's \noil. This is roughly the same amount of oil the U.S. imports from Saudi \nArabia. During the oil price plummet over two years ago, more than a \nquarter of these wells closed, many of them for good.\n\n  The overwhelming majority of producing wells in Texas are marginal \nwells. A survey by the Independent Producers Association of America, \nIPAA, found that marginal wells account for 75 percent of all crude \nproduction for small independent operators; up to 50 percent for mid-\nsized independents; and up to 20 percent for large companies.\n  A more sensible energy independence policy would be to offer tax \nrelief to producers of these smaller wells that would help them stay in \nbusiness when prices fall below a break-even point. When U.S. producers \ncan stay in business during periods of low prices, supply will be \nhigher and help keep prices from shooting up too high.\n  My legislation provides a maximum $3 per barrel tax credit for the \nfirst 3 barrels of daily production from a marginal oil well, and a \nsimilar credit for marginal gas wells. The marginal oil well credit \nwould be phased in-and-out in equal increments as prices for oil and \nnatural gas fall and rise. For oil, it would phase in between $18 and \n$15 per barrel.\n  A counter-cyclical system such as this would help keep producers \nalive during the record low prices, so they can be producing during the \nrecord highs. This would gradually ease our dependence on overseas oil.\n  There's another benefit to encouraging marginal well production: it \nhas a multiplier effect. In 1997, these low-volume wells generated $314 \nmillion in taxes paid annually to State governments. These revenues are \nsued for State and local schools, highways and other state-funded \nprojects and services.\n  Another idea in my plan is to offer incentives to restart inactive \nwells by offering producers a tax exemption for the costs of doing so. \nThis would ensure greater oil availability and also increase Federal \nand State tax revenues paid by oil producers and energy sector \nemployees. Everyone wins. More jobs, more State and Federal revenue, \nand, most importantly, more domestic oil.\n  Studies and actual results have borne this out. In Texas, a program \nsimilar to this has met with considerable success. Over 6,000 wells \nhave been returned to production, injecting approximately $1.65 billion \ninto the Texas economy each year. We should try this nationwide.\n  We do not have to be at the whim of market forces beyond our control. \nThe only way out, though, is to be part of the price setting process, \nrather than be price takers. To do that, we've got to increase our \ndomestic supply. We have an excellent opportunity to unite around this \nbill, Democrats and Republicans, energy production and energy \nconsumption States.\n  Marginal well tax incentive legislation is a positive, proactive \napproach that I believe can garner a majority of support in Congress \nand that will begin to reverse the slide toward greater and greater \ndependence on foreign oil.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH.

We recognized then, as \nthe sponsors of today's bill do now, that S corporations are a vital \nand growing part of our economy and that our tax law should reflect the \nimportance of these entities and provide tax rules that allow them to \ngrow and compete with a minimum of complexity and a maximum of \nflexibility.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, there were nearly 2.6 \nmillion S corporations in the United States in 1998, up from about \n500,000 in 1980. In fact, S corporations now outnumber both C \ncorporations and partnerships. These are predominantly small businesses \nin the retail and service sectors. Over 92 percent of all S \ncorporations in 1998 reported less than $1 million in assets. Many of \nthese businesses, however, are growing rapidly. These are the kinds of \nbusinesses that make up ``Main Street USA.'' In my home state of Utah, \nover half the corporations have elected Subchapter S treatment.\n  Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted in 1958 to help \nremove tax considerations from small business owners' decisions to \nincorporate. This elective tax treatment has been helpful to millions \nof small businesses over the years, particularly to those just starting \nout. Subchapter S provides entrepreneurs the advantage of corporate \nprotection from liability along with the single level of tax enjoyed by \npartnerships and limited liability companies.\n  However, Subchapter S as enacted and modified over the years contains \na variety of limitations, restrictions, and pitfalls for the unwary. \nAnd, even though some very important improvements have been made over \nthe years, including many first introduced in the 1993 S Corporation \nReform Act I mentioned earlier, more needs to be done to bring the tax \ntreatment of these important businesses into the 21st Century. This is \nwhat our bill today is all about.\n  A May 2001 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nhighlights the importance of small businesses to our economy and points \nout why Congress should do everything possible to make it easier for \nthese entities to get started and grow. The study points out that more \nthan 75 percent of the net new jobs created from 1990 to 1995 occurred \nin small firms, defined as those with fewer than 500 employees. \nMoreover, seven of the ten fastest growing industries have been \ndominated by small businesses in recent years, including the high \ntechnology sector, where small firms employ 38 percent of that \nindustry's workers.\n  In the rural parts of America, the role of small enterprises is even \nmore important. Small businesses account for 90 percent of all rural \nestablishments. In 1998, small companies employed 60 percent of rural \nworkers and provided half of rural payrolls.\n  What do these small businesses, especially those in small-town \nAmerica, most need to grow, to thrive, and even to survive? According \nto the White House Conference on Small Business, two of the most \nimportant issue areas for these enterprises is easier access to capital \nand an easing of the tax burden. The bill we are introducing today \naddresses both of these vital issues.\n  Perhaps the biggest challenge facing all kinds of businesses, but \nespecially smaller ones, is attracting adequate capital. Unfortunately, \nSubchapter S is currently a hindrance, rather than a help, for many \ncorporations facing this challenge. For example, current law allows for \nonly one class of stock for S corporations. Further, S corporations are \nnot allowed currently to issue convertible debt. Nor are they allowed \nto have a non-resident alien as a shareholder. These restrictions all \nlimit the ability of S corporations in attracting capital, which is \nvery often the lifeblood of growing a business.\n  Several of the provisions of the Subchapter S Modernization Act are \ndesigned to alleviate these restrictions on the ways S corporations can \nattract capital. This will help make them more competitive with other \nsmall enterprises doing business in other forms, such as partnerships \nor limited liability companies, that do not face such barriers.\n  Even though electing Subchapter S currently offers much to a small \ncorporation in the way of tax relief, principally because such an \nelection eliminates the corporate level of taxation, S corporations \nstill face some significant tax burdens in the way of potential \npitfalls and tax traps for the unwary. Some of these impediments exist \nin the requirements of elective S corporation status, and others are in \nthe rules governing the day-to-day operations of the\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nentities. In either case, these provisions stifle growth and impede job \ncreation.\n  Most of the sections of the bill we introduce today are dedicated to \neliminating many of these barriers and making it easier for companies \nto elect Subchapter S and to operate in this status once the election \nis made.\n  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 made many important \nchanges to Subchapter S. One of the most significant was the ability \nfor small banks to elect to be S corporations for the first time. This \nopened the door for many small community banks to become more \ncompetitive with other financial institutions operating in their towns \nand neighborhoods. So far, more than 1,400 banks in the U.S. have made \nthe election, which represents about 18 percent of the more than 8,000 \ncommunity banks in the United States.\n\n  According to a survey taken earlier this year by the accounting firm \nGrant Thornton, 3 percent of the remaining community banks plan to \nelect Subchapter S status in 2001, and another 14 percent are \nconsidering the election after this year.\n  The availability of Subchapter S has been a positive development in \nincreasing profitability and competitiveness of many community banks. \nHowever, two problems currently exist. The first is that current law \nincludes several significant hurdles to many small banks in converting \nto S corporation status. These include restrictions on the types and \nnumber of shareholders allowed. The second problem is that some of the \noperating rules under Subchapter S are unduly inflexible, complex, and \nharsh.\n  The bill we introduce today attempts to address many of these \nchallenges by easing the restrictions on the kinds of shareholders who \ncan own S corporation stock and the number of shareholders allowed, as \nwell as relaxing some of the operational rules. These changes are \ndesigned to make it significantly easier for community banks to take \nadvantage of the benefits of Subchapter S.\n  Small businesses are key to the continued growth of our economy and \nto future job creation. The way I see it, it is the job of government \nto see that unnecessary restrictions and barriers to the success of \nthese businesses are removed so that these small enterprises can \nattract capital and function with the maximum of efficiency.\n  Some would argue that S corporations are a relic of the past and that \nnewer, more flexible forms of doing business, such as limited liability \ncompanies, are the business entities of the future. Such a view is a \ngreat distortion of reality. S corporations are a large and growing \npart of our economy. They have served a vital function in our \ncommunities for the past 43 years and will continue to do so. Our tax \nlaws should be overhauled to streamline these rules and make them as \nflexible and easy to work in as possible.\n  The S Corporation Modernization Act enjoys the support of a broad \nrange of associations and trade groups, many of which have worked with \nus in crafting the bill. I want to especially acknowledge the \nassistance of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, \nthe Taxation Section of the American Bar Association, the Independent \nBankers Association of America, and the Utah Bankers Association. These \norganizations contributed time and talent in making recommendations for \nmany of the improvements in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a close look at this bill, and to \nsupport it. Thousands of small and growing businesses in every State \nwill benefit from the improvements included therein. Its enactment will \nlead to an increased ability of these enterprises to attract capital, \nexpand, and create new jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section description of the \nbill and a letter of support from a group of organizations that endorse \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n               Supporters of S Corporation Modernization\n\n       Dear Senators Hatch, Breaux, Lincoln, and Allard: The \n     undersigned organizations, speaking on behalf of many of \n     America's small businesses, want to commend and thank you for \n     sponsoring the S Corporation Modernization Act of 2001. This \n     important legislation will improve capital formation \n     opportunities for small businesses, preserve family-owned \n     businesses, and eliminate unnecessary and unwarranted traps \n     for taxpayers. We want to express our unqualified and \n     enthusiastic support for the entire bill.\n       In 1958, Congress created S corporations to create an \n     effective alternative business structure for private \n     entrepreneurs. Under Subchapter S, if certain requirements \n     and restrictions are met, a business can choose to operate in \n     corporate form without being penalized with a second level of \n     tax. Today, about 2.6 million S corporations operate in \n     virtually every sector and in every State across America. \n     These S corporations employ many Americans and hold over \n     $1.45 trillion in business assets.\n       Though many of these businesses have been successful \n     ventures, the qualifications and restrictions contained in \n     the original Subchapter S rules were very limiting and \n     complex. Over time, Congress has removed some of these \n     restrictions and has made incremental changes to update and \n     improve the Subchapter S rules. Congress last acted in 1996 \n     to pass reforms to make S Corporation rules more compatible \n     with modern-day business demands.\n       Unfortunately today, many of these companies are still \n     burdened by obsolete rules, which stunt expansion, inhibit \n     venture capital attraction, and otherwise impede these \n     businesses from meeting the demands of the challenging global \n     economy. As the domestic economy faces increasing challenges, \n     such restrictions are particularly troubling. For S \n     corporations, which have been a key element in America's \n     economic growth, we can no longer afford to keep such \n     antiquated restrictions in place.\n       Indeed, the need for any of these restrictions is highly \n     doubtful. Over the last decade, all States (with supporting \n     rulings from the IRS) have now enacted statutes creating \n     limited liability companies (LLCs). LLCs operate like S \n     corporations (with limited liability and subject to a single \n     level of tax), but face none of the burdensome and \n     unnecessary restrictions. As a result, new business \n     enterprises are being formed at an accelerating rate under \n     the LLC regime. The Subchapter S Modernization Act of 2001 \n     will go a long way toward lifting these needless burdens on S \n     corporations.\n       For these reasons, we agree with you that it is again time \n     to revisit Subchapter S reform, and we look forward to \n     working with you to enact the S Corporation Modernization Act \n     of 2001. Thank you again for your championship of this \n     important initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Employee-Owned S Corporations \n           of America; S Corporation Association; National \n           Cattleman's Beef Association; Associated General \n           Contractors of America; National Association of \n           Realtors; National Multi Housing Council; National \n           Apartment Association; Small Business Survival \n           Committee; Independent Insurance Agents of America; \n           National Association of Manufacturers; Independent \n           Community Bankers of America; American Bankers \n           Association; Utah Bankers Association; Independent \n           Bankers Association of Texas; Independent Bankers of \n           Colorado; Maine Association of Community Banks; \n           Independent Community Bankers of Minnesota; Community \n           Bankers of Wisconsin; Community Bankers Association of \n           Indiana; Community Bankers Association of Kansas; \n           Bluegrass Bankers Association; The Community Bankers \n           Association of Alabama; Independent Community Bankers \n           of New Mexico; Iowa Independent Bankers; California \n           Independent Bankers; Community Bankers Association of \n           Illinois; Montana Independent Bankers; Missouri \n           Independent Bankers Association; Nebraska Independent \n           Community Bankers; Arkansas Community Bankers; \n           Community Bankers Association of Georgia; Michigan \n           Association of Community Bankers; Community Bankers of \n           Louisiana; Independent Bankers Association of New York; \n           Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers; \n           Independent Community Bankers of South Dakota; \n           Independent Community Bankers of North Dakota; West \n           Virginia Association of Community Bankers; Virginia \n           Association of Community Banks; Community Bankers \n           Association of Oklahoma; Community Bankers Association \n           of New Hampshire.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Subchapter S Modernization Act of 2001--Section-by-Section Description\n\n       The Subchapter S Modernization Act of 2001 includes the \n     following provisions to help improve capital formation \n     opportunities for small business, preserve family-owned \n     businesses, and eliminate unnecessary and unwarranted traps \n     for taxpayers.\n\n\n           Title I--Eligible Shareholders of An S Corporation\n\n     Section 101. Members of family treated as 1 shareholders\n       The Act provides for an election to count family members \n     that are not more than six generations removed from a common \n     ancestor as one shareholder for purposes of the number of \n     shareholder limitation (currently 75 shareholders). The \n     election requires the consent of a majority of all \n     shareholders. The provision helps family-owned S corporations \n     plan for the future without fear of termination of their S \n     corporation elections.\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\n     Section 102. Nonresident aliens allowed to be shareholders\n       The Act would permit nonresident aliens to be S corporation \n     shareholders. To assure collection of the appropriate amount \n     of tax, the Act requires the S corporation to withhold and \n     pay a tax on effectively connected income allocable to its \n     nonresident alien shareholders. The provision enhances an S \n     corporation's ability to expand into international markets \n     and expands an S corporation's access to capital.\n     Section 103. Expansion of bank S corporation eligible \n         shareholders to include IRAs\n       The Act permits Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to \n     hold stock in a bank that is a S corporation. Additionally, \n     the Act would exempt the sale of bank S corporation stock in \n     an IRA from the prohibited transaction rules. Currently, IRAs \n     own community bank stock, which results in a significant \n     obstacle to banks that want to make an S election. The \n     provision allows an IRA to own bank S stock, and thus, avoids \n     transactions to buy back stock, which drains the bank's \n     resources.\n     Section 104. Increase in number of eligible shareholders to \n         150\n       Currently a corporation is not eligible to be an S \n     corporation if it has more than 75 shareholders. The Act \n     increases the number of permitted shareholders to 150. The \n     provision will enable S corporation to raise more capital and \n     plan for the future without endangering their S corporation \n     status.\n\n\n Title II--Qualification and Eligibility Requirements of S Corporations\n\n     Section 201. Issuance of preferred stock permitted\n       The Act would permit S corporations to issue qualified \n     preferred stock (``QPS''). QPS generally would be stock that \n     (i) is not entitled to vote, (ii) is limited and preferred as \n     to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to \n     any significant extent, and (iii) has redemption and \n     liquidation rights which do not exceed the issue price of \n     such stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation \n     premium). Stock would not fail to be treated as QPS merely \n     because it is convertible into other stock. This provision \n     increases access to capital from investors who insist on \n     having a preferential return and facilitates family \n     succession by permitting the older generation of shareholders \n     to relinquish control of the corporation but maintain an \n     equity interest.\n     Section 202. Safe harbor expanded to include convertible debt\n       The Act permits S corporations to issue debt that may be \n     converted into stock of the corporation provided that the \n     terms of the debt are substantially the same as the terms \n     that could have been obtained from an unrelated party. The \n     Act also expands the current law safe-harbor debt provision \n     to permit nonresident alien individuals as creditors. The \n     provision facilitates the raising of investment capital.\n     Section 203. Repeal of excessive passive investment income as \n         a termination event\n       The Act would repeal the rule that an S corporation would \n     lose its S corporation status if it has excess passive income \n     for three consecutive years. A corporate-level ``sting'' (or \n     double) tax would still apply, as modified in Section 204 \n     below, to excess passive income.\n     Section 204. Modifications to passive income rules\n       The Act would increase the threshold for taxing excess \n     passive income from 25 percent to 60 percent (consistent with \n     a Joint Tax Committee recommendation on simplification \n     measures). In addition, the Act removes gains from the sales \n     or exchanges of stock or securities from the definition of \n     passive investment income for purposes of the sting tax.\n     Section 205. Stock basis adjustment for certain charitable \n         contributions\n       Current rules discourage charitable gifts of appreciated \n     property by S corporations. The Act would remedy this problem \n     by providing for an increase in the basis of shareholders' \n     stock in an amount equal to excess of the value of the \n     contributed property over the basis of the property \n     contributed. This provision conforms the S corporation rules \n     to those applicable to charitable contributions by \n     partnerships.\n\n\n           TITLE III--TREATMENT OF S CORPORATION SHAREHOLDERS\n\n     Section 301. Treatment of losses to shareholders\n       In the case of a liquidation of an S corporation, current \n     law can result in double taxation because of a mismatch of \n     ordinary income (realized at the corporate level and passed \n     through to the shareholder) and a capital loss (recognized at \n     the shareholder level on the liquidating distribution). \n     Although careful tax planning can avoid this result, many S \n     corporations do not have the benefit of sophisticated tax \n     advice. The Act eliminates this potential trap by providing \n     that any portion of any loss recognized by an S corporation \n     shareholder on amounts received by the shareholder in a \n     distribution in complete liquidation of the S corporation \n     would be treated as an ordinary loss to the extent of the \n     shareholder's ``ordinary income basis'' in the S corporation \n     stock.\n     Section 302. Transfer of suspended losses incident to divorce\n       The Act allows for the transfer of a pro rata portion of \n     the suspended losses when S corporation stock is transferred, \n     in whole or in part, incident to divorce. Under current IRS \n     regulations, any suspended losses or deductions are personal \n     to the shareholder and cannot, in any manner, be transferred \n     to another person. Accordingly, if a shareholder transfers \n     all of his or her stock in an S corporation to his or her \n     former spouse as a result of divorce, any suspended losses or \n     deductions with respect to such stock are permanently \n     disallowed. This result is inequitable and unduly harsh, and \n     needlessly complicates property settlement negotiations.\n     Section 303. Use of passive activity loss and at-risk amount \n         by qualified subchapter S trust income beneficiaries\n       The Act clarifies that, if a QSST transfers its entire \n     interest in S corporation stock to an unrelated party in a \n     fully taxable transaction, the income beneficiary's suspended \n     losses from S corporation activity under the passive activity \n     loss rules would be freed up for use by the income \n     beneficiary. The Act further provides that the income \n     beneficiary's at-risk amount with respect to S activity would \n     be increased by the amount of gain recognized by the QSST on \n     a disposition of S stock. These provisions clarify a \n     troublesome area under current law, and so, eliminate traps \n     for the unwary taxpayer.\n     Section 304. Deductibility of interest expense incurred by an \n         electing small business trust to acquire S corporation \n         stock\n       The Act provides that interest expense incurred by an ESBT \n     to acquire S corporation stock is deductible by the S portion \n     of the trust. Recently issued proposed regulations would \n     provide that interest expense incurred by an ESBT to acquire \n     stock in an S corporation is allocable to the S portion of \n     the trust, but is not deductible. This result is contrary to \n     the treatment of other taxpayers, who are entitled to deduct \n     interest incurred to acquire an interest in a pass through \n     entity. Further, Congress never intended to place ESBTs at a \n     disadvantage relative to other taxpayers.\n     Section 305. Disregard of unexercised powers of appointments \n         in determining potential current beneficiaries of ESBT\n       The Act revises the definition of a ``potential current \n     beneficiary'' in the context of the ESBT eligibility rules by \n     providing that powers of appointment should only be evaluated \n     when the power is actually exercised. Current law provides \n     that postponed or non-exercisable powers will not interfere \n     with the making of an ESBT election. However, proposed \n     regulations provide that, once such powers become \n     exercisable, the S election will automatically terminate if \n     the power could potentially be exercised in favor of an \n     ineligible individual--whether it was actually exercised in \n     favor of the ineligible individual or not. The application of \n     this rule would prevent many family trusts from qualifying as \n     ESBTs.\n       The Act expands the existing method to cure a potential \n     current beneficiary problem. Under the Act, an ESBT will have \n     a period of up to one year (currently 60 days) to either \n     dispose of all of its S stock or otherwise cause the \n     ineligible potential current beneficiary's position in the \n     trust to be eliminated without causing the ESBT election or \n     the corporation's S election to fail.\n     Section 306. Clarification of electing small business trust \n         distribution rules\n       The Act clarifies that, with regard to ESBT distributions, \n     separate share treatment applies to the S and non-S portions \n     under section 641(c).\n     Section 307. Allowance of charitable contributions deduction \n         for electing small business trusts\n       The Act permits a deduction for charitable contributions \n     made by an ESBT, while taxing the charity on its share of the \n     S corporation's income as unrelated business taxable income. \n     Current law discourages charitable contributions by S \n     corporation shareholders by preventing an ESBT from claiming \n     a charitable contribution deduction. The Act encourages \n     philanthropy by permitting a charitable deduction while at \n     the same time effectively taxing the S corporation's income \n     in the hands of the recipient charity to the extent of the \n     deduction.\n     Section 308. Shareholder basis not increased by income \n         derived from cancellation of S corporation's debt\n       The Act provides that cancellation of indebtedness (COD) \n     income excluded from the gross income of an S corporation, \n     i.e., due to the S corporation's insolvency, does not \n     increase shareholder's basis in S corporation stock. The Act \n     changes the result reached in the recent U.S. Supreme Court \n     decision in Gitlitz v. Comm'r (2000).\n     Section 309. Back-to-back loans as indebtedness.\n       The Act clarifies that a back-to-back loan (a loan made to \n     an S corporation shareholder who in turn loans those funds to \n     his S corporation) constitutes ``indebtedness of the S \n     corporation to the shareholder'' so as to increase such \n     shareholder's basis in the S corporation. The provision would \n     help many shareholders avoid inequitable pitfalls encountered \n     where a loan to an S corporation is not properly structured, \n     even though the shareholder has clearly made an economic \n     outlay with respect to his investment in the S corporation \n     for which a basis increase is appropriate.\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\n       title iv--expansion of s corporation eligibility for banks\n\n     Section 401. Exclusion of investment securities income from \n         passive income test for bank S corporations\n       The Act clarifies that interest and dividends on \n     investments maintained by a bank for liquidity and safety and \n     soundness purposes shall not be ``passive'' income. By \n     treating all bank income as earned from the active and \n     regular conduct of a banking business, banks will no longer \n     face the conundrum of evaluating investment decisions based \n     on tax considerations rather than on more important safety \n     and economic soundness issues.\n     Section 402. Treatment of qualifying director shares\n       The Act clarifies that qualifying director shares of bank \n     are not to be treated as a second class of stock. Instead, \n     the qualifying director shares are treated as a liability of \n     the bank and no increase or loss from the S corporation will \n     be allocated to these qualifying director shares. The \n     provision clarifies the law and removes a significant \n     obstacle unique among banks contemplating a S corporation \n     election.\n     Section 403. Bad debt charge offs in years after election \n         year treated as items of built-in loss\n       The Act permits bank S corporations to recapture up to 100 \n     percent of their bad debt reserves on their first S \n     corporation tax return and/or their last C corporation income \n     tax return prior to the effective date of the S election. \n     Banks that convert to S corporation status must change from \n     the reserve method of accounting to the specific charge off \n     method. The resulting recapture income is treated as built-in \n     gain subject to tax at both the shareholder and the corporate \n     level. The Act allows banks to accelerate the recapture of \n     bad debt reserve to their last C corporation tax year. The \n     corporate level tax would still be paid on the recapture \n     income, but the recapture would no longer trigger a tax for \n     the bank's shareholders.\n\n\n              title v--qualified subchapter s subsidiaries\n\n     Section 501. Relief from inadvertently invalid qualified \n         subchapter S subsidiary elections and terminations\n       The Act provides statutory authority for the Secretary to \n     grant relief for invalid QSub elections, and terminations of \n     QSub status, if the Secretary determines that the \n     circumstances resulting in such ineffectiveness or \n     termination were inadvertent. This would allow the IRS to \n     provide relief in appropriate cases, just as it currently \n     does in the case of invalid or terminated S corporation \n     elections.\n     Section 502. Information returns for qualified subchapter S \n         subsidiaries\n       The Act would help clarify that a Qualified Subchapter S \n     Subsidiary (QSSS) can provide information returns under their \n     own tax ID number to help avoid confusion by employers, \n     depositors, and other parties.\n     Section 503. Treatment of the sale of interest in a qualified \n         subchapter S subsidiary\n       The Act treats the disposition of QSub stock as a sale of \n     the undivided interest in the QSub's assets based on the \n     underlying percentage of stock transferred followed by a \n     deemed contribution by the S corporation and the acquiring \n     party in a nontaxable transaction. Under current law, an S \n     corporation may be required to recognize 100 percent of the \n     gain inherent in a QSub's assets if it sells as little as 21 \n     percent of the QSub's stock. IRS regulations suggest this \n     result can be avoided by merging the QSub into a single \n     member LLC prior to the sale, then selling an interest in the \n     LLC (as opposed to stock in the QSub). The Act achieves this \n     result without any unnecessary merger and thus removes a trap \n     for the unwary.\n     Section 504. Exception to application of step transaction \n         doctrine for restructuring in connection with making \n         qualified subchapter S subsidiary elections\n       The Act provides that the step transaction doctrine does \n     not apply to the deemed liquidation resulting from QSub \n     elections. Application of the step transaction doctrine, in \n     the context of making a QSub election, introduces complexity \n     and uncertainty in what should be a simple matter. The \n     doctrine requires knowledge of decades of jurisprudence and \n     administrative interpretations, and poses an unnecessary trap \n     for the unwary.\n\n\n                    TITLE VI--ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n     Section 601. Elimination of all earnings and profits \n         attributable to pre-1983 years\n       The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 eliminated \n     certain pre-1983 earnings and profits of S corporations that \n     had S corporation status for their first tax year beginning \n     after December 31, 1996. The provision should apply to all \n     corporations  and S) with pre-1983 S earnings and \n     profits without regard to when they elect S status. There \n     seems to be no policy reason why the elimination was \n     restricted to corporations with an S election in effect for \n     their first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1996.\n     Section 602. No gain or loss on deferred intercompany \n         transactions because of conversion to S corporation or \n         qualified S corporation subsidiary\n       The Act makes clear that any gain or income from an \n     intercompany transaction is not taxed at the time of the S \n     corporation or QSub elections.\n     Section 603. Treatment of charitable contribution and foreign \n         tax credit carryforwards\n       The Act provides that charitable contribution carryforwards \n     and other carryforwards arising from a taxable year for which \n     the corporation was a C corporation shall be allowed as a \n     deduction against the net recognized built-in gain of the \n     corporation for the taxable year. This provision is \n     consistent with the legislative history of the 1986 Act.\n     Section 604. Distribution by an S corporation to an employee \n         stock ownership plan\n       An ESOP will usually borrow from the sponsoring corporation \n     to fund its acquisition of employer securities. In the case \n     of a C corporation, the tax code provides that an ESOP will \n     not be treated as engaging in a ``prohibited transaction'' if \n     it uses any ``dividend'' on employer securities purchased \n     with loan proceeds to make payments on the loan regardless of \n     whether such employer securities have been pledged as \n     collateral to secure the loan. The policy facilitates the \n     payment of ESOP loans and thereby promotes employee \n     ownership. Because S corporation distributions are \n     technically not ``dividends'', the Act provides that S \n     corporation distributions are treated as dividends. This \n     clarification is necessary to ensure that the policy of \n     facilitating the payment of ESOP loans applies equally to S \n     corporation and C corporation ESOPs.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch, Lincoln, and Thompson, the Subchapter S \nModernization Act of 2001. This bill is very important to the 2.6 \nmillion S Corporations in this country and to the thousands of S \nCorporations in my own State of Louisiana.\n  The Small Business Administration estimates that small businesses \naccount for seventy-five percent of the employment growth in the United \nSates and are the major creators of new jobs. Small businesses employ \n52 percent of all private workers and provide 51 percent of the output \nin the private sector. They have been, in large part, the engine that \nfuels our economy.\n  S Corporations make up a large number of the Nation's small \nbusinesses. In fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that \nover ninety-two percent of all S Corporations report less than $1 \nmillion in assets. They operate in every sector of the economy, employ \nmillions of Americans and hold over $1.45 trillion in business assets. \nAs such, anything we can do the help S Corporations will help the \neconomy. The Subchapter S Modernization Act does this by encouraging S \nCorporations to expand, allowing S Corporations to attract more \ncapital, and removing tax traps for the unwary.\n  The legislation expands the list of eligible shareholders to non-\nresident aliens and some Individual Retirement Accounts held by banks. \nThe bill also permits families to be treated as one shareholder, which \nnot only expands the size of S corporations, but also helps keep family \nbusinesses together. In additional, the bill increases the number of \npermitted shareholders to 150 from the current law limit of 75.\n  All of these important provisions also give S Corporations greater \nflexibility in attracting new sources of investment and capital. By \npermitting S Corporations to issue preferred stock, the Subchapter S \nModernization Act increases access to capital from investors, such as \nventure capitalists, who insist on a preferential return. This \nprovision also facilitates family ownership by allowing older \ngenerations to relinquish control of the corporation to later \ngenerations while maintaining an equity interest in the company.\n  Lastly, the bill removes many complex tax traps and clarifies the law \nregarding many provisions enacted in 1996. Per the Joint Committee on \nTaxation's recommendation in its simplification report, our bill \nrepeals the excessive passive investment income rule as a termination \nevent for S corporations and increases the threshold for taxing excess \npassive investment income from 25 percent to 60 percent. Capital gains \nare excluded from the definition of passive income. The rules for \ntaxing Electing Small Business Trusts and managing Qualified Subchapter \nS Subsidiaries are simplified in many ways, thus reducing the \npossibility that companies will inadvertently terminate their S \ncorporation election.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today my colleagues and I are \nintroducing legislation which is critically important to millions of \nsmall and family-owned businesses across this Nation. The Subchapter S \nModernization Act of\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n2001 is the culmination of months of hard work by Senators Hatch, \nBreaux and me. We have worked to bring new ideas together with known \nand necessary S corporation reforms into a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation which will help improve capital formation opportunities for \nsmall businesses, will help preserve family-owned businesses, and will \neliminate unnecessary and unwarranted traps for well-intentioned \ntaxpayers.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of commerce in my home State of \nArkansas. There are between sixteen and seventeen thousand small \nbusinesses formed as S corporations in Arkansas and over 2.58 million \nnationwide. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, over ninety-\ntwo percent of these companies have assets totaling less than one \nmillion dollars and a majority are in the retail trade and service \nsectors. These are truly your mom and pop stores and businesses, and I \nam proud to be working on their behalf.\n  This bill represents not just the hard work of the principal sponsors \nbut also of several of my colleagues past and present. I would like, in \nthe short time that I have, to acknowledge the past efforts of former \nSenators Pryor and Danforth, who represented small business S \ncorporations so well and who helped develop many of the provisions we \nhave included in the Subchapter S Modernization Act of 2001. I would \nalso like to recognize Senator Allard, who has joined in sponsoring \nthis legislation, and who has been a lead proponent of S corporation \nreforms which would allow small financial institutions to benefit from \nSubchapter S. And, of course, I would like to thank Senators Thompson, \nGramm, and Thomas who have joined Senator Hatch, Breaux, and me as \noriginal sponsors of what I believe is very good legislation for hard \nworking men and women across this Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 1205. A bill to adjust the boundaries of the Mount Nebo Wilderness \nArea, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mount Nebo \nWilderness Boundary Adjustment Act. This legislation is intended to \ncorrect several small boundary issues that have frustrated Juab County \nand its residents' attempts to maintain their sources of water.\n  Mount Nebo, located in Juab County, UT, is an 11,929 foot peak in the \nWasatch Mountains. The surrounding area is home to bighorn sheep, \nspectacular views of the Great Basin, primitive recreation, and the \nsource of water for many who live and farm around the towns of Nephi \nand Mona, UT. Due to the wilderness characteristics of the lands \nincluding and surrounding Mount Nebo, Congress designated the 28,000 \nacre Mount Nebo Wilderness as part of the Utah Wilderness Act of 1984. \nWhile the United States Forest Service was drawing the maps of the \nnewly designated Mount Nebo Wilderness, nine areas were improperly \nincluded in the wilderness boundaries that contained springs, \npipelines, and other water structures which provide water to the \nresidents of Juab County.\n  Water in the west is truly the lifeblood of the region. Without \nwater, our towns and cities, both large and small, would dry up and \nblow away. Equally important is the ability to maintain springs, \npipelines, and other structures that allow water to be put to \nbeneficial use. The water that flows from the Mount Nebo Wilderness \nprovides irrigation for Juab County farmers, is part of the Nephi City \nculinary water system, and provides water directly to a number of \nresidents who live in close proximity to the wilderness. It should be \nnoted that the water rights for some of these springs were granted as \nearly as 1855 and have been providing water ever since. These pipelines \nand water structures are old and need constant maintenance. Wilderness \nprohibitions do not provide the flexibility needed by the county to \nmaintain its water sources.\n  This legislation would redraw the boundaries of the wilderness area \nto allow motorized access for the county and other affected users in \norder to maintain existing water structures. Because this boundary \nadjustment will result in the removal of lands from the Mount Nebo \nWilderness, the county has identified existing USFS land adjacent to \nthe wilderness to serve as replacement acreage which will result in a \nnet gain of 14 acres of wilderness. I believe this is legislation that \nbenefits all parties. The Forest Service will have a wilderness area \nwith fewer access issues and the counties will be able to maintain \ntheir critical water sources.\n  I am offering a simple piece of legislation that will solve a \nlongstanding problem for one of Utah's counties. I would greatly \nappreciate Senator Bingaman's help in moving this bill through his \ncommittee as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Frist, and Mr. \n        McConnell):\n  S. 1206. A bill to reauthorize the Appalachian Regional Development \nAct of 1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues, \nSenator Bill Frist, Senator James Inhofe, and Senator Mitch McConnell, \nto introduce the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments of \n2001. Once enacted, our bill will reauthorize the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, ARC and create a specific initiative to help bridge the \n``digital divide'' between Appalachia and the rest of our nation.\n  One of the honors that I have as a United States Senator is to serve \nas a member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. One of the reasons I am \npleased to be on this subcommittee is the fact that it has oversight \njurisdiction over the ARC. As a Senator who represents one of the \nthirteen States within the ARC, my membership on this subcommittee \ngives me a great opportunity to focus on issues of direct importance to \nthis region of our Nation.\n  In 1965, Congress established the ARC to help bring the Appalachian \nregion of our Nation into the mainstream of the American economy. This \nregion includes 406 counties in 13 States, including Ohio, and has a \npopulation of about 22 million people.\n  The ARC is composed of the governors of the 13 Appalachian states and \na Federal representative who is appointed by the President. The Federal \nrepresentative serves as the Federal Co-Chairman with the governors \nelecting one of their number to serve as the States' Co-Chairman. As a \nunique partnership between the Federal Government and these 13 States, \nthe ARC runs programs in a wide range of activities, including highway \nconstruction, education and training, health care, housing, enterprise \ndevelopment, export promotion, telecommunications and technology, and \nwater and sewer infrastructure. All of these activities help achieve a \ngoal of a viable and self-sustaining regional economy.\n  ARC's programs fall into two broad categories. The first is a 3,025-\nmile corridor highway system to break the regional isolation created by \nmountainous terrain, thereby linking the Appalachian communities to \nnational and international markets. Roughly 80 percent of the \nAppalachian Development Highway System is either completed or under \nconstruction.\n  The second is an area development program to create a basis for \nsustained local economic growth. Ranging from water and sewer \ninfrastructure to worker training to business financing and community \nleadership development, these projects provide Appalachian communities \nwith the critical building blocks for future growth and development. \nThe sweeping range of options allows governors and local officials to \ntailor the federal assistance to their individual needs.\n  The ARC currently ranks all of the 406 counties in the Appalachian \nregion, including the 29 counties in Ohio that are covered by the ARC, \naccording to four categories: distressed, transitional, competitive, \nand attainment. These categories determine the extent for potential ARC \nsupport for specific projects. They also help ensure that support goes \nto the areas with the greatest need. Distressed countries are the most \n``at-risk,'' with unemployment at least 150 percent of the national \naverage, a poverty rate of at least 150 percent of the national \naverage, and a per capita market income of\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\nno more than two-thirds of the national average. Generally, this means \nthat a distressed county has an unemployment rate of greater than 7.4 \npercent, a poverty rate of at least 19.7 percent, and a per capita \nincome of less than $14,164. In fiscal year 2001, 114 counties, or \nroughly one-fourth of the counties in the ARC, have been classified as \ndistressed. Ten of these counties are in Ohio.\n  In order to undertake a wide variety of projects to help improve the \nregion's economy, the ARC uses the Federal dollars it receives to \nleverage additional State and local funding. This successful \npartnership enables communities in Ohio and throughout Appalachia to \nhave programs which help them to respond to a variety of grassroots \nneeds. In Ohio, ARC funds support projects in five goal areas: skills \nand knowledge, physical infrastructure, community capacity, dynamic \nlocal economies, and health care. In rough figures, every ARC dollar \nOhio received in fiscal year 2000 leveraged approximately $2.60 in \nadditional federal, state and local funds. In fiscal year 2000, ARC \nprovided approximately $4.7 million to fund non-highway projects in \nOhio.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the current authorization of the ARC will \nsoon expire. In anticipation of the need for reauthorization \nlegislation, I have been working since last year on putting together a \nbill that focuses on the issues that the ARC needs to address in the \nearly part of the 21st century. One of the more productive activities I \ndid in preparation for reauthorization was to conduct a Transportation \nand Infrastructure Subcommittee field hearing on the ARC at the Opera \nHouse in Nelsonville, OH, in August 2000. Following the hearing, I had \nthe opportunity to tour the region to witness first-hand the beneficial \nimpact of ARC-funded projects in the community.\n  My objectives for both the field hearing and the tour were to obtain \nan overview of the importance of ARC programs to Appalachia, to closely \nexamine the progress that has been made with respect to the \nimplementation of these programs, and to identify the challenges that \nstill must be overcome for the region to fully participate in our \nNation's economy. Along with the poignant visual impact of my tour, the \ntestimony I received from the impressive array of witnesses at this \nhearing provided valuable input that has been very helpful in drafting \nthis legislation.\n  Our legislation, the Appalachian Regional Development Act Amendments \nof 2001, would allow the ARC to continue its important work for the \npeople of Appalachia. One of the most innovative aspects of our bill \nwould establish a Telecommunications and Technology Initiative that \nwould focus on providing training in new technologies; assisting local \ngovernments, businesses, schools, and hospitals in developing e-\ncommerce networks; and creating more jobs and business opportunities \nthough access to telecommunications infrastructure.\n  E-commerce is one of the largest factors driving our economy and any \nbusiness that wants to successfully compete in today's technological \nrevolution must have access to the Internet. By establishing a specific \ninitiative under the ARC to help the people of Appalachia connect with \ntoday's technology, we are also helping Appalachian communities achieve \nthe same quality of life that is available to the rest of the Nation.\n  The bill also would increase the percentage of ARC funds required to \nbe spent on activities or projects that benefit distressed counties or \narea. Right now, the requirement is set at 30 percent, and under our \nbill, it would increase to 50 percent. An analysis of fiscal year 1999 \nand 2000 shows that the ARC already spends about half of its project \nfunding on grants to Appalachia's poorest counties, therefore this \nprovision simply codifies current practice.\n  In addition, the bill would establish the ARC as the lead Federal \nagency in coordinating the economic development programs carried out by \nFederal agencies in the region through the establishment of an \nInteragency Coordinating Council on Appalachia. The Council would be \nestablished by the President and its membership composed of \nrepresentatives of the Federal agencies that carry out economic \ndevelopment programs in the region.\n  The bill also would change the non-federal match requirement for \nadministrative grants to the region's Local Development Districts from \n50 percent to 25 percent for those Local Development Districts which \ninclude all or part of at least one distressed county. Local \nDevelopment Districts are multi-county economic development planning \nagencies that work with local governments, non-profit organizations, \nand the private sector to determine local economic development needs \nand provide professional guidance for local economic development \nstrategies. There are 71 Local Development Districts working with ARC \nin Appalachia.\n\n  Additionally, the bill would authorize annual appropriations for the \nARC for five years, beginning with $83 million in fiscal year 2002 and \nincreasing by $3 million in each of fiscal years 2003 through 2006. Of \nthe authorized amount, $10 million would be earmarked each fiscal year \nfor the Telecommunications and Technology Initiative.\n  For more than 35 years, the ARC has had a dramatic impact on the \nlives of the men and women who live in the Appalachian region of our \nNation, helping to cut the region's poverty rate in half, lowering the \ninfant mortality rate by two-thirds, doubling the percentage of high \nschool graduates to where it is now slightly above the national \naverage, slowing the region's out-migration, reducing unemployment \nrates, and narrowing the per capita income gap between Appalachia and \nthe rest of the United States.\n  Despite its successes to date, the ARC has not completed its mission \nin Appalachia. I know that there is a vast reserve of potential in \nAppalachia that is just waiting to be tapped, and I wholeheartedly \nagree with one of ARC's guiding principles that the most valuable \ninvestment that can be made in a region is in its people.\n  The ARC is the type of Federal initiative that we should be \nencouraging. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation, and I urge its speedy consideration by the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1206\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachian Regional \n     Development Act Amendments of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Albuquerque, New \nMexico, metropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and honor that \nI\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nrise today to introduce a bill to create a National Veterans Cemetery \nin Albuquerque, NM.\n  The men and women who have served in the United States Armed Forces \nhave made immeasurable sacrifices to this great Nation. Veterans have \nsecured liberty for citizens of the United States since time and \nimmemorial. Their sacrifices and those of their families must not be \nforgotten.\n  These veterans deserve to be buried in a National Cemetery with their \nfellow comrades. However, the Santa Fe National Cemetery, which serves \nthe Northern two thirds of New Mexico, is rapidly approaching maximum \ncapacity.\n  Some years ago, the Senate passed my legislation to extend the useful \nlife of the Santa Fe National Cemetery by authorizing the use of flat \ngrave markers. However, that legislation was a temporary measure, \nrather than a solution since the Cemetery will lack sufficient plot \nspace by 2008. The solution that I am seeking is to designate a new \nNational Cemetery in Albuquerque, NM.\n  I believe all New Mexicans are proud of the Santa Fe National \nCemetery. Since its humble beginnings, it has grown from 39/100 of an \nacre to its current 77 acres.\n  The cemetery first opened in 1868 and was designated a National \nCemetery in April of 1875. Service men and women from all of our \nNation's wars hold an honored spot within its hallowed ground.\n  With that proud history in mind, we must find another suitable site \nto serve as the last resting place for New Mexico's veterans.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Heather Wilson for bringing this \nimportant issue to my attention, and for introducing companion \nlegislation earlier this year.\n  The need to begin planning soon cannot be overstated. Half of New \nMexico's 180,000 veterans live in the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area. \nInterment rates continue to rise with the passing of our older veterans \nand will peak in 2008.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today to create a National \nVeterans Cemetery in Albuquerque, NM.\n  The bill simply directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a National Cemetery in the Albuquerque metropolitan area and \nto submit a report to Congress setting forth a schedule for \nestablishing the Cemetery.\n  In conclusion I would ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CEMETERY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Albuquerque, New \n     Mexico, metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and \n     their families.\n       (b) Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report that sets forth a schedule for the establishment of \n     the national cemetery under subsection (a) and an estimate of \n     the costs associated with the establishment of the national \n     cemetery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1208. A bill to combat the trafficking, distribution, and abuse of \nEcstasy (and other club drugs) in the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nSenators Grassley, Lieberman, Durbin, Landrieu, and Clinton, to \nintroduce the Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001; legislation to combat the \nrecent rise in trafficking, distribution and violence associated with \nMDMA, a club drug commonly known as Ecstasy. Ecstasy has become the \n``feel good'' drug of choice among many of our young people, and drug \npushers are marketing it as a ``friendly'' drug to mostly teenagers and \nyoung adults.\n  Last year I sponsored and Congress passed legislation which drew \nattention to the dangers of Ecstasy and strengthened the penalties \nattached to trafficking in Ecstasy and other ``club drugs.'' Since \nthen, Ecstasy use and trafficking continue to grow at epidemic \nproportions, and there are many accounts of deaths and permanent damage \nto the health of those who use Ecstasy. The U.S. Customs Service \ncontinues to report large increases in Ecstasy seizures, over 9 million \npills were seized by Customs last year, a dramatic rise from the \n400,000 seized in 1997. According to the United States Customs Service, \nin Fiscal Year 2001, two individual seizures affected by Customs \nInspectors in Miami, FL totaled approximately 422,000 ecstasy tablets. \nThese two seizures alone exceeded the entire amount of ecstasy seized \nby the Customs Service in all of Fiscal Year 1997. The Deputy Director \nof Office of National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, Dr. Donald Vereen, \nJr., M.D., M.P.H., recently said that ``Ecstasy is one of the most \nproblematic drugs that has emerged in recent years.'' The National Drug \nIntelligence Center, in its most recent publication ``Threat Assessment \n2001,'' has noted that ``no drug in the Other Dangerous Drugs Category \nrepresents a more immediate threat than MDMA'' or Ecstasy.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy's Year 2000 Annual Report \non the National Drug Control Strategy clearly states that the use of \nEcstasy is on the rise in the United States, particularly among \nteenagers and young professionals. My State of Florida has been \nparticularly hard hit by this plague, but so have the States of many of \nmy colleagues here. Ecstasy is customarily sold and consumed at \n``raves,'' which are semi-clandestine, all-night parties and concerts. \nNumerous data also reflect the increasing availability of ecstasy in \nmetropolitan centers and suburban communities. In the most recent \nrelease of Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse Mid-year 2000, which \nfeatured MDMA and club drugs, it was reported that the sale and use of \nclub drugs have expanded from raves and nightclubs to high schools, \nstreets, neighborhoods and other open venues.\n  Not only has the use of Ecstasy exploded, more than doubling among \n12th graders in the last two years, but it has also spread well beyond \nits origin as a party drug for affluent white suburban teenagers to \nvirtually every ethnic and class group, and from big cities like New \nYork and Los Angeles to rural Vermont and South Dakota.\n\n  And now, this year, law enforcement officials say they are seeing \nanother worrisome development, increasingly violent turf wars among \nEcstasy dealers, and some of those dealers are our young people. \nHomicides linked to Ecstasy dealing have occurred in recent months in \nNorfolk, VA; Elgin, IL, near Chicago; and in Valley Stream, NY. Police \nsuspect Ecstasy in other murders in the suburbs, of Washington, DC, and \nLos Angeles, and violence is being linked to Israeli drug dealers in \nLos Angeles and to organized crime in New York City. Ecstasy is also \nbecoming widely available on the Internet. Last year, a man arrested in \nOrlando, FL, had been selling Ecstasy to customers in New York.\n  The lucrative nature of Ecstasy encourages its importation. \nProduction costs are as low as two to twenty-five cents per dose while \nretail prices in the U.S. range from twenty dollars to $45 per dose. \nManufactured mostly in Europe, in nations such as the Netherlands, \nBelgium, and Spain where pill presses are not controlled as they are in \nthe U.S., ecstasy has erased all of the old routes law enforcement has \nmapped out for the smuggling of traditional drugs. And now the trade is \nbeing promoted by organized criminal elements, both from abroad and \nhere. Although Israeli and Russian groups dominate MDMA smuggling, the \ninvolvement of domestic groups appears to be increasing. Criminal \ngroups based in Chicago, Phoenix, Texas, and Florida have reportedly \nsecured their own sources of supply in Europe.\n  Young Americans are being lulled into a belief that ecstasy, and \nother designer drugs are ``safe'' ways to get high, escape reality, and \nenhance intimacy in personal relationships. The drug traffickers make \ntheir living off of perpetuating and exploiting this myth.\n  I want to be perfectly clear in stating that ecstasy is an extremely \ndangerous drug. In my State alone, between July and December of last \nyear, there were 25 deaths in which MDMA or a variant\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\nwere listed as a cause of death, and there were another 25 deaths where \nMDMA was present in the toxicology, although not actually listed as the \ncause of death. This drug is a definite killer.\n  The ``Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001'' renews and enhances our \ncommitment toward fighting the proliferation and trafficking of Ecstasy \nand other club drugs. It builds on last year's Ecstasy Anti-\nProliferation Act of 2000 and provides legislation to assist the \nFederal and local organizations that are fighting to stop this \npotentially life-threatening drug. This legislation will allot funding \nfor programs that will educate law enforcement officials and young \npeople and will assist community-based anti-drug efforts. To that end, \nthis bill amends Section 506B(c) of title V of the Public Health \nService Act, by adding that priority of funding should be given to \ncommunities that have taken measures to combat club drug trafficking \nand use, to include passing ordinances and increasing law enforcement \non Ecstasy.\n  The bill also provides money for the National Institute on Drug Abuse \nto conduct research and evaluate the effects that MDMA or Ecstasy has \non an individual's health. And, because there is a fear that the lack \nof current drug tests ability to screen for Ecstasy may encourage \nEcstasy use over other drugs, the bill directs ONDCP to commission a \ntest for Ecstasy that meets the standards of and can be used in the \nFederal Workplace.\n\n  Through this campaign, our hope is that Ecstasy will soon go the way \nof crack, which saw a dramatic reduction in the quantities present on \nour streets after information of its unpredictable impurities and side \neffects were made known to a wide audience. By using this educational \neffort we hope to avoid future deaths and ruined lives.\n  The Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2000 can only help in our fight against \ndrug abuse in the United States. Customs is working hard to stem the \nflow of Ecstasy into our country. As legislators we have a \nresponsibility to stop the proliferation of this potentially life \nthreatening drug. The Ecstasy Prevention Act of 2001 will assist the \nFederal and local agencies charged to fight drug abuse by raising the \npublic profile on the substance-abuse challenge posed by the increasing \navailability and use of Ecstasy and by focusing on the serious danger \nit presents to our youth.\n  We urge our colleagues in the Senate to join us in this important \neffort by co-sponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Bingaman (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Torricelli, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 1209. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to consolidate and \nimprove the trade adjustment assistance programs, to provide community-\nbased economic development assistance for trade-affected communities, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for Workers, Farmers, Communities, and Firms Act \nof 2001, and would like to add Senators Baucus, Daschle, Conrad, \nRockefeller, Kerry, Torricelli, Jeffords, Lincoln, Breaux, Bayh, \nDayton, and Lieberman as original co-sponsors.\n  This legislation represents the culmination of almost two years of \neffort, including discussions with individuals who process or receive \ntrade adjustment assistance, conversations with labor and trade policy \nexperts, consultations with the Department of Labor, requests for \nstudies from the General Accounting Office, and dialogue between my \ncolleagues in the Senate. The legislation is extremely important, as it \ndirectly addresses the question of how Congress will assist those \nworkers and communities negatively impacted by international trade. It \nis also long overdue, as Congress--the Senate in particular--has \ndiscussed reform of the trade adjustment assistance programs for a \nnumber of years. The last revision of the trade adjustment assistance \nprograms occurred when NAFTA was passed, and we only added to the \nprograms at that time, we did not make them compatible in any tangible \nway. I believe it is time to act, and I think we have a unique \nopportunity to act in that there is interest both in Congress and the \nAdministration to improve the trade adjustment assistance programs in a \nfundamental and a beneficial way.\n  Let me give some background on trade adjustment assistance, and why I \nfeel it is so important to address at this time.\n  In 1962, when the Trade Expansion Act was being considered in \nCongress, the Kennedy Administration established a basic rule \nconcerning international trade as it applies to American workers. When \nsomeone loses their job as a result of trade agreements entered into by \nthe U.S. government, we have an obligation to assist these Americans in \nfinding new employment. It is a very straightforward proposition \nreally. If you lose your job because of U.S. trade policy, the Federal \nGovernment should help you in your effort to get a job in a competitive \nindustry at a wage equivalent to what you are making now. While I \nbelieve the United States should be committed to expanding the \ninternational trading system, I also believe we should help our workers \nget back on their feet when they are harmed by trade agreements.\n  I find this proposition to be reasonable, appropriate, and fair. It \nsuggests that the U.S. government supports an open, multilateral \ntrading system, but recognizes that it is responsible for the negative \nimpacts this policy has on its citizens. It suggests that the U.S. \ngovernment believes that an open trading system provides long-term \nadvantages for the United States and its people, but the short-terms \ncosts must be addressed if the policy is to continue and the United \nStates is to remain competitive. It suggests that there is a collective \ninterest that must be pursued by the United States in the international \ntrading system, but that our individual and community interests must be \nsimultaneously protected for the greater good of our country.\n  This commitment to American workers has continued over the years--\nthrough both Democratic and Republican administrations and Congresses--\nand I am convinced the Trade Adjustment Assistance program should be \nboth solidified and expanded at this time. I say this for two reasons.\n  First, as I have stated above, because from where I stand American \nworkers and communities deserve some tangible help from the competitive \npressures of the international trading system. We cannot stand by and \npretend that there is not a need to assist workers and communities \nadjust to the dramatic changes that are now occurring as a result of \nglobalization. Trade adjustment assistance will help do this.\n  Second, as a practical matter, passage of stronger trade adjustment \nassistance legislation will allow us to intensively pursue \ninternational trade negotiations and focus on important issues like \nliberalization, transparency, access, inequality, and poverty in the \ninternational economy. If we support programs like Trade Adjustment \nAssistance--programs that empower American workers, that raise living \nstandards, and that advance the prospects of everyone in our country--\nthen we open the possibility for more comprehensive and beneficial \ninternational trade agreements. We must understand that globalization \nis inevitable, and over time will only move at an even more rapid pace. \nThe question for us in this chamber is not whether we can stop it--we \ncannot--but how we can manage it to benefit the national interest of \nthe United States. Trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and \ncommunities will help do this.\n  There is no denying that globalization is a double-edged sword. But \nwhile there are obvious benefits that come from a more open and \ninterdependent trading system, we cannot ignore the problems that come \nas a result. In my State of New Mexico we have seen a number of plant \nclosings and lay-offs, including some in my own home town of Silver \nCity. These people cannot simply go across the street and look for new \nwork. They are people who have been dedicated to their companies and \nhave played by the rules over the years. When I talk to these people, \nthey ask me: Where am I supposed to work now? Where do I find a job \nwith a salary that allows me to support a family, own a house, put food \non the table, and live a decent life?\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nWhere are the benefits of free trade for me now that my company has \ngone overseas?\n  These are hard questions, especially given their current situation. \nBut my answer is that they deserve an opportunity to get income support \nand re-training to rebuild their lives. They deserve a program that \ncreates skills that are needed, that moves them into new jobs faster, \nthat provides opportunities for the future, that keeps families and \ncommunities intact. They deserve the recognition that they are \nimportant, and that through training they can continue to contribute to \nthe economic welfare of the United States.\n  Trade adjustment assistance offers the potential for this outcome. \nOver the years it has consistently helped workers across the United \nStates deal with the transition that is an inevitable part of a \nchanging international economic system. It helps people that can work \nand want to work to train for productive jobs that contribute to the \neconomic strength of their communities and our country. Although TAA \nhas not been without its flaws, it remains the only program we have \nthat allows workers and companies to adjust and remain competitive. \nWithout it, in my opinion, we are saying unequivocally that we don't \ncare what happens to you, that we bear no responsibility for the \nposition that you are in, that you are on your own. We can't do that. \nWe have made a promise to workers in every administration, both \nDemocrat and Republican, and we should continue to do so.\n\n  As we wrote this legislation, we kept a number of fundamental \nobjectives in mind:\n  First, we wanted to combine existing trade adjustment assistance \nprograms and harmonize their various requirements so they would provide \nmore effective and efficient results for individuals and communities. \nIn doing so, we wanted to provide allowances, training, job search, \nrelocation, and support service assistance to secondary workers and \nworkers affected by shifts in production. We also ensured that the \nState-based delivery system created through the Workforce Investment \nAct remained intact but tightened the program so response times to lay-\noffs and trade adjustment assistance applications would quicker.\n  Second, we wanted to recognize the direct correlation between job \ndislocation, job training, and economic development, especially in \ncommunities that have been hit hard by unemployment. In the past, trade \nadjustment assistance focused specifically on individual re-training, \nbut it did not address the possibility that unemployment might be so \nhigh in a community that jobs were not available for an individual \nafter they had completed a training program. To rectify this problem, \nwe have created a community trade adjustment assistance program, \ndesigned to provide strategic planning assistance and economic \ndevelopment funding to those communities that need it the most. In \ndoing so, we have emphasized the responsibility of regional and local \nagencies and organizations to create a community-based recovery plan \nand activate a response designed to alleviate economic problems in \ntheir region, and to establish stakeholder partnerships in the \ncommunity that enhance competitiveness through workforce development, \nspecific business needs, education reform, and economic development.\n  Third, we wanted to encourage greater cooperation between Federal, \nregional, and local agencies that deal with individuals receiving trade \nadjustment assistance. At present, individuals that are receiving trade \nadjustment assistance obtain counseling from one-stop shops in their \nregion, but typically this is limited to information related to \nallowances and training. Not available is the other information \nconcerning funds available through other Federal departments and \nagencies, such as health care for individuals and their families. To \nprevent the creation of duplicative programs and to use the funds that \nare currently available, we have asked that an inter-agency working \ngroup on trade adjustment assistance be created and that a inter-agency \ndatabase on Federal, State, and local resources available to TAA \nrecipients be established.\n  Fourth, we wanted to establish accountability in the trade adjustment \nassistance program. In the past, data concerning trade adjustment \nassistance has been collected, but not in a uniform fashion across all \nStates and regions. The Department of Labor and the General Accounting \nOffice have done their best to obtain data that allow us to evaluate \nprograms and measure outcomes, and we have used this data in writing \nthis bill. In the future, however, we need to ensure that Congress has \nthe information needed that will allow us to make targeted reforms.\n  Finally, we wanted to help family farmers. At present, trade \nadjustment assistance is available for employees of agricultural firms, \nthe reason being that firms have individuals that can become \nunemployed. Family farmers, however, are not in this position. For \nthem, there is no way to become unemployed, and therefore, no way for \nthem to become eligible for trade adjustment assistance.\n  This legislation improves upon the current system in a number of \nways. As I mentioned above, for the first time Congress will establish \na two-tier system for trade adjustment assistance, recognizing that \ntrade can adversely affect both individuals and communities.\n  For individuals, the legislation: harmonizes TAA and NAFTA/TAA across \nthe board as it relates to eligibility requirements, certification time \nperiods, and training enrollment discrepancies, making it one coherent, \ncomprehensive program; extends TAA benefits to all secondary workers \nand all workers affected by shifts in production; increases TAA \nbenefits so allowances and training are both available for a 78 week \nperiod; provides relocation and job search allowances to TAA \nrecipients; provides support services for individuals, including child-\ncare and dependent-care; increases the time frame available for breaks \nin training to 30 days; allows individuals who return to work to \nreceive training funds for up to 26 weeks; entitles individual \ncertified under trade adjustment assistance program to training, and \ncaps total training program funding at $300m per year; establishes \nsliding scale wage insurance program at the Department of Labor; \nrequires detailed data on program performance by States and Department \nof Labor, plus regular Department of Labor report on efficacy of \nprogram to Congress; establishes inter-agency group to coordinate \nFederal assistance to individuals and communities; allows individual \neligible for trade adjustment assistance program a tax credit of 50% on \namount paid for continuation of health care coverage premiums; requires \nthe General Accounting Office to conduct a study of all assistance \navailable from Federal Government for workers facing job loss and \neconomic distress; requires States to conduct a study of all assistance \navailable from Federal Government for workers facing job loss and \neconomic distress; provides States with grants not to exceed $50,000 to \nconduct such study; requires General Accounting Office and States to \nsubmit reports to Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means \nCommittee within one year of enactment of this Act; establishes that \nthe Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee can \nby resolution direct the Secretary to initiate a certification process \ncovering any group of workers.\n\n  For communities, the legislation: establishes Office of Community \nEconomic Adjustment (OCEA) at Commerce; establishes inter-agency group \nto coordinate Federal assistance to communities; establishes community \neconomic adjustment advisors to provide technical assistance to \ncommunities and act as liaison between community and Federal government \nconcerning strategic planning and funding; provides funding for \nstrategic planning; provides funding for community economic adjustment \nefforts; responds to the criticism contained in several reports and \ncreates a series of performance benchmarks and reporting requirements, \nall of which will allow us to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of \nthe program.\n  For companies, the legislation: re-authorizes TAA for firms program.\n  For Farmers, Ranchers, and Fishermen, the legislation: establishes \nspecial provisions that allow TAA to cover family farmers, ranchers, \nand fishermen.\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\n  Let me conclude by saying that I consider the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program to be a commitment between our government and the \nAmerican people. It is the only program designed to help American \nworkers cope with the changes that occur as a result of international \ntrade. Current legislation expires on September 30th of this year, and \nit is time to do something more than a simple reauthorization. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7969-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 137--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n           COUNSEL IN JOHN HOFFMAN, ET AL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 137 submitted earlier today by \nthe majority leader and the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by Title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 137) to authorize representation by \n     the Senate Legal Counsel in John Hoffman, et al. v. James \n     Jeffords.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, two Republican voters in Pennsylvania \nhave commenced a civil action against Senator Jeffords in federal \ndistrict court in the District of Colombia to challenge Senator \nJeffords' recent decision to become an Independent and to caucus with \nthe Democratic party for organizational purposes within the Senate. \nSpecifically, this lawsuit seeks ``to assert the invalidity of Senator \nJeffords change of party by mere announcement'' and requests a court \norder requiring Senator Jeffords ``to reinstate his status as a \nRepublican Senator'' particularly ``during the Senate polling and \ncaucusing of its members.''\n  Through this action, the plaintiffs seek to subject to judicial \ncontrol a Senator's choice of with which Senators to caucus, as well as \nthe process by which the Senate chooses its officers and the chairs of \nits committees. This attempt to question a Senator in court about the \nperformance of his legislative responsibilities in the Senate is barred \nby the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, which commits such \noversight of Senators to the electorate, not to the judiciary. This \nsuit also runs afoul of the clauses of the Constitution that commit to \neach House of Congress the responsibility to elect officers and \ndetermine the rules of its proceedings.\n  Because this suit seeks to challenge the validity of actions taken by \nSenator Jeffords in his official capacity, representation in this case \nfalls appropriately within the Senator Legal Counsel's statutory \nresponsibility. This resolution would accordingly authorize the Senate \nLegal Counsel to represent Senator Jeffords to present to the Court the \nconstitutional bases for dismissing this suit.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc, and any statements related thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 89, S. 180.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudan Peace Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Sudan has intensified its prosecution \n     of the war against areas outside of its control, which has \n     already cost more than 2,000,000 lives and has displaced more \n     than 4,000,000.\n       (2) A viable, comprehensive, and internationally sponsored \n     peace process, protected from manipulation, presents the best \n     chance for a permanent resolution of the war, protection of \n     human rights, and a self-sustaining Sudan.\n       (3) Continued strengthening and reform of humanitarian \n     relief operations in Sudan is an essential element in the \n     effort to bring an end to the war.\n       (4) Continued leadership by the United States is critical.\n       (5) Regardless of the future political status of the areas \n     of Sudan outside of the control of the Government of Sudan, \n     the absence of credible civil authority and institutions is a \n     major impediment to achieving self-sustenance by the Sudanese \n     people and to meaningful progress toward a viable peace \n     process.\n       (6) Through manipulation of traditional rivalries among \n     peoples in areas outside their full control, the Government \n     of Sudan has effectively used divide and conquer techniques \n     to subjugate their population, and internationally sponsored \n     reconciliation efforts have played a critical role in \n     reducing the tactic's effectiveness and human suffering.\n       (7) The Government of Sudan is utilizing and organizing \n     militias, Popular Defense Forces, and other irregular units \n     for raiding and slaving parties in areas outside of the \n     control of the Government of Sudan in an effort to severely \n     disrupt the ability of those populations to sustain \n     themselves. The tactic is in addition to the overt use of \n     bans on air transport relief flights in prosecuting the war \n     through selective starvation and to minimize the Government \n     of Sudan's accountability internationally.\n       (8) The Government of Sudan has repeatedly stated that it \n     intends to use the expected proceeds from future oil sales to \n     increase the tempo and lethality of the war against the areas \n     outside its control.\n       (9) Through its power to veto plans for air transport \n     flights under the United Nations relief operation, Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the Government of Sudan has been able \n     to manipulate the receipt of food aid by the Sudanese people \n     from the United States and other donor countries as a \n     devastating weapon of war in the ongoing effort by the \n     Government of Sudan to subdue areas of Sudan outside of the \n     Government's control.\n       (10) The efforts of the United States and other donors in \n     delivering relief and assistance through means outside OLS \n     have played a critical role in addressing the deficiencies in \n     OLS and offset the Government of Sudan's manipulation of food \n     donations to advantage in the civil war in Sudan.\n       (11) While the immediate needs of selected areas in Sudan \n     facing starvation have been addressed in the near term, the \n     population in areas of Sudan outside of the control of the \n     Government of Sudan are still in danger of extreme disruption \n     of their ability to sustain themselves.\n       (12) The Nuba Mountains and many areas in Bahr al Ghazal, \n     Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions have been excluded \n     completely from relief distribution by OLS, consequently \n     placing their populations at increased risk of famine.\n       (13) At a cost which has sometimes exceeded $1,000,000 per \n     day, and with a primary focus on providing only for the \n     immediate food needs of the recipients, the current \n     international relief operations are neither sustainable nor \n     desirable in the long term.\n       (14) The ability of populations to defend themselves \n     against attack in areas outside the Government of Sudan's \n     control has been severely compromised by the disengagement of \n     the front-line sponsor states, fostering the belief within \n     officials of the Government of Sudan that success on the \n     battlefield can be achieved.\n       (15) The United States should use all means of pressure \n     available to facilitate a comprehensive solution to the war \n     in Sudan, including--\n       (A) the multilateralization of economic and diplomatic \n     tools to compel the Government of Sudan to enter into a good \n     faith peace process;\n       (B) the support or creation of viable democratic civil \n     authority and institutions in areas of Sudan outside \n     government control;\n       (C) continued active support of people-to-people \n     reconciliation mechanisms and efforts in areas outside of \n     government control;\n       (D) the strengthening of the mechanisms to provide \n     humanitarian relief to those areas; and\n       (E) cooperation among the trading partners of the United \n     States and within multilateral institutions toward those \n     ends.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Government of sudan.--The term ``Government of Sudan'' \n     means the National Islamic Front government in Khartoum, \n     Sudan.\n       (2) OLS.--The term ``OLS'' means the United Nations relief \n     operation carried out by UNICEF, the World Food Program, and \n     participating relief organizations known as ``Operation \n     Lifeline Sudan''.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDEMNATION OF SLAVERY, OTHER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, \n                   AND TACTICS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN.\n\n       Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns--\n       (A) violations of human rights on all sides of the conflict \n     in Sudan;\n       (B) the Government of Sudan's overall human rights record, \n     with regard to both the prosecution of the war and the denial \n     of basic human and political rights to all Sudanese;\n       (C) the ongoing slave trade in Sudan and the role of the \n     Government of Sudan in abetting and tolerating the practice; \n     and\n       (D) the Government of Sudan's use and organization of \n     ``murahalliin'' or ``mujahadeen'', Popular Defense Forces \n     (PDF), and regular Sudanese Army units into organized and \n     coordinated raiding and slaving parties in Bahr al Ghazal, \n     the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile regions; and\n       (2) recognizes that, along with selective bans on air \n     transport relief flights by the Government of Sudan, the use \n     of raiding and slaving parties is a tool for creating food \n     shortages and is used as a systematic means to destroy the \n     societies, culture, and economies of the Dinka, Nuer, and \n     Nuba peoples in a policy of low-intensity ethnic cleansing.\n\n     SEC. 5. SUPPORT FOR AN INTERNATIONALLY SANCTIONED PEACE \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress hereby recognizes that--\n       (1) a single viable, internationally and regionally \n     sanctioned peace process holds the greatest opportunity to \n     promote a negotiated, peaceful settlement to the war in \n     Sudan; and\n       (2) resolution to the conflict in Sudan is best made \n     through a peace process based on the Declaration of \n     Principles reached in Nairobi, Kenya, on July 20, 1994.\n       (b) United States Diplomatic Support.--The Secretary of \n     State is authorized to utilize the personnel of the \n     Department of State for the support of--\n       (1) the ongoing negotiations between the Government of \n     Sudan and opposition forces;\n       (2) any necessary peace settlement planning or \n     implementation; and\n       (3) other United States diplomatic efforts supporting a \n     peace process in Sudan.\n\n     SEC. 6. MULTILATERAL PRESSURE ON COMBATANTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United Nations should be used as a tool to \n     facilitating peace and recovery in Sudan; and\n       (2) the President, acting through the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should seek \n     to--\n       (A) revise the terms of Operation Lifeline Sudan to end the \n     veto power of the Government of Sudan over the plans by \n     Operation Lifeline Sudan for air transport of relief flights \n     and, by doing so, to end the manipulation of the delivery of \n     those relief supplies to the advantage of the Government of \n     Sudan on the battlefield;\n       (B) investigate the practice of slavery in Sudan and \n     provide mechanisms for its elimination; and\n       (C) sponsor a condemnation of the Government of Sudan each \n     time it subjects civilians to aerial bombardment.\n\n     SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 116 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151n) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) In addition to the requirements of subsections (d) \n     and (f), the report required by subsection (d) shall \n     include--\n       ``(1) a description of the sources and current status of \n     Sudan's financing and construction of oil exploitation \n     infrastructure and pipelines, the effects on the inhabitants \n     of the oil fields regions of such financing and construction, \n     and the Government of Sudan's ability to finance the war in \n     Sudan;\n       ``(2) a description of the extent to which that financing \n     was secured in the United States or with involvement of \n     United States citizens;\n       ``(3) the best estimates of the extent of aerial \n     bombardment by the Government of Sudan forces in areas \n     outside its control, including targets, frequency, and best \n     estimates of damage; and\n       ``(4) a description of the extent to which humanitarian \n     relief has been obstructed or manipulated by the Government \n     of Sudan or other forces for the purposes of the war in \n     Sudan.''.\n\n     SEC. 8. CONTINUED USE OF NON-OLS ORGANIZATIONS FOR RELIEF \n                   EFFORTS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should continue to increase the use of non-OLS \n     agencies in the distribution of relief supplies in southern \n     Sudan.\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a detailed \n     report to Congress describing the progress made toward \n     carrying out subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 9. CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR ANY BAN ON AIR TRANSPORT RELIEF \n                   FLIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Plan.--The President shall develop a contingency plan \n     to provide, outside United Nations auspices if necessary, the \n     greatest possible amount of United States Government and \n     privately donated relief to all affected areas in Sudan, \n     including the Nuba Mountains, Upper Nile, and Blue Nile, in \n     the event the Government of Sudan imposes a total, partial, \n     or incremental ban on OLS air transport relief flights.\n       (b) Reprogramming Authority.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, in carrying out the plan developed under \n     subsection (a), the President may reprogram up to 100 percent \n     of the funds available for support of OLS operations (but for \n     this subsection) for the purposes of the plan.\n\n     SEC. 10. HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR EXCLUSIONARY ``NO GO'' \n                   AREAS OF SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Pilot Project Activities.--The President, acting \n     through the United States Agency for International \n     Development, is authorized and requested to undertake, \n     immediately, pilot project activities to provide food and \n     other humanitarian assistance, as appropriate, to vulnerable \n     populations in Sudan that are residing in exclusionary ``no \n     go'' areas of Sudan.\n       (b) Study.--The President, acting through the United States \n     Agency for International Development, shall conduct a study \n     examining the adverse impact upon indigenous Sudan \n     communities by OLS policies that curtail direct humanitarian \n     assistance to exclusionary ``no go'' areas of Sudan.\n       (c) Exclusionary ``No Go'' Areas of Sudan Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``exclusionary `no go' areas of Sudan'' \n     means areas of Sudan designated by OLS for curtailment of \n     direct humanitarian assistance, including, but not limited \n     to, the Nuba Mountains, the Upper Nile, and the Blue Nile.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 180), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/19/senate-section/article/S7986-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say in closing, the assistant \nminority leader is in the Chamber, and I express through him to the \nentire Republican caucus our appreciation for their cooperation in \nmoving this legislation that we have just completed, and the \nnominations. We now have completed three appropriations bills. Last \nCongress at this same time we were able to complete eight before the \nAugust recess. That is a goal we have. We certainly would like to be \nable to do that.\n  Even though there has been a few missteps this week back and forth, I \nthink there has been an understanding as to what is expected on each \nside. Again, I express my appreciation to the entire Republican caucus, \nthrough my friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, the assistant \nminority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague, \nSenator Reid from Nevada. We did get some things accomplished today. We \ndid pass two appropriations bills. We did confirm, I think, about 18 \npeople. And we are going to confirm about three judges tomorrow, and \nseveral other individuals. So we are making progress.\n  I thank my friend and colleague as well for his patience. This is not \nthe easiest process, as we found out in the last session of Congress. \nSometimes it is more difficult to pass appropriations bills than it \nshould be. But my friend from Nevada has been very persistent. He is \ngetting his appropriations bills passed and we are getting some \nnominations through. I pledge to continue working with him to see if we \ncan accomplish both objectives: completing appropriations bills in a \ntimely manner and also seeing to it that President Bush's nominees are \ngiven fair consideration and are confirmed in an appropriate timeframe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
