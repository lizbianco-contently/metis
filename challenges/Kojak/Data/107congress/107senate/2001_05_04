Give Him the praise and the glory. Before all living, \nacknowledge the many good things He has done for you, by blessing and \nextolling His name in song. Before all men, honor and proclaim God's \ndeeds, and do not be slack in praising Him. A king's secret it is \nprudent to keep, but the works of God are to be declared and made \nknown. Praise them with due honor. Do good, and evil will not find its \nway to you. Prayer and fasting are good, but better than either is \nalmsgiving accompanied by righteousness. A little with righteousness is \nbetter than abundance with wickedness.''\n  Let us pray:\n  Almighty God, we give You thanks for the many and varied ways You \nhave blessed the men and women who serve in the Senate.

Lord, Your presence is found where unity and love prevail; grant \nthat they may strive to work together in harmony and peace.\n  We acknowledge that God is the strength and protector of His people; \ngrant Lord to the Members of the Senate the strength and courage they \nneed to serve the people of the United States.\n  Grant this through Christ our Lord.

Mr. President, we are here discussing the education bill. \nYesterday, the Senate passed a measure to\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\nincrease funding for education over what is in the baseline by $150 \nbillion. I supported that. But we have an incredible disconnect going \non between what we are doing on the floor of the Senate and what we are \nabout to do in the budget resolution. The budget resolution that has \ncome out of the conference committee has no new money for education--\nnone, zero. So we are all out here talking about education being the \ntop priority--and, indeed, it is--but we have a budget resolution \ncoming out of the conference committee that gives no priority to \neducation--none, not one thin dime of additional resources to \neducation. It is really an incredible disconnect--the difference \nbetween the rhetoric on the floor and the reality of this budget \nresolution.\n  The new President of the United States proposed a very modest \nincrease in education over the so-called baseline. He proposed $13 \nbillion of new money for education over the 10-year period. In the \nDemocratic alternative budget, we proposed $139 billion of new money \nfor education over the 10-year period. What passed on the floor of the \nSenate when we considered the budget resolution was an increase of $308 \nbillion. We passed the Harkin amendment, which reduced the tax cut by \n$450 billion and allocated half to education and half to debt \nreduction. The Harkin amendment added $225 billion to education over \nthe next 10 years. It went to conference committee to be worked out as \nto the differences between the House and Senate, and they came back \nwith nothing, zero, no new money.\n\n  We passed on the floor of the Senate the Jeffords-Breaux amendment \nwhich added $70 billion to fund IDEA. That went to the conference \ncommittee and came back with zero--a big nothing. So there is no new \nmoney in this budget for education, and our colleagues ought to be \naware of it as we consider the budget next week.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4376-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4376-S4377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 372.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To tie funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education \n              Act of 1965 to improved student performance)\n\n       On page 29, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 16. FUNDING RULE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) Adjusted for inflation, the amount of money Federal, \n     State, and local governments spend per public school student \n     has nearly doubled over the past 30 years.\n       ``(2) This doubling of real, per-pupil spending has had no \n     effect on test scores.\n       ``(3) In 1965, the Federal Government enacted title I of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to \n     eradicate the achievement gap between economically \n     disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers.\n       ``(4) In 2001 that achievement gap persists, unaffected by \n     the $120,000,000,000 the Federal Government has spent on such \n     title I.\n       ``(5) In 1996 the Department of Education reported that \n     `The progress of [part A of title I] participants on \n     standardized tests and on criterion-referenced tests was no \n     better than that of nonparticipants with similar backgrounds \n     and prior achievement'.\n       ``(b) Funding Rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, a State shall be eligible for an increase in the \n     amount of funds made available under this Act from one fiscal \n     year to the next fiscal year (after adjusting for increases \n     in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers as \n     published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) when the State \n     meets the requirements for adequate yearly progress for the \n     State under section 1111(b)(2) for the school year preceding \n     the fiscal year for which the determination is made, except \n     that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to provide \n     funds to a State under this Act for any fiscal year in an \n     amount that is less than the amount of funds provided to the \n     State under this Act for fiscal year 2001.''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to address \nthe very issue my colleague has just talked about, the issue of \nspending and education. We have offered an amendment to curb the \nFederal Government's appetite to spend tax dollars. It will ensure that \nwe no longer throw good money after bad programs. It will focus our \nNation's educational bureaucracy on what should be its sole purpose: \nhelping students learn.\n  Over the course of the last several days, we have been debating \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, \nand in that process we are adding by authorization a phenomenal amount \nof new money for the purpose of education.\n  We have heard a great deal in this Chamber about how much we need to \nspend to improve education for our young people. Every Senator clearly \nwants to improve the educational system to which we entrust our \nchildren's futures. Unlike the past, we are offering some very real \nreforms this time. But in a continuation of past practices, we also are \noffering a tremendous amount of new money.\n  Let me say very clearly that we have spent an awful lot of money on \neducation in the past, and the record is very clear that money alone \ndoes not solve that problem. In fact, the additional money we have \nadded to our educational system over the last 30 years has done nothing \nto improve education.\n  Over the past 30 years, the amount of money we have spent to educate \nour children has doubled; that is even after inflation. In other words, \nit is real money we're talking about here and a lot of it. It will cost \ntaxpayers twice as much to educate my grandchildren in public schools \nas it did to educate my children in public schools.\n  We doubled the amount we spend on each student in the timespan of 30 \nyears. Yet this huge increase in spending has brought us, as I just \nmentioned, nothing.\n  This is a chart that demonstrates that clearly. In spite of the fact \nthat per-student spending has doubled and continues to climb, student \nachievement has stagnated. This is a line that demonstrates that major \nincrease in spending over the timeframe I have mentioned through the \nseventies, the eighties, and the nineties. Look at the reading scores \nof the national assessment of 17-year-olds, 13-year-olds, and 9-year-\nolds. Somehow it does not seem to parallel the amount of money we have \nspent.\n  We doubled the resources, and yet somehow the system did not improve, \nand our children were shortchanged. Today's schoolchildren are entering \nan educational system that is no better than that in which their \nparents were educated. In fact, there are measurements to indicate it \nis worse.\n  This next chart shows that not only have reading scores stagnated \nover that 30-year period, but doubling education spending likewise has \nbrought us no improvement in math and no improvement in science. Yet \nour young people, in a very integrated world where demand for math and \nscience skills is higher than ever, must compete with students from \naround the world for jobs that in their very character are \ninternational. Yet our educational system, despite all the money we've \npoured into it, has produced stagnation in math and science achievement \nfor the last 30 years.\n  The law we concern ourselves with today was passed in 1965. Its \nprimary purpose is to close the achievement gap between poor students \nand nonpoor students. Since 1965, we have devoted some $120 billion to \nthis goal. Yet as this chart demonstrates, $120 billion later, poor \nkids still lag behind in reading. In other words, poor kids are no \nbetter off today than they were 30 years ago. We have achieved nothing \nfor them. Most important, we have allowed them not to achieve, and the \ntaxpayers of this country have spent $120 billion in a failed attempt \nto close that gap.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  Five years ago, the Department of Education conducted a review of \nthis program for disadvantaged students known as title I and found:\n\n       The progress of [title I, part A] participants on \n     standardized tests and on criterion-referenced tests was no \n     better than that of nonparticipants with similar backgrounds \n     and prior achievement.\n\n  When tested, no difference could be found between those inside title \nI and those outside title I. I want to repeat that. The progress of the \nparticipants was no better inside the program than outside the program. \nIn other words, we spent a lot of money on a program that did nothing \nto improve the situation of these poor children. One hundred twenty \nbillion dollars and nothing to show for it.\n  How did we reward the system's failure? Of course, with more money. \nWe allowed the establishment to design the system, and we fed the \nsystem money hoping that young people would improve, hoping that their \nscores in reading, math, and science would improve, and it did not \nhappen.\n  Yes, children have been left behind for a good number of years. We \nhave struggled mightily. Certainly the chairman and the Presiding \nOfficer have struggled mightily to try to reform the primary and \nsecondary education systems of our country. The establishment has \nfought them openly and aggressively.\n  Today we have some reform, but we are also putting in a phenomenal \namount of new money through authorization with that reform. The \nquestion is, What will it yield?\n  It has been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same \nthing over and over and just hoping there will be a different result. \nThat is exactly what we have been doing for 30 years.\n  This is a prescription for mediocrity.\n  The amendment I offer today will change the way the Federal \nGovernment deals with schools that fail to improve. It is a moderate \namendment and, I believe, a compassionate amendment.\n  Decade after decade, as I have demonstrated, at least for the last \nthree decades, schools have failed to improve, and decade after decade, \nwith a wink and a smile, we tell the system: Don't worry about how many \nchildren you have left behind, we are still going to give you more \nmoney.\n  The amendment I offer today will stop handing out rewards for leaving \nchildren behind. Under this amendment, in order to receive a funding \nincrease under this act, States would be required to make adequate \nyearly progress in boosting student achievement, as defined in the \nbipartisan agreement reached between my colleagues from Vermont and \nMassachusetts, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member.\n  This is a moderate measure. It will not cut educational spending. It \nguarantees that a State's funding level cannot fall below its current \nlevel but that a State that does not improve their children's \nachievement would forgo any reward from the Federal Government until \nthey do.\n  This amendment even allows the act to adjust for inflation because if \nwe did not, that would be a real cut.\n  What we have to say to the educational establishment of this country \nis: If you do not create a system that allows our children to achieve \nat ever improving rates, then we cannot reward you with more of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Public education is critically important, and a strong public \neducation system in our country has been the foundation of our Republic \nand, without question, the strength of our Republic.\n  This is a moderate and compassionate measure, and I believe it is \nnecessary. We cannot reauthorize this act and say that without \nimprovement, the taxpayers of this country will continue to reward the \nsystem.\n  Taxpayers historically have been very generous when it comes to \neducation. Funding at the local and State level over the last several \nyears across the country has rapidly increased. But it is also time to \nsay, as we do with this amendment and with the reauthorization of ESEA, \nimprovement is now a must; it must be measured, and if you do improve, \nwe will reward you. But if you do not, we will no longer use taxpayers' \nhard earned dollars to buy mediocrity for the young people of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4377-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4377-S4379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET CONSIDERATION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, next week we will be considering the \nbudget of the United States. We have gone through sort of the ``Perils \nof Pauline'' here crafting the budget for the country. After much talk \nof bipartisanship, the other side locked out the Democrats from the \nconference committee. That is the meeting between the House and the \nSenate budget members to work out the differences between the two \nsides.\n  We were invited to the first meeting and told we would not be invited \nback, that the Republican majority was going to write this budget all \non their own, which they have done. So much for bipartisanship.\n  That is unfortunate. I think we could have crafted a much better \nresult if we would have had a chance to work together. We really had an \nunprecedented year working on the budget in which there was no markup \nin the Budget Committee, and now a conference committee to work out the \ndifferences between the House version of the budget and the Senate \nversion of the budget completely excluding Democrats from the \nconsideration.\n  As a result, I think we are going to get an unbalanced budget, a \nbudget that threatens to put us back into deficit, back into debt, a \nbudget that does not reflect the values of the American people, that \ndoes not put a priority on education when everybody is giving speeches \nabout the critical importance of education.\n  I grew up in a family in which my parents were killed when I was \nyoung. My grandparents raised me. My grandmother was a schoolteacher. \nIn our family, education was the priority. It was not just the first \npriority; it was the second priority; it was the third priority because \nmy grandparents believed that education was what unlocked opportunity \nfor every child. They just did not talk about it; they lived it.\n  My grandparents, who were successful people but not wealthy by any \nmeans, set aside a fund so every one of my brothers and cousins could \ngo on to higher education. As a result, everyone in our family got an \nadvanced degree. There were 13 cousins in my immediate family and \neveryone got an advanced degree--from a middle-class family. That was \nbecause my grandparents truly believed in the value of education. They \nwere right. Those are the right values. Those are American values.\n  We hear a lot of Senate speeches about education being the priority. \nWhen they go to the back room and write a budget, all the speeches are \nright out the window. It is all hot air. It is all fluff. It does not \nmean a thing. It is all words--words and not deeds.\n  That is not right. In fact, it is misleading people to stand up and \nsay they are for education and then go in a back room and cut out every \npenny of money to strengthen education. They ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves.\n  We are going to have a real chance to compare votes on education in \nthis Chamber with votes on the budget, and we are going to see how they \nmatch up. We are going to see who is being straight with the people \nthey represent and who is not.\n  Here is what we have learned of this conference report. This is what \nthe President's budget was. This is the Democratic alternative. This is \nwhat the Senate passed. This is what is coming out of the conference \ncommittee. It is very interesting.\n  The tax cut has gone up from what was passed in the Senate. But when \nyou look at education--this is the education line. We passed $308 \nbillion of funding for education, new money for education. What came \nout of the conference committee? Zero. No money.\n  It is not just there that this budget fails us. On the environment, \nthe President proposed a huge cut. What came out of the Senate was a \nsubstantial cut but not as big as the President's. What has come out of \nthe conference committee? Zero. No new money for protecting the \nenvironment.\n  It does not end there. On strengthening Social Security--to me, this \nis, along with education, the most valuable because we know--there is \nnot a\n\n[[Page S4378]]\n\nSenator who does not know we are headed for a crisis when the baby \nboomers retire.\n  We know that. This is not a projection. The baby boomers have been \nborn. They are alive. They are going to retire. And they are going to \ndramatically increase the draw on the Federal Treasury and the programs \nof Social Security and Medicare.\n  The President has a big event at the White House saying he is for \nstrengthening Social Security. Then when you go to match the words with \nthe deeds and you look at the bill coming from the conference \ncommittee, do you know what you find that has been a set-aside to \nstrengthen Social Security? Nothing. Zero. No money. It is all words \nabout how education is a priority. It is all words about how \nstrengthening Social Security is a priority because there is no new \nmoney for either one--nothing for education and nothing to deal with \nthe long-term debt that is facing this country in Social Security.\n  I think we probably know, as I reviewed before and as this chart \ndetails, what happened in the Senate. In the Senate, we passed the \nHarkin amendment that provided $225 billion over 10 years to improve \neducation in America, money that is desperately needed. My colleague \nfrom Idaho said money doesn't make a difference. It doesn't in and of \nitself solve the problem. We all understand that. It takes more than \nmoney to improve education. We will have a hard time getting the best \npeople to be teachers in this country if we don't pay them decently.\n  What is happening all across America is that many of the best \nteachers are leaving education because they are not being fairly \ncompensated. I have a cousin who was a teacher on an Indian reservation \nin North Dakota--a wonderful teacher, absolutely superb. But she was \nbeing paid so little money she really couldn't make ends meet. So she \nleft to go to the private sector, started a store and became a small \nbusiness person. That is terrific. But education lost a star performer.\n  It is just not here, but across America people are leaving education \nfor higher paying jobs somewhere else, and we are losing some of the \nbest.\n  We can either say it doesn't matter or we can respond. We have \nschools all across America that were built in the 1950s that are not \nprepared for the high-tech world of today. We turned our back on that \nand said: Well, tough luck, kids. You are not going to be educated for \nthe world that is to come. We are going to leave you out of the high-\ntechnology workforce.\n  That is a mistake. We know that classrooms have too many students in \nthem. We know that every objective standard has indicated that if you \nhave smaller classrooms and fewer students, the individual student who \ngets more attention does better. It costs money.\n  Here is what we did in the Senate. We said we are going to put the \nmoney where our mouth is. We are going to put some money into \neducation: $225 billion. We are going to reduce the tax cut by $450 \nbillion. We are going to put half of it into education. We are going to \nput half of it into further debt reduction.\n  Look at what came out of the conference committee: Zero. They took \nout every dime of additional money for education. We passed in the \nSenate the Breaux-Jeffords amendment for IDEA funding. That is the \ndisabilities act. Congress made a promise when it passed the \ndisabilities act that they were going to fund 40 percent of the cost. \nThey did not do it. We said: Let's provide the money to keep the \npromise. And we did it in the Senate.\n  It goes to the conference committee, and they come back with a big \ngoose egg.\n  Why is this being done? I believe it is being done because the \noverall budget doesn't add up. It doesn't add up. If you include an \neducation initiative, if you include the money that is being asked for \nby the Defense Department to strengthen America's defense, then you \nhave a budget that doesn't add up. You have a budget at that point that \nis raiding the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security trust fund. \nOf course, everybody says they do not want to do that.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle have produced a budget \nthat is kind of a hide-and-seek budget. It hides big chunks of spending \nthat all of us know are going to occur.\n  For example, there appeared in USA Today on Friday, April 27, \n``Billions Sought For Arms. Secretary seeks to reduce role of ground \ntroops,'' talking about the Secretary of Defense.\n  The story goes on to say, ``As Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, \nnears the end of a top-to-bottom review of Pentagon, he is expected to \nseek a large boost in defense spending--$200 billion to $300 billion \nover the next 6 years.''\n  Is that in the budget? Is that big defense buildup in the budget? No. \nNone of it is in the budget. They do not have $200 billion to $300 \nbillion of new money in the budget for defense. Why not? Because if \nthey put it in before the tax cut passes, the budget doesn't add up. \nThey are into the Medicare trust fund and the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  What is going on here is a giant scam. That is what is happening. It \nis a giant scam to mislead the American people--pass the tax cut, and \nthen come back to Congress and say: Oh, by the way, we forgot about the \nmoney that we need for defense. We need $200 billion or $300 billion \njust for the next 6 years.\n  Remember, this is a 10-year plan on which we are working. They say \nthey are going to need another $200 billion to $300 billion just for \nthe next 6 years, only it is not in the budget that we are going to \nvote on next week. Not a penny of it is in there. Why? Because, if they \nput it in, the budget doesn't add up.\n  That is their problem. As soon as you are honest with people about \nthe true costs of funding defense and of improving education, then you \nare raiding the Medicare trust fund, the Social Security trust fund, \nand doing it in a big way. These aren't the only items left out.\n  Let me conclude on the defense item. This is a story that ran in the \nWall Street Journal. This was May 1st. ``Pentagon plan sees 42 percent \nrise in the arms budget.''\n  Is there a 42 percent rise in the budget we are going to vote on next \nweek? No, there is no 42 percent rise. They have not put this money in \nthe budget. They are going to announce the week after next, after we \nhave passed the budget with the big tax cut in it, because they don't \ndare show the true budget, the true spending, or the true plan until \nthey get their tax cut passed because if they show the try numbers, it \ndoesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up.\n  They are raiding the Medicare trust fund to the tune of $250 billion. \nThey are raiding the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $50 \nbillion. That is what is really going on in this town.\n  It is a hide-and-seek budget. They are going to hide the true effects \nof this budget until after the tax cut passes. Then they are going to \ncome back to us, and they are going to say: We have to do something \nmore for defense. We have to do something more for education. We have \nto do something to fix this alternative minimum tax problem.\n  That is a big one they aren't talking about. The alternative minimum \ntax today affects about two million taxpayers. The Joint Tax Committee \nhas told us that if we passed the Bush plan, 35 million people are \ngoing to be caught up in the alternative minimum tax.\n  Boy, they are in for a surprise. They thought they were going to get \na tax cut. But instead, one in four American taxpayers will be caught \nup in the alternative minimum tax. They will be paying more. It costs \n$300 billion to fix it.\n  Do you see that anywhere in the budget? It is nowhere in the budget. \nThey don't have a dime in this budget to fix the alternative minimum \ntax. They don't have a dime for this big defense buildup they are \ngetting ready to announce. They don't have a dime of new money for \neducation. Why? Because, if they did, they would have a budget that \ndoesn't add up. It is right back into deficit. It is right back into \nthe bad old days of deficits and debt and decline.\n  The harsh reality is, unlike the 1980s, if we go back to deficits and \ndebt now, this is no time to recover, because the baby boomers start to \nretire in 11 years. Then all of this changes. We go from big surpluses \ntoday to massive deficits in that 10-year period.\n  That is the Comptroller General of the United States warning us of \nwhere\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\nwe are headed. He says we face a demographic tidal wave that is unlike \nanything we have ever seen in this country. That is because the baby \nboomers are such a large group, when they retire, the number of people \non Medicare and Social Security double in very short order.\n  We ought to be setting aside money today to deal with the problem we \nknow is coming tomorrow. This budget does not do it. This budget does \nnot set aside a dime to strengthen Social Security for the long term. \nThere is no money in the budget for that.\n  In our budget, we propose setting aside $750 billion to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term. But the conference committee comes \nback and there is no money, just as they came back with no new money \nfor education, no money for this big defense buildup they are going to \nbe asking for week after next, no money for area after area that we \nknow is going to be a real cost--no money to fix the alternative \nminimum tax. The reason is simple and clear: It is only by showing a \nfalse budget that they can get it to add up.\n  If they put the true costs in, if they put in the defense buildup, if \nthey put in the cost of alternative minimum tax reform, if they put in \nnew money for education, then they are heavily raiding the Medicare \ntrust fund, heavily raiding the Social Security trust fund. That is the \ntruth.\n  This is exactly how we get into trouble in the country: betting on a \n10-year forecast that even the people who made the forecast warn us is \nunlikely to come true. In fact, we have a projection of a $5.6 trillion \nsurplus over the next 10 years--$5.6 trillion. But that is just a \nprojection. That money is not in the bank.\n  In fact, the people who made the forecast said that number only has a \n10-percent chance of coming true; a 45-percent chance there will be \nmore money, a 45-percent chance there will be less money.\n  That forecast was made about 10 weeks ago now. What has happened in \nthe interim? The economy has weakened. We have a jobless report today \nthat suggests quite dramatic weakening in the economy. So do we bet \nthere is going to be more money or less money? I would say all the \nsigns are there is going to be less money. That puts us in grave danger \nof going back into deficit, going back to the bad old days of raiding \nevery trust fund in sight.\n  I say to you, the thing that is most wrong about that approach is \nthat in the 1980s we had time to recover. This time, if we get it \nwrong, there is no time to recover. The baby boomers start retiring in \n11 years, and all of these things that have been working in our favor \nstart to turn the other way. There is not a Member of this body who \ndoes not know that is true.\n  I just hope that before we vote on this budget, people will think \ncarefully about the implications, and they will think carefully about \nthe risks, and they will think carefully about the danger of going back \ninto deficit, back into debt, just before the baby boomers start to \nretire; and we know these surpluses of today turn into massive deficits \ntomorrow. That would just be a serious mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have been receiving a disturbingly \nconsistent and an increasingly high volume of bad economic news. Even \nwhat appeared to be good news at its base is bad news.\n  In today's Washington Post, is an article--and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this and the other articles to which I will refer be \nprinted in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There was considerable enthusiasm a couple of weeks ago \nwhen the Federal Reserve Board reduced interest rates for short-term \ninterbank borrowings by .5 percent. Today, we learn why the Federal \nReserve Board acted in that manner in an unusual format between its \nregularly scheduled meetings.\n  The background is that the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan \nGreenspan, had, for weeks, directed the Federal Reserve staff to \nclosely track company earnings announcements and business executives' \ncomments about their plans for such things as capital spending.\n  Staff members have been working the phones, asking companies specific \nquestions about their future intentions. What the Federal officials and \nthe staff found out by early April was a disturbingly sour attitude \namong corporate executives, suggesting that many of them were hunkering \ndown, concentrating on cutting costs and slashing investment plans. The \npolicy planners concluded that quick Federal Reserve Board action was \nneeded to try to break the psychological mindset lest it undermine the \ndrag we pick up in economic growth later this year. Many Federal \nofficials are hoping there will be a turnaround and that this action \nwas necessary in order to turn that hope into reality.\n  Unfortunately, today we have received some additional bad economic \nnews. To quote from the report of the New York Times:\n\n       The Nation's unemployment rate shot up by 4.5 percent in \n     April, the highest level in 2.5 years. Businesses slashed \n     their payrolls by the largest amount since the recession of \n     1991.\n\n  The Labor Department report of Friday--today--was the freshest \nevidence that the economy, which started to slow in the second half of \nthe last year, continues to weaken. The increase of .2 percentage \npoints in the unemployment rate marks the second straight month the \njobless rate had gone up. In March, it had ticked up by 4.3 percent. \nApril's rate was the highest since October of 1998 when unemployment \nalso stood at 4.5 percent.\n  Similar reports are in today's online news reports from USA Today, \nthe Washington Post, all of which I have submitted for the Record.\n  Nobody likes to talk about bad news. I think what we need to be \ntalking about now is common sense.\n  What are likely to be the consequences of this accumulation of bad \nnews? I am afraid the consequences will include a further assault upon \nconsumer confidence, which has already declined precipitously, and a \nfurther assault on the willingness of consumers to undertake serious \nexpenditures. We know that about two-thirds of our economy is \npredicated on consumer spending. As the willingness of consumers to \nspend is undermined by the kind of bad news they received this morning, \nthat will have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our \neconomy.\n  How have we been reacting--we Members of Congress and the new \nadministration--to this bad news? In my judgment, we have been \nresponding inadequately. We have been responding based on a denial of \nthe changes that are occurring in our economy and an unwarranted \ncommitment to pursue the ideas that were the product of a different \neconomic era.\n  I believe we should be seriously looking--not only looking but \nacting--to provide new levels of economic assurance to the American \npeople and the economic capability to take advantage of that \nreassurance. We should immediately institute a tax stimulus designed to \nencourage consumers to increase their spending and, therefore, begin to \ncounter the softening consumer demand in our economy.\n  Unfortunately, the tax stimulus has been the stepchild of tax policy. \nWhy has it been the stepchild? I think, first, it has been the \nstepchild because there has been an undue commitment to policies that \nwere developed in another time.\n  I remember a statement made by President Bush, which was a statement \nmade to indicate his constancy, his degree of unwavering support, for \nhis $1.6\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\ntrillion tax plan. That statement started with the fact that the \nPresident indicated when he first announced his tax plan during the \nwinter of 1999, in preparation for the 2000 Iowa caucus, that he first \nproclaimed his commitment to a $1.6 trillion plan and that commitment \nhad continued throughout the Republican primary process, the Republican \nConvention, and the general election, and has continued until that date \nin February of 2001.\n\n  What has happened is that while the plan has continued to be the same \nfrom the winter of 1999 to the now almost summer of 2001, the economic \nstage has changed. Stagehands have come on the stage and removed the \nbooming stock market, which in the winter of 1999 was giving us almost \ndaily new highs in stock market prices. The stagehands have also \nremoved what was almost an all-time low in unemployment and replaced it \nwith the unemployment circumstance we find today, which is 4.5-percent \nunemployment, up three-tenths in just the last 60 days. We also have \nreplaced the gross domestic product, which had been running at rates of \n5 or 6 percent, with one in which we now are approaching an anemic 2-\npercent growth rate in our GDP.\n  The second stage, which began in the late winter of this year, was \nthat at least we started with the rhetoric that we were interested in \ntax stimulus, but no change in the tax plan. We were saying the same \nplan that had been developed in the winter of 1999, which was defined \nas a plan to give a rebate, refund, to the American people for \nexcessive taxes--that the same plan now was relabeled as being a tax \nstimulus.\n  There was a glimmer of hope. That glimmer of hope occurred just \nwithin the last few days when we heard that the conference committee \nthat was working on the melding of the House and Senate budget \nresolutions was proposing that there be a $100 million tax stimulus and \nthat that tax stimulus was to start immediately. That glimmer of hope \nwas quickly shattered, because now we see that in the conference report \non the budget resolution, there is no $100 billion for a tax stimulus--\nthe $100 billion was folded into the $1.25 billion overall tax cut. A \ntax cut of $1.25 trillion over 10 years has now absorbed the $100 \nbillion that was supposed to be the tax stimulus and has grown. So we \nhave a tax reduction proposal in the budget resolution of $1.37 \nbillion, but no specific tax stimulus.\n  Another source of disappointment is that in the budget resolution \nthat passed the Senate, we were talking about two tax bills between now \nand October 1. There would be one in mid-May and another one prior to \nSeptember 30. That raised the hope, and there was some public comment \nthat that first tax bill would be the tax stimulus bill; it would be \nthe means by which we would respond rather than passively observe that \naccumulation of very troubling economic news. That, too, has now been \neliminated in that the budget resolution apparently will only call for \na single tax bill. It is being suggested that tax bill should be \nbasically the winter of 1999 tax bill with minor modifications.\n\n  I am discouraged and disappointed at the current state of affairs, \nbut I am hopeful there will be a new day. Maybe that hope can be found \nin the fact that we learned late last night that the conference report \non which the House was supposed to have voted and which we were \nassumedly going to be debating some today and again on Monday and vote \non Tuesday was deficient; that there were, in fact, two pages of the \nconference report that were mysteriously missing.\n  The hope is those two pages are the two pages that contain some \ncommitment toward an intelligent tax stimulative policy. If that is not \nthe case, then it is incumbent on us to come to our senses and to take \nconstructive action before it is too late.\n  I analogize the situation we are in to a business which has just \nlearned there is going to be built in close proximity a gasoline tank \nfarm. The business owner is looking at his insurance policy and asking \nthe question: Given the fact that I am now going to have a heightened \nrisk of a fire in the neighborhood in which my business is located, \nwould it not be prudent to acquire some additional fire insurance?\n  We are getting the message that there is additional vulnerability in \nour economic neighborhood, and would it not be prudent under these \ncircumstances for us to buy some additional insurance, an insurance \npolicy against recession or an insurance policy against a deepened, \nprolonged recession?\n  I believe, just like the business person, yes, it would be prudent \nfor us to do so. I suggest in doing so we should reexamine the proposal \nthat will soon be before us and say, first, it is not prudent to be \nattempting to pass one gigantic tax bill, most of which benefits do not \noccur until 5 years from now; rather, what we should be doing is \npassing immediately an economic stimulus tax bill which will deal with \nthe No. 1 economic challenge to this Nation and most of our people, and \nthat is how to provide some additional economic encouragement and sense \nof hope for Americans at a time of a sliding economy, increasing \nunemployment, and declining gross domestic product.\n  I believe that first tax bill we pass should have the following \ncharacteristics: It should be an immediate tax bill. It should be front \nloaded with substantial benefits available immediately after enactment.\n  The President's original tax bill had only $187 million of tax \nbenefits in the calendar year 2001. I believe we need to have a \nsubstantial tax cut of at least $60 billion in 2001 and in each \nsuccessive year. We need to place that tax cut primarily in the hands \nof all American families through a reduction in their withholding tax. \nThis would result in the greatest likelihood that tax cut would, in \nfact, be used to stimulate demand.\n  This plan needs to be simple. We are about to consider what will be a \nvery complicated plan, a plan that will have multiple provisions, most \nof which will not have a significant economic impact until after the \nyear 2005.\n  I believe we need to have a simple, straightforward plan which will \nhave an impact immediately. The proposal Senator Corzine and I have \ndeveloped which we submit as meeting these characteristics will be \naccomplished by taking a recommendation of President Bush, which is \nthat we add a new bracket to our income tax code, and that be a bracket \nat the 10-percent level--that the first taxable dollars earned by \nAmericans would be at a 10-percent rather than a 15-percent level.\n\n  The President's suggestion should be modified in two regards. First, \nthe 10-percent bracket, as he has suggested it, will not go into full \neffect until the year 2006. We suggest it ought to be in full effect as \nof January 1, 2001.\n  Second, his proposal is limited to the first $6,000 of earnings for \nan individual and the first $12,000 for a married couple. We increase \nthose numbers to $9,500 for an individual and $19,000 for a married \ncouple. The effect of that is to provide a $60 billion tax stimulus \nreflected through reductions in withholding taxes and immediately \navailable to the American people.\n  We offer this as a commonsense solution to a very serious and \ndisturbing set of economic changes that are occurring. We offer this as \na means of providing to the American people the kind of support the \nFederal Government can and should be providing at this time. We offer \nit as a statement that we are not so disconnected from the lives of \nAmericans that we are unable to appreciate the anxiety which many of \nour fellow citizens are suffering and the opportunity we have to \nprovide a constructive and immediate source of relief.\n  I suggest that we, the Members of Congress, are about to be tested. \nAre we isolated, stuck on some plan that is now almost 2 years out of \ndate, or are we engaged with the American people; that we appreciate \nthe implications of the declining economy to their lives, and we are \nprepared to act in a way that will give them the confidence that will, \nin turn, be beneficial to all Americans because it is their confidence \nconverted into actions in the marketplace which have the best chance of \nbeginning to place some concrete under our economy and begin to lift us \nout of this series of declines.\n  We are going to be tested. Next week is going to be the testing date. \nI hope this Congress will receive positive grades on the report card we \nare going to be issued because if we fail to do so, and if that tank \nfarm of declining economic statistics explodes this summer\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\nor fall, the question is going to be asked of us: What did you do when \nyou had the opportunity to buy an economic insurance policy to help \navoid this consequence? We do not want to say we were blind and deaf to \nthe circumstances of the American people and failed to act.\n  I hope this news, as disappointing and distressing as it is, will \nserve as a shock signal to this Congress to act and next week we will \nshow that we have heard the alarm.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2001]\n\n                  Fed's Legwork Led to Quick Rate Cut\n\n\n                  firms surveyed before april surprise\n\n                           (By John M. Berry)\n\n       When Federal Reserve policymakers surprise financial \n     markets with an unexpected change in interest rates, \n     investors and analysts often wonder, ``What do they know that \n     we don't?'' Usually, the answer is nothing.\n       But when the Fed caught the markets off guard on April 18 \n     with a half-percentage-point reduction in short-term interest \n     rates, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other central bank \n     officials did have some vital, privately gathered information \n     that convinced them an immediate rate cut was needed.\n       The chairman had expressed concern earlier this year that \n     businesses, worried about falling profits in a sluggish \n     economy, might cut their spending on new plants and equipment \n     so much that they would prolong the slump and forestall an \n     eventual rebound in growth. Anecdotal evidence reaching the \n     Fed suggested that could be the case.\n       To get a better reading, Greenspan had for weeks directed \n     Fed staff to closely track company earnings announcements and \n     business executives' comments about their plans for such \n     capital spending. Some staff members also had been working \n     the phones, asking companies specific questions about their \n     spending plans.\n       What Fed officials and the staff found by early April was a \n     disturbingly sour attitude among corporate executives that \n     suggested many of them were hunkering down, concentrating on \n     cutting costs and slashing investment plans. The policymakers \n     concluded that quick Fed action was needed to try to break \n     that psychological mind-set lest it undermine the gradual \n     pickup in economic growth later this year that many Fed \n     officials expect. And the officials decided they could not \n     wait until their next regular meeting, scheduled for May 15.\n       So on April 18, Greenspan convened an 8:30 a.m. conference-\n     call meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's \n     top policymaking group. That group lowered the Fed's target \n     for overnight interest rates by half a percentage point, to \n     4.5 percent. In a separate action, the Fed board reduced the \n     discount rate, the interest rate financial institutions pay \n     when they borrow directly from one of the Fed's 12 regional \n     reserve banks, by the same half-point.\n       This picture emerges from interviews with sources who spoke \n     on the condition of anonymity, Wall Street analysts and \n     public comments by several Fed officials.\n       The Fed's moves surprised financial markets, for two \n     reasons.\n       First, the most recently published economic statistics \n     suggested that, while the U.S. economy was still weak, some \n     sectors had begun to improve. Some private forecasters had \n     even begun to revise their predictions for growth upward \n     modestly.\n       Second, several presidents of the regional Fed banks had \n     made recent speeches noting the signs of improvement, which \n     the markets interpreted as suggesting that urgent action on \n     rates was not needed.\n       For some investors and analysts, the clincher came from \n     William Poole, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve \n     Bank, on April 10. After a speech in Dyersburg, Tenn., Poole \n     told reporters that the Fed's target for overnight rates \n     should be changed only at the FOMC's eight regularly \n     scheduled meetings each year, except in ``compelling'' \n     circumstances.\n       ``There are compelling times when quick action is \n     necessary, but this is not one of them,'' Poole asserted.\n       Remarks the same day in a speech by Jack Guynn, Poole's \n     counterpart at the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank, also implied \n     a desire to act at regularly scheduled meetings rather than \n     at other times. And two weeks earlier, Anthony Santomero, \n     president of the Philadelphia Fed, had said, ``I do not think \n     the Fed should routinely take policy actions for the sole \n     purpose of boosting expectations or merely to affect \n     confidence.''\n       A few weeks earlier, at its March 20 meeting, the FOMC had \n     cut its rate target by half a point and hinted clearly that \n     it might cut rates again if necessary before the May meeting. \n     In the statement, the committee said that, given the weak and \n     uncertain economic outlook, ``when the economic situation \n     could be evolving rapidly, the Federal Reserve will need to \n     monitor developments closely.''\n       The FOMC had used similar wording in an announcement after \n     its mid-December meeting, intending to signal that it would \n     consider making a rate cut before its next regular meeting. \n     But more market participants did not pick up that signal and \n     were therefore very surprised when the Fed lowered its rate \n     target by half a point on Jan. 3. The reappearance of that \n     language in March initially convinced many investors and \n     analysts that another reduction was likely during the long \n     eight-week period between the March and May meetings.\n       But as April wore on, and the tone of new economic data \n     improved a bit and some Fed officials suggested no Fed action \n     was in the offering, market expectations for a rate cut \n     evaporated.\n       So when the Fed moved on April 18, some analysts concluded \n     that Fed officials must have decided that a rate cut would \n     have a greater impact if it came as a surprise to investors \n     and business executives. If that were the case, then the \n     president's remarks must have been part of a coordinated plan \n     intended to mislead market participants, the analysts said.\n       To most Fed officials, the notion of coordinating \n     statements of all the policymakers is almost laughable. \n     Public statements by one policymaker or another often leave \n     others in the group shaking their heads. That clearly was the \n     case when Poole so specifically ruled out an inter-meeting \n     move.\n       Furthermore, historically there has always been a certain \n     tension between Fed officials in Washington and the 12 \n     Federal Reserve Bank presidents scattered across the country. \n     Some of that tension has involved issues of who has what \n     powers within the system, which is largely dominated by the \n     chairman.\n       The bank presidents carefully guard their limited \n     independence, even to the point of rarely conferring with one \n     another on monetary policy outside of formal meetings. Some \n     of the presidents do send drafts of the speeches to \n     Washington, where the Fed board and staff read them and may \n     make some suggestions for changes. But there is no attempt to \n     coordinate statements and the presidents are free to ignore \n     suggestions.\n       This geographic separation contrasts with the weekly Fed \n     board meeting in Washington, usually on Monday mornings, at \n     which reports on the state of the economy are presented by \n     the staff and discussed by the board members. Fed officials \n     would not discuss the extent to which the reserve banks' \n     presidents were apprised of the board staff's findings as it \n     gathered up details of corporate announcements and made \n     telephone inquiries about business investment plans.\n       Nor has there been any public indication of whether there \n     were any dissents registered during the April 18 conference \n     call. The minutes of that meeting, along with those from the \n     preceding regular FOMC session March 20, will be released two \n     days after the upcoming May 15 meeting.\n       The Fed's announcement following last month's unexpected \n     rate cut highlighted the policymakers' concerns about \n     business attitudes and spending plans, and mentioned other \n     uncertainties about consumer spending and the demand for U.S. \n     exports. After noting some of the same positive economic \n     signs the bank presidents had mentioned in their speeches, \n     the FOMC said:\n       ``Nonetheless, capital investment has continued to soften \n     and the persistent erosion in current and expected \n     profitability, in combination with rising uncertainty about \n     the business outlook, seems poised to dampen capital spending \n     going forward. This potential restraint, together with the \n     possible effects of earlier reductions in equity wealth on \n     consumption and the risk of slower growth abroad, threatens \n     to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak. As a \n     consequence, the committee agreed that an adjustment in the \n     stance of policy is warranted during this extending \n     intermeeting period.''\n       In addition to economic worries, the condition of the stock \n     market likely helps explain some of the timing of the April \n     rate cut.\n       While Greenspan and other Fed officials maintain they are \n     not in the business of targeting stock prices, they readily \n     acknowledge that the market can have a significant impact on \n     the economy and that does concern them. For example, the \n     weakness in the stock market over the past year is a factor \n     in business investment decisions because the market can be a \n     source of inexpensive funding for new plants and equipment.\n       But if investors were still driving stock prices downward--\n     as appeared to be the case until the first part of April--a \n     surprise rate cut might have had little impact on the market. \n     Like an intervention in foreign exchange markets to affect \n     the value of a currency, officials felt it would be better to \n     wait until the market appeared to have hit bottom and was on \n     its way up.\n       As the market began to improve during the week before the \n     rate cut, another factor came into play--Easter. The market \n     was to be closed on Friday, April 13, and was to close early \n     the day before, and under such circumstances trading volume \n     is usually low. So if one goal, likely a subsidiary one, was \n     to give the market a boost, the following week was probably a \n     better bet.\n       Now, of course, attention has turned to what the Fed will \n     do May 15. Most analysts expect a further reduction in the \n     target for overnight rates, by either a quarter of a point or \n     a half-point. The latter would bring the rate target down to \n     4 percent, it lowest in seven years.\n       Some analysts think the Fed will stop at 4 percent, whether \n     it gets there in one step or two. That could well be the case \n     since a significant member of Fed officials believe economic \n     growth will gradually improve in the second half of the year, \n     though they generally stress the uncertainty of the outlook.\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\n      A smaller group of analysts thinks the economy will prove \n     stubbornly weak and that the target for overnight rates will \n     bottom out at 3.5 percent.\n       But with rates as low as they are likely to be after May 15 \n     and only six weeks until the subsequent FOMC meeting in late \n     June, a third surprise rate reduction between meetings this \n     year can be only a very remote possibility.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2001]\n\n                      Wall Street Feels Labor Pain\n\n                      (By Jessica Doyle Belvedere)\n\n       The government released fresh evidence this morning the \n     U.S. economy continues to weaken.\n       The April employment report handed Wall Street a bag of bad \n     news. The labor market showed the steepest job losses in over \n     a decade as the unemployment rate vaulted to a high not seen \n     since October 1998.\n       Non-farm payroll jobs plunged 223,000, rebuffing \n     expectations of a gain of 21,000 and pushing the unemployment \n     rate to 4.5 percent, up from 4.3 percent in March. That is \n     the highest jobless rate since October 1998 and higher than \n     the consensus 4.4 percent forecast. Meanwhile, average hourly \n     earnings rose 0.4 percent.\n       Manufacturing was the hardest hit sector of the economy, as \n     employment fell 104,000 in the ninth consecutive monthly \n     decline and the largest since August. The report also showed \n     that job losses were widespread. However retail and \n     government operations added to their payrolls.\n       Wall Street is particularly tuned into this morning's \n     report since the labor market is a key driver of consumer \n     confidence, which in turn impacts spending patterns. With the \n     economy weakening since last summer, consumers may curtail \n     spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. \n     Thus far, consumer spending has been resilient and helped to \n     buoy the overall economy.\n       The report also raises the stakes that the Federal Reserve \n     will make another aggressive interest rate cut later this \n     month. The Fed has acted four times this year to stimulate \n     the flagging economy.\n       Gerald D. Cohen, Senior Economist at Merrill Lynch believes \n     the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points at its May 15th, \n     and by August fed funds will stand at 3.5 percent. ``We still \n     don't think the economy is going into recession. Spending has \n     softened but it will be ok. The Fed will help spur growth \n     when the rate hikes come on line. And enough sectors are \n     holding up that they will keep the economy from slipping into \n     a recession.''\n       Wall Street is bearing the brunt of the weaker-than-\n     expected reading. As of 9:50 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones \n     industrial average had fallen 104 points or nearly 1 percent. \n     Meanwhile, the Nasdaq dropped 48 points, or 2.19 percent, \n     after losing 3.4 percent on Thursday.\n       The drumbeat of anemic labor data continued Thursday, \n     prompting investors to question the odds of an economic \n     rebound, and therefore an earnings rebound in the latter half \n     of the year.\n       Thursday's report on the labor market showed new claims for \n     unemployment benefits rose by 9,000 to 421,000 for the week \n     of April 28. The report's 4-week moving average, with \n     smoothes out statistical blips, rose to 405,000, the highest \n     level of unemployment claims since October 1992. \n     Additionally, a job-placement firm that tracks layoffs \n     reported that businesses in April announced plans to \n     eliminate 165,600 jobs, a record in the survey's 8-year \n     history.\n       Another economic indicator proved troubling to investors. \n     The non-manufacturing portion of National Association of \n     Purchasing Management's monthly report fell to a reading of \n     47.1 percent in April from 50.3 percent in March. Any reading \n     below the 50 percent benchmark signals economic contraction, \n     and the gauge indicated that the economic downturn may be \n     broadening.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2001]\n\n                Fed Finds Slowdown Is Widespread in U.S.\n\n                              (By Greg Ip)\n\n       WASHINGTON.--Despite a flurry of upbeat news, the economy's \n     worst days may not be behind it after all.\n       The Federal Reserve's latest report on regional economic \n     conditions offered little evidence that the slowdown is over. \n     ``Almost all districts report a slow pace of economic \n     activity in March and early April,'' the Fed said yesterday. \n     ``Labor-market tightness has eased in almost every \n     district.''\n       The report, known as the beige book, summarizes economic \n     conditions in the 12 Federal Reserve districts and is used by \n     policy makers to determine monetary policy. the policy makers \n     meet next on May 15.\n       To be sure, much of the news lately has been positive. The \n     economy grew at a 2% annual rate in the first quarter, double \n     expectations; in April, stocks had one of their best months \n     in years; and the latest signs from manufacturing suggest the \n     sector is bottoming out. Yesterday, the Commerce Department \n     said factory orders rose 1.8% in March from February, \n     seasonally adjusted, thanks mostly to transportation.\n       On closer inspection, however, the picture is less \n     comforting. While consumer spending was surprisingly \n     resilient in the first quarter, it weakened as the quarter \n     progressed. In March and April, a key variable in the \n     spending equation--employment--worsened.\n       Last Friday's report on first-quarter gross domestic \n     product ``is telling you what's going on outside your window \n     over the past few months. It's not a good leading \n     indicator,'' said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at the \n     Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York. By contrast, \n     initial claims for unemployment insurance ``are going the \n     wrong way fast,'' he said. Claims topped 400,000 in late \n     April, the highest in five years and up 44% from a year \n     earlier.\n       Mr. Achuthan noted that while the National Association of \n     Purchasing Management's index of manufacturing activity rose \n     a touch in April from March, the employment portion fell. \n     That suggests job cuts are broadening.\n       Yesterday's Fed report said that retail sales, after \n     weakening in March, picked up in April. But this may have \n     been due to ``Eastern sales and better weather,'' according \n     to businesses in the Dallas district. The beige book found \n     housing demand remained firm, but auto sales were more mixed, \n     ``Almost across the board . . . districts note that higher \n     gas prices appear to have reduced demand for new SUVs, luxury \n     vehicles and trucks.''\n       In the St. Louis district, layoffs have hit both the Old \n     and New Economy alike: steel, timber, electronics, plastics \n     and high-tech companies. In the Boston district, discount \n     retailers said that ``demand has softened because their \n     lower-income customers are facing a fuel-price squeeze.''\n       Still, the fact the economy grew as much as it did in the \n     first quarter does suggest improved prospects for avoiding a \n     recession, which is often defined as two consecutive quarters \n     of declining GDP.\n       ``Much of the inventory correction is behind us, as the \n     ratio of real inventories to private final sales has now \n     fallen back to the level of the first half of the last \n     year,'' noted forecasting firm Marcoeconomic Advisers LLC of \n     St. Louis, which said it is more comfortable with its \n     relatively upbeat forecast. It also cited a number of \n     positives: The Fed cut interest rates half a percentage point \n     April 18; stocks are recovering; and a tax cut is more \n     likely.\n       Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Robert \n     Parry said yesterday that he ``seriously doubts'' that the \n     nation's economy will plunge into a recession, given the \n     Fed's four rapid and aggressive rate cuts this year. \n     Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said its \n     gauge of business activity had improved to a level suggesting \n     the likelihood of recession had fallen.\n       The economy has benefited from the fact that consumer \n     spending held up while businesses slashed inventories. \n     Consumer spending may weaken now, but inventory cutting is \n     less likely to compound that. ``Production and demand are \n     kind of weaving around each other, and if you keep getting \n     that you probably won't have a recession,'' said Edward \n     McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs. ``The bid \n     intellectual battle is more, `How firm a recovery can you \n     expect?' '' Stock and bond markets are anticipating a solid \n     recovery, but ``we think the economy is in for an extended \n     period of sluggishness.''\n       One of the factors likely to keep growth anemic is cuts to \n     capital spending. Though business investment in equipment \n     fell less than expected in the first quarter, there is no \n     turnaround in sight. Technology shares have rallied, but more \n     on hopes that the sector has hit bottom than actual signs of \n     increased demand. Semiconductor prices, for example, have \n     actually weakened in recent weeks, suggesting those hopes are \n     premature.\n\n\n                             factory orders\n\n       Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures for \n     manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Mar.

In March, the jobless rate ticked up a notch to 4.3 \n     percent. April's rate was the highest since October 1998, \n     when unemployment also stood at 4.5 percent.\n       Both the increase in the unemployment rate and the cut in \n     jobs surprised many analysts. They were predicting that the \n     unemployment rate would rise to 4.4 percent and that \n     businesses actually would add jobs during the month.\n       Businesses cut their payrolls in April by 223,000 jobs, the \n     largest reduction since February 1991, when payrolls fell by \n     259,000. It was the second month in a row that businesses \n     trimmed their payrolls. In March, payrolls fell by 53,000, \n     according to revised figures, a smaller reduction than the \n     government previously reported.\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\n       In April, job losses were widespread except in retail and \n     government, which added to their payrolls.\n       The unemployment numbers follow the Federal Reserve's \n     surprise interest rate cut by one-half point last month--the \n     fourth reduction this year in the Fed's campaign to ward off \n     recession. Analysts have said further rate cuts are likely at \n     the central bank's May 15 meeting.\n       With unemployment expected to continue inching up, some \n     economists worry that consumers might rein in spending and \n     further weaken the struggling economy.\n       Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of all economic \n     activity and has helped buoy the economy during the downturn.\n       Some companies are coping by sharply cutting production, \n     leading to reductions in workers' hours and overtime, and \n     forcing thousands of layoffs.\n       The New York Times announced this week that it would cut \n     100 jobs after already laying off 100 people at its online \n     unit and offering buyouts to other employees. That followed \n     recent announcements at Morgan Stanley, Honeywell \n     International Inc., LM Ericsson and Texas Instruments Inc.\n       Friday's report showed that manufacturing, which has been \n     bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown, continued to \n     hemorrhage, losing a huge 104,000 jobs last month. Declines \n     since June have totaled 554,000 and two-thirds of those job \n     losses have occurred in the past four months.\n       Construction, which had been adding jobs over the last \n     several months, lost 64,000 jobs in April. The government \n     said the drop may reflect in part heavy rains over part of \n     the country. The construction and housing businesses have \n     remained healthy during the economic slowdown--a key force in \n     keeping the economy out of recession.\n       Business services cut 121,000 jobs in April. Temporary \n     employment services experienced another sharp decline of \n     108,000 last month, and have lost 370,000 jobs since \n     September.\n       Seasonal hiring in amusement and recreation services and \n     hotels was well below normal last month, with unemployment \n     declines of 30,000 and 13,000, respectively.\n       Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation, rose by \n     0.4 percent in April to $14.22 an hour. That matched the gain \n     in March. The length of the average workweek was unchanged at \n     34.3 hours in April.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Mr. President, we have discussed at considerable length \nthe educational issues that have been brought forward by the BEST bill, \nwhich is the proposal that came out of the Health Committee I serve on, \nchaired by Senator Jeffords from Vermont, and ranking member Senator \nKennedy from Massachusetts. We talked a lot about policy and the fact \nthis bill moves the policy forward to try to reform our school systems \nin a number of ways. It does not necessarily go as far as some Members \nwould like, but it is progress in areas which are in significant need \nof progress.\n  I have had a chance to speak about the need for more choice, the need \nfor basic themes such as being child centered, flexibility, has \nacademic achievement as its goal especially for low-income kids, and it \nhas accountability standards to make sure the academic standards are \nmet.\n  I have spoken on a number of specific issues such as how to deal with \nteachers, how it improves the capacity of local school districts to do \nmore to get and keep good teachers and hire good teachers.\n  I will speak about the issue of the funding in this bill and the \nfunding question generally because there has been a lot of discussion \nespecially from the other side of the aisle about how inappropriate the \nfunding levels are that the President has proposed to support the \neducational reforms he has requested.\n  When I hear these representations from the other side of the aisle, I \nam not so sure they come to the table--not to be too aggressive--with \nclean hands on the issue. The issue of funding education in this \ncountry, especially things such as special education, has been debated \nfor the last few years and it has been the Republican side of the aisle \nthat has significantly increased the commitments to educational \nfunding. I think it is appropriate to review the history of where we \nare in the area of funding.\n  First, it is most important to point out the equation for better \neducation is not more dollars equal better education. Over and over \nagain it has been shown, in study after study, that more dollars do not \nproduce better education. The key to better education is a much more \ncomplex formula than some would have Members believe. Those who suggest \nwe put more dollars in and we get better education are wrong. The key \nto education is a formula that involves, No. 1, parental involvement; \nNo. 2, good teachers; No. 3, good principles; No. 4, local control over \nthe curriculum and how the schools teach; and probably No. 5 on the \nlist, dollars. It is a mixture of these factors and other factors, of \ncourse--facilities and things like that--but primarily it is a very \ncomplex formula. It is not just more dollars means better education.\n  A number of studies have shown this relative to local dollars and \nState dollars. Regarding Federal dollars spent, the statistics are \nespecially startling. We have had a Federal program in place now for \nover 30 years, the purpose of which was to raise the level of academic \nachievement of especially low-income children. That is what we were \nfocusing on as a Federal Government. Regrettably, our success in this \narea has been singularly poor. This chart reflects this. We have spent \n$120 billion on title I, which is directed at low-income children. Yet \nthe score levels of our kids who meet this category of educational \nsupport has remained absolutely flat for all intents and purposes in \nreading and math. The spending has gone up dramatically, but the score \nlevels of these children has been flat.\n\n  In fact, the average child who comes from a low-income family today, \nwho is in the fourth grade, reads at two grade levels below a peer in \nthat class. That is true not only for the fourth but fifth and sixth, \nand naturally they fall back as they go into the eighth, ninth, and \ntenth grade to the point where this group of kids, low-income families \nand especially minority families from urban areas, are graduating at \nless than a 50-percent rate from high school, even though we spent all \nthis money.\n  One thing we know for sure is that putting money into the problem has \nnot resolved it. The issue is, What should we do? We need to reform the \nsystem. That is what the President has suggested. Through a lot of hard \nnegotiation and aggressive effort on the part of both sides of the \naisle, with Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords taking the lead, we \nhave been successful coming forward with a bill which in some ways \nsignificantly reforms the system, although it leaves out key elements I \nwould like to see, but it is still a major step in the right direction, \nespecially once the bill is amended by the underlying agreement which \nwas reached between the chairman and the ranking member and other \npeople who negotiated.\n  Reform is critical if you get something for the dollars spent. \nDollars are not the only issue.\n  Let me simply say the representation by the other side that this \nadministration is not willing to commit the dollars to support reform \nis inconsistent with the history of what has happened over the last few \nyears and who has been willing to fund what. If you look at the amount \nof funding which President Clinton suggested we put into the \neducational system over the 8 years of his administration, recognizing \nfor the first 4 years of his administration he has the deficit, the \naverage amount spent, the average increase, was about 3.3 percent. The \nbiggest increase he suggested in any given year was 3 years ago when he \nsuggested 8 percent. But generally, his increases have been proposed at \naround 4 percent, 3 percent, 2 percent in the area of spending for \neducation.\n  President Bush has suggested an increase of 11 percent in his budget, \ntwice, three times what President Clinton proposed in any budget over \nthe last 8 years. He has suggested, and he has made an offer to the \nother side which would represent a 50-percent increase in spending in \ntitle I specifically, the single largest increase ever proposed in this \nprogram by a factor of 10, by my calculations.\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\n  The simple fact is that the President has been willing to come \nforward, subject to reform being put in place, and commit the dollars \nnecessary to support those reforms. Remember something about the reform \nproposals brought forward, even as part of the agreement: There is a \nlead time to those reforms being put in place. They basically all key \noff of something called annual yearly progress, which keys off of a \ntesting regime, and the testing regime is not presumed to be effective \nor completely in place for almost 3 years, probably 4 years. It is not \nexpected, under this bill, that we will attain our goals because it \ntakes so long to ramp up to this type of a situation, for 10 years. \nThus, the money that is going into the program this year, the 50 \npercent increase which the President has been willing to propose, is a \nhuge infusion of money upfront when the reforms are not in place. It is \nreally a downpayment in anticipation of what will happen in reforms.\n\n  It is really a sign of good faith on his part to make that type of \ncommitment. He is saying, as President, I am committed to these \nreforms. I know you have to make the reforms to get decent education \nand achieve improvement in our education. But I also understand money \nis going to have to be committed. Even though I am not going to get my \nreforms immediately, I am willing to put the money upfront, and a \nsignificant amount of money, a huge amount of money in the context of \nwhat has been done in this area for years.\n  So this argument from the other side that the money is not there, \nthere is not any money there--I heard the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee come down this morning and give us an explanation of that--is \nsimply inaccurate. Not only has the President proposed to increase his \nbudget by 11 percent, not only was the budget reported out with an 11 \npercent increase in it, but he has gone much further and said, on the \nappropriating accounts, he is willing to make a much more significant \nincrease. And the people on the other side who have been negotiating \nthis matter know that. The President has agreed he will find those \ndollars within the contents of the budget that has been settled on, \nhuge dollars of increase.\n  Let's take another subject in which we have heard a lot of talk about \nmoney, IDEA, special education. This is something I have been working \non for a long time. The Senator in the chair has been working on it for \na long time. The Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the committee, \nhas been working on it for a long time. When I came to the Senate, the \nFederal Government was paying 6 percent of the cost of special \neducation. It had agreed in 1976 that it would pay 40 percent of the \ncost. So the difference, the difference between 6 percent and 40 \npercent, was being picked up by the local communities through their tax \nbase or States through their tax base. Essentially States and local \ncommunities were having to support the Federal obligation.\n  As a result, their resources were being skewed and sent places and \nbeing used to support Federal obligations when they might have wanted \nto use them to do something else at the State level. So a number of us \nmade a conscious effort to change that, and we have made huge progress. \nWe have gone from the Federal Government picking up 6 percent of the \ncost to the Federal Government today picking up almost 17 percent of \nthe cost; and we are closing in on 20 percent of the cost.\n  But who is the energizer for this? Did it come from President \nClinton? Did these additional efforts in the area of special education \ncome from President Clinton? For 8 years in a row there was essentially \nno increase sent up here by the Democratic White House to increase \nspecial education funding of any significance. Only 1 year did they \nsend anything up with any significance. In fact, in a number of years \nthey essentially flat funded this account.\n  It was not until we got a Republican Congress that this issue was \naddressed and began to be addressed aggressively. I have a chart which \nreflects this rather dramatically. This is 1996, the year the \nRepublican Congress came into being. The red accounts reflect the \nincrease in IDEA funding since that period. As you can see from this \nbar chart, it has gone up every year since there has been a Republican \nCongress. In this period, of course, you had a Democratic President.\n\n  I suggest you go back and look at the budget submissions that came \nfrom the White House during this period. You will see no increase. If \nthis were to track the budget submissions of the White House, those \nlines would be cut off right there. The increase in special education \nfunding has come as a result of aggressive initiatives coming from this \nside of the aisle.\n  The President this year has put in his budget the single largest \nincrease ever proposed by a White House in the area of special \neducation--$1 billion. So we will now exceed $7 billion in funding for \nspecial education if we follow the President's proposal. Those are real \ndollars that will significantly relieve the burden of the local \ncommunities in the area of education and specifically in the area of \nspecial education.\n  So when we hear this patter from the other side of the aisle that the \ndollars are not there to support the initiatives which the President \nhas talked about, it is simply inconsistent with the facts. There is no \nquestion but that the hundreds of billions of dollars that have been \nsuggested on the other side of the aisle are not there because they \nwere not responsible and they would not resolve the problem.\n  It was ironic, I have to admit, after 8 years of receiving \nessentially no increase or only marginal increases in title I funding \nfrom a White House controlled by the Democratic Party, that during the \nfirst few months, when the White House became controlled by the \nRepublican Party, suddenly the Democratic Party decided they needed a \n74 percent increase in funding in 1 year in this account. That was \nafter 8 years of saying they did not really need any type of increase \nof funding in this account.\n  Could it be political? I don't think so. But the fact is, the request \nwas made and so far we have heard from the other side that unless that \nrequest is met, we will be underfunding these accounts.\n  The President has proposed, as I said, in his budget and has \nsupported in his budget an 11 percent increase overall in education \nfunding. That is the single largest item of increase in his budget of \nany account, whether it is defense, NIH, whatever. He has put on the \ntable an extra $1 billion for special ed funding. And he has made an \noffer on the appropriating side relative to title I, which would \nrepresent a 50 percent increase of title I funding in the first year--\nthe first year, which is not 74 percent, but it is still a pretty \ndarned big number.\n  My view is that the President has more than gone the distance in \nputting the money on the table necessary to address the reforms which \nare in this package. The reforms are good reforms.\n  Once again, let's remember these reforms have a lead-in time which is \nfairly significant. The money is actually going to be available before \nthe reforms are in place. So I would say the President is showing \nreally good faith in this exercise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Craig amendment No. 372 is the pending \nbusiness.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. So there is an amendment before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment may be set aside temporarily and that I might offer an \namendment and hopefully get it acted upon by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 373 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I ask unanimous consent further reading of the amendment be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\n(Purpose: To provide assistance to local educational agencies to carry \n            out activities to reduce underage alcohol abuse)\n\n       On page 586, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 405.

Mr. President, the warm springtime weather brings to mind \nthe words of Shakespeare:\n\n     From you have I been absent in the spring,\n     When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,\n     Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.\n\n  But, unfortunately, all is not well with many of our youth. While \nmost of them are shedding their winter coats and playing in the warm \nsunshine, a shocking number are engaging in some very dangerous \nbehavior, dangerous both to themselves and others. I am speaking of \nalcohol abuse.\n  When I say ``dangerous behavior,'' I am talking about alcohol abuse.\n  According to a study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, get this: The \nextent of alcohol consumption by children ages 9 to 15 is startling, \nand preventing it must become a national priority.\n  Consider these facts. Three million children ages 14 through 17 are \nregular drinkers. Twenty-four percent of eighth graders have used \nalcohol in the last 30 days.\n  Let me read that again.\n  Three million children ages 14 through 17 are regular drinkers.\n  Where are the parents? They aren't around.\n  Twenty-four percent of eighth graders have used alcohol in the last \n30 days. More than 100,000 12- to 13-year-olds binge drink every month. \nMore than 100,000 youngsters 12 to 13 years old binge drink every \nmonth.\n  Ninth graders who drink are almost twice as likely to attempt suicide \nthan those who do not drink. Moreover, 40 percent of children who begin \ndrinking before the age of 15 will become alcoholics at some point in \ntheir lives.\n  Let me say that again.\n  Forty percent of children who begin drinking before the age of 18 \nwill become alcoholics at some point in their lives.\n  America has taken elaborate measures to combat the scourge of drugs. \nWe have financed police and military attacks on the drug problem. But \nthe most favored drug for Americans is alcohol. That is the most \nfavored drug--alcohol. The most commonly abused drug is widely \navailable, and it is cowardly promoted--alcohol. Walk into any liquor \nstore, show your ID card--sometimes you don't even have to do that, I \nam told--and buy your poison. It is for sale.\n\n  On television, for those who watch it--I do very little of it. I \nwatch television very seldomly. I watch it when public television has \non a truly good informative movie, such as ``Napoleon,'' or ``The Ten \nCommandants.'' I believe I saw ``The Ten Commandments.'' I know I saw \nit. But I believe it was on one of those very good programs on some \nother network, or a station other than public television. Of course, I \ndon't ask everyone to do what I do or to follow me as an example. I am \njust saying that as far as television is concerned, I select very \ncarefully the programs that I watch on television.\n  But on television, sports heroes debate whether a particular type of \nbeer tastes great or less filling.\n  On television, sports heroes debate whether a particular type of beer \ntastes great or is less filling.\n  These commercials send a not-so-subtle message to our young people \nthat drinking is what adults do, particularly adults who are popular--\nathletes, for example. Drinking is what adults do. So why don't you do \nit? If it is all right for adults, it is all right for you young \npeople.\n  Comedians joke about drunks. But drinking is no joke. And we must \nmake a greater effort to get the word out where it can have the \ngreatest impact. Drinking is no joke.\n  Don't think that the crisis of youth violence is not connected with \nalcohol. We talk about alcohol abuse. I will just say alcohol, plain \nold alcohol. We tippy-toe around about it and call it alcohol abuse. Of \ncourse, it is alcohol abuse.\n  Let me say this in addition. There are many causes of youth violence. \nThe people of this country are concerned about youth violence in the \nschools and elsewhere. There are many causes of youth violence. But \njudgment, which is not always very well developed in the young, is \nclearly impaired by alcohol.\n  My amendment would authorize $25 million, which is a very small sum \nfor this purpose, for competitive grants to be awarded to local \neducational agencies for the purpose of assisting them with the \nimplementation of innovative and effective alcohol abuse prevention \nprograms targeted at children and particularly teenagers.\n  Out of this amendment, $5 million would be set aside for the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to provide \nalcohol abuse resources to the local education agencies, as well as to \nassist them with the implementation of their program.\n  The U.S. Department of Education would work jointly with the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to develop \nthe grant application with special attention to the low-income and \nrural educational agencies.\n  This program is modeled on the National Awards Recognition Program. \nThat program rewards colleges and universities for innovative and \neffective alcohol prevention initiatives. The difference, however, is \nthat this amendment would create a program that gives funding to \nschools to create effective alcohol abuse prevention programs targeted \ntowards high school students.\n\n  Now, this is the beautiful month of May. We are heading right into \nthe time when there will be high school commencements all over the \ncountry. And all too often we read in the newspapers about what happens \nafter high school commencements in some instances: An automobile full \nof young people, who have just graduated, perhaps from high school, go \nout for a drive, they drink, they have beer in the car--may have \nwhiskey in the war--and they end up with their automobile wrapped \naround a tree. Many of those high school youngsters die on those \noccasions.\n  So let us take action now, so that springtimes for decades to come \ncan be\n\n[[Page S4386]]\n\nwholesomely enjoyed, and can orient our youth toward futures teeming \nwith possibilities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Before my colleagues respond, my good friend--and he is my good \nfriend--and he is my favorite Senator on this side of the aisle. I will \nnot say today who my favorite Senator is on the other side of the \naisle, but I have no problem doing that when the occasion arises. I \nhave several favorite Senators, but Senator Kennedy is my favorite of \nall favorites on this side of the aisle.\n  Now, you do not win friends by saying things like that, selecting \nanother individual and saying he is your favorite. I like all my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, but Senator Kennedy and I have a \nlong history and a long history of friendship. I have great admiration \nfor him.\n  But in connection with this amendment, Senator Kennedy asked me a few \ndays ago, right out of the blue sky, to quote a certain poem. That \ntests your mettle when somebody asks you to quote a poem right in front \nof the television camera. And these poems are not easy to quote in \nsituations like that. I am almost tempted, though, to quote that poem \nin connection with this amendment.\n     Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\n     Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\n     But over its terrible edge there had slipped\n     A duke and full many a peasant.\n     So the people said something would have to be done,\n     But their projects did not at all tally;\n     Some said, ``Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,''\n     Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     But the cry for the ambulance carried the day.\n     For it spread through the neighboring city;\n     A fence may be useful or not, it is true,\n     But each heart became brimful of pity\n     For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff;\n     And the dwellers in highway and alley\n     Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,\n     But an ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     ``For the cliff is all right, if you're careful.'' they said,\n     ``And, if folks even slip and are dropping,\n     It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much.\n     As the shock down below when they're stopping.''\n     So day after day, as these mishaps occurred,\n     Quick forth would these rescuers sally\n     To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,\n     With their ambulance down in the valley.\n\n     Then an old sage remarked: ``It's a marvel to me\n     That people give far more attention\n     To repairing results than to stopping the cause,\n     When they'd much better aim at prevention.\n     Let us stop at its source all this mischief,'' cried he,\n     ``Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally;\n     If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense\n     With the ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n     ``Oh, he's a fanatic,'' the others rejoined,\n     ``Dispense with the ambulance? Never!\n     He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could;\n     No! No! We'll support them forever.\n     Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?\n     And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?\n     Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence,\n     While the ambulance works down in the valley?''\n\n     But a sensible few, who are practical too.\n     Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;\n     They believe that prevention is better than cure.\n     And their party will soon be the stronger.\n     Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,\n     And while other philanthropists dally,\n     They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence\n     On the cliff that hangs over the valley.\n\n     Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,\n     For the voice of true wisdom is calling,\n     ``To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best\n     To prevent other people from falling.''\n     Better close up the source of temptation and crime\n     Than deliver from dungeon or galley;\n     Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff\n     Than an ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n  That is what this amendment does. It helps--it is not enough--but it \nhelps, it begins a program of putting a fence around the edge of a \ncliff to rescue these people, prevent their going to the dungeon or \ngalley. I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment, that we \nmight put up a strong fence around the edge of the cliff and keep some \nof these young people, hopefully, from bringing disaster upon \nthemselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just about a week ago, Senator Byrd was \naddressing the Senate on a matter of importance, and I took just a \nmoment of his time to ask him if he could refresh our recollection of a \npoem that he previously recited about the fence and the ambulance down \nin the valley.\n  As things would have it, there was intervening business, and the good \nSenator was kind and patient enough to permit others to proceed. It was \nlate in the afternoon, close to the evening, and Senator Byrd agreed to \nrespond to my request for recitation of this poem at a later time.\n  Little did I know then that his presentation would have such meaning \nin connection with the amendment that he offers today, to try to \nstrengthen the academic achievement of children in this country. His \namendment is absolutely on point, in that it recognizes that investment \nin prevention is a much wiser investment than providing remedies after \nthe fact.\n  Prevention is what the Senator's amendment is really all about. That \nis the central theme of the Senator's amendment today in terms of \nawakening awareness among our young people across this country about \nthe extraordinary dangers and devastations of alcohol.\n  The good Senator from West Virginia is not a member of our Education \nCommittee, but I am hopeful that in the remaining time the Senate \nconsiders the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, at some time the \nSenator will recall for us the importance of a quality education.\n  There is no one in this Chamber who can speak more eloquently or more \npassionately or more knowledgeably than he about the basic importance \nof starting a young person off on the right path towards academic \nachievement. And there is no one who can tell the story more \neffectively about the challenges that are presented to young people, \nand the resolve they must have in order to earn the legitimate \nscholarship that results from application of hard work in the \ndevelopment of one's academic abilities.\n  I do not think there is anyone I know who can remember the names of \ntheir third, fourth, and fifth grade teachers, as the Senator from West \nVirginia can, the subject matter that was taught, and the lessons \nlearned in those classrooms many years ago. I know of no one who can \nmake a more persuasive or passionate statement of support for the \nimportance of a good education as a matter of national priority than \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  I will certainly urge that his amendment be adopted. But more \nimportant, I hope that as this body is considering the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act and as we get weighted down in the particulars \nof the legislation, at some time during this period, he might remind us \nall of the importance of education in a young life and the difference \nthat makes.\n  He has a remarkable story. I can remember many of the good Senator's \nspeeches. But his past speeches on the importance of a quality \neducation is always one I remember with such clarity and such \nprofundity. It is an extraordinary story. I hope at the end, or \nsometime during the debate that story of the early educational years of \nBob Byrd will remind us all about what we hope this legislation is \nreally about.\n  We are talking about different features of the legislation this \nmorning, as we did yesterday and we will next week. But Senator Byrd's \nstory brings it all together.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this amendment to our attention. I \nthink it adds a very important dimension to this legislation. I hope it \nwill be accepted at this time, if my good friend from Vermont believes \nit is appropriate to do so.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Again, I commend my good friend from West Virginia on a \nmost eloquent statement. I shall in no way try to match or improve upon \nwhat he has said. I strongly believe in what he is trying to do.\n  Senator Kennedy has most eloquently expressed his views and thoughts \nabout not only the amendment but the Senator's past. I, for one, admire \nhim every time I hear him speak. It always lifts my day a little bit.\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\n  I certainly would accept the amendment. I am checking now to find out \nfrom other Members to see if we can do that. We cannot do it at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators. I hope we can adopt \nthis amendment today. I would be willing to do it on a voice vote if \nthe Senators find it possible.\n  While I am on my feet, let me say, with the utmost sincerity and \ngratitude, that the words of my friend, Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, are words I shall always recall as long as I live. These \nwords coming from him, and also the words of the Senator from Vermont, \nare most gratifying.\n  Senator Kennedy has led in the fight for better legislation and for \nmore appropriations for the education of our young people. He has been \ndoing this for a long time. When I was majority leader of the Senate \nseveral years ago, Senator Kennedy was one of those committee chairmen. \nHe was almost unique, I would say, but there were one or two others: \nScoop Jackson, who was a Senator, and when he came to the floor as \nchairman of the committee, he had done his homework; he was well \nprepared. He and Senator Kennedy were two I can think quickly of as \nbeing Senators who turned out legislation which later became the law of \nthe land.\n  I can remember those days when I would compliment Senator Kennedy on \nthe work he was doing, and I, from time to time, commented that the \nlegislation he brought from his committee usually became a statute. I \ncan't remember today any Senator who exceeded or who equals the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, in developing language for statutes; I \ncan't think of any Senator who exceeds or even equals Senator Kennedy \nin that respect.\n  It might surprise some people around here to know that in the time I \nhave served, I have yet to find a statute which bears the name of \nWebster; I have yet to find a statute which is the Clay law; I have yet \nto find a statute that was authored by John C. Calhoun. Some people \njudge Senators by the number of laws that bear the Senators' names. \nThat is not the proper standard. When I think of the three greatest \nSenators of all time, I think of Webster, Calhoun, and Clay because \nthey were great Senators for many reasons. But I find that they were \nnot great Senators because of statutes or laws that bear their name.\n  But I can find many statutes that became such because of Senator \nKennedy's leadership. And in no area of legislation should one be more \nproud than that of being a leader in promoting and developing and \nmanaging legislation that becomes law. There is nothing better than \ndoing this in the field of education. Those are the best resources for \nour children.\n  I am going to accede to Senator Kennedy's request, if I can, and try \nto develop a few words that will respond to his magnificent accolades. \nI certainly salute him as my leader in the field of education. I thank \nhim for what he said today. I thank him for his service. I thank both \nSenators for their acceptance of this amendment. I hope we can pass it \nin the Senate today by a voice vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, again, I thank my friend and colleague \nfor his kind words.\n  I am also grateful for the Senator's extraordinary service. I say to \nmy colleagues, if they want to find out what a Senator's Senator is all \nabout, travel to West Virginia with Bob Byrd. And if you want to know \nwhat the history of this body is, read his lengthy history of this \ninstitution.\n  There are many reasons we are indebted to his service in this \ninstitution. There is no one who fights to preserve the institution as \nSenator Byrd does, and to those of us who love and respect this \ninstitution, he stands as Number One. History will not show his equal.\n  Mr. President, now I want to take a few moments to review a very \nimportant aspect of this education debate, and that is the issue of \nfunding for the educational reforms that are before us today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table describing the history of \npast efforts for funding Title I and other elementary and secondary \neducation programs be printed in the Record in refutation of Senator \nGregg's statement on education earlier this morning.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     ESEA BUDGET REQUESTS VS.

On the education budget, I want to emphasize something \nthat is enormously important and to which the American people must pay \nattention: this budget conference agreement, which arrived at 2 a.m. \nthis morning, includes an outline of what will be invested in education \nover the next 10 years. This is the budget that has the support of some \nRepublicans in Congress and the administration.\n  If we look at education and what the funding will be over the next 10 \nyears, I hope our Members will look at the part of the budget--the \nreference is H1867, in yesterday's Congressional Record from the House. \nLook at the figures there.\n  Fiscal year 2001, budget authority of $76.9 billion, outlays of \n$69.850 billion; then for 2002, $81.234 billion in budget authority, \n$76.742 billion in outlays: that is about a 5-percent real increase \nafter adjusting for inflation. The Department of Education's FY 2002 \nBudget Summary confirms, on page 2: ``The President is requesting $44.5 \nbillion in discretionary appropriations for the Department of Education \nin fiscal year 2002, . . . an increase of $2.5 billion or 5.9 percent \nover the 2001 program level.''\n  Fiscal year 2003, the outlays go from $76 billion to $81 billion. \nFiscal years 2004 to 2005, it goes from $81 billion to $83 billion; \n2005, it goes from $83 billion to $85 billion; 2006, $87 billion; 2007, \n$89 billion; 2008, $92 billion; 2009, $94 billion; 2010, $96 billion; \n2011, $99 billion. Flat funding for education for the next 10 years \nafter accounting for inflation. This is the guidepost for educational \nfunding for the next 10 years. Flat funding. No increase.\n  With respect to the priorities for this country, how do we reach the \nrecognition that education is the No. 1 priority for this country when \nthe administration and the Republican leadership in the House and the \nSenate have said no increase; none whatsoever. Flat funding in the area \nof education, not for next year or the year after, but flat funding \nover every one of the remaining 8 years of this decade, that is the \nguidepost in this budget proposal.\n  That is absolutely unacceptable, Mr. President. Unacceptable. How are \nwe going to explain it? When are we going to hear the explanation from \nthe budgeteers? What happened to the Senate vote on the Harkin \namendment where, in a bipartisan way, the Senate voted to increase \neducation investments by $250 billion over the next ten years. We \nwanted funding for Title I. We wanted funding for the Head Start \nProgram. We wanted funding for the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Program. We still want to fund an investment in children. Why? \nBecause they are our future. We know if we do not invest in our \nchildren, they are not going to be able to fully participate in our \nsociety, in our economy, and be productive and creative members of \nsociety. That is what this debate is all about.\n  There is no issue that comes before us that more defines what we are \nabout as a society than whether we are going to have a strong \neducational system.\n  What is Republicans' real message? On the one hand, we hear education \nis the No. 1 priority. Yet here's the budget, Mr. President, funding \nover the next 10 years. This is absolutely shocking. It certainly does \nnot reflect the opinion of the Senate when yesterday the Senate \nresponded to the superb amendment that was offered by Senator Hagel, a \nRepublican, Senator Harkin, a Democrat, dealing with special needs of \nchildren and recognizing we made a commitment to the States that we \nwere going to provide 40 percent of funding for special education. We \nare at about 15, 17 percent of the\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nfunding now. Yesterday, this body went on record saying, yes, we want \nto keep our promise to those children, families, and local communities.\n\n  In the evening yesterday, again in a bipartisan effort with Senator \nDodd and Senator Collins, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to provide \nfull funding for the Title I program over the next 10 years. It \nprovided a virtual doubling of the number of children who would be \nreached in the first year under Title I. It was adopted overwhelmingly \nlast evening, Mr. President.\n  Nonetheless, we have in this budget flat funding for the next 10 \nyears. Unacceptable, I say.\n  If we look further in the budget on pages H1868-69 of yesterday's \nHouse Congressional Record, the Republican budget says that $336.2 \nbillion in non-defense discretionary spending will be available next \nyear. But the Congressional Budget Office tells us that the amount of \nfunding necessary to provide current services over the next year, \nincluding education, health, NIH, and assistance for Seniors under the \nOlder Americans Act, is $343 billion. Just look here in chapter 4, of \nthe Congressional Budget Office's Spending Outlook, Table 4-4: $343 \nbillion will be necessary for all government non-defense discretionary \nspending in 2002. But look at what the budget says, it limits this to \n$336 billion. This means the budget provides $7 billion less, which \nwill mean there will be cuts in education, health, the environment, or \nother essential government services.\n  These are the facts. We can talk about our priorities. We can talk \nabout what the administration is thinking about, but this budget shows \nRepublicans' true economic objectives. They focus on tax cuts for the \nsuper wealthy, period. This budget document says we will have in excess \nof a $1.2 trillion tax cuts going to some of the wealthiest individuals \nin our country and we will have flat funding in education.\n  I cannot understand how Members of this body can support this budget \nand say we give education a priority. This is so discouraging.\n  We have before us good education reform legislation as a result of a \nbipartisan effort to ensure we are going to combine robust resources \nand accountability to get constructive and productive results from \nschools.\n  While we work to make our education policy the best, under this \nbudget, we effectively turn our backs on the needs of students across \nthis country. It's a disgrace.\n  I take issue with comments made earlier about what has been happening \nin Title I. I heard we really don't need to fund Title I because it \nwill take so long for the programs we are passing to be put into \neffect: It will take time to develop the tests; it will take time for \nthe schools to allegedly fail over a period of time; it will take time \nbefore we need the resources. I question that. That is not my reading \nof the specific language.\n  This bill talks about school improvement for failing schools. We know \ntoday we have 10,000 failing schools. This particular legislation has \napproaches to help local communities and assist them to get out of the \ncategory of failing schools. That will take resources. We don't have to \nwait 2, 3, 4, 5 years. We don't have to do that. We know there are \n10,000 failing schools in the country today. We know the average cost \nis $180,000 to turn around a failing school. There are some 57 \nresearch-based, comprehensive school reform models that have been \nidentified by the New American Schools Corporation as proven and \nsuccessful. School committees choose their preferred model. The \ndecision is made locally.\n  For a $1.8 billion commitment, we could begin turning around every \nfailing school tomorrow. We have not gotten that. That is what we want \nto try to do. People say, wait for the bill to go into effect. It will \nhave to be in effect 3 or 4 or 5 years before we force action to turn \naround failing schools. But there are 10,000 failing schools that can \nbe turned around now. The parents want them improved now. Why wait?\n  In the BEST bill, we seek to turn around those 10,000 needy schools \nnow. Under the budget the administration suggested, we will be able to \nreach only 2,440 schools. This is a missed opportunity. It makes no \nsense. Do we want a $1.2 trillion tax cut or do we want to take a small \npercent of that, less than half of 1 percent that would fund these \nprograms? We ought to have the vote on that. Should we have less than a \none-half of 1 percent reduction in the tax program to try to turn \naround the schools, or shall we go ahead and give the tax cut?\n  The Budget Committees, that are the voice of the Republican majority, \nsay we will shortchange the schools. We are resisting that. The Senate \nis resisting that in a bipartisan way. Those votes last night were \nbipartisan. That is a clear reflection of where we are. We are very \nhopeful of using those votes to try to persuade the Administration to \nmake the kinds of investments in the children needed.\n  With all respect to those who spoke earlier today, I would like to \nreview what has happened historically in terms of the NAEP test. The \nfederal government contributes 6 or 7 cents out of every education \ndollar spent. Education is primarily the State and local \nresponsibility. On the federal level, we try to target aid toward the \nneediest children. Fifteen percent of the children in this country are \npoor. You have to be desperately poor to qualify under Title I. There \nare some 10.3 million children we identify as needy for the purposes of \nTitle I. But we provide enough funding to reach only 3.5 million of \nthose children. We think we ought to fully fund Title I and really \nleave no child behind.\n  In recent years, we have seen NAEP achievement gains by needy \nchildren. They have been gradually going up with regard to white \nchildren, gradually going up with regard to Hispanics, gradually going \nup with regard to blacks. What is most encouraging, you can say look \nhow little progress has been made, or you can say progress has been \nmade. We are talking about the poorest of the poor, the neediest of the \nneedy.\n\n  The fact we added 5 million disabled children, mainstreamed them, \nwith physical and mental challenges, the fact we have had an explosion \nof homelessness, the fact we have had an explosion in the number of \nmigrant children impacted, and we have had a dramatic increase in the \nimmigrant children attending schools--all those have impacted \nachievement levels. We have had a very significant increase in those \nspeaking different languages, foreign languages, and difficulties \nassociated with that.\n  In spite of these new challenges, the achievement gap between \nchildren of different races and classes has been reduced. We see in 13-\nyear-olds, in math, a 46-percent achievement gap reduced to a 32 \npercent gap, a 30-percent change. We are moving in the right direction.\n  The reduced achievement gap has come without the further improvements \nbrought in this legislation--improvements that will strengthen the \nquality of education for the teachers, improve the curriculum, give the \nschools more authority, fund supplementary services in the afterschool \nprograms, and come from an insistence on results.\n  We have seen even under the old system that we have been making some \nprogress--not as much as any of us would like, but we have seen the \nlines moving in the right direction, which has to be a part of our \nnational purpose and goal. In this case, it was for 13-year-olds in the \narea of math.\n  In reading, for 9-year-olds, there was a 44 percent gap in the 1970s, \nand a 29-percent gap in 1996. The best results show minority students \nare moving in the right direction--there has been a 34-percent change \nin the last 30 years. It is not a dramatic change, but when you look at \nthe expansion of the student body and the significant expansion of \nstudents, poor children getting poorer, and all the other factors that \nimpact children, it is still moving along--not as fast as any Members \nwould like, but we are making some progress under the NAEP tests.\n  This chart shows for 17-year-olds, in reading, a 52-percent gap at \nthe start of the program, down to a 29-percent gap at the present time; \nfairly flat at the top, and moving up with regard to minority students.\n  For the 9-year-old kids, in science, a 57-percent gap has been \nreduced to a 41-percent gap, a 28-percent change. Look at the gap in \nminority students. They have moved up in an important way.\n  We have made some progress. We spend $400 billion a year on K-12. The \nmain federal program is only $8 billion,\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\nabout 2 cents out of each dollar spent, and we are still making \nprogress.\n  Yesterday, I used the example of the special situations where we had \nmany of the programs we have supported and illustrated in this \nlegislation that have resulted in dramatic improvements for children.\n  I will just mention a few.\n\n       Goethe Middle School, Sacramento, CA--With chronically low \n     test scores across the curriculum, Geothe Middle School \n     recently decided to attack its academic problems at their \n     root: Many students had never learned to read well. Beginning \n     with the 1997-98 school year, Goethe took a radical step. It \n     trained all instructional staff in Corrective Reading and \n     used fourth period for a mandatory reading class for \n     virtually every student. Although this DI implementation is \n     still too new to judge, preliminary data are encouraging. In \n     the fall of 1997, only 11 percent of Goethe students could \n     read above a sixth-grade level, while 12 percent were at a \n     ``high average'' level for sixth grade. In other words, fewer \n     than one in four students had much hope of keeping up with \n     the reading assignments usually required of middle school \n     students. By the end of the school year, the number of \n     students reading at least at this basic level had more than \n     doubled: 22 percent were at the ``high average'' level, 26 \n     percent were above.\n\n  This legislation will expand that type of program.\n\n       Kalispell, MT--The only independent study of Early Steps \n     was conducted in Kalispell, Montana, a small school district \n     with many lower- and middle-class Caucasian families \n     attending Title I schools. In general, the student selected \n     into the study were among the most economically disadvantaged \n     in the district. All students in the study were also \n     performing in the lowest 20th percentile of their class in \n     reading and on related tasks, such as alphabetic knowledge, \n     spelling, word attack and recognition of words in context. \n     Students were assigned to two matched groups, receiving \n     different types of tutorial interventions. After one year, \n     students who had been taught using Early Steps significantly \n     outperformed their peers in reading assessments. In addition, \n     52 percent of the Early Steps students were found to be \n     reading at or above grade level, compared to 23 percent of \n     students in the control group.\n\n  We know that this program can work.\n\n       Cameron Elementary School, Fairfax County, VA--In Fairfax \n     County, Cameron Elementary School's reading scores were below \n     average, and well below those of many schools in the \n     district. With as many as 40 percent of students suffering \n     from low reading achievement, the school decided to implement \n     ECRI as a summer school intervention. By the end of the \n     summer, not only had students in the 4th and 6th grades \n     increased their scores by 10 points, but they also ranked at \n     or above the national average on standardized tests.\n\n  We have adopted the kinds of programs there which have been \nsuccessful.\n\n       Arkansas--The state of Arkansas approved Reading Recovery \n     for statewide use in 1988. From 1991 to 1994, 1,088 \n     struggling students received the full RR program (defined as \n     having received 60 lessons). Of those students, 940 (86 \n     percent) attained grade level. Fifty-nine students who had \n     successfully completed the program were followed for an \n     additional two years. Compared to a random sample of non-RR \n     students, the RR students tended to perform as well or better \n     on measures of dictation, spelling and text reading in both \n     the third and fourth grades.\n\n  Mr. President, we have many examples of improving academic \nachievement and the reading ability of the nation's schoolchildren. We \ncan help children achieve. That is what this legislation is all about. \nWe have the ability to do it. The real question is whether we aim to \nreach all of these children, or whether we aim to reach only one-third \nof them? That is the issue.\n  Earlier we heard a good deal about the improvements that were taking \nplace in Houston, Texas. Secretary Paige is from Houston. All of the \nHouston's educational improvements that were highlighted earlier in \nthis debate have come at a cost Houston has seen a 43 percent increase \nin education spending between 1995 and 2000. That is an investment in \nchildren. That is what we are asking for. We have seen it work in \nHouston.\n  In Dallas, too, we have seen results. Dallas has made academic gains. \nSince Dallas made an investment in their accountability system, between \n1994 and 2000, they have seen a 21% increase in the number of students \nthat are passing all portions of the TAAS. Before the Texas \naccountability system, Texas was spending $673 million in Dallas. \nToday, they spend $985 million. That is a 46 percent increase--$312 \nmillion.\n  These examples indicate real investments. Real money. We have the \nprograms and the educational reforms. We know that when the reforms are \nin place, and when we have significant investments, we get results. We \nhave a bill that contains the right programs, but now we need the \nresources.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 375 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. I ask \nthe pending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 375 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding, and authorize \nappropriations for, title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n                              Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902. SENSE OF THE SENATE; AUTHORIZATION OF \n                   APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should appropriate $3,000,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2002 to carry out part A title II of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 and thereby--\n       (1) provide that schools, local educational agencies, and \n     States have the resources they need to put a highly qualified \n     teacher in every classroom in each school in which 50 percent \n     or more of the children are from low income families, over \n     the next 4 years;\n       (2) provide 125,000 new teachers with mentors and year-long \n     supervised internships; and\n       (3) provide high quality pedagogical training for every \n     teacher in every school.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out title II part A of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965--\n       (1) $3,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (2) $4,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (3) $4,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (4) $5,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (5) $5,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (6) $6,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation is focused on ensuring \nthat there is a well-trained teacher in every classroom for all of the \nchildren. This amendment is also about providing teachers with \nopportunities for mentorship and other support services to create \nsuccessful pathways toward academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  The BEST Act currently authorizes $3 billion professional development \nin the first fiscal year covered by the bill. The current authorization \nincludes $1.6 billion previously authorized for class-size reduction, \nand about $500 million for the Eisenhower math-science professional \ndevelopment program.\n  What we are saying in this amendment is that we should give teacher \ntraining a special priority in future years as well. The amendment \nprovides for a modest increase of $500 million more in authorized \nfunding levels in each of the following years, for the next 6 years. \nThis is a 7-year authorization bill. Title II, Part A will be used to \nsupport qualifying teachers, attract new teachers, and provide mentors \nfor new teachers. That is what this amendment is about. At the end of \nthe 7 years, we will have well-qualified teachers in virtually every \nhigh poverty classroom. Under current law, we would reach less than \nhalf that many in 7 years.\n  Having a qualified teacher in every classroom is the key to \neducational success. My friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nmentioned four or five factors this morning that really strengthen \neducation. Well-qualified teachers was one of those factors. Many \nbelieve it is most important. It is difficult to make a judgment about \nthe most important factor influencing achievement, but quality teaching \ncertainly, without question, is one of the most important.\n  Under current law, there is high-quality professional development for \nless than 5 percent of the Nation's teachers, approximately, 100,000 \nout of the current 2.8 million. There are more than 750,000 teachers in \nthe high-poverty schools who do not have undergraduate degrees in their \nprimary instruction.\n\n  This amendment provides an increased authorization for professional \ndevelopment for every teacher in high-\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\npoverty schools. It would positively impact virtually 50 percent of all \nteachers. In the first year alone, it would provide subject matter \ntraining to about 187,000 teachers in high poverty schools who do not \nhave an undergraduate degree in their primary instructional field.\n  With the additional funding in the second year, we will get another \nquarter of the 750,000. We will not only do that, but we will also make \nsure that we provide mentoring support for 125,000 new teachers.\n  That is what we need--quality training for current teachers, mentors \nfor new teachers, and continued and ongoing professional development. \nThat is the way you ensure the atmosphere and the climate for learning. \nThat is what we find in almost every study that has been done.\n  I hope those who are interested in this subject matter take a few \nmoments to review this excellent report, ``What Matters Most, Teaching \nfor America's Future.'' It was published in 1996. It is the document \nrecognized as the leading authority in terms of what is necessary in \nthe classroom to help a child learn.\n  I will take a few moments to mention a few of the observations. This \nis on page 41.\n  Most U.S. teachers have almost no time to consult together or learn \nabout new teaching strategies, unlike their peers in many European and \nAsian countries where teachers have substantial time to plan and study \nwith one another. In Germany, Japan, and China, for example, teachers \nspend between 15 and 20 hours per week working with colleagues on \ndeveloping curriculum, counseling students, and pursuing their own \nlearning. They regularly visit and serve other school classrooms and \nattend seminars provided by university faculty and other teachers, \nconduct group research projects, and participate in teacher-led study \ngroups. The result is a rich environment for continuous learning about \nteaching and the needs of students.\n  Instead of these ongoing learning opportunities, American teachers \nget a few brief workshops offering packaged programs from outside \nconsultants and that contribute little to deepening their subject \nknowledge or teaching skills.\n  I couldn't say it better than that. We are trying to change that.\n  What about the importance of mentoring? The weight of accumulated \nevidence clearly shows that traditional sink-or-swim induction to \nteaching contributes to high attrition and lower levels of teacher \neffectiveness.\n  Sink or swim, put a new teacher with no seniority in the toughest \nclass in America, and they don't last. Forty percent leave in the first \n2 years. You put that teacher in the class with an experienced teacher \nand mentor a young teacher, and you find that you reduce the number of \nteachers that leave the profession by about 80 percent.\n  Supervised internships or residencies regularly provided for new \nentrants in other professions, such as architects, psychologists, \nnurses, doctors, and engineers, are rare in teaching, but they have \nproven to be quite effective where they exist. Some States have created \nprograms for new teacher induction. Few have maintained the commitment \nrequired. With few exceptions, initiatives during the 1980s focused \non evaluation and failed to fund mentoring programs. Again, the problem \nis not that we do not know how to support beginning teachers. The \nproblem is that we have not yet developed the commitment to do so \nroutinely.\n\n  We know what is necessary and what is needed. Again, work in the \nclassroom, getting the well-trained teachers, getting the mentoring and \ndoing it in a continuous way is absolutely key.\n  I again point out from this study, in addition, that investing in \ntargeted recruitment preparation for teachers for high-need locations \nis a national need. That is why we believe we have a responsibility to \nmove ahead in this area.\n  I will not take additional time in terms of the justification. It is \nall here in a very compelling way.\n  I say one additional thing about this at this time. We want to make \nsure in the legislation, in title II part A, that we set a strong \ndefinition for all qualified teachers who have an academic major in the \narts and sciences, develop competence in a high-level of in-core \nacademic subjects, and are certified and licensed by the States.\n  My amendment ensures that professional development and mentoring \nactivities are research-based and of high quality. It requires \nprofessional development activities be an integral part of broad, \nschool-wide improvement plans, are sustained, and of such high quality \nand sufficient duration to have a positive and lasting impact on \nclassroom instruction.\n  My amendment does not promote the one-time workshops we have now but \nwhat the best available research tells us.\n  My amendment promotes mentoring activities that are multi-year and \ndesigned to help teachers continue to improve their practice of \nteaching and develop their instructional skills.\n  It ensures that professional development activities are aligned with \nState content standards, student performance standards, assessment, and \nthe curriculum of programs tied to those standards.\n  We are trying to get well-qualified teachers in the classroom. We are \npromoting a high-grade curriculum, tests that are not going to be a \nquick, slick, or easy multiple-choice test, but a test that is really \ngoing to test the ability of the child to think through complex \nproblems in math, science, literature, and be able to express them by \nwriting in these areas.\n  We need all of these reforms. We need thoughtful tests that challenge \nchildren. We need strengthened curricula, and we need quality teaching.\n  We require in this legislation that all teachers in schools with 50 \npercent of poverty or higher are highly qualified in 4 years. I don't \nbelieve, quite frankly, under the bill that we can achieve that with \nthe resources provided.\n  I think the additional funding that we provide in this amendment will \nmove us on a pathway to being able to achieve that. Then we move ahead \nto the other parts.\n  Finally, I hope the Senate will not accept the Craig amendment that \nis before us. It would effectively undermine in a very significant and \nimportant way what we are really attempting to do. The Craig amendment \nis the wrong approach to improving education. The Craig amendment tells \nalready failing schools that they have to improve achievement before \nreceiving the additional resources. That is a recipe for failure.\n  The schools and children failing need additional resources in order \nto achieve the heightened standards we are demanding of them in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, we have a strong blueprint. We know that once this \nlegislation is achieved it will trigger school improvement. And we have \nthe ability to do so. For my money, we have a greater demand than there \nare the resources. But we have the ability to do so.\n\n  If we are not going to be able to show results by the range of \ndifferent support that is available under this legislation, we will \nhave a prescription for disaster in terms of addressing the real needs \nof children. It is counterintuitive to say to children that we are not \ngoing to give you what you know you need until you make progress.\n  So we will have a chance, I imagine, when the Senator from Idaho is \npresent to get into greater debate. But it does seem to me that his \namendment runs in conflict with the central thrust of this legislation. \nI hope the amendment is not adopted.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenator Kennedy.\n  In S. 1, we have combined the class size reduction program with the \nEisenhower math and science program to create a single, substantial \nfunding stream for staff development. Given the difficulty in finding \nteachers who have adequate pre-service training in reading, math, \nscience, and special education, in- service professional development is \ncritically important.\n  This amendment establishes a set of ambitious goals for the funding \nof title II of S. 1, much like the amendment of Senators Dodd and \nCollins on title I.\n  If we are going to meet the goals established in this legislation--\nthat every child reach proficiency--then we must upgrade the teaching \nforce. This amendment sends the right signal.\n  I am pleased to join the Senator in this amendment. I shall work with \nhim to get it adopted.\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\n  Seeing no other Senator asking for recognition, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are debating the education reform act. \nDebate over this bill is increasingly boiling down to debate over one \nquestion: What is Congress' solution to the problems in our schools, \nspecifically, lagging overall achievement and the fact that too many \nchildren are failed altogether?\n  Anyone watching this debate will realize there is a divide between \nthose of us who believe that the solution lies in reform and those, on \nthe other hand, who believe that the solution is to spend more of your \nmoney.\n  This morning, the Senator from New Hampshire was very clear in \npointing out how the expenditure of billions and billions of dollars \nover the years has not resulted in any improvement in the test scores \nof our children, and, indeed, after the expenditure of over $120 \nbillion for the last 30 years, our children are actually falling \nfurther behind than ever before.\n  Granted, those of us who advocate that reform have committed to \nsignificant funding increases. Again, as the Senator from New Hampshire \nnoted earlier today, the budgets offered by President Bush and \nsupported by the Republicans in the Senate have called for \nsubstantially increased spending on the education program. Of course, \ngranted, most who focus on spending pay lipservice to the need for \nreform but just not too much of it. I think that is the fundamental \ndivide in this debate.\n  I am concerned that as we proceed with amendments the spending side \nis making up a great deal of ground, while the reformers who are \nlooking to change the system in order to help our kids are losing by \ncontrast. Our achievements are looking very meager in contrast.\n  As politicians, we will likely benefit, at least in the short term, \nfrom producing a bill that gives the special interests a taxpayer-\nfunded windfall, in exchange for a bare minimum of reform. But our \npolitical exercise will not serve America's children; 6 or 7 years from \nnow, we will be making the same excuses to the taxpayers who were \npromised improvement.\n  We should stop making excuses for failure and begin by retiring the \nmost tired excuse of all, which is that a lack of resources explains \nwhy our public education system is failing so many of our children--a \nlack of resources, of course, in the form of taxpayer dollars for \neducation programs.\n  The education special interests may come up short in educating the \nchildren who most desperately need the help, but they are experts at \nexcuses. Here are some in the education sector who have moved beyond \nexcuses. This is a book called ``No Excuses,'' by Samuel Casey Carter. \nIt has lessons from 21 high-performing, high-poverty schools. It shows \nhow these schools have implemented commonsense reforms and overcome the \nchallenges that others use as excuses for failure.\n  The successes of these schools were not achieved by the expenditure \nof large quantities of new funding but by the innovations of caring \npeople. Most of the programs are in very poor areas, minority areas, \nand the schools that have some of the best achievements are either \ncharter public schools or private schools. They have overcome modest \nbudgets, typically budgets more modest than many public schools have. \nThey have overcome the psychological and material impediments to \nlearning, which many young people suffer from today. In short, they \nhave overcome big excuse No. 1, the ``more money excuse,'' and big \nexcuse No. 2, also known and characterized by President Bush as the \n``bigotry of low expectations,'' which attempts to excuse failure by \nsaying disadvantaged children can't learn and excel.\n\n  The book is full of stories. For example, Patsy Burk's story of Owen \nElementary School in Detroit, MI, in which 82 percent of the students \nat the school come from low-income families. Yet, the reading and math \nscores have improved dramatically as a result of people who care, the \ninnovations in that particular school, and a very innovative team \napproach to teaching in that school.\n  Then there is Michael Feinburg School and the Kip Academy in Houston, \nTX. ``There are no shortcuts'' is the simple motto of the Kip Academy. \nThey have 9\\1/2\\ hour days, classes on Saturday, school during the \nsummer, and a lot of homework. These are all nonnegotiable at this \nschool. They are 95 percent low-income. Yet, the math and reading \nscores are very, very good.\n  Example after example is identified in this particular book. It shows \nhow these schools have implemented commonsense reform and overcome the \nusual excuses for failure. I think there are practices that parents \nwould like to see employed in their own schools, in the schools that \nthey would like to have their children attend, that are similar to \nthose innovative practices identified in this particular book. But most \nof these parents don't have the same opportunity as the parents of the \nkids identified in this book. These kids had a choice; their parents \nhad a choice on where they were going to send their kids. It was that \nvery choice that enabled them to provide the kind of education they \nknew was best for their particular kids.\n  When you don't have that choice and you are stuck in a failing \nschool, there is a great deal of frustration. We have seen that not \nonly in the debate today but also throughout the country in the last \nseveral years. That is what President Bush has tried to get away from--\nthe idea that you are stuck in a failing school system.\n  As the lessons in this particular book show, when you have a choice \nwhere you can send your children, not only are you able to take them to \nthe school that best fits their needs and where they can excel but the \ncompetition that is provided by those schools to the failing schools \ntends to bring the failing schools up as well because as kids leave \nthose schools, obviously people begin asking questions. Sometimes the \nState dollars leave the school as well. So those schools have an \nincentive to improve.\n  I can remember in my own State of Arizona opening the paper one day \nand seeing a full-page ad from a public school--frankly, a public \nschool that was pretty good--advertising for students to come back to \nthis particular public school. I inquired into it. What I found was \nthat in this very fast-growing area of one of the Phoenix suburbs, a \nlot of the kids were joining up with the private schools that were \navailable or the charter schools that had opened up in the area. \nTherefore, the enrollment in the large public school was essentially \nflat.\n  The superintendent, rather than complaining about it or making \nexcuses, had gone to these charter schools and private schools and \nasked why so many kids were leaving his public school district and the \nlarger schools and attending these others. He found that they were \ninnovating, providing things that the parents of the students really \nwanted. So he chose from among those innovations those that he thought \ncould best be incorporated into the large public schools of which he \nwas superintendent.\n  When those reforms were instituted, he then advertised them to the \nparents of the kids in the school district. He said: We have changed. \nWe have instituted some reforms now. We think you are going to like \nthese things. Come back to the public schools.\n  It has been one of the best examples of a public school system which \nwas not doing too badly but could improve. The competition caused it to \nreexamine what it needed to improve, and it did so. The enrollment \nsince then has gone up. The students are doing very well on scores, and \nI think but for the competition, that school would not be able to brag \nabout that today.\n  We need to ask the parents of children in failing schools: Would you \nrather the Federal Government appropriate funds to fully fund your \nfailing school or would you rather be given the freedom to enroll your \nchild in one of these no excuses schools? The kind about which I am \ntalking. I think we all know the answer.\n  I am afraid the new 900-page negotiated bill that is going to replace \nthe old 800-page bill passed by the committee, while it provides for \nsome modest enhancement of school choice, does\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nso only under very rigid conditions with significant limitations, and \nthat concerns me greatly.\n  There will be amendments to broaden that choice, to extend the \nbenefits of education freedom to more of America's families and \nchildren. I look forward to the debate on those amendments, and I \ncertainly look forward to supporting them.\n  I believe that giving parents that freedom is the most certain path \nto improvement in education because parents, unlike politicians, are \nnot going to accept excuses for failure.\n  I look forward to the amendments when they are offered. I look \nforward to offering an amendment on my own which will show through a \ntax credit for contributions to special scholarship funds which can \nprovide scholarships for children in low-income areas to attend the \nschool of their choice, we can enhance this kind of competition and \nenhance freedom as a result. I look forward to the debate, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contribution \nto the debate and his interest in education.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 373\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect \nto amendment No. 373.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand there is no objection to this amendment, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 373.\n  The amendment (No. 373) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute or so as we complete \nthe first few days of debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. There are, I am sure, countless amendments still pending that we \nwill consider in the following week or two, before we complete full \nconsideration of a bill we only deal with--and this may come as a \nsurprise to many Americans--once every 5 or 6 years. Unlike \nagriculture, defense, or a variety of other subject matters dealt with \nannually, we only debate elementary and secondary education and higher \neducation every 5 or 6 years.\n  It seems to me we ought to have an annual discussion of the condition \nof America's public schools, how well they are doing, and what more we \ncould be doing to assist local communities and States in providing the \nbest possible education for every child.\n  Over the last few days, we have begun to consider amendments. Senator \nCollins of Maine offered an amendment dealing with reading which was \nadopted unanimously. Senator Jeffords had a trigger on testing which \nwas adopted almost unanimously. Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel \noffered an amendment that dealt with full funding of special education, \nwhich is something that every mayor, every superintendent of schools, \nevery board of education in my State of Connecticut--and, I am \nconfident, in other States--have been asking us to do for years.\n  Children with disabilities ought to have the same opportunity to \nreach their maximum potential, as every child. I think all Americans \ntoday accept that notion.\n  Over the years, many have advocated for us to reach the goal of a \nquarter of a century ago of funding 40 percent of States' special \neducation costs. Today, we're at about 15 percent.\n  In the measures similar to the amendment offered by Senator Harkin \nand Senator Hagel or have been offered over the years by Senator \nJeffords, myself, and many others--on occasion, they actually passed \nthe Senate but did not pass the other body or were dropped in \nconference--something always happened to frustrate the overwhelming \ndesire of people in this country for the U.S. Government to meet its \ngoal. The amendment adopted here will now require that.\n  I am confident the bill, for reasons I will state in a minute, will \nbecome law in this country, and for the first time we will have \nlanguage which takes us to that goal.\n  And, along with my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, \nI was the author of an amendment that will fully fund title I, the \nheart of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is what this \nbill is all about since, again, about 35 years ago we decided our role \nin public education would be to help the most disadvantaged communities \nand kids of the country. From the beginning in the early 1960s, that is \nwhat the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was designed to do. \nThere are other pieces of it, but about 50 percent of the dollars go to \ntitle I. Yet, we only fund title I at one-third of the goal we \nestablished.\n\n  Yesterday, this body went on record with the overwhelming vote of 79-\n21 in support of full funding of title I over the next 10 years, with \nthe bulk of that obligation being met over the next 4 or 5 years, 75 to \n80 percent of the full funding requirement. This now is going to make \nit possible, in my view, to have a chance to meet the concerns that \nhave been raised by many over the quality of public education.\n  The bill will also include some long-sought-after reforms on \naccountability and standards so the children are not just warehoused \nand pushed from grade to grade without ever having met the educational \nrequirements. That has gone on. We all know about it. Everyone knows \nabout it at local and State levels.\n\n  This bill says that we really want some accountability, we want some \nstandards, we want some means by which we measure whether or not \nchildren are, in fact, learning.\n  Many of us accept that is something we ought to do in the Federal \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. But we also say if you are \ngoing to do that, you have to put the resources in place so these \nreforms have a chance of producing the desired results. Reform without \nresources is just a lot of hot air. And resources without reforms is a \nwaste of money.\n  Now we are, I hope, in this bill--having adopted the full funding of \ntitle I and the anticipated adoption of reforms--going to build on the \nwork we did in 1994 to marry reforms and resources. So many of us \nconclude this first week of debate with a sense of optimism that, \nfrankly, I did not have 24 hours ago. I had a deep concern we were \ngoing to adopt mandates for our local communities and tell our \ncommunities what they had to do and then not participate in providing \nthe resources to achieve those goals.\n  I still have some outstanding concerns that will not be addressed in \nthis bill, but I raise them briefly today. I may try to find some way \nto give expression to these ideas in the coming week in this debate.\n  I think it is outrageous that the Federal Government is such a minor \nplayer, financially, in the cost of educating America's kids. I always \nsay this. I think Americans would be stunned to discover that, of their \nFederal taxes that come to Washington, less than 1 percent go back to \nthe education of elementary and secondary school students around the \ncountry. In elementary and secondary education, the earliest building \nblock, in many ways, of a child's learning, your National Government is \nreally only a minor participant.\n\n  We are very good at instructing our towns and cities how to educate \nchildren, and telling the States, but when it comes to putting our \nmoney where our mouth is, as the old expression goes, we are pretty \ncheap.\n  That goes back a long time. ``Education was only the responsibility \nof local communities. The National Government just ought to stay as far \naway from elementary and secondary education as possible.'' That was \nthe idea in the 19th century. That was the idea through much of the \n20th century.\n  We ought to be rethinking the structure of funding education in this \ncountry as we enter the 21st century. No longer will the children in my \nState merely be competing with the children of New Jersey or California \nor Texas or New York. The child growing up in Connecticut will be \ncompeting with children in Beijing, Moscow, South Africa, Australia, \nParis, London. That is the world they will be entering. The idea that \nwe would accept a 19th and 20th century structure to educate children \nto compete in a 21st century global economy is outrageous, in my view, \nand foolish.\n  You cannot expect sufficient resources to help these children to come\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\nexclusively or almost exclusively, as they do in at least in 40 States, \nto come from a local property tax. You are going to bankrupt these \nhomeowners. And, in the poorest communities where the need is greatest \nfor creating opportunity, the resources are the most scarce. I would \nlike to see us say at some point to our communities and States: You \nbear one-third apiece and we will pick up a third of the cost.\n  First of all, just think of the property tax relief for millions of \nAmericans. They are sending their money to Washington. We are taking \ntheir Federal taxes. As I said, less than one-half of 1 percent is \ngoing to secondary and elementary education. Why not see if we can \nbecome a better partner?\n  As we lecture States and localities about what they are not doing, it \nmight be helpful if we also increased what we are doing to contribute \nto their attracting qualified teachers, seeing that schools are modern \nand wired with the technology kids will need to be economically \nindependent, contributing members of what we want to be the greatest \ncountry on Earth in the 21st century as it was in the 20th century.\n  I very much would like to see us do that. We will not do that in this \nbill, but I invite some discussion of how, in the coming years, we can \nbe a better partner in education.\n  The great irony is that we spend the bulk of our tax dollars in the \narea of 18 to 22 through Pell grants and Stafford loans, assistance for \nhigher education. And, without question, those programs are invaluable.\n  But we know that the most important years of a human being's \ndevelopment in terms of their ability to learn and to have the tools \nnecessary to succeed in life, occur in the earlier years of life. We \nought to do more in the earliest stage. If we do, more children will \nsucceed as they go on toward adulthood.\n  The second point I wanted to make is this: I want to see some \naccountability out of the States, too. We are telling towns and \nlocalities they have to do a better job. If not, we are going to shut \ndown their schools.\n  I don't agree with the idea that the solution that we are going to \nsolve the problem of schools in poor-inner city or poor rural areas by \npaying for the students to attend private schools. In desperately poor \nareas there are not those kinds of alternatives except in the most rare \nof circumstances.\n  We are talking about being pretty tough with local schools in this \nbill. I'm all for accountability, but I would like to raise the \npossibility of getting a little tough with the States, as well. This \nmay be an anathema for some.\n  There is great disparity based on the affluence and poverty of our \nrespective communities within these States. This has provoked a great \ndebate about the States. I am not suggesting a one-size-fits-all \nsolution, but it seems to me, we might want to include the States in \nthis discussion so that you will at least begin to minimize the \ndisparity in opportunity.\n  My State is a good example. I don't blame present administrations or \nrecent administrations. Administrations have wrestled with this idea \nfor a long time. I am sure this is the case in your State, Mr. \nPresident, in New Jersey. It is pretty much the case in all of our \nStates.\n  I represent the most affluent State in America. Here we are, a State \nwith incredibly affluent communities. They do a magnificent job in \nallocating their resources to improving the quality of public education \nin their communities. Yet I can take you from one of those \ncommunities--I am not exaggerating--for a car ride in less than 15 \nminutes to a neighboring community that ranks in the top 10 of the \npoorest communities in America. One community will have a public high \nschool that can compete with a community college in terms of its \nfacilities, athletics, radio, television stations, language \nlaboratories, and wonderful teachers who receive more than decent \ncompensation to teach children in that community. And 15 minutes away, \nI can take you to a place where the buildings are falling apart, \ntechnology is rarely available, and police officers are on every floor. \nYou begin to wonder if you are in a school or a detention facility.\n  There are wonderful teachers and wonderful students in these schools \nwho struggle every day to provide and receive the best educational \nopportunity they can. But in the most affluent State in the country, in \nthe most affluent Nation on the face of this Earth, we have communities \nwithin minutes of each other where the educational opportunity--that is \nall I am talking about--is light-years apart.\n  We can't accept this anymore. Especially as we enter the 21st century \nwith the economic gap growing wider every day, when we will end up \nhaving those who are well prepared to fit in this information \ntechnology age and the global economy, and those who will have a hard \ntime finding the most menial jobs in America because we didn't provide \na decent education.\n  I say to our partners in all of this, our States, just as we say to \nour communities, that we want you to do a better job as well. I am \ngoing to explore some legislative language on how we might demand \ngreater accountability for seeing that equal opportunity for education \nis going to be met at the State as well as the local and national \nlevels.\n  I don't expect anything dramatic to be adopted in this Chamber on \nthis particular bill. But it is a debate we ought to start. Chaka \nFattah, a very effective Member of Congress from the city of \nPhiladelphia, is a good friend of mine. Chaka Fattah wrote language \nwhich specifically addresses this issue. In fact, he offered it in the \nU.S. House of Representatives in the previous Congress and received \nclose to 200 votes in the other Chamber. It is a rather complicated \nproposal but one which goes to the heart of this issue, again without \ninsisting on any particular formulation but saying the States have to \ndo a better job in working to see to it that equal opportunity in \neducation is going to be available to all students and be held to some \ndegree of accountability on this issue.\n\n  I commend Congressman Fattah for offering that amendment and for \nprovoking that debate. He sent me the language on that. I am going to \nsubmit it for the consideration of my colleagues, perhaps with some \nvariation, over the next couple of weeks.\n  Again, I thank the membership for their hard work, and especially of \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords, the ranking member and chair of \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on which I have \nthe pleasure of sitting. I know my colleague from New Jersey has a \nstrong desire to join at some point. We hope he will be there with us. \nIt is an exciting committee. They have done a good job.\n  I commend Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, and Senator Lott as \nwell, for moving this debate along.\n  This has been a pretty good first week--better than I ever thought it \nwould when we started the week. We see a lot more has to be considered. \nI will have amendments to offer with Senator Shelby of Alabama and \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico. We will be proposing those amendments \nat the appropriate time, which we hope our colleagues will support.\n  I look forward to those debates and discussions, and other amendments \nour colleagues will be offering.\n  I think we have started out on a pretty good foot. We have not \nanswered all of the questions. But I think we are going to marry \nresources and reforms in a package that most of us are going to be able \nto support.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 375 To Amendment No. 358, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, I send a modification to the desk of an \namendment he has offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 375) to amendment No. 358, as modified, is as \nfollows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding, and authorize \nappropriations for, title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n                              Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 902.

Mr. President, earlier this week, Vice President Cheney \ngave us a brief glimpse of the administration's soon-to-be-released \nenergy plan that suggests that we need to take action to avert an \nimpending energy crisis. He suggested that the plan will push for \nincreasing fuel supplies from domestic sources. Still, the Vice \nPresident did not explain how domestic climate change programs will be \nreflected in the energy plan, nor did he discuss press reports that the \nadministration is developing a plan to deal with the international \naspects of climate change.\n  I would like to focus on the latter, and discuss recent decisions by \nthe administration regarding the international negotiations. Climate \nchange cannot be discussed in complete isolation from the soon-to-be \nreleased energy plan, since the issue of climate change must be \naddressed both domestically and internationally.\n  I wish to note, at the outset, that I applaud the administration's \nsupport for clean coal technologies and the administration's \nrecognition that coal is one of our country's most important sources of \nenergy. I recognize and strongly support this policy by the executive \nbranch. A bill I have introduced this session, S. 60, the National \nElectricity and Environmental Technology Act, addresses the challenges \nfaced by coal, and I would welcome the administration's active support \nto utilize coal in a cleaner, more efficient way.\n  I also believe, however, that it would be a mistake to focus too \nheavily just on increasing fuel supplies from domestic sources. If that \nis where the administration is headed, it is not on exactly the right \npath. In order to solve the challenge of climate change, we must \ndevelop new domestic sources such as coal, using clean coal \ntechnologies, while also engaging in bold initiatives to develop new \ntechnologies in the area of energy conservation, energy efficiency, and \nrenewable energy.\n  I am concerned, based upon preliminary reports, that the \nadministration's plan may not reflect such a balanced and farsighted \nperspective. Let me begin by noting the obvious--the primary, manmade \ncause of global warming is the burning of the very fossil fuels that \npower virtually the entire world.\n  Here is part of the power just above us as we look up to the ceiling \nof the Senate Chamber and see these lights. What is required, then, is \nthe equivalent of an industrial revolution. We must develop new and \ncleaner technologies to burn fossil fuels as well as new methods to \ncapture and sequester greenhouse gases, and we must develop renewable \ntechnology that is practical and cost-effective. Rarely has mankind \nbeen confronted with such a challenge--a challenge to improve how we \npower our economy. This is the greatest nation in the world when the \nissue is one of applying our engineering talents to push beyond the \nnext incremental improvement, and, instead, visualize and then achieve \nmajor leaps forward. We can do this, if only we apply ourselves. The \nscale and the scope of the problem are enormous, as is the leadership \nthat will be required by the current administration, and, for that \nmatter, the next dozen administrations, if we are to confront and \novercome this awesome challenge in our children's time and in our \ngrandchildren's lifetime.\n  But this takes visionary leadership. It would take extraordinary \nleadership. We need more than just small, incremental increases in our \ndomestic oil supplies or in our existing research and development \nprograms. This is an approach which only pays lip service to the \nchallenge that we face. It is a huge challenge. I hope that the \nadministration's plan will take a broader view.\n  We must also recognize that the European Union, China, and other \ndeveloping nations are quick to point the finger at us, at the world's \nlargest contributor to global warming. We must demonstrate our resolve, \nand begin to get our own house in order by launching such a research \nand development effort, as well as continuing and expanding our current \nefforts to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.\n  However, it should also be noted that China will soon surpass us as \nthe largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The Chinese Government must \nstop blocking all forward movement on the question of developing \ncountry participation. The developing world is poorly served by the \ncurrent level of Chinese intransigence. The poorest nations in the \ndeveloping world--which will be those that are hardest hit by global \nwarming during this century--must demand leadership from within their \nown ranks, and especially from China. The Chinese leadership must join \nus in honestly discussing solutions to the problem of climate change. \nThe United States can develop and provide the technological \nbreakthroughs that can be deployed by all nations, as we move forward \ntogether to solve this common, global problem.\n  However, I want to emphatically warn that new technologies and \nvoluntary approaches will not by themselves solve this problem. We must \nalso actively negotiate and ratify international agreements that \ninclude binding commitments for all of the largest emitters of \ngreenhouse gases, if we are to have any hope of solving one of the \nworld's--one of humanity's--greatest challenges.\n  This concern takes me back to the Senate's actions just 4 years ago. \nDuring the Senate floor debate over Senate Resolution 98 in July 1997, \nI expressed two fundamental beliefs that have guided my approach on the \nissue of climate change. First, while some scientific uncertainties \nremain, I believe that there is significant, mounting evidence that \nmankind is altering the world's climate. Second, the voluntary approach \nof the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \ncommonly known as the Rio Convention, has failed, as almost all of the \nnations of the world, including the United States, have been unable to \nmeet their obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 \nlevels. With those points in mind, we must ask\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nwhat needs to be done in a binding fashion to begin to address this \nglobal issue--the preeminent environmental challenge of our time.\n  On July 25, 1997, the Senate passed, by a vote of 95-0, S. Res. 98 \nwhich stated that, first, developing nations, especially the largest \nemitters, must agree to binding emission reduction commitments at the \nsame time as industrialized nations and, second, any international \nclimate change agreement must not result in serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy. That resolution served as guidance to U.S. negotiators as they \nprepared to hammer out the details of the Kyoto Protocol.\n  Senator Hagel and I were the prime cosponsors of that resolution.\n  The adoption of that resolution was perhaps, a dose of reality--\nlaying out, in advance of the completion of the Kyoto negotiations or \nthe anticipated submission of a climate change treaty to the Senate, \njust what an administration--any administration--would need to win the \nSenate's advice and consent. Contrary to statements made by some in \nthis administration, the Senate has never voted on the Kyoto Protocol, \nalthough the protocol, in its current form, does not meet the \nrequirements of S. Res. 98.\n  Since that vote in July 1997, international climate change \nnegotiations have covered a wide range of topics in an attempt to craft \na balanced treaty. While there have been some important gains and there \nhave been some unfortunate setbacks from the U.S. perspective, I am \nconcerned that, in the Bush administration's zeal to reject Kyoto for \nits failure to comply with S. Res. 98, the baby is being thrown out \nwith the bath water through a complete abandonment of the negotiating \nprocess. Such an abandonment would be very costly to U.S. leadership \nand credibility and could force the international community to go back \nto ``square one'' on certain critical issues such as carbon \nsequestration and market-based mechanisms--areas which I believe are \ncritical to any future binding climate change treaty.\n  Still, an examination even of Kyoto's drawbacks can provide the basis \nfor forward movement by the Bush administration.\n  Let me say that again. An examination, even of Kyoto's drawbacks, can \nprovide the basis for forward movement by the Bush administration.\n  For example, U.S. negotiators should go back to the negotiating table \nwith proposals that could be achieved internationally. In my opinion, \nan effective and binding international agreement must include several \nelements. First, the initial binding emission reduction targets and \ncaps should be economically and environmentally achievable. Such an \ninternational agreement should specify increments by which the initial \nreduction could be racheted downward and made more stringent over time. \nThis architecture could provide a realistic and obtainable target, and \nit would give U.S. industry more time to prepare to meet such \nrequirements. Additionally, the inclusion of incremental reductions \nwould encourage the development of a range of cleaner, more efficient \ntechnologies to meet the long-term goal, namely, the stabilization of \ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Most important, these \nsteps would give the United States a clearer path toward the goal of \ndealing seriously with a serious and growing problem.\n  Recently, we have heard talk by the Bush administration to the effect \nthat the United States should promote voluntary initiatives to meet our \ninternational treaty commitments. Well, that sounds good, but it will \nnot work. I note that, in 1993, the former administration undertook an \nextensive assessment to formulate the U.S. Climate Change Action Plan, \nwhich subsequently developed a wide range of voluntary programs and \ntechnology strategies to help the United States reduce domestic \nemissions to 1990 levels. While these remain laudable and important \nprograms, they have not put us on a path toward significantly reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. In fact, rather than accomplishing that goal, \nby the late 1990s, U.S. emissions were at least 11 percent above those \n1990 levels. Clearly then, the next global climate change treaty will \nhave to include binding emission limits by industrialized nations, as \nwell as developing nations, specifically the biggest emitters in the \ndeveloping world. I am talking about China, India, Mexico, Brazil, and \nothers.\n  Additionally, as I explained at the time we were debating S. Res. 98, \nthe initial commitment by developing countries could be modest, with \nthe agreement specifying a more rigorous approach to growth and \nemissions over time. Recent press reports indicate that China, the big \nemitter, exceeding the emissions of the United States very soon, has \nalready made progress in reducing the growth of its greenhouse gas \nemissions. That is good news. That is encouraging. A future binding \nclimate change agreement could recognize these efforts and provide \nmarket-based mechanisms by which China could obtain technological \nassistance to expand upon its efforts over time.\n  An international treaty with binding commitments can and should \nprovide for the continued growth of the world's developing nations. The \neconomic growth of Mexico or China, for example, need not be choked off \nby unrealistically stringent, inflexible emission reduction targets. \nThe initial commitment could be relatively modest, pacing upwards \ndepending upon various factors, with a specific goal to be achieved \nwithin a fixed time period. If properly designed, a binding \ninternational treaty can accommodate economic growth and environmental \nimprovement in the developing world. This approach provides the means \nby which China and other key developing nations can grow in a more \nefficient, environmentally sound manner while also making commitments \nto reduce their fair share of this global climate change burden.\n  Using this approach, the Bush administration has a historic \nopportunity to shape, rather than cripple, the international climate \nchange debate by negotiating an agreement that includes all of the \nlargest emitters of greenhouse gases on a global basis.\n  It is a huge task no doubt, but it is a huge problem, and it \nconfronts the world, not just he occidental but also the oriental--not \njust the West but also the East. Such an agreement must also include \nmarket mechanisms that are unencumbered by layers of bureaucracy; \nstrong provisions for domestic and international sinks, sequestration, \nand projects that prevent deforestation; and tough enforcement and \ncompliance requirements.\n  But any such agreement must also be met by an honest effort on \nAmerica's domestic front. I am, therefore, very concerned that the \nPresident's overall budget does not adequately provide the level of \nfunding necessary to support programs and policies that would address \nU.S. energy and climate change challenges. So I urge the Bush \nAdministration to include all relevant policy aspects in the energy \nneeds assessment currently under review and to examine the total \ncosts--both economic and environmental--in any national energy \nstrategy. I hope the President will work with Congress on these \ncritical issues to develop a constructive, long-term negotiating path \nfor the future. America leads the world in so many important areas--\naddressing our global climate change challenges should be front and \ncenter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4395-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4395-S4397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have serious concerns about certain trade \npolicy issues that the Bush administration inherited from its \npredecessor, but which remain unresolved. I refer to the steel crisis, \nthe failure to formulate a coherent trade policy with respect to China, \nand the failure to recognize that ``fast-track'' trade negotiating \nauthority represents both an unwarranted diminution of the \nConstitutional authority of Congress and an invitation to our trade \npartners to accelerate their attack on the framework of fair trade.\n  As I have long maintained, U.S. trade policy cannot be complacent as \nAmerica's manufacturing plants are moved to low-wage countries, a \nphenomenon that makes it increasingly difficult for American employers \nto stay competitive and, at the same time, pay good wages and provide \ngood benefits to their workers. While American workers do benefit from \nlower prices for imported products, too many have been made worse off, \non balance, by globalization. As the columnist Michael Kelly recently \npointed out, ``What the unionists know is that\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\nglobalization ultimately depends on driving manufacturing jobs out of \nthe country in which they live.''\n  Indeed, in many historically high-wage and efficient industries, the \ninevitable result of complacent trade policy is bankruptcy. The \ninevitable result of complacent trade policy is bankruptcy. A case in \npoint is the U.S. steel industry. The steel crisis--which is the direct \nresult of an unprecedented surge in imports, particularly dumped and \nsubsidized imports--began in late 1997 and continues to this day. The \nsurge in imports has already led 18 American steel companies--18 \ncompanies--to declare bankruptcy. Hear them at the other end of the \navenue. Over the past year alone, an estimated 5,000 U.S. steelworkers \nhave lost their jobs.\n  A great sage once said, ``Reflect upon three things and you will not \ncome to sin: Know from where you came, and to where you are going, and \nbefore whom you are destined to give an accounting.'' Let's reflect \nagain on those three things: Know from where you came, and to where you \nare going, and before whom you are destined to give an accounting. So, \nlet me bring this issue a little closer to home, my home, that is. In \n1996, Weirton Steel Corporation, of Weirton, West Virginia, in the very \ntip of the northern panhandle the eighth largest integrated steel \nproducer in the United States, employed 5,375 of the most skilled \nworkers and managers in the world, using the most up-to-date production \ntechnology. That was down from a few years ago. What is it today? \nToday, in 2001, Weirton employs only 4,111 workers and managers, a loss \nof over 25 percent from 1996. Weirton just reported that its first \nquarter sales this year were down 24 percent from last year and that it \nlost $75.3 million in the first quarter. Continuation of the status quo \nin the steel market will not mean continuation of the status quo for \nWeirton Steel, for it cannot stay in business over an extended period \nof time in the face of such losses.\n  Now, by Ohio Valley steel industry standards, Weirton is the lucky \none even with such losses. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., the ninth \nlargest U.S. integrated steel producer, was forced last year to declare \na Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to avoid being picked apart by its \ncreditors. I hope that it will soon emerge from bankruptcy with the \nhelp of a federally guaranteed loan.\n\n  I could talk about the need for a section 201 investigation of \n``serious injury'' to the American steel industry. Such an \ninvestigation is necessary, and it is necessary now--the administration \nshould not tie its decision on a 201 investigation to any other trade \npolicy initiative. But, I will save that discussion for another day. \nRather, I wish to point out that the administration is sending a \ndamaging signal on its approach to the steel crisis by proposing to \nrescind $10 million from the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Because the demands on that program will--in all likelihood--continue \nto increase, the proposed reduction in funding represents an \nunacceptable risk of harm to an industry that is vital both to our \nnational defense and the way of life of communities across this Nation.\n  The emergency guarantee program was made necessary because of the \nreaction of the financial community to the onset of the steel crisis. \nWith no assurance that the injurious surge in steel imports would abate \nin the near future, financial institutions were--for the most part--\nunwilling to restructure steel producers' debts. Thus, Congress acted \nto provide incentives for private-sector loans to the steel industry. \nThe new program was signed into law on August 17, 1999, and was \ndesigned to give qualified U.S. steel producers access to a $1 billion \nrevolving guaranteed loan fund.\n  I say, parenthetically, that I was the author of that legislation.\n  Now is simply the wrong time to be considering rescissions from the \nemergency guarantee program. There are many steel companies in Chapter \n11 bankruptcy, and several of them will undoubtedly request these \nfederally guaranteed loans as a key element in their restructuring \nprograms.\n  The steel crisis takes us right into the issue of our trade policy \ntoward China. Whatever else one might say about China, it is, without \nquestion, an economic behemoth. Our trade deficit with China in 2000 \nwas nearly $84 billion. In that same year, imports from China totaled \n$100.1 billion, accounting for eight percent of total U.S. imports, \nmaking China the fourth largest exporter to the United States. \nMoreover, in February 2001, we imported 97 million tons of finished \nsteel products from China, almost as much as the 100 million tons we \nimported from Japan!\n  Even the quickest perusal of Commerce Department and International \nTrade Commission records demonstrates that China is engaged in dumping \nsteel products in the United States. China has recently been found to \nbe dumping steel wire rope, as well as--in preliminary determinations--\nhot-rolled steel and steel concrete reinforcing bars.\n  What I am trying to tell the Senate, and the administration--if the \nadministration will listen, if the administration will hear--is that \nChina may not intend to play the trade game by the traditional rules. \nIndeed, as we have seen in recent weeks, China does not play the \ninternational relations game by acceptable norms. The Weekly Standard \nopined at the height of the reconnaissance plane crisis that:\n\n       The United States must respond in ways that directly affect \n     China's interests. . . . The Chinese believe, with good \n     reason, that the American business community has a hammerlock \n     on American policy toward China. . . .\n\n  Let us resolve to demonstrate that we can respond effectively to any \nChinese attempt to push the envelope--not by indulging in angry \noverreaction, but by doing whatever is reasonable and practicable and \naccording to the dictates of common sense, to restore Congressional \nauthority to review China's trade status on an annual basis. The \nconcept of ``Permanent Normal Trade Relations'' is premised on the \nassumption of normality in a bilateral relationship, and our bilateral \nrelationship with China is anything but normal.\n  This brings me, now, to the issue of ``fast-track.'' The President \nwants fast track. The administration wants fast track. The \nadministration says it needs this deviation from the traditional \nprerogatives of Congress in order to negotiate multilateral trade \nagreements. Let me be clear: I am not in favor of attaching myriad \namendments to trade agreements negotiated by the President.\n  I am not for having the Congress hang up on every import of every \ntoothbrush or violin string or piece of cloth.\n  There may be, however, a few very important items--a few--that \nCongress will need to consider in detail before proceeding to a final \nvote on a multilateral trade agreement.\n  Under the Constitution, which I hold in my hand, Congress has this \nresponsibility. We ought to read it. Again, I say I am not for looking \nat every comma, semicolon, colon, hyphen--every little jot and tittle \nabout trade agreements. Who wants to engage themselves in debate over \nminuscule matters that may appear in a trade agreement?\n  But there are some very important items, limited to three or four or \nfive huge questions. We have questions we need to debate. We have \nissues we need to debate in connection with these trade matters, and we \nshould debate them. Congress has a responsibility to debate them before \nCongress considers a final vote on a multilateral trade agreement. We \nhave a responsibility to do that.\n  Fast track? Not for me. Let's not be in all that big a hurry. We \ndon't need to be in such a hurry. What it means is shut Congress out of \nthe debate. Just vote up or down. The people's representatives, the \nelected representatives of the people in this country--here, in this \nbody, in this Chamber--shut them out. What we want is fast track, says \nthe administration.\n  I say no. No fast track. Let the people speak, through their elected \nrepresentatives, to trade agreements. I don't mind limiting it to very \nfew, a handful, a half dozen questions or issues to be voted on. It is \nimportant that the Senate debate these matters.\n  Here is an example. A key objective of many of our trading partners \nin any multilateral negotiation is to weaken U.S. antidumping, \ncountervailing duty, and safeguard laws. As a matter of fact, I read \nthe other day that several of the Free Trade Area of the Americas \ncountries are proposing elaborate\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\nchanges to our antidumping and countervailing duty laws. Does anyone \nseriously believe that their objective is anything less than to gut the \neffectiveness of those laws? Now, why should we not debate that? Why \nshould we not be able to offer an amendment or amendments? Does anyone \nseriously believe that their objective is anything less than to gut the \neffectiveness of those laws? Does anyone seriously believe that, in any \nfull negotiating round, our hemispheric trading partners will not work \nin concert with Japan, Korea, and the European Union to eviscerate the \nframework of fair trade as we know it?\n  Some of the FTAA countries undoubtedly also have in mind that our \ntrade laws be interpreted and applied by multilateral tribunals--in \nother words, the chapter 19 model. Under Chapter 19 of NAFTA, persons \nwho, in many instances, are not even trained in U.S. law, and who have \na strong personal or professional interest in weakening our trade laws, \nare called to interpret and apply them. The result should have been \npredictable: enforcement of those laws has been compromised. Senators \ndon't have to believe me. Just read retired U.S. Court of Appeals Judge \nMalcolm Wilkey's dissent in the Canadian softwood lumber extraordinary \nchallenge determination! Judge Wilkey contrasts the promises that were \nmade to Congress in connection with Chapter 19--particularly that it \nwould lead to no change in U.S. law--with the frequent refusal of \nforeign panelists to apply basic concepts of American administrative \nlaw such as the standard of review. He also raises serious questions \nabout whether Chapter 19 ignores conflicts of interest on the part of \npanelists that would be disqualifying under our rules of ethics.\n  My conclusion from all of this is simple. If ``trade negotiating \nauthority,'' to use the administration's term for fast-track, means \nthat Congress agrees to surrender its responsibility to thoroughly \nevaluate--and refine, if necessary--those provisions of proposed \ninternational agreements that might necessitate changes to our trade \nlaws and regulations, I want nothing of it.\n  In considering these three issues--the steel crisis, trade with \nChina, and fast-track--I am motivated by a deep and abiding concern for \nthe hardworking men and women of my country, America. They have been \nhammered by deindustrialization and disinvestment. Both the public \nsector and the private sector are to blame for these trends, as well as \npoliticians, which have been long in the making. But there is one thing \nwe can say with certainty: the trade liberalization model that has been \nrelied upon by recent administrations--Democratic and Republican--does \nnot help. It limits the ability of the United States to use import \nrestrictions to ensure fair trade in our markets while giving foreign \ncountries such as China virtually a free hand in excluding selected \nU.S. exports from their markets. What is fair about that? What is free \nabout that? That isn't free trade. In light of the current situation in \nmany of our basic industries, this imbalance can no longer be \ntolerated.\n  We must remember from whence we came. I happen to go back to the \nhills and the hollows and the Mountain State of West Virginia, which \nwas born during the Civil War, to renew my love, to renew my \nrecollection, and to reinvigorate my understanding of what the people \ndeserve and what the people want.\n  We must remember from whence we came and before whom we are destined \nto give an accounting. So remember from whence we came, remember where \nwe are going, and remember before whom we must give an accounting.\n  We must stand up for the working men and women of America, the people \nwho have not forgotten God's edict that he delivered when he drove Adam \nand Eve from the Garden of Eden, to earn thy bread by the sweat of thy \nbrow. Those are the people we must remember.\n  We must stand up for them and stand against any initiative that would \nundermine the framework of ``fair trade.'' We must not allow anyone in \nthe name of ``free trade'' or anyone in the name of ``fast track'' to \ndestroy the way of life of communities across the Nation.\n  No, Mr. President, we don't need fast track.

Mr. President, on April 7, 2001, Robbie Callaway, \nSenior Vice President for Boys & Girls Clubs of America, was honored \nwith the organization's highest award for professional service: the \nThomas G. Garth Character and Courage Award.\n  Thomas G. Garth served as president of Boys & Girls Clubs of America \nfrom 1988 until his death in 1996. It was under his leadership that \nBoys & Girls Clubs began their aggressive outreach movement into \nAmerica's most distressed communities and evolved into one of our \nNation's premier youth development organizations. It was Tom's dream \nthat every disadvantaged youth in America have access to a Boys & Girls \nClub.\n  The Thomas G. Garth Character and Courage Award is presented each \nyear to the professional in the Boys & Girls Clubs movement that best \nexemplifies the qualities of character and courage, the very qualities \nthat made Tom Garth an extraordinary leader and role model.\n  Those of us who are fortunate to have known Robbie Callaway for many \nyears are not surprised by his receipt of the Thomas G. Garth Character \nand Courage Award. Character and courage have defined his service to \nthe Nation's youth. Not only is Robbie's enthusiasm contagious, but he \nalso sets an example for others to follow.\n  Robbie has dedicated himself to ensuring that every one of our \nNation's youth is given an opportunity at a better life. Countless \nyoung people and communities throughout America have benefitted as a \nresult. The progress that Boys & Girls Clubs of America have made in \npublic housing, Native American lands, and other inner-city and rural \ncommunities is due in large part to his relentless spirit and his \nunwillingness to take ``no'' for an answer. He believes in his heart, \nas did Tom Garth, that it is Boys & Girls Clubs of America's obligation \nto reach every child in need and at-risk.\n  Robbie is also a founding board member of the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, where he currently serves as chairman-\nelect. As a result of the National Center's extensive relationship with \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement, along with corporate \nAmerica, it is the leading child safety organization in America. The \nNational Center also has a strong working partnership with Boys & Girls \nClubs of America. Together, these two fine organizations strive to keep \nour Nation's youth out of harm's way.\n  Robbie has received numerous awards throughout his career. Yet he \nwill tell you his greatest accomplishment is raising, along with his \nwife Sue, two fine children, Adam and Maureen.\n  The United States of America is a better place because of people \npurchase Robbie Callaway. His selfless contributions have impacted the \nlives of this Nation's youth and will continue to do so for generations \nto come. We owe him a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4397-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4397-S4398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to express my dismay at the Economic and Social \nCouncil's vote yesterday removing the United States from membership on \nthe United Nations Human Rights Commission for the first time since its \ninception in 1946.\n  The United States was a founding member of this distinguished body \nand has been an active member since its establishment. Under the \nchairmanship of Eleanor Roosevelt, the U.S. was instrumental in helping \nto draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the very first work \nof the Commission and one that deeply reflects longstanding and \ntreasured American values. For over 50 years, the United States has \nworked within the Commission to codify fundamental human rights and \npractices. Through the Commission we have also fought for vigorous \ninvestigations of grave breaches of human rights wherever they occurred \nand have raised our voice in defense of freedom on behalf of those \nwhose own voices were silenced.\n  The Commission's membership has grown along with the membership in \nthe United Nations as newly independent nations have joined the world \nbodies. However, the inclusion of countries with extremely poor human \nrights records, such as Sudan and Cuba, on the Commission is troubling. \nAnd it means that we will have to work even harder to promote universal \nstandards so that one day all people can enjoy the freedom, liberty and \nequality we too often take for granted here at home.\n  We may never know why so many countries voted against us in the \nsecret balloting. I am afraid, however, that it may reflect widespread \ndissatisfaction with what is perceived to be a go-it-alone attitude in \nforeign affairs by the new administration. Our friends and allies have \nreacted negatively to a number of President Bush's pronouncements and \npolicies, including rejection of the Kyoto Climate Change Treaty, his \nopposition to the International Criminal Court, and his willingness to \nabandon the ABM Treaty before we have a workable missile defense plan \nin place. This vote clearly demonstrates that there can be \nunanticipated and damaging consequences to our actions on the world \nstage. The U.S. cannot take our friends for granted and must remain \nvigilant against the anti-U.S. efforts of our enemies.\n  The United States now becomes an observer on the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission but we can, indeed we must, remain actively engaged in \ndefending human rights throughout the world. We have lost our vote but \nnot our voice. The Commission will be weaker without our membership and \nour leadership. But the real losers in yesterday's election were the \noppressed, people in many parts of the world who desperately need the \nsupport of the United States and the United Nations to stop abuses of \ntheir basic rights and to bring the light of freedom into their lives.\n  I am terribly disappointed by the vote against U.S. membership on the \nCommission. However, we must not allow this vote to deter our efforts \nto promote and defend human rights around the world. Our commitment and \nleadership in advancing freedom, equality and justice for all people \nderives from the principles on which our Nation was founded and which \ncontinue to guide us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4398-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DISASTER TAX EXEMPT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as those of us from our Nation's southern \nand eastern coastal areas know, living in the sunshine of summer can be \na double-edged sword. As Floridians enjoy the best weather Mother \nNature has to offer, we must not neglect preparations for the start of \nhurricane season on June 1, 2001. I am pleased to join my colleague \nfrom Florida, Senator Nelson, and my colleagues from Texas in \nintroducing legislation that will help protect Florida from economic \ndevastation as sunny days and warm water are accompanied by the \npotential for catastrophic disaster.\n  Our legislation amends section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to \ngrant tax-exempt status to State chartered, not-for-profit insurers \nserving markets in which commercial insurance is not available. In \nFlorida, this legislation will assist the Florida Windstorm \nUnderwriting Association, FWUA, and the Florida Residential Property \nand Casualty Joint Underwriting Association, JUA.\n  The Florida Windstorm Association was created in 1970. Twenty-two \nyears later, in 1992, the legislature authorized the Joint Underwriting \nAssociation. These organizations operate as residual market mechanisms. \nThey provide residential property and casualty insurance coverage for \nthose residents who need, but are unable to procure, insurance through \nthe voluntary market.\n  The JUA was created in direct response to $16 billion in covered \nlosses during Hurricane Andrew. The destructive force of Andrew \nrendered a number of property insurance companies insolvent. Other \nfirms reacted to the catastrophe by withdrawing from the Florida \nmarket.\n  During those fortunate years when Florida is not hit by major \nhurricanes or other natural disasters, the FWUA and JUA take in more \npremiums than are paid out in claims and expenses. Florida law prevents \nthose funds from being distributed so that needed reserves will \naccumulate in preparation for disasters we know will come in the \nfuture.\n  Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes Florida for this \nresponsible, forward thinking practice. It requires that 35 percent of \nthose funds be sent to Washington, as Federal income taxes rather than \nbe used to accumulate reserves. Designating State chartered, non-profit \ninsurers as tax-exempt entities will help Florida amass the necessary \nreserves to pay claims brought on by a catastrophe.\n  State law also authorizes the FWUA and the JUA to assess property \ninsurance policyholders for losses generated by natural disasters. Tax \nexemption will reduce the frequency and severity of assessments levied \nagainst individual policyholders, because higher reserves will be \navailable to cover losses.\n  Mr. President, though nearly a decade has passed, Hurricane Andrew is \nstill a nightmarish memory for Floridians. The National Weather Service \nexpects this hurricane season to be another active storm season. It is \nimperative that the Federal Government avoids the comfortable habit of \nignoring lessons presented by Andrew and other recent catastrophes.\n  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives and enjoys bipartisan support from Florida's \ncongressional delegation.\n  Our legislation is extremely important to homeowners and businesses \nthroughout Florida, all of whom are subject to assessment if reserves \nare not sufficient to pay claims in the event of a catastrophe. Florida \nremains sensitive to the perils of nature. Enactment of this \nlegislation will permit our State to prepare for the next Hurricane \nAndrew while alleviating some of the economic hardship exacted on \nFlorida property owners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4398-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4398-S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         VERMONT GRANITE MUSEUM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week I had the pleasure of \nattending the raising of the old Jones Brothers granite shed in Barre, \nVermont. This historic wooden building built in 1895 will be raised \nfour feet off the ground for several months while a new foundation is \npoured and the building is secured. Once one of the largest granite \nmanufacturing plants in the world, this building will soon be home to \nthe Vermont Granite Museum, a tribute to one of Vermont's oldest and \nproudest industries. As the grandson of a stonecutter I cannot think of \na better way to honor this heritage than a world class museum and \nlearning center in the heart of Vermont. I would like to share with my \ncolleagues the comments of my fellow Vermonters, Edwin Granai and \nMarsha Davis, who spoke eloquently of this building, its history and \nwhat the museum will mean to our state.\n  I ask consent that the statements of Edwin Granai and Marcia Davis be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\n  The statements follow:\n\n                        Remarks of Edwin Granai\n\n       ``In Italia,'' my grandmother used to say, ``Una volta un \n     portiere sempre un portiere (Once a porter always a \n     porter).'' At the beginning of the last century in Italy \n     those born into poverty lived a life of poverty. The rigid \n     class structure of the monarchy would prevail in Italy for \n     another half century. My grandparents did not have a half \n     century to wait, so they came America, the ``Promised Land.'' \n     My grandfather emigrated from the quarries of Carrara, Italy, \n     to the quarries of Barre, Vermont to find work and above all \n     opportunity.\n       The Promised Land did not materialize for him. His earnings \n     never rose above subsistence level and he lost his health at \n     mid-life. He died in his forties with empty pockets and dust-\n     filled lungs. My father, after completing the fourth grade at \n     Brook Street School, went to work at the age of ten years in \n     1907 in this very building to help support his family. In \n     time America did become the Promised Land for my father and \n     for his children, of which I am one. But my grandfather died \n     as he came, poor.\n       Other immigrants made it in the first generation. Last Fall \n     I stayed an extra day in Washington to visit the recently \n     completed National Cathedral. It is one of the world's great \n     churches. Roger Marigi was the Master Carver for a quarter \n     century during the completion years. His grandfather came to \n     Barre at the same time mine did. Marigi says: ``My \n     grandfather came to America from Italy in 1890 . . . He went \n     to Barre, Vermont, because all the Italian stone carvers were \n     up there. That's where you got your job . . . You went up to \n     Barre because that's where the work was. Granite. You stayed \n     there and learned . . .''\n       The work was here because we have Barre Gray, the durable \n     and aesthetically pleasing stone that adorns memorials, \n     buildings, and plazas throughout the world. And we had the \n     skilled quarriers, artisans and sculptors to extract and \n     shape that stone. They came from Italy, Scotland, Sweden, \n     England, Spain, France, Canada, and around the world to \n     Barre.\n       The work is still here for the same reasons. We have a \n     4500-year supply of Barre Gray. And we still have the finest \n     quarriers, manufacturers, artisans and sculptors shaping that \n     stone. Sculptors from all over America and around the world \n     come to Barre today to learn from and work with Barre stone \n     artisans.\n       These assets--the stone and skilled workers--are like the \n     foundation we dedicate today. This foundation is the starting \n     point for the restoration of this historic building. Our \n     granite and our skilled workers are both out heritage and the \n     starting point for the renewal of Barre's granite industry.\n       At the beginning of this new century we live in a very \n     different world from that of our fathers. The citizens of \n     Barre City and Barre Town recognized this when they gathered \n     in 1994 to brainstorm their vision for the future. They saw \n     the challenge of the global marketplace. They recognized that \n     in today's world economy our granite industry is in fierce \n     competition with lesser quality stone and inferior artistry. \n     In the vision of the Vermont Granite Museum they recognized \n     the value of combining and displaying the wisdom of the past \n     with a modern learning environment that will create a \n     dynamic marketing force for the industry. The educational \n     programs of the museum will invigorate the worldwide \n     learning connection. The tourist benefit, 90,000 people \n     per year, will infuse six million dollars annually into \n     the central Vermont economy. More importantly together \n     they will create a new level of awareness for the beauty, \n     function and utility of Barre Gray in all its uses, and a \n     new level of appreciation for stone finishing and carving \n     as both art and vocation.\n       This is an ambitious project and it is happening thanks in \n     large part to everyone here assembled. I grew up in Barre and \n     maintain strong family and community ties. I have never seen \n     such a strong focus and wide spread support for a community \n     project. The scale requires it.\n       I had never been in this building until I toured it with \n     Marcia a year and a half ago. I came to see what we were \n     starting with and to imagine what it could become. I was not \n     prepared for what happened to me within minutes of my entry. \n     Suddenly and unexpectedly I was keenly aware of the ghost of \n     my deceased father working here as a child and young man. His \n     presence was so real it penetrated my heart and threatened my \n     composure. It took my breath away. And, when I got my breath, \n     I then thought of my grandfather and said a silent prayer of \n     thanks to Coriolano for his courage to leave his homeland to \n     come to America.\n       I will never forget that moment. It profoundly deepened my \n     connection to my heritage here in Barre, to my father and \n     grandfather through the work that they did and the sacrifices \n     they made. It connected me in a new way to their courage and \n     spirit, and in so doing strengthened my determination to put \n     my shoulder to this project. The pay-off of this project \n     began for me on that day when the rehabilitation of this \n     building had barely begun. I can only imagine the impact of \n     the finished museum. If I seem enthused about this project it \n     is because I am. And my enthusiasm increases each step of the \n     way.\n       As we dedicate this foundation of what is to be a world \n     class museum and learning center we are half way to our \n     twelve million-dollar goal. That is remarkable. But just as \n     remarkable is the energy that has emerged around this \n     project. It is the kind of energy that will create a new \n     prosperity for this community and region. The glass is half \n     full--enough to toast the courage and fortitude of our \n     ancestors and to say with certainty to our heirs that the \n     future of Barre is as solid as the rock--Barre Gray--upon \n     which it is build.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRemarks of Marcia A. Davis, Executive Director, Vermont Granite Museum \n                                of Barre\n\n       Welcome.\n       We are here today to celebrate Vermont's granite industry: \n     its past, present and future.\n       The Jones Brothers granite shed represents the industry's \n     distinguished past. Built in 1895, with Douglas Fir timbers, \n     brought by rail from the Pacific Northwest, this building was \n     one of the first straight shed designs to be constructed in \n     Barre to house water powered overhead cranes.\n       Who were the Jones Brothers?\n       The Jones Brothers were sons of Hugh Jones, whom at age 2 \n     immigrated to America with his parents from Wales, and \n     settled in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. When the Civil War broke \n     out, Hugh Jones enlisted and became the first Union soldier \n     to be killed at the Battle of Fort Stedman, Virginia, in \n     1865, leaving behind a widow and six children all under the \n     age of 13.\n       Fifteen years later, the two older Jones Brothers, \n     Marshall, and Seward, ``imbued with faith in an industry, in \n     themselves, in their friends, and in a nation'', opened their \n     own wholesale monumental business in 1882 in Boston, \n     Massachusetts. Marshall was 29 years old. Seward was four \n     years younger.\n       Their monument dealership dealt in light pink and gray \n     granite from Scotland, darker granites from Sweden, Norway, \n     and Finland, and native granite from Quincy, Massachusetts.\n       Later on two younger brothers, Dayton and Hugh Jones, \n     joined the company, and they opened an office in Aberdeen, \n     Scotland in 1884.\n       While searching for granites in New England, the Jones \n     Brothers were introduced to Barre Gray granite. They \n     described it as having a ``color and texture far surpassing \n     the gray Scotch in beauty and quality''.\n       In 1886, they decided to expand again, purchasing a dark \n     gray granite quarry on Millstone Hill, Barre, and leased a \n     granite manufacturing shed from Mackie & Simpson, on 46 \n     Granite Street, the very same site of the Socialist Block, \n     now known as the Old Labor Hall.\n       The Jones Brothers Company also owned and operated the \n     Wells Lamson Quarry in Barre Town.\n       The Jones Brothers Company was the first granite enterprise \n     to advertise finished granite monuments nationally in 1927.\n       The Jones Brothers Company employed as many as 500 people \n     on this very site.\n       The Jones Brothers Company was referred to as the largest \n     and oldest granite manufacturing plant in the world. The \n     business closed in 1975.\n       The company's trademark, registered in 1926, portrays an \n     angel with arms and wings outstretched above a rectangular \n     memorial which says ``Guardian Memorials of Everlasting \n     Beauty. To mark the place with beauty forever.''\n       And they did.\n       Thousands of monuments, family mausoleums, memorials, and \n     buildings were designed, commissioned and produced on this \n     very site for eighty years.\n       Some of the more notable structures located throughout the \n     country are:\n\n     The Green Beret Memorial, dedicated by John Wayne, in Fort \n         Bragg, No. Carolina\n     The Beacon Monument for the Massachusetts State House, in \n         Boston, Massachusetts\n     Sixteen Massive Pillars in the nave of St. John the Divine \n         Cathedral, in New York City (Eight of which were six feet \n         in diameter, 38 feet high, weighing 100 tons each, and \n         took a year to produce, transport and set them prior to \n         construction of the cathedral itself.)\n     The Brigham Young Memorial in Salt Lake City, Utah\n     The Shevchenko Memorial in Washington, DC\n     The Coal Miners Memorial in West Virginia\n     The U.S. President William Henry Harrison Memorial\n     And mausoleums for the Woolrich, Firestone, Heinz, Hood, \n         Hershey, Ringling and Webb families.\n\n       With technological advances in power, transportation, and \n     machinery came the ``boom years'' of the granite industry. \n     Between 1880 and 1900, in Barre alone, the population grew \n     from 2060 to 11,754. Montpelier, Northfield, Woodbury, \n     Hardwick, Bethel and South Ryegate were full of granite sheds \n     and quarries.\n       Waves of immigrants came from Scotland, Italy, England, \n     Ireland, France, Spain, Canada, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark \n     to work in Vermont's stone industry. They came through Ellis \n     Island, Boston and other ports of entry, many of them having \n     to leave their families behind, yet full of hope for a better \n     life in America.\n       These men cut, hauled, shaped, lettered and carved stone \n     with a passion for their families, and for Vermont, \n     ultimately becoming Americans.\n       Even under extremely difficult working conditions, these \n     men and this industry not\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\n     only survived, but flourished, transforming this country's \n     landscape as we know it today.\n       Today, granite countertops are to be expected in luxury \n     homes and offices. NASA's subcontractors use granite \n     precision surface plates to check for flaws or aberrations in \n     the shuttle's engine parts, as do numerous other \n     manufacturers for products that require the most stable and \n     accurate conditions are required for manufacturing.\n       No one can predict the future, however, we do know the \n     granite industry is up for whatever challenges may come its \n     way, and that will become a new exhibit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CELEBRATING THE SCHIFFER CANCER CENTER OF WHEELING HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nrecent accomplishment of one of West Virginia's finest health care \nfacilities, the Schiffer Cancer Center at Wheeling Hospital. Wheeling \nHospital just became one of only two community hospitals in the country \nand the ninth facility in the world to become a part of the Partnership \nin Science with the Division of Clinical Sciences of the National \nCancer Institute in Bethesda, MD. This is an incredible and important \naccomplishment for this facility and the citizens of West Virginia.\n  Wheeling Hospital, which is located in Wheeling, WV, is an acute care \ncommunity hospital, which just celebrated its 150th anniversary last \nyear. Located right in the heart of the northern pan-handle in Ohio \nCounty, the hospital serves Ohio County, parts of Brook and Marshall \nCounties, and eastern Ohio State residents bordering the Ohio River in \naddition to residents of southwestern Pennsylvania and across the State \nof West Virginia.\n  I had the pleasure of visiting Wheeling Hospital in 1993 for the \ndedication of their Howard Long Wellness Center. The facility employs \napproximately 2,000 people and maintains five centers of excellence \nincluding: cancer; cardiac, including open heart surgery; women's \nhealth; trauma; and the Howard Long Wellness Center, which is 55,000 \nsq. feet. The recent partnership between Wheeling Hospital and the \nNational Center Institute is one of the greatest achievements in cancer \ncare that has happened in the Ohio Valley. With this partnership, \nqualified cancer patients in the area will be able to participate in a \nselect number of new cancer research protocols without leaving home. \nThey will also be empowered to consult with and obtain second, third, \neven fourth opinions about their condition and treatment. Additionally, \nthe partnership increases education opportunities for physicians, \nnurses, and other health care professionals in the area. Residents of \nWest Virginia, eastern Ohio, and southwestern Pennsylvania will all \nbenefit from this partnership.\n  I am so thankful to Wheeling Hospital, its CEO, Don Hofreuter, its \ndoctors and nurses, and all of its employees for all of the amazing \nwork that they continue to do to serve their community. The people of \nOhio County, West Virginia, and the surrounding area are indeed \nfortunate to have you as part of our community. Congratulations on your \n150th anniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4400-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated.\n\n           By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \n             Kyl):\n       S. 834.

A bill to establish the Detroit River International Wildlife \nRefuge in the State of Michigan, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Detroit \nRiver International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act. The Detroit \nRiver is one of North America's greatest rivers and is a part of our \nMichigan heritage. It not only joins the Upper Great Lakes to the Lower \nGreat Lakes, but it also connects Canadians and Americans through an \ninseparable border. This great resource is one that we must work hard \nto protect so that generations to come can benefit from its economic, \nrecreational and ecological value.\n  The Detroit River provides a home to communities of unique plants and \nanimals and rare, threatened and endangered species. The Michigan \nDepartment of Natural Resources and Ontario Ministry of Natural \nResources recognize the Detroit River as having one of the highest \ndiversities of wildlife and fish in all of the Great Lakes. More than \n29 species of waterfowl and 65 kinds of fish make their home in the \nDetroit River. The river is an important waterfowl migration corridor \nwhere an estimated three million ducks, geese, swans, and coots migrate \nannually. The Detroit Audubon Society has documented over 300 species \nof birds in the Detroit-Windsor area, and approximately 150 bird \nspecies nest near the river.\n  The Detroit River also provides shipping channels which link Detroit \nto a worldwide economy. Further, approximately half of the over 870,000 \npleasure boats registered in Michigan are used on the Detroit River and \nLake St. Clair, in part to fish for the estimated 10 million walleye \nthat ascend the Detroit River each spring from Lake Erie to spawn. \nThese walleye have helped create an internationally renowned sport \nfishery.\n  In 1998, the Detroit River was designated an American Heritage River \nwhich will assist the community in a revitalization effort to celebrate \nthe river's history and heritage. Further, it is anticipated that the \nDetroit River will receive a Canadian Heritage River designation this \nyear, making it the first international heritage river system in North \nAmerica.\n  This is a river that we need to protect. Fish and wildlife habitat in \nthe Lower Detroit River continue to be destroyed and degraded. It has \nbeen estimated that over 95 percent of the historical, coastal wetlands \nalong the river have been lost to development. This legislation would \nprotect remaining high quality habitat before they are lost to further \ndevelopment and rehabilitate and enhance degraded ones.\n  Specifically, this legislation would authorize the Secretary of \nInterior to acquire American lands adjacent to the Detroit River in \norder to protect its wildlife and habitat. It further authorizes the \nPresident and Secretary of Interior to negotiate with Canadian \nofficials to create a Detroit River International Wildlife Corridor in \nthe lands adjacent to the River, including both American and Canadian \nlands. The legislation authorizes the Secretary to procure land from \nwilling sellers or donors, islands and other natural features along the \nDetroit River, running some 18 miles from Mud Island to Pt. Mouillee. \nThe legislation would also authorize the Secretary to negotiate \ncooperative management agreements with landowners living along the \nDetroit River.\n  The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act \nwill provide the protections necessary to save and preserve this \npriceless treasure for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4401-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 372.

Mr. President, our collective national memory is still \nhaunted by images from the so-called ``McCarthy Era.'' This was a time \nin the middle of the last century when ``The Red Scare'' came to \ndominate both the headlines and the national consciousness, a time when \nno stone was left unturned in the search for the Communists beneath \nthem.\n  Truth took a back seat during ``The Red Scare,'' with the result that \ninnocent and guilty alike had their rights trampled upon, and an \nentirely proper investigation became an exercise in hysteria. During \n``The Red Scare'' we lost track of the facts and got wrapped-up in the \nemotions of the time.\n  The United States is now entering into an energy crisis. Demand for \npower is up and supplies are, if not down, at least not keeping up with \nthat demand. As an example, gasoline prices are over $2 a gallon, and \nthe hot weather and travel season aren't even here yet, Mr. President!\n  We all know there's a real power crisis in the State of California. \nHow it came about is well-documented and need not occupy us here today. \nSuffice it to say, all the elements conspired to come together at the \nright time and in the right place--much like the events told in ``The \nPerfect Storm''--and this disaster is now upon us.\n  How are we going to get out of it, or, at least, mitigate the worst \nof its effects? How do we get there from here? I submit we are neither \ngoing to exclusively drill our way out of it, nor are we going to \nexclusively conserve our way out of it. Both those options may look \ngood on paper, but they are doomed to failure in the real world.\n  This body is about to come to grips with designing a national energy \npolicy. It will be an interesting time for us, as we work to blend \neffective conservation measures with ways to ensure that we have the \npower sources we need. It is my hope that this plan will be based on \nsound science, not on emotions or slogans. If it's not, it's eyewash, \nnot worth the paper the headlines it would generate are written on.\n  Mr. President, there is a five-part series entitled ``Environment \nInc.,'' which ran between April 22 and April 26, 2001, in the \n``Sacramento Bee'' newspaper.\n  This series was written by a ``Bee'' reporter named Tom Knudson. Mr. \nKnudson has won two Pulitzer Prices for his writing on environmental \nissues.\n  This series examines the high-powered fund raising machine that now \ncharacterizes much of today's Corporate Environmental Culture, a \nmachine that increasingly funds, not environmental conservation \nefforts, but an unceasing flow of litigation and a spreading spill of \npublic relations efforts. Conservation organizations have, themselves, \nbecome big businesses, complete with fund raising consultants and \ntremendous salaries.\n  Annual salaries for the heads of 9 of the 10 largest environmental \ngroups now top $200,000; one makes over $300,000 a year. In 1997, and \nI quote here: ``. . . one group fired its president and awarded him a \nseverance payment of $760,335.'' We don't see television ads of fat \ncats in their high-rise offices or swilling martinis in ritzy hotels. \nThe article notes that some are now calling the Sierra Club, ``Club \nSierra.'' John Muir would be appalled, I think.\n\n  Make no mistake about it, the Corporate Environmental Culture has\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nraised a lot of money. Direct mail efforts. It boggles the mind to \nthink that anyone would give money to a group that sends out millions \nof paper brochures asking for money to save the rain forest. \nTelemarketing efforts. ``Send us money or the Jenkins Warbler goes \nextinct on the 27th of next month.''\n  This series points out that, and I quote:\n\n       Six national environmental groups spend so much money on \n     fund raising and overhead they don't have enough left to meet \n     the minimum benchmark for environmental spending--60 percent \n     of annual expenses--recommended by charity watchdog \n     organizations.\n\n  Many--although, in fairness, not all--of these groups use an \naccounting loophole--and again I quote:\n\n     to classify millions of dollars spend on direct mail and \n     telemarketing not as fund raising, but as public education \n     and environmental activism!\n\n  If a citizen wants to give a few bucks to Club Sierra, that's not \nproperly any of our business, is it? But increasingly, this series \npoints out, environmental groups are inundating the courts with \nendangered species lawsuits. Such suits have become one of their basic \ntools. Even if there's no chance they'll win, they can tie up projects \nin courts for years on end.\n  Every time the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service misses a deadline, a \nlawsuit follows like a hungry duckling waddling after its mother. \nIncreasingly, the Service will tell you they are devoting more and more \nof their time and resources to fighting lawsuits, which leaves less and \nless time for the wildlife biology that is the Service's proper \nbusiness.\n  Why would groups suppposedly dedicated to conservation behave this \nway? Increasingly evidence suggests this onslaught of suits might well \nhave its roots in the Almighty Dollar and the pursuit thereof. A lawyer \nwho wins one of these ``citizen suits'' is entitled to a refund of his \nor her attorney fees from the taxpayers. These attorneys typically \ncharge $150 to $350 an hour. The series notes that, and again I quote:\n\n       When California water districts won a suit . . . last year, \n     they submitted a bill for $546,403.70 to the government. The \n     Justice Department was stunned.\n\n  It gets worse. There is increasing evidence that environmental groups \nare misusing science. They are behaving the way a fellow who tries to \nsell you a used toothbrush behaves, that is, they tell the truth, but \nthey don't tell the whole truth. Here's an example from the series \nrelating to necessary thinning programs in national forests.\n\n       The buildup of fuels in Western forests was a prominent \n     topic in the 1996 Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project report, a \n     3,187-page scientific assessment of the California mountain \n     range.\n       Citing a remarkable accumulation of vegetation and \n     deadwood, the $6.5 million, congressionally funded report \n     warned of a fiery future--unless overcrowded stands were \n     thinned soon.\n       One suggested remedy was small-tree logging, followed by \n     prescribed fire. `Logging can serve as a tool to help reduce \n     fire hazard,' it stated.\n       Environmental groups overlooked that part of the report.\n       Instead, they plucked one sentence from thousands to argue \n     that all logging is bad. Here's how the National Forest \n     Protection Alliance, a consortium of activists, used the \n     report last fall in an action alert, under the heading, \n     ``What the Government's Own Scientists Say about Logging and \n     Wildfires'': ``Timber harvest, through its effects on forest \n     structure, local microclimate and fuels accumulation has \n     increased fire severity more than any other recent human \n     activity.''\n\n  One fire scientist who helped write the report notes that the excerpt \nrefers to historic logging that left Western forests littered with \nwoody debris--not modern thinning designed to clean up such debris. \nInformed of this, a network coordinator for the forest alliance, said: \n``This is the most popular fact we have. It is a quote congresspeople \nhave used.''\n  Well, that settles that for all time, doesn't it, Mr. President?\n  I submit that our national energy policy is increasingly being \naffected not by scientific fact and the best interests of the country, \nbut by the same type of hysteria and misinformation we saw when truth \ntook a back seat during ``The Red Scare'' of 50 years ago.\n  During ``The Red Scare'' we lost track of the facts and got wrapped-\nup in emotion. During ``The Green Scare,'' which we're going through \nnow, we're giving ourselves over to hysteria yet again. This present-\nday hysteria is fed by a bloated, inefficient environmental industry, \nabsorbed by its pursuit of money and devoted to the preservation, not \nof the natural environment, but of its own high rise, martini-swilling \ncorporate lifestyle. There is a sizeable body of evidence that \nEnvironment, Inc. is willing to abandon truth and science, even the \nvery reason for its existence, in pursuit of a buck. It is a movement \nthat has lost its soul.\n  There's a bright side to all this. First of all, the word is getting \nout. Thanks to people like Tom Knudson, the author of the ``Environment \nInc.'' series and to concerned people in an out of the environmental \nmovement, more and more people are coming to realize they've bought \nthat used toothbrush we talked about before. As our population soars \nand demands upon our eco-system accelerate, there is much real \nenvironmental work to be done.\n  I will conclude where Mr. Knudson's series concludes, with the coming \nthing in environmentalism, a movement both new and rooted in the very \norigins of environmentalism. Everyday ``garden-variety'' \nenvironmentalists are bringing ``more science, entrepreneurial skill, \naccountability, teamwork, and results to a movement they say has grown \nself-righteous, inefficient, chaotic, and shrill.'' The Nature \nConservancy, the Conservation Fund, and other groups are focusing, not \non their offices and attorney fees, but on protecting land and on \nrestoring it. These groups are making allowances for necessary \ndevelopment.\n  This represents a maturing of the environmental movement, a \nrealization that it is fire not smoke that counts, results, not \nheadlines. It is time for America to stand up to the lies and hysteria \nof ``The Green Scare'' and say: ``No. Not again.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from the series \n``Environment Inc.'' be printed in the Record.\n  I wish to also note that the entire series may be found at: \nwww.sacbee.com/news/projects/environment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 22, 2001]\n\n      Fat of the Land--Movement's Prosperity Comes at a High Price\n\n                            (By Tom Knudson)\n\n       As a grass-roots conservationist from Oregon, Jack Shipley \n     looked forward to his visit to Washington, D.C., to promote a \n     community-based forest management plan. But when he stepped \n     into the national headquarters of The Wilderness Society, his \n     excitement turned to unease.\n       ``It was like a giant corporation,'' Shipley said, ``Floor \n     after floor after floor, just like Exxon or AT''\n       In San Francisco, Sierra Club board member Chad Hanson \n     experienced a similar letdown when he showed up for a soiree \n     at one of the city's finest hotels in 1997.\n       ``Here I had just been elected to the largest grass-roots \n     environmental group in the world and I am having martinis in \n     the penthouse of the Westin St. Francis,'' said Hanson, an \n     environmental activist from Pasadena. ``What's wrong with \n     this picture? It was surreal.''\n       Soon, Hanson was calling the Sierra Club by a new name: \n     Club Sierra.\n       Extravagance is not a trait normally linked with \n     environmental groups. The movement's tradition leans toward \n     simplicity, economy and living light on the land. But today, \n     as record sums of money flow to environmental causes, \n     prosperity is pushing tradition aside, and the millions of \n     Americans who support environmental groups are footing the \n     bill.\n       High-rise offices, ritzy hotels and martinis are but one \n     sign of wider change. Rising executive salaries and fat Wall \n     Street portfolios are another. So, too, is a costly reliance \n     on fund-raising consultants for financial success.\n       Put the pieces together and you find a movement estranged \n     from its past, one that has come to resemble the corporate \n     world it often seeks to reform.\n       Although environmental organizations have accomplished many \n     stirring and important victories over the years, today groups \n     prosper while the land does not. Competition for money and \n     members is keen, Litigation is a blood sport. Crisis, real or \n     not, is a commodity. And slogans and sound bites masquerade \n     as scientific fact.\n       ``National environmental organizations, I fear, have grown \n     away from the grass roots to mirror the foxes they had been \n     chasing,'' said environmental author Michael Frome, at a \n     wilderness conference in Seattle last year. ``They seem to me \n     to have turned tame, corporate and compromising.''\n       This series of articles--based on more than 200 interviews, \n     travel across 12 states and northern Mexico, and thousands of \n     state and\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\n     federal records--will explore the poverty of plenty that has \n     come to characterize much of the environmental movement. Some \n     of the highlights:\n       Salaries for environmental leaders have never been higher. \n     In 1999--the most recent year for which comparable figures \n     are available--chief executives at nine of the nation's 10 \n     largest environmental groups earned $200,000 and up, and one \n     topped $300,000. In 1997, one group fired its president and \n     awarded him a severance payment of $760,335.\n       Money is flowing to conservation in unprecedented amounts, \n     reaching $3.5 billion in 1999, up 94 percent from 1992. But \n     much of it is not actually used to protect the environment. \n     Instead, it is siphoned off to pay for bureaucratic overhead \n     and fund raising, including expensive direct-mail and \n     telemarketing consultants.\n       Subsidized by federal tax dollars, environmental groups are \n     filing a blizzard of lawsuits that no longer yield \n     significant gain for the environment and sometimes infuriate \n     federal judges and the Justice Department. During the 1990s, \n     the U.S. Treasury paid $31.6 million in legal fees for \n     environmental cases filed against the government.\n       Those who know the environment best--the scientists who \n     devote their careers to it--say environmental groups often \n     twist fact into fantasy to serve their agendas. That is \n     especially true in the debate over one of America's most \n     majestic landscapes: its Western evergreen forests. A 1999 \n     report by the U.S. General Accounting Office found that 39 \n     million acres across the West are ``at high risk of \n     catastrophic fire.'' Yet many groups use science selectively \n     to oppose thinning efforts that could reduce fire risk.\n       ``A lot of environmental messages are simply not \n     accurate,'' said Jerry Franklin, a professor of forest \n     ecology and ecosystem science at the University of \n     Washington. ``But that's the way we sell messages in this \n     society. We use hype. And we use those pieces of information \n     that sustain our position. I guess all large organizations do \n     that.''\n       And sometimes when nature needs help the most, \n     environmental groups are busy with other things.\n       As the tiny Fresno kangaroo rat struggled for survival in \n     the industrialized farmland of California's San Joaquin \n     Valley in the 1990s, for example, the environmental movement \n     did not seem to notice.\n       As a fisheries conservationist tried to save rare trout \n     species across remote parts of Oregon and Nevada, he found no \n     safety net in major environmental groups.\n       As sea turtles washed up dead and dying on Texas beaches in \n     1993, no groups made the turtles their mascot.\n       ``I contacted everybody and nobody listened,'' said Carole \n     Allen, who rehabilitates turtles injured in fishing nets. \n     ``Everybody wants to save dolphins. Turtles aren't popular. \n     It really gets frustrating.''\n       Yet look closely at environmentalism today and you also see \n     promise and prosperity coming together to form a new style of \n     environmentalism--one that is sprouting quietly, community by \n     community, across the United States and is rooted in results, \n     not rhetoric.\n       ``I'm so frustrated with the opportunism and impulsiveness \n     of how groups are going about things,'' said Steve McCormick, \n     president of The Nature Conservancy, which uses science to \n     target and solve environmental problems. ``What's the plan? \n     What are the milestones by which we can measure our \n     success?''\n       Today's challenges are more subtle and serious than those \n     of the past. Stopping a dam is child's play compared to \n     halting the spread of destructive, non-native species. \n     Protecting old-growth forests from logging is simple; saving \n     them from fire and disease is more difficult.\n       But as the Bush administration takes control in Washington, \n     many groups are again tuning up sound bites--not drawing up \n     solutions.\n       There is no clearinghouse for information about \n     environmental groups, no oversight body watching for abuse \n     and assessing job performance. What information exists is \n     scattered among many sources, including the Internal Revenue \n     Service, philanthropic watchdogs, the U.S. Department of \n     Justice and nonprofit trade associations.\n       Sift through their material and here is what you find:\n       Donations are at flood stage. In 1999, individuals, \n     companies and foundations gave an average of $9.6 million a \n     day to environmental groups, according to the National Center \n     for Charitable Statistics, which monitors nonprofit fund \n     raising.\n       The dollars do not enrich equally. The nation's 20 largest \n     groups--a tiny slice of the more than 8,000 environmental \n     organizations--took in 29 percent of contributions in 1999, \n     according to IRS Form 990 tax records. The top 10 earned \n     spots on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list of America's \n     wealthiest charities.\n       The richest is The Nature Conservancy, an Arlington, Va., \n     group that focuses on purchasing land to protect the \n     diversity of species. In 1999, The Nature Conservancy \n     received $403 million, as much as its six nearest rivals \n     combined: Trust for Public Land, Ducks Unlimited, World \n     Wildlife Fund, Conservation International, National Wildlife \n     Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Forty years ago, the environmental movement was a national \n     policy sideshow. Today, it is a strong, vocal lobby that \n     weighs in on everything from highway transportation to global \n     trade. Some groups, such as the National Audubon Society and \n     Environmental Defense, are generalists, dabbling in many \n     things. Others, such as Ducks Unlimited and Conservation \n     International, have found success in specialization.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       David Brower, the legendary former Sierra Club leader who \n     led successful battles to keep dams out of Dinosaur National \n     Monument and the Grand Canyon in the 1950s and '60s, said \n     success springs from deeds, not dollars.\n       ``We were getting members because we were doing things,'' \n     Brower said before he died last year. ``Out (strength) came \n     from outings and trips--getting people out. If came from \n     full-page ads and books.''\n       Today, there is a new approach--junk mail and scare \n     tactics.\n       ``Dear Friend, If you've visited a national park recently, \n     then some of the things you're about to read may not surprise \n     you!\n       ``America's National Park System--the first and finest in \n     the world--is in real trouble right now.\n       ``Yellowstone . . . Great Smoky Mountains . . . Grand \n     Canyon . . . Everglades. Wilderness, wildlife, air and water \n     in all these magnificent parks are being compromised by \n     adjacent mining activities, noise pollution, commercial \n     development and other dangerous threats . . .''\n       So begins a recent fund-raising letter from the National \n     Parks Conservation Association, a 400,000-plus-member \n     organization. The letter goes on to tell of the group's \n     accomplishments, warn of continued threats, ask for money--\n     ``$15 or more''--and offer something special for signing up. \n     ``Free as our welcome-aboard gift . . . The NPCA bean bag \n     bear!''\n       Let's say you did send in $15. What would become of it?\n       According to the group's 1998-99 federal tax form, much of \n     your money would have been routed not to parks but to more \n     fund raising and overhead. Just $7.62 (51 percent) would have \n     been spent on parks, less than the minimum 60 percent \n     recommended by the American Institute of Philanthropy, a \n     nonprofit charity watchdog group.\n       And the parks association is not alone.\n       Five other major groups--including household names such as \n     Greenpeace and the Sierra Club--spend so much on fund \n     raising, membership and overhead they don't meet standards \n     set by philathropic watchdog groups.\n       It's not just the cost of raising money that catches \n     attention these days. It is the nature of the fund-raising \n     pitches themselves.\n       ``What works with direct mail? The answer is crisis. \n     Threats and crisis,'' said Beard, the Audubon Society chief \n     operating officer.\n       ``So what you get in your mailbox is a never-ending stream \n     of crisis-related shrill material designed to evoke emotions \n     so you will sit down and write a check. I think it's a slow \n     walk down a dead-end road. You reach the point where people \n     get turned off.'' Then he hesitated, adding:\n       ``But I don't want to say direct mail is bad because, \n     frankly, it works.''\n       Even some of those who sign the appeals are uncomfortable \n     with them.\n       ``Candidly, I am tired of The Wilderness Society and other \n     organizations--and we are a culprit here--constantly \n     preaching gloom and doom,'' said William Meadows, the \n     society's president, whose signature appears on millions of \n     crisis-related solicitations. ``We do have positive things to \n     say.''\n       Many environmental groups, The Wilderness Society included, \n     also use a legal accounting loophole to call much of what \n     they spend on fund raising ``public education.''\n       In 1999, for instance, The Wilderness Society spend $1.46 \n     million on a major membership campaign consisting of 6.2 \n     million letters. But when it came time to disclose that bill \n     in its annual report, the society shifted 87 percent--$1.27 \n     million--to public education. The group also shrank a $94,411 \n     telemarketing bill by deciding that 71 percent was public \n     education.''\n       The Wilderness Society's spokesman, Ben Beach, said that \n     kind of accounting is appropriate because fund-raising \n     solicitations are educational.\n       ``No one is trying to do anything that isn't right by the \n     rule book here,'' he said. ``A lot of us don't particularly \n     like getting (telemarketing) calls. But that's not to say you \n     don't learn something.''\n       Still, the accounting practice is controversial. Nine of \n     the nation's 20 largest groups don't use it. ``Playing games \n     with numbers is not worth the effort or questions that would \n     come from it,'' said Stephen Howell, chief operating officer \n     at The Nature Conservancy.\n       ``It should be called what it is,'' said Noonan, the \n     Conservation Fund leader. ``As we become larger and more \n     successful, I worry about the ethics of our movement. We need \n     to think about self-regulation and standards. If not, the \n     ones who make mistakes are going to hurt it for all of us.''\n       Dollars can disappear in other ways, of course.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Comfortable office digs and sumptuous fund-raising banquets \n     are another drain on donor dollars. The Sierra Club spends \n     $59,473 a month for its office lease in San Francisco. In \n     Washington, Greenpeace pays around $45,000 a month.\n       In June 1998, The Nature Conservancy spent more than $1 \n     million on a single fund-raising bash in New York City's \n     Central Park. Carly Simon and Jimmy Buffett\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n     played. Masters of ceremonies included Dan Rather, Peter \n     Jennings, Mike Wallace and Leslie Stahl. Variety magazine \n     reported that the 1,100 guests were treated to a martini bar \n     and a rolling cigar station.\n       ``The goal was to raise (our) profile among high-dollar \n     donors,'' Conservancy spokesman Mike Horak said in a \n     statement. And it paid off: $1.8 million was raised.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Salaries gobble up money raised, too. In 1999, top salaries \n     at the 10 largest environmental groups averaged $235,918, \n     according to IRS tax forms. By contrast, the president of \n     Habitat for Humanity, International--which builds homes for \n     the poor--earned $62,843. At Mothers Against Drunk Driving, \n     the president made $69,570.\n       Among environmental groups, Ducks Unlimited paid its leader \n     the most: $346,882.\n       ``Those salaries are obscene,'' said Martin Litton, a \n     former Sierra Club board member, who worked tirelessly over a \n     half-century to help bring about the creation of Redwoods \n     National Park in 1968 and Sequoia National Monument last \n     year. Litton did it for free.\n       ``There should be sacrifice in serving the environment,'' \n     he said.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/04/senate-section/article/S4406-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
