Mr. President, today the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the DeWine amendment regarding issue advocacy ads. \nThere will be up to 15 minutes of debate prior to a vote at 9:45. \nFollowing the vote, Senator Harkin will be recognized to offer an \namendment regarding volunteer spending limits. By previous consent, \nthere will be up to 2 hours of debate on the amendment. Senators should \nbe aware that the vote on the Harkin amendment is expected to occur \nprior to noon today.\n  Further amendments will be offered throughout the day. There will be \nnumerous votes, with the goal of completing action on the bill by this \nevening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been in contact with the two managers \nof the bill, and I have indicated that Senator Dodd and I have worked \nto cut down the list. We have several amendments. I think there has \nbeen a civil debate in this 2-week period of time. There have been very \nfew quorum calls in effect. We are going to do what we can.\n  I alert everyone, to finish this bill today is going to be extremely \ndifficult. We had 21 amendments yesterday on this side. We are down now \nto about 14. We picked up two during the night. I am sure most of them \nwill work with time limits on the amendments. But that having been \nsaid, it is going to be very difficult to finish today. I think the \nleadership should consider we will have to have something else either \ngoing into tomorrow or Saturday or finishing next week.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I must say while the amendments seem to be multiplying \non the other side, they are vanishing on this side. There are a couple \nof amendments, but there is really only one, I think, that has any \nserious drama attached to it, and that is the nonseverability amendment \nwhich we hope to vote on later today, to be offered by Senator Frist, \nin coordination with a member of the Democratic Party from the other \nside of the aisle.\n\n  I say to my friend, the Democratic whip, we don't have many \namendments left to go over here, so we may at some point just be \ndealing with Democratic amendments.\n  Mr. REID. We will do our best to cooperate with the manager of the \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Over the last 2 weeks, literally every day I have been \nstanding on the floor with the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Nevada saying we are going out early, we have a lot of amendments \nto go, and we need to get this done, and everybody wants to get it done \nby the end of this week, particularly by this evening. Apparently that \nis going to be very difficult to do.\n  My suggestion to the Senator from Kentucky and the leadership on both\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nsides is stay in tonight until we get it done or--that is my first \nchoice. My second choice would be tomorrow and then on Saturday. I \nthink we are all aware that the leadership wants to move to the budget \ndebate. I think that is appropriate. We all agreed at the beginning \nthat 2 weeks was sufficient time to address this issue.\n  One thing I suggest to the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nNevada is tabling motions, but clearly first-degree amendments have at \nleast an hour and a half, even if all time is yielded back on the other \nside.\n  I hope most Members appreciate that there are a couple or three \nissues, the main one being severability, but the rest of them either \nhave been addressed in some fashion or are not of compelling impact, \neven though the authors of the amendments may believe that is the case.\n  I urge my colleagues to be prepared to stay in very late tonight \nbecause we need to finish this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, he \nwill notice I have not filed a cloture motion. I have said that there \nis only one major amendment left, the nonseverability amendment, which \nwill be offered on a bipartisan basis, and that there are few to no \namendments left on this side.\n  From my point of view, as someone who is certainly unenthusiastic \nabout this bill and will vigorously oppose it, nevertheless I realize \nit is time to get to final passage sometime today. I say to the Senator \nfrom Arizona we will not have a problem getting to final passage \nbecause of this side. We cleared things out on our side and are ready \nto go to final passage. I am happy to finish it up sometime today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't want to belabor this. I briefly say \nto the Senator from Arizona, the votes for this reform have been \nsupplied by this side of the aisle. We appreciate its bipartisan \nnature. We are doing our very best, and we have people who believe in \ncampaign finance reform who have amendments. They believe they \nstrengthen the bill, and we will work with them to try to cut down \ntheir time. Some of them have waited, they haven't been off the Hill \ndoing something else, they have been waiting to offer these amendments. \nWe will do everything we can to protect them so they can offer these \namendments for what they believe will strengthen this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Hopefully, we can collate the number of the amendments, \nperhaps work out some time agreements on each one, so we can have an \nidea as to when we can finish.\n  Mr. REID. We will do our very best.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one final item: I want to notify the \nSenate that about 4 o'clock I am planning to address the Senate on the \nimplications of this bill on our two parties. I know we frequently \ndon't show up to listen to each other's speeches, but I recommend that \nSenators who are interested in the impact of this bill on the future of \nthe two-party system and on their own reelections might want to pay \nattention to what I have to say. My current plan is to deliver that \nspeech around 4 o'clock, and I want to notify people on both sides of \nthe aisle and the staffers who may be listening to the proceedings on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I think this is one speech that maybe Senators on both sides of the \naisle ought to listen to. So maybe just to give notice, I ask unanimous \nconsent I be allowed to address the Senate for up to 30 minutes, \nbeginning at 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection as long as there is 30 minutes reserved \nto respond to the Senator from Kentucky by someone from this side of \nthe aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, I don't think there \nwill be anything to respond to. I am sure it will be a factual \npresentation of the impact.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure that will be the case, but we ask for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3070-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3070-S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 2001\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the DeWine amendment, No. 152, \non which there shall be 15 minutes for closing remarks.\n  First, the clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill, S. 27, to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     of 1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter amendment No. 140, to provide findings regarding \n     the current state of campaign finance laws and to clarify the \n     definition of electioneering communication.\n       DeWine amendment No. 152, to strike certain provisions \n     relating to noncandidate campaign expenditures, including \n     rules relating to certain targeted electioneering \n     communications.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 152\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield, on behalf of the opponents of this \nmeasure, 7\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will have an \nopportunity to vote on an amendment I have offered along with Senator \nHatch, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, Senator Brownback, and Senator \nRoberts. This amendment is a very simple amendment. It strikes title II \nfrom this bill.\n\n  This will be the last opportunity that Members of this Senate will \nhave to strike what is blatantly and obviously a unconstitutional \nprovision of this bill. We all take an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution. I think it is one thing to say we are not sure how a \ncourt is going to rule. That is certainly true. We are never totally \nsure. It is one thing to say a provision of a bill may be held \nunconstitutional. But I do not know how anyone can look at the amended \nbill, which is no longer Snowe-Jeffords--it is now Snowe-Jeffords-\nWellstone; it is fundamentally different--I don't know how anyone can \nlook at this bill and not know it is blatantly unconstitutional. I \nthink everyone knows when it leaves here it will be held \nunconstitutional and that is why we will have, later today, a debate \nabout this whole issue of severability. We would not have to have that \ndebate if people did not believe this provision is unconstitutional.\n  What does it do? What does Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone do? What will the \nbill say unless we amend it by striking this provision? It will draw an \narbitrary, capricious, and I submit an unconstitutional line in the \nsand 60 days before an election, and it will say that within 60 days of \nan election free speech goes out the window. No longer can a \ncorporation, no longer can a labor union, and most important and \nclearly the most unconstitutional part, no longer will citizen groups \nthat come together to run ads on TV or radio be able to do that if they \nmention the candidate's name. That is an unbelievable restriction on \nfree speech at a time when it is the most important, when it has the \nmost impact--60 days before the election--and in the most effective \nway, on TV and radio.\n  This Congress will be saying in this bill, if we pass it and if we \nkeep this provision in, that we are going to censure that speech, we \nare going to become the free political speech police corps and we are \ngoing to swoop in and say you cannot do that.\n  Groups that want to run an ad criticizing Mike DeWine or criticizing \nany other candidate will then go into a local TV station to run an ad \ntalking about an issue and mentioning the name or putting up our \npicture on the screen and will no longer be able to do that. The \nstation manager will have to say: I am sorry, you can't run that ad.\n  People will say: Why not?\n  The Congress passed a ban on your ability to do that.\n  That is clearly unconstitutional.\n  What is the criterion? What have the courts held necessary, before \nCongress can abridge freedom of speech? There\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nare certain areas where clearly we can do it and the courts have held \nwe can do it. What is the test?\n  There must be a compelling State interest to do it. If it is done, it \nmust be done in the least restrictive way. Least restrictive? What \ncould be more restrictive than to say you can't go on TV, you can't \ncommunicate to people? If this remains in the bill, we will end up with \na situation in this country where the only people who can speak in the \nlast 60 days, to the electorate, will be the Tom Brokaws of the world, \nthe TV commentators, the radio commentators, and the candidates. This \nis not a closed system. It is not an exclusive club. It is something in \nwhich everyone should be able to participate. That is the essence of \nfree speech.\n  The courts have held all kinds of things to be part of free speech. \nBut the most pure form of free speech, the thing that absolutely must \nbe protected, the thing that obviously the Framers of the Constitution \nhad in mind when they wrote the first amendment, is political speech in \nthe context of a campaign when we talk about issues and when we talk \nabout candidates.\n\n  I do not like a lot of these ads. My colleagues who come to the \nfloor--and by the way, every colleague who came to the floor to oppose \nthe DeWine amendment, everyone except Mr. Wellstone--voted against the \nWellstone amendment. Every single one of them did. I don't know why \nthey did. I know why Mr. Edwards did. He said it was unconstitutional, \nand I think everybody in this Chamber knows it is unconstitutional. But \nthat is what the restriction will be. It is blatantly unconstitutional. \nIt does not pass the Supreme Court's test of a compelling State \ninterest.\n  What is the compelling State interest to smash free speech within 60 \ndays before an election? I will stop at this point and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine controls the \ntime in opposition.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the DeWine amendment. I \nbelieve the Senator from Ohio raises serious and legitimate issues \nabout the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. The fact is, to put it in plain \nterms for the people around the country, they are being subjected to \nads that about everybody knows are really campaign ads. They are what \nmany people call phony issue ads. They know very well they are not just \nissue ads.\n  What Senators Snowe and Jeffords have done is to try to come up with \na formula to get at the heart of the problem, to have the Supreme Court \nhave an opportunity for the first time in many years to look at \nlegislative language from the Congress, to ask the question: Are these \nads that are supposed to be protected under the first amendment or are \nthey really electioneering ads that everyone would concede have to be \nsubject to some kind of regulation in order for there to be fair \nelections in this country?\n  That is the question. The only way we can find the answer to the \nquestion is to pass a bill. We cannot call up Chief Justice Rehnquist \nand say: Say, if we did this, would it be constitutional? We are \nprohibited from asking for those kinds of advisory opinions.\n  I believe this is constitutional. I believe it is very carefully \ncrafted with a very strong respect for the difficult first amendment \nquestions that are involved. But I do think it would be held \nconstitutional.\n  I expect some of the Justices might find it is not constitutional. \nBut that is not how the Supreme Court works. It does not have to be \nunanimous. The question is, What do a majority of the Justices believe? \nI believe a majority of the Justices who see these ads on television \nwould conclude, as I do, that they are not issue ads but that they are \nreally campaign ads and are appropriately regulated in this manner.\n  For that reason, I believe this is an extremely valuable addition to \nthe bill. It is the second big loophole in the system. No. 1 is the \nsoft money loophole. No. 2 is the phony issue ads. And that is exactly \nwhat the distinguished Senator from Maine and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont are opposed to. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I now yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am disturbed at the DeWine attempt to \nsolve a problem that is not there. I was one of those back in my last \nelection--not the last but the one before that--who was exposed to this \nkind of advertising, who has had to face seeing ads on television which \ntotally distort the facts and say terrible things. You watch a 20-\npercent lead keep going down and you do not know who is putting them \non. You know what they are saying is totally inaccurate, but you have \nno way to refute it, other than to try to get people convinced that \nnobody knows who put it there, who is behind it.\n  The constitutionality of our provisions is common sense. How can you \nsay that something which merely asks the person who put out the ad to \nlet everybody know who they are is unconstitutional? How in the world \ncan you say that it is unconstitutional to require somebody to disclose \nwho they are and what they are?\n\n  That is all we are doing in Snowe-Jeffords.\n  The Wellstone amendment does make things a little more confusing in \nthat regard.\n  Let's remember what we are doing if we vote on this bill without \nleaving in the very critical provisions of Snowe-Jeffords, which say \nthat anyone who does ads and does so in a way to attack a candidate, \nthey have to let people know who they are. What is wrong with that? I \nthink everybody believes that is a positive addition.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords provisions also make sure that when the time comes \ndown to the very end, that unions and corporations are not precluded \nfrom ads by any means. But they are required to disclose from where the \nmoney came and use individually donated hard money.\n  It can't be unconstitutional in the sense of the corporations or \nunions using individually donated funds instead of their own funds to \nrun these ads. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me briefly respond to my colleague \nfrom Vermont.\n  Look, no one likes these ads. No one likes to be attacked. My friend \nsaid he is disturbed by these ads; they say terrible things, and they \nare inaccurate. I understand that. All of us have had that experience. \nAll of us have been in tough campaigns. All of us have been attacked by \nwhat we consider to be unjustifiable. All of us have faced attacks \nwhere people have said things that we just shudder about and just can't \nbelieve that it is running on television. Our families do not like it. \nOur mothers do not like it. Our kids do not like it. But do you know \nsomething. That is part of the system. That is part of democracy. This \nis not some other country where we restrict campaigns and what can be \nsaid at the time campaigns take place.\n  It might be easier. It might be cleaner. It might be easier to look \nat. No one ever said democracy was easy and wasn't sometimes messy. But \nthat is the first amendment. That is not a justification to put a clamp \non freedom of speech.\n  My friends talk about disclosure. That is not the biggest problem \nwith this bill. It is not a disclosure problem so much as it is a \nrestriction on free speech within 60 days of an election.\n  Let me repeat what it does.\n  Within 60 days of an election, you can't run an ad that mentions a \ncandidate's name or that has the candidate's image unless you are the \ncandidate for that particular office.\n  That is what it says. It is wrong to make it unconstitutional.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak in support of \nthe provision originally crafted by the distinguished Senators from \nMaine and Vermont, Senators Snowe and Jeffords, and in opposition to \nthe DeWine amendment. When the debate on campaign finance reform \nreached a stalemate in the fall of 1997, Senator Snowe\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\nand Senator Jeffords first came together to draft this language, and it \nhas been a vital contribution to reform effort. I thank them both for \ntheir continued dedication to closing the issue ad loophole which, next \nto soft money, is surely the most serious violation of the spirit of \nour campaign finance laws.\n  Snowe-Jeffords gets at the heart of the issue ad loophole. Right now \nwealthy interests are abusing this loophole at a record pace. They are \nflouting the spirit of the law, there is no question about it. They \nadvocate for the election or defeat of a candidate, even though they \ndon't say those ``magic words,'' such as ``vote for,'' ``vote \nagainst,'' ``elect'' or ``defeat.'' These ads might side-step the law, \nMr. President, but they certainly don't fool the public. One recent \nstudy decided to see how the public viewed sham issue ads. They wanted \nto see if people thought they were really about the issues, or whether \nthey were about candidates. The results were definitive.\n  Take a look at this chart, which cites the results of a study \nconducted by David Magleby at Brigham Young University. Nearly 90 \npercent of respondents in the study thought that phony issue ads paid \nfor by outside groups were urging them to vote for or against a \ncandidate.\n  People didn't need to hear the so-called magic words to know what \nthese ads were really all about. That was just as true for issue ads \npaid for by the parties as it was for ads paid for by outside groups.\n  Party soft money ads were just as clearly crafted to influence the \nvoters. When respondents reviewed party soft money ads, 83 percent \nranked those ads as ``clearly intended to influence their vote.'' And \nthis is perhaps even more interesting, more respondents thought the \nparties' ads were intended to influence their vote than the ads paid \nfor by the candidates' campaigns. The party ads, the sham issue ads \npaid for with soft money, were more obviously advocating for or against \na candidate than the ads the candidates made themselves. That is a \ngreat example of how soft money and the issue ad loophole have come \ntogether to warp the current campaign finance system.\n  As you can see in this next chart entitled ``Political Party Soft \nMoney Ads Overtake. . .'', party spending on soft money ads has now \novertaken candidate spending on ads in the presidential race. You can \nsee on this chart how this shift has taken place between the 1996 and \n2000 elections. The parties are now spending phenomenal amounts of soft \nmoney on sham issue ads.\n  Again, on this chart, you can see how party spending on ads has \novertaken candidate spending in the race for the Presidency, and dwarfs \nspending by outside groups. And here is the kicker: None of these party \nads mention party label, but all of them mention the candidate. They \nmention the candidate because they are advocating for the election or \ndefeat of that candidate. And yet the law says that doesn't count.\n\n  This doesn't make sense. The magic words test is completely helpless \nto stem the tide of sham issue ads, ads from the parties, ads from \nunions or corporations, or ads from outside groups that are acting on \nbehalf of those unions or corporations. We need to close the loophole, \nand Snowe-Jeffords does just that.\n  Here is how Snowe-Jeffords navigates the difficult political and \nconstitutional terrain of this debate. Here I am talking about the \noriginal Snowe-Jeffords provision, before adoption of the Wellstone \namendment. The first thing that the provision does is define a new \ncategory of communications in the law--we call them electioneering \ncommunications. These electioneering communications are communications \nthat meet three tests: First, they are made through the broadcast \nmedia--radio and TV, including satellite and cable. Second, they refer \nto a clearly identified Federal candidate--in other words, they show \nthe face, or speak the name of the candidate. And third, they appear \nwithin 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary in which \nthat candidate is running.\n  The original Snowe-Jeffords provides that for-profit corporations and \nlabor unions cannot make electioneering communications using their \ntreasury funds. If they want to run TV ads mentioning candidates close \nto the election, they must use voluntary contributions to their \npolitical action committees. We believe that this approach will \nwithstand constitutional scrutiny, because corporations and unions have \nlong been barred from spending money directly on Federal elections.\n  The Supreme Court upheld the ban on corporate spending in the Austin \nv. Michigan Chamber of Commerce case. It noted that a Michigan \nregulation that prohibited corporations from making independent \nexpenditures from treasury funds prevented ``corruption in the \npolitical arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense \naggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the \ncorporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's \nsupport for the corporation's political ideas.'' According to the \nCourt, the Michigan regulation ``ensured that the expenditures reflect \nactual public support for the political ideas espoused by the \ncorporations.''\n  We are merely saying through this provision that that actual public \nsupport, shown by voluntary contributions to a PAC, must be present \nwhen corporations and unions want to run ads mentioning candidates near \nin time to an election.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords provision goes on to permit spending on these \nkinds of ads by non-profit corporations that are registered as \n501(c)(4) advocacy groups, by 527 organizations, and by other \nunincorporated groups and individuals. But it requires disclosure of \nthe spending and of the large donors whose funds are used to place the \nads once the total spending of the group on these ``electioneering \ncommunications'' reaches $10,000.\n\n  A few things should be noted about the disclosure requirement that \nentities other than unions and for-profit corporations are subject to \nif they engage in these kinds of electioneering communications. The \ndisclosure is not burdensome; it simply requires a group placing an ad \nto report the spending to the FEC within 24 hours, and to provide the \nname of the group, of any other group that exercises control over its \nactivities, and of the custodian of records of the group, and of the \namount of each disbursement and the person to whom money was paid.\n  Second, disclosure is triggered by spending a total of $10,000 or \nmore on these kinds of ads. So a small group that spends only a few \nthousand dollars on radio spots will never have to report a thing.\n  Third, the disclosure of contributors required is quite limited. Only \nlarge donors--those who contribute more than $1,000--must be \nidentified, and they must be identified only by name and address. And a \ngroup that receives donations for a wide variety of purposes, including \nsome corporate or labor treasury money, can set up a separate bank \naccount to which only individuals can contribute, pay for the ads out \nof that account, and disclose only the large donors whose money is put \nin that account.\n  The net result will be that the public will learn through this \namendment who the people are who are giving large contributions to \ngroups to try to influence elections. And if a group is just a shell \nfor a few wealthy donors, then we will know who those big money \nsupporters are and be much better able to assess their agenda.\n  On the other hand, if an established group with a large membership of \nsmall contributors wishes to engage in this kind of advocacy, it need \nnot disclose any of its contributors because it can pay for the ads \nfrom small donor money that has been raised for the special bank \naccount for individual donors.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these disclosure provisions will pass \nconstitutional muster. The Buckley case, it should be remembered, \nrejected limits on independent expenditures but upheld the requirement \nthat the expenditures be disclosed. Rules that merely require \ndisclosure are less vulnerable to constitutional attack than outright \nprohibitions of certain speech. The information provided by these \ndisclosure statements will help the public find out who is behind \nparticular candidates. This disclosure can help prevent the appearance \nof corruption that can come from a group secretly spending large \namounts of money in support of a candidate.\n  Some have argued--the Senator from Kentucky among them--that even\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nthese reasonable disclosure requirements violate the Constitution. They \ncite the case of NAACP v. Alabama from 1958. That is a very important \ncase, and one with which I fully agree, but the conclusion that the \nSenator from Kentucky draws from it, with respect to the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision, is simply wrong.\n  In the NAACP case, at the height of the civil rights struggle, the \nstate of Alabama obtained a judicial order to the NAACP to produce its \nmembership lists and fined it $100,000 for failing to comply. The NAACP \nchallenged that order and argued that the first amendment rights of it \nmembers to freely associate to advance their common beliefs would be \nviolated by the forced disclosure of its membership lists. It pointed \nout many instances where revealing the identities of its members \nexposed them to economic reprisals, loss of employment, and even \nthreats of physical coercion. The Court held that the state had not \ndemonstrated a sufficient interest in obtaining the lists that would \njustify the deterrent effect on the members of the NAACP exercising \nthere rights of association.\n  Snowe-Jeffords is totally different from what the State of Alabama \ntried to do in the NAACP case. Snowe-Jeffords doesn't ask for \nmembership lists, it asks for the very limited disclosure of large \ncontributors to a specific bank account used to pay for electioneering \ncommunications. Most membership groups won't have to disclose anything \nif they receive sufficient small donations to cover their expenditures \non these type of communications. Contributors to the groups that don't \nwant to be identified can simply ask that their money not be used for \nthe kind of ads that would subject them to disclosure. And finally, the \ndisclosure requirement can be avoided altogether by crafting an ad that \ndoes not specifically refer to a candidate during the short window of \ntime right before an election.\n  The Supreme Court has shown much more willingness to uphold \ndisclosure requirements in connection with election spending than \nopponents of Snowe-Jeffords have been willing to recognize. In the \nCitizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, a 1981 case, for \nexample, the Court struck down a limit on contributions to committees \nformed to support or oppose ballot measures. But the Court noted \nspecifically, and I quote, ``the integrity of the political system will \nbe adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public \nfiling revealing the amounts contributed; if it is thought wise, \nlegislation can outlaw anonymous contributions.'' It is worth noting \nthat the opinion in that case was by Chief Justice Warren Burger and \nthe vote was 8-1. The dissenter, Justice White, thought the limit on \ncontributions should be upheld.\n  In U.S. v. Harris, the Court upheld disclosure requirements for \nlobbyists, despite the alleged chilling effect that those requirements \nmight have on the right to petition the government. And, of course, the \nBuckley Court upheld disclosure requirements for groups making \nindependent expenditures.\n\n  Now it is of course true that the Court will have to analyze the \ndisclosure requirements in Snowe-Jeffords, and the type of \ncommunications that trigger it and determine if they pass \nconstitutional muster. I will not proclaim that there is no argument to \nbe made that the provision is unconstitutional. But to say that there \nis no chance that this provision will be upheld is just not right. \nThere is ample constitutional justification and precedent for this \nprovision.\n  That conclusion is supported by a letter we have received from 70 law \nprofessors who support the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold \nbill, including the Snowe-Jeffords provision. This is what they write \nwith respect to Snowe-Jeffords:\n\n       [T]he incorporation of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment into \n     the McCain-Feingold Bill is a well-reasoned attempt to define \n     electioneering in a more realistic manner while remaining \n     faithful to First Amendment vagueness and overbreadth \n     concerns. . . . While no one can predict with certainty how \n     the courts will finally rule if any of the these provisions \n     are challenged in court, we believe that the McCain-Feingold \n     Bill, as current drafted, is consistent with First Amendment \n     jurisprudence.\n\n  As the Brennan Center for Justice wrote in an analysis of Snowe-\nJeffords:\n\n       Disclosure rules do not restrict speech significantly. \n     Disclosure rules do not limit the information that is \n     conveyed to the electorate. To the contrary, they increase \n     the flow of information. For that reason, the Supreme Court \n     has made clear that rules requiring disclosure are subject to \n     less exacting constitutional strictures than direct \n     prohibitions on spending. . . . There is no constitutional \n     bar to expanding the disclosure rules to provide accurate \n     information to voters about the sponsors of ads indisputedly \n     designed to influence their votes.\n\n  The opponents of our bill speak with great disdain of the Snowe-\nJeffords provision and act as if it is certainly and indisputably \nunconstitutional. Now I will not pretend that there are not difficult \nconstitutional issues raised, but I simply do not think it is accurate \nto say, as our opponents do, that there is no hope for this provision \nbefore the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court is going to decide this \nissue, that we know for sure. All the lower court decisions in the \nworld on state statutes that don't have a bright line approach as \nSnowe-Jeffords does, don't mean much of anything. The Supreme Court has \nnot yet addressed this issue; if we enact this bill, it undoubtedly \nwill.\n  It is important to note that Snowe-Jeffords contains provisions \ndesigned to prevent the laundering of corporate and union money through \nnon-profits. Groups that wish to engage in this particular kind of \nadvocacy must ensure that only the contributions of individual \ndonors are used for the expenditures.\n\n  Anyone who opposes this provision must defend the rights of unions \nand corporations using their treasury money, not just citizen groups \nlike the National Right to Life Committee or the Christian Coalition, \nor the Sierra Club, to run what are essentially campaign advertisements \nthat dodge the federal election laws by not using the magic words \n``Vote For'' or ``Vote Against,'' or to finance those ads through other \ngroups.\n  Second, they must argue that the public is not entitled to know, in \nthe case of advocacy groups that run these ads so close to the \nelection, the identities of large donors to group's election-related \neffort. Many opponents of McCain-Feingold have trumpeted the virtues of \nfull disclosure. I have at times doubted how serious they were about \ndisclosure because they would never acknowledge the important advances \nin disclosure already included in our bill.\n  I have discussed here the original Snowe-Jeffords provision. The \nWell- \nstone amendment, in effect, broadens that provision to cover ads run by \ncorporations and unions. I voted against adding that amendment. I \nthought and still think that it makes Snowe-Jeffords more susceptible \nto a constitutional challenge, but it passed when many Senators who \noppose the bill and the Snowe-Jeffords provision voted for it. In any \nevent, the Wellstone amendment was written to be severable from the \nremainder of the Snowe-Jeffords provision. That gives even more \nsignificance to the vote we will have today on severability. But if we \nwin that vote, Snowe-Jeffords will survive even if the Wellstone \namendment is held to be unconstitutional.\n  Let me again commend Senators Snowe and Jeffords for crafting a \nprovision that treats labor unions and corporations equally. Rather \nthan try to give one side or the other an advantage, this provision \ntries to bring back some sanity to our system by recognizing that both \nsides have played fast and loose with the spirit of the election laws \nby running ads that claim to be about issues, but are really candidate \nspecific campaign ads.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 47 seconds for \nthe Senator from Ohio, and 3 minutes for the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to strike that has \nbeen offered by my good friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine. Make no \nmistake about it. A vote to strike the Snowe-Jeffords provision \nspecifically would be a vote against disclosure.\n  It is interesting to hear my colleague describe the amendments and \nthe provisions that are contained with the McCain-Feingold legislation; \nthat it is a restriction on the first amendment\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nright, the right to free speech. That is not only a \nmischaracterization, but it is false.\n  The Supreme Court never said you can't make distinctions in political \ncampaigns in terms of what is express advocacy and issue advocacy. That \nis what we have attempted to do with the support of more than 70 \nconstitutional experts--to design legislation that is carefully crafted \nthat says if these organizations want to run ads, do it as the rest of \nus. Use the hard money that we have to raise in order to finance those \nads 60 days before an election that mention a Federal candidate.\n  We are seeing the stealth advocacy ad phenomenon multiplying in \nAmerica today--three times the amount of money that is spent on so-\ncalled sham ads in the election of 2000, and three times the amount in \n1996. Why? Because of what they have done to skirt the disclosure laws \nbecause they do not use the magic words ``vote for or against.'' They \nmention a candidate.\n  Is it no coincidence that they are mentioning the candidate's name 60 \ndays before an election? What for? It is to impact the outcome of that \nelection.\n  What we are saying is disclose who you are. Let's unveil this \nmasquerade. Let's unveil this cloak of anonymity. Tell us who you are. \nTell us who is financing these ads to the tune of $500 million in this \nlast election. The public has the right to know. We have the right to \nknow.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is not an infringement \non free speech. It is political speech. Even my colleague from Ohio \nsaid it is political speech, political speech you have to disclose.\n  That is what we are talking about in this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a study \nentitled ``The Facts about Television Advertising and the McCain-\nFeingold Bill.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Facts About Television Advertising and the McCain-Feingold Bill\n\n               (By Jonathan Krasno and Kenneth Goldstein)\n\n       The McCain-Feingold bill and its House counterpart \n     sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan are universally \n     regarded as the most significant campaign finance legislation \n     under serious consideration by Congress in a generation, \n     perhaps since the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act (FECA). This legislation would not expand on the \n     1974 reforms but instead restore them by regulating the two \n     mechanisms that have developed in the intervening decades to \n     circumvent FECA, so-called ``soft money'' and ``issue \n     advocacy.'' Together and separately soft money and issue \n     advocacy have become an enormous part of many federal \n     campaigns, in some cases even eclipsing the efforts of \n     candidates operating under FECA's rules.\n       That popularity, naturally, has created a powerful group of \n     donors and recipients who have exploited these loopholes and \n     now oppose any attempt to close them, even as some \n     contributors have begun to complain of the relentless \n     pressure to give money. These political forces, coupled with \n     the putative relationship between soft money, issue advocacy \n     and several core constitutional values, have made McCain-\n     Feingold among the most controversial bills facing Congress.\n       This paper uses a unique source of data about television \n     commercials to examine some of the most important issues \n     raised in connection to this proposal. It is appropriate that \n     we focus on television advertising since it is the largest--\n     and most discussed--single category of expenditures by \n     candidates, parties and interest groups in federal elections. \n     McCain-Feingold's chief impact would surely be seen on the \n     nation's airwaves, on the hundreds of thousands of issue ads \n     paid for with soft money. Indeed, many of the arguments for \n     and against McCain-Feingold are rooted in different \n     interpretations of those very ads.\n       For its critics, the huge outlay on issue ads is a \n     dangerous scam perpetrated on democracy, a scam predicated on \n     twin falsehoods that issue ads promote issues and soft money \n     builds parties. For its defenders, the spending on issue \n     advertising is a sign of democracy's vitality and any attempt \n     to limit issue ads or soft money is inherently ham-handed and \n     dangerous. Fortunately, many of these claims are empirical \n     questions; given the proper data they can be carefully \n     dissected and weighed. That is precisely what we do here by \n     using the most extensive data set on television advertising \n     ever developed to explore some of the core assumptions \n     invoked by proponents and opponents of McCain-Feingold.\n\n\n                        MONITORING THE AIRWAVES\n\n       The sheer amount of television advertising--on \n     approximately 1300 stations in the nation's 210 media markets \n     over the 15 or 16 most popular hours in the broadcast day--\n     makes commercials extremely difficult to study. Fortunately, \n     using satellite tracking first developed by the U.S. Navy to \n     detect Soviet submarines, a commercial ad tracking firm, the \n     Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG), is able to gather \n     information about the content, targeting and timing of each \n     ad aired. CMAG tracks commercials by candidates, parties and \n     interest groups in the nation's top 75 media markets. \n     Together these markets reach approximately 80 percent of \n     households in the U.S. CMAG's technology recognizes the seams \n     in programming where commercials appear, creates a unique \n     digital fingerprint of each ad aired, then downloads a \n     version of each ad detected along with the exact time and \n     station on which it appeared. The company later adds \n     estimates of the average cost of an ad shown in the time \n     period.\n       With funding from the Pew Charitable Trust, CMAG's data for \n     1998 and 2000 were purchased. These data are literally a \n     minute-by-minute view of political advertising across the \n     country--along with ``storyboard'' (a frame of video every 4-\n     5 seconds plus full text of audio) for each ad detected \n     during these two election cycles. The storyboards were then \n     examined by teams of graduate and undergraduate students at \n     the University of Wisconsin (2000) and Arizona State \n     University (1998) who coded the content of each commercial.\n       Some of the questions--such as whether an ad mentioned a \n     candidate for office by name or urged viewers to ``vote for'' \n     or ``defeat'' a particular candidate--were objective. Others \n     were subjective. These included items asking coders to assess \n     the purpose (to support a particular candidate or express a \n     view on an issue) and tone (promote, attack, or contrast) of \n     an ad. Both types of questions elicited nearly identical \n     responses from different students who assessed the same ad, \n     indicating a reassuring degree of intercoder reliability. In \n     addition, we also took special care to examine the disclaimer \n     in each commercial, the written portion appearing usually at \n     the end of each commercial noting its sponsor (``Paid for by \n     . . .''), where possible. From this we were able to determine \n     whether an ad is sponsored by a candidate, party or interest \n     group, and, if paid for by a party or group, whether it is an \n     issue ad or not.\n       Coders ended up examining approximately 2,000 different \n     federal ads (eliminating ads referring to state and local \n     candidates or ballot propositions) in 1998 and nearly 3,000 \n     in 2000. As Table One shows, these ads fell into different \n     campaign-finance categories and appeared on the air hundreds \n     of thousands of times. Most of the astonishing growth from \n     1998 to 2000, of course, is attributable to the presidential \n     election, but the number of ads in congressional elections \n     also rose in this two-year period from 302,377 to 420,656 and \n     expenditures nearly doubled. Most of this upsurge came from \n     parties and interest groups.\n\n          TABLE ONE.--TELEVISION ADVERTISING IN TOP 75 MARKETS\n             [Estimated cost/number of spots in parentheses]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1998             2000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCandidates:\n  Total...............................     $140,617,427     $334,571,178\n                                              (235,791)        (429,747)\nParties:\n  Issue ads...........................       20,526,340      163,586,235\n                                               (37,386)        (231,981)\n  Hard $ ads..........................        5,296,318       29,166,653\n                                                (7,488)         (37,938)\nInterest Groups:\n  Issue ads...........................       10,371,191       95,893,837\n                                               (20,431)        (139,577)\n  Hard $ ads*.........................          421,222  ...............\n                                                (1,281)  ...............\n      Total...........................     $177,232,508     $623,217,897\n                                              (302,377)        (839,243)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*The vast majority of commercials sponsored by interest groups were\n  issue ads. We are continuing to examine the data to determine how much\n  groups spent on hard money ads (independent expenditures) in 2000.\n\n                           whose ox is gored:\n\n       The first question the professional politicians in Congress \n     are asking about McCain-Feingold is who will it affect. Such \n     questions are always perilous since advertisers will \n     undoubtedly try to adapt to any new regulations, searching \n     for new loopholes to exploit. Which direction their search \n     will eventually take them is at best an educated guess. What \n     is more than guesswork, however, is the matter of how much \n     has been spent on issue ads by the parties and their allies \n     over the last two cycles.\n       Figure One (not reproducible in the Record) breaks down the \n     issue ads in Table One by party, showing the total number run \n     by various Democratic and Republican party committees and \n     their allies. While Republicans had a noticeable advantage in \n     issue ads in 1998, Democrats claimed a small lead in 2000. \n     This modest reversal illustrates the unpredictability of soft \n     money. Since contributions (to either parties or interest \n     groups) for issue ads are unlimited, the generosity of a \n     relatively small number of well-heeled donors may shift the \n     tide. But equally striking is the near equality between the \n     parties. Total soft money spending for the Democrats and \n     Republicans is separated by no more than $5,000,000 in either \n     year, a relatively small amount among the hundreds of \n     millions spent on political advertising in both years. That \n     is not to say, of course, that no candidates would have been \n     particularly helped or hurt had McCain-Feingold been in \n     effect earlier, only that the Democrats' and Republicans' \n     gains and losses come fairly close to balancing out across \n     the country.\n\n\n                       regulating issue advocacy\n\n       The working definition of issue advocacy comes from a \n     footnote in the Supreme\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\n     Court's seminal decision in Buckley v. Valeo (1976) that \n     limited FECA's impact by defining campaign communications as \n     those ``expressly advocating'' the election or defeat of a \n     particular candidate by using words like ``elect,'' \n     ``defeat,'' or ``support.'' The purpose behind the footnote \n     was to protect speech about ``issues''--lobbying on bills \n     before Congress, pronouncements or debate over public \n     policy--from the financial regulations affecting partisan \n     electioneering. The need to distinguish the two is obvious, \n     but whether use of specific words of express advocacy (now \n     widely known as ``magic words'') is an effective way to do so \n     is less clear.\n       We sought to evaluate this standard by looking at ads \n     purchased by candidates' campaigns. Candidates are a perfect \n     text case since the purpose of their advertising is so \n     obviously electioneering that the magic words test does not \n     apply to them. Thus, candidates must live with FECA whether \n     or not they use magic words. That might lead one to assume \n     that candidate ads unabashedly urge viewers to vote for one \n     person or defeat another, but it turns out that such direct \n     advocacy is exceedingly rare. In 2000 just under 10 percent \n     of the nearly 325,000 ads paid for by federal candidates \n     directly urged viewers to support or oppose a particular \n     candidate or used a slogan like ``Jones for Congress,'' the \n     full list of magic words in Buckley. Earlier we found just 4 \n     percent of 235,000 candidate ads in 1998 used any of the \n     verbs of express advocacy; 96 percent did not ask viewers to \n     vote for or against any candidate. Any device that fails to \n     detect what it was designed to find 9 times out of 10 is \n     clearly a flop. The magic words test simply does not work.\n       The failure of the magic words test does not mean, of \n     course, that all issue ads are necessarily electioneering. \n     But several things suggest that a great majority of them are. \n     To begin with, the issues raised in commercials by candidates \n     and in issue ads are virtually identical. Table Two lists the \n     top five themes appearing in both types of ads in 1998 and \n     2000. While occasional variations occur, the overwhelming \n     impression is that issue ads mimic the commercials that \n     candidates run. This may be mere coincidence, but it is a \n     suggestive one. At very least, it contradicts the argument \n     that issue ads by parties and interest groups introduce \n     policy matters into the political arena that are otherwise \n     ignored.

If issue ads were \n     intended only to pronounce on important policy matters we \n     would expect to see them spaced throughout the year or \n     concentrated in periods when Congress is most active. As \n     Figure Two (not reproducible in the Record) demonstrates, \n     however, that is far from the case. While in both 1998 and \n     2000 members of Congress cast a steady stream of votes and a \n     series of what Congressional Quarterly labels as ``key \n     votes'' throughout the year, the greatest deluge of issue ads \n     began appearing after Labor Day (about week 36). Indeed even \n     the most casual inspection of the number of issue ads that \n     appeared each week indicates that this line is much more \n     closely related to the activity of candidates, not the \n     activity of Congress. This relationship of issue advertisers \n     and candidates, repeated over two years, is far too strong to \n     be coincidental. There is no doubt that issue ads are largely \n     inspired by the same cause that motivates candidates, the \n     slow approach of Election Day.\n       Despite the overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of \n     issue ads are a form of electioneering, there were \n     commercials in each year that our coders took to be genuine \n     discussion of policy matters (22 percent of issue ads in \n     1998, 16 percent in 2000). Would the definition of \n     electioneering created by McCain-Feingold--any ad mentioning \n     a federal candidate by name in his or her district within 30 \n     days of the primary or 60 days of the general election--\n     inadvertently capture many of these commercials? We addressed \n     this question by comparing the issue ads that would have been \n     classified as electioneering under McCain-Feingold to the \n     coders' subjective assessment of the purpose of each ad. In \n     1998 just 7 percent of issue ads that we rated as \n     presentations of policy matters appeared after Labor Day and \n     mentioned a federal candidate; in that figure was lower \n     still, 1 percent. In 2000 that number was less than one \n     percent. Critics may argue that chance of inadvertently \n     classifying 7 percent, or even 1 percent, of genuine issue \n     ads as electioneering makes this bill overly broad. In \n     contrast, these percentages strike us as fairly modest, \n     evidence that McCain-Feingold is reasonably calibrated. In \n     addition, our examination suggests that these errors may be \n     reduced with some small additions to the bill.\n\n\n                            party soft money\n\n       Just as the rules on issue advocacy are intended to \n     safeguard free speech, soft money is also intended to achieve \n     a worthy goal, in this case to strengthen political parties. \n     Parties are a frequently underappreciated fact of political \n     life in democracies. Political scientists have sought ways to \n     buttress them for years, to augment their ability to \n     communicate with and mobilize the public, and to magnify \n     their impact as political symbols.\n       The most obvious place to start assessing the value of \n     parties' advertising is with a simple objective question: \n     does the ad mention either political party by name? It is \n     hard to imagine how a commercial might strengthen a party if \n     it neglects to praise its sponsors or at least malign the \n     opposition. Yet, party ads are remarkably shy about saying \n     anything about ``Democrats'' or ``Republicans''--just 15 \n     percent of party ads in 1998 and 7 percent in 2000 mentioned \n     either political party by name. By contrast, 95 percent of \n     these ads in 1998 and 99 percent in 2000 did name a \n     particular candidate. It seems fairly clear that these ads do \n     far more to promote the fortunes of individual candidates \n     than the fortunes of their sponsors.\n       A piece of supporting evidence for this conclusion comes \n     from the perceived negativity of each ad. Coders found ads by \n     parties to be much more likely to be pure attack ads (60 \n     percent in 1998, 42 percent in 2000) than ads by candidates. \n     While we remain agnostic about whether attack advertising is \n     somehow better or worse than other forms, we do note that \n     there is little hope that this flood of negative commercials \n     magically strengthens either party.\n       Finally, some defenders of party soft money also argue, in \n     conflict to the claims about building parties, that these \n     commercials help provide vital information to voters in \n     various places and about various candidates which they would \n     not otherwise receive. This is a complicated assertion to \n     unravel. It is obviously debatable whether any particular ad \n     conveys much information to viewers. If we assume--quite \n     charitably--that all political ads help educate voters then \n     the question becomes a matter of allocation. Do party ads \n     appear for candidates about whom little is known or in \n     otherwise neglected districts and media markets? If the \n     answer is yes, then it is fair to conclude that party ads may \n     play an important role in informing the public.\n       The truth, however, is that the best predictor of the \n     number of commercials aired by parties in a particular \n     contest and media market is the number of ads aired by \n     candidates in the same location. There are exceptions--the \n     RNC sponsored all of the pro-Bush advertising in California \n     and neither party ran commercials in New York after the two \n     Senate candidates agreed to forgo soft money--but parties \n     overwhelmingly concentrated their efforts in swing states and \n     districts, the very places already saturated by the \n     candidates. One indication of how focused party advertising \n     in congressional races is that in both years the majority of \n     party ads appeared in just three Senate races and a dozen \n     House contests, even though the CMAG system tracks \n     advertising in scores of states and districts. As a result, \n     the educational value of party ads is inevitably limited, as \n     is any effect they might have on the competitiveness of \n     elections.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Our examination of television commercials in 1998 and 2000 \n     shows that the current campaign finance system is \n     unmistakably flawed. The magic words test supposed to \n     distinguish issue advocacy from electioneering is a complete \n     failure. The rules allowing parties to collect unlimited \n     amounts of soft money to build stronger parties have instead \n     allowed parties to spend on activities unrelated to that \n     goal, and perhaps even in conflict with it. The evidence for \n     both of these conclusions is, in our view, overwhelming. The \n     plain fact is that any contention that most issue ads are \n     motivated by issues or that most soft money builds political \n     parties must ignore a veritable mountain of conflicting \n     evidence. We find such claims completely unsustainable.\n       Whether that conclusion should translate automatically into \n     support for McCain-Feingold and Shay-Meehan is a different \n     matter. These decisions inevitably involve a number of \n     factors, starting with the judgment whether these bills are \n     the best response to the manifest weaknesses of our campaign \n     finance laws. We cannot be sure that it is, but our analysis \n     suggests two important facts in its favor. First, the \n     experience of the last two elections suggests that neither \n     Democrats nor Republicans would be disproportionately harmed \n     by a ban on soft money or a stricter definition of issue \n     advocacy. Indeed, neither party stands to gain or lose much \n     against their counterparts since the Democrats' relative \n     financial weakness is proportionately smaller in soft money \n     than in hard, and their allies outspent Republicans' in both \n     years. Past experience suggests that neither party would gain \n     an advantage on TV if the McCain-Feingold bill becomes law.\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\n       Second, we found no evidence that the new dividing line \n     between issue advocacy and electioneering in McCain-Feingold \n     is overly broad and would affect many commercials that we \n     found to be genuine attempts to advocate issues, not \n     candidates. Some critics will surely complain that we have no \n     objective standards for determining which commercials are \n     genuine issue advocacy, but that is untrue. The standards \n     offered in McCain-Feingold are objective. The fact that they \n     perform so well against the subjective judgment of our \n     coders, each of whom examined hundreds of ads, is extremely \n     reassuring. We are always eager to consider improvements, but \n     there is no reason not to conclude that the definition of \n     electioneering in McCain-Feingold is, at the very least, an \n     excellent start.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, ninety-nine percent of the ads that were \nrun in that 60-day period mention Federal candidates. They tested the \nSnowe-Jeffords language. Guess what. Ninety-nine percent were ads that \nmentioned a Federal candidate. Only 1 percent were genuine issue \nadvocacy ads. They can run all of the ads they want, but they have to \ndisclose.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we will be voting in just a few minutes. \nLet me make a couple of comments.\n  First of all, the disclosure that is required in this bill is \nconstitutionally suspect. I don't think there is any doubt about that. \nBut that is not the worst part of this bill. My colleague from Maine \nkeeps skipping over what is the worst part. The worst part is this.\n  Let's go through one more time what it does because it is so \nunbelievable.\n  It basically draws an unconstitutional line of 60 days before the \nelection that says labor unions can't run ads, corporations can't run \nads, nor can any other group run ads if a candidate's name is mentioned \nor if a candidate's image appears on the screen.\n  Yes, it is political speech. Yes, they are trying to affect an \nelection. They are trying to affect the political discourse as the most \neffective way to do it right before the election when everyone is \npaying attention.\n  This bill arbitrarily says that at the most crucial time when free \nspeech and political speech is the most important, we are going to \narbitrarily say you can no longer do it. It is absolutely unbelievable.\n  This is the last time on this vote that Members of the Senate are \ngoing to have the opportunity to strike out what obviously the courts \nwill later strike out. That is not Snowe-Jeffords, but it is now Snowe-\nJeffords-Wellstone. It is unconstitutional.\n  A vote for the DeWine amendment is a vote for freedom of speech, for \nthe first amendment, and for the Constitution.\n  I ask my friends when they come to the floor in just a minute to \nremember the oath that all of us took to support the Constitution.\n  It is one thing for us to vote on things that are close. This one is \nnot close. This one is unconstitutional. It needs to come out of the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 40 \nseconds to respond to my colleague, if he would be so gracious.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Chair if I don't use the 40 seconds to give \nme 5 more.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator asked for 40 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ready, go.\n  This is not about a constitutional question. There are lots of groups \nand organizations--left, right, and center--that want to put soft money \ninto these sham ads. Any group or organization can run any ad they \nwant. They just have to finance it out of hard money. We don't want \nthere to be a big loophole for soft money. Not constitutional? The \nLeague of Women Voters says it is. Common Cause says it is \nconstitutional. The former legislative director of ACLU says it is \nconstitutional. The House of Representatives passed Shays-Meehan, which \nincludes Snowe-Jeffords-Wellstone, that says it is constitutional. In \nall due respect, there are many who think this is constitutional. This \nis all about spending groups and organizations that want to be able to \nuse this as a loophole to run sham issue ads.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to also announce that the Republican amendment \nafter that will be offered by Senator Frist of Tennessee, along with a \nDemocratic cosponsor, on the subject of nonseverability, which is one \nof the most important, if not the most important, amendments remaining \nbefore we complete this bill at some point--the leader says--today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Harkin, is recognized to offer an amendment on which there \nshall be 2 hours of debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Iowa has \nconsented to let me take just a few minutes at this point to introduce \na bill. I have checked with the distinguished manager, Senator \nMcConnell, and it is agreeable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for up \nto 10 minutes for the introduction of a bill as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I could not hear the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Senate, please.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My request was to proceed for up to 10 minutes as in \nmorning business for the introduction of a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of an extensive statement \nbe printed in the Record and that the Record reflect--sometimes the \nRecord does not reflect the actual language;\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nthere is a cutoff.

I thank the Chair, and I thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized to offer \nan amendment on which, as I stated earlier, there shall be 2 hours of \ndebate. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 155\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide \n   for a voluntary system of spending limits with respect to Senate \n                          election campaigns)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 155.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am proud to have as my cosponsor the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  I want to recap where we are in this week-long debate on campaign \nfinance reform. We have come a long way in the last week and a half on \nthis campaign finance reform bill.\n  We have debated a wide range of amendments, accepted some, rejected \nothers. The good ones we have adopted are: To stop the price gouging on \nTV ads, the Torricelli amendment; to require up-to-date inspection of \nall reports on the Internet, the Cochran-Landrieu-Snowe amendments; \nstronger disclosure rules by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel; \nbringing all organizations under the issue ad ban; the Wellstone \namendment.\n  And we rejected some amendments. Attempts to preserve soft money were \nrejected; an attempt to dramatically increase hard money was rejected; \nprovisions to silence the workers of America, paycheck protection, were \nrejected. I am a little disappointed that yesterday we did, \nunfortunately, increase the amount of hard money we can raise for \ncampaigns. I do not believe increasing the amount of money one can \nraise from hard dollars is reform, but that was adopted by the Senate.\n  But, there is something missing in this debate. There is something \nthat has been missing for a week and a half from this debate. It is \nlike the crazy uncle in the basement who no one talks about. What kind \nof reform can we have when all we are talking about is how we raise the \nmoney and how much one can raise when we don't talk about how much we \nspend and what can be spent? What I am talking about is the kind of \nreform that includes some limits on how much we can spend.\n  With the increase in the amount of hard money we can raise --and we \nhave banned soft money, which is good; I voted to ban soft money--that \njust means all of us now will be running our fool heads off raising \nmore hard money. We do have the Torricelli amendment that says TV \nstations have to sell us their ads at the lowest unit rate based upon \nlast year, and that is fine; I am all for that. It just means we can \nbuy more ads. We will raise more money, and we will buy more ads.\n  It has gotten so that now we hire ad agencies. They write the ads and \nsell us like soap. We are just a bunch of bars of soap to the American \npeople; that is all we are. They see these ads, one ad after another \ncome election time, and it is just like selling soap. Can we be \nsurprised when the American people treat us like soap, that we are no \nmore important in their lives, for example; that we are irrelevant \nexcept when we annoy them by ban barding them with ads in the weeks \nbefore the election. What I hear from the American people time and time \nagain is: When are you going to talk about the issues in your campaigns \nrather than having all these ads out there?\n  We are really missing a serious part of campaign finance reform by \nnot talking about it and doing something about it.\n  I do not know about any other Senator, but one of the things I hear a \nlot in Iowa and other places around the country when people talk to me \nabout campaign finance reform is: When are you going to get a control \non how much money you spend?\n  In the last election cycle, just in Federal elections, we spent over \n$1 billion, I think about $1.2 billion. The American people are upset \nabout this. Are they upset about raising soft money and corporations \nand special influence? Yes, they are. They are equally upset about the \ntremendous amount of money we are spending in these campaigns, buying \nthese ads and flooding the airwaves.\n  We have to think about how we can limit how much we spend on \ncampaigns so all of us aren't running around, weekend after weekend, \nweek after week, month after month, to see how much hard money we can \nraise to hire that ad agency to buy those ads.\n  That is what this amendment Senator Wellstone and I have offered \ndoes. It is very simple and straightforward. It puts a voluntary limit \non how much we can spend in our Senate campaigns.\n  The formula is very simple. It is $1 million plus 50 cents times the \nnumber of voting-age residents in the State. Every Senator has on his \nor her desk the chart that shows how much you would be limited in your \nown State. With that limitation, there is a low of $1.2 million in \nWyoming to $12 million in California. My own State of Iowa would be \nlimited to $2.1 million for a Senate campaign. I say to the occupant of \nthe Chair, in Virginia the limit would be $3.6 million. I don't know \nhow much the Senator spent this last campaign, but I know for myself in \nIowa, $2.1 million runs a good grassroots campaign as long as your \nopponent does not spend any more than that. I bet the same is true in \nVirginia at $3.7 million.\n  The amendment also says if you have a primary, you can spend 67 \npercent of your general election limits. If you have a runoff, you can \nspend 20 percent of the general election limit.\n  I'd like to stress that this is a voluntary limit. Why would anyone \nabide by the limit? You abide by the limit because the amendment says \nif one candidate goes over the voluntary limits by $10,000, then the \nother person who abided by the limits will begin to get a public \nfinancing of 2-1. For every $1 someone would go over the limit, you get \n$2.\n  For example, in Virginia, if the limit is $3.6 million and the \nSenator from Virginia voluntarily agrees to abide by that limit, if the \nperson running against the Senator from Virginia went over $3.6 \nmillion--say they spent $4 million, which would be $400,000 more--the \nSenator from Virginia would get $800,000. Two for one. Now, that is a \ngreat disincentive for anyone to go beyond the voluntary limits because \nthe other person gets twice as much money as the person who went over \nthe limits.\n  I point out the difference between my amendment and the one offered \nearlier by Senator Biden and Senator Kerry. Their amendment included \npublic financing from the beginning. This amendment does not. This \namendment says, raise money however we decide to let you raise money. \nThat is the way you raise it. PACs, personal contributions, whatever \nlimits we decide on around here, you raise that money. There are no \npublic benefits. The only time public benefits kick in is if someone \nwent over the voluntary limits.\n\n  My friend from Kentucky said the other day on the floor that all of \nthe polls show the American people don't like public financing. They \ndon't want their tax dollars going to finance Lyndon LaRouche and other \nsuch people.\n  First of all, the money we use here to counter what someone might \nspend over the limits is not raised from tax dollars; it is a voluntary \ncheckoff and from FEC fines.\n  Second, if the Senator from Kentucky is right, and I think he may \nwell\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nbe--I don't know--that the American people don't want public financing \nof campaigns, then that is a second hammer on discouraging someone from \ngoing over the voluntary limits. If someone goes over the voluntary \nlimits, that person is responsible for kicking in public financing. \nThat person is responsible for kicking in public financing, not from a \ntax but from a voluntary checkoff and from FEC fines.\n  There are two prohibitions here to keep someone from going over the \nvoluntary limits. One, your opponent gets twice as much money as \nwhatever you spent over those limits; second, there would be a built in \npublic reaction against someone who did it because it would cause \npublic financing to kick in.\n  Another issue was raised regarding this limit. Someone said: You have \nthe voluntary spending limits, but what about all the independent \ngroups out there? They are buying all the ads running against you; you \nare limited but they are not.\n  With the Snowe-Jeffords provision and the Wellstone amendment we \nadopted and just reaffirmed this morning, that is not the case. Those \nindependent groups cannot raise that kind of money from the \ncorporations and they cannot run those ads with your name in them.\n  Someone said: That is all well and good, but what if the Supreme \nCourt throws out the Wellstone amendment, throws out Snowe-Jeffords, \nand says that is unconstitutional? Then we are left with your limits \nand these independent groups can go ahead and raise all this money and \nrun those ads.\n  The amendment says if the Supreme Court finds the Wellstone amendment \nor the Snowe-Jeffords provisions unconstitutional, my amendment falls. \nIt will not be enacted. It will not be part of the campaign finance \nreform law.\n  If the Supreme Court finds the Wellstone amendment is \nunconstitutional and these groups go ahead and raise that money and run \nthose ads against you, then the limits in my amendment do not pertain. \nAll bets are off. But as long as Wellstone is constitutional, as long \nas Snowe-Jeffords is constitutional, then the voluntary limits would be \nthere and the provisions of a 2-for-1 match, if you went off, would \nalso pertain.\n  Bob Rusbuldt, executive vice president of the Independent Insurance \nAgents of America, said recently, ``campaign finance reform is like a \nwater balloon; You push down on one side, it comes up on the other.''\n  I think that is what will happen. We ban the soft money; we increase \nhard money. Push down one side, it goes up the other side. Who are we \nkidding? We are going to continue to raise hundreds of millions, \nbillions of dollars for these campaigns. My amendment will burst that \nwater balloon and make the existence of loopholes irrelevant, by \ncreating voluntary spending limits and providing a strong incentive for \ncandidates to comply with them. That is what this amendment is about.\n\n  Again, I am going to be very frank. The voluntary limit for my State \nof Iowa would be about $2.1 million. In 1996, when I ran for \nreelection, I spent $5.2 million. Can I abide by $2.1 million? You bet \nI can. As long as my opponent has to--fine. We can run our campaigns \nthe old fashioned way--at the grassroots. Then we will not have to be \nbuying ad after ad after ad, countering back and forth and all that \nstuff. Then maybe we will get down to real debates about issues and \nthings people care about, without just hiring ad agencies to buy all \nthese ads.\n  On each desk is a copy of basically what the amendment does, and a \nlist by State of what the limits would be.\n  I conclude this portion of my remarks by saying, again, this is the \ncrazy uncle in the basement no one wants to talk about. Everybody wants \nto talk about stopping how we raise money, getting rid of soft money, \nbut no one wants to talk about cutting down on how much we spend. Let's \nstart talking about it. Now is the time to do something about it. This \nvoluntary limit is constitutional and it will answer the other side of \nthe campaign finance reform debate that heretofore we have not \naddressed.\n  I yield whatever time the Senator from Minnesota requires. How much \ntime do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 44 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I may not need 15 minutes. The Senator from North \nDakota is here, as are others.\n  First, I say to my colleague from Iowa and other Senators, I do want \nto talk about the amount of money we spend. I am very honored to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment with the Senator from Iowa. I think this is \na great amendment. This amendment could very well pass in the Senate \nbecause it makes a lot of sense. It is just common sense.\n  My colleague from Iowa has described what this amendment is about. I \ndo not know that I need to do that again. We are talking about \nvoluntary limits. Then what we are saying is, if you agree to that \nvoluntary limit but the opponent doesn't, then you get a 2-to-1 match \nfor however many dollars your opponent goes over this limit. This \namendment makes the McCain-Feingold bill, which deals with the soft \nmoney part, quite a strong reform measure.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, I believe so strongly in this \namendment for a couple of different reasons. First of all, here is \nsomething else we have not talked about, and we need to, as incumbents. \nIn all too many ways the system is wired for incumbents. This amendment \nprobably comes as close as you can come to creating a more level \nplaying field. It really does. Many more people would have an \nopportunity to run with this amendment part of the law. They really \nwould.\n  I think there is quite a bit of pressure on people. It seems to me, \nif this is the law of the land and candidates step forward and say, \nabsolutely we will agree to this limit because we do not want to be \ninvolved in this obscene money chase, we will agree with this limit \nbecause we want there to be more debate and fewer of these poison ads \nand all the rest, we will agree because we know people in Iowa and \nConnecticut and North Dakota and Minnesota do not like to see all this \nmoney spent, I think it is going to be much more difficult for another \ncandidate to say, no, I won't agree with this limit; I want to buy this \nelection. Then you have the additional disincentive of the 2-to-1 \nmatch.\n\n  This is a perfect marriage. In one stroke, it dramatically reduces \nthe amount of money spent, dramatically reduces the power of special \ninterest groups, dramatically reduces the cynicism and disillusionment \npeople have about politics in the country, and dramatically increases \nthe chances of a lot of citizens thinking they can run for the Senate, \nthat they might be able to do this, they might be able to raise this \namount of money and they would not lose because someone could just \ncarpet bomb them with all sorts of ads and all sorts of resources. This \nis a great reform amendment.\n  I also make another point. I just finished saying the system is wired \nfor incumbents but that I think all of us are going to want to support \nthis amendment. The truth is, in one way it is wired--but it is so \ndegrading. Who wants to have to constantly be on the phone asking for \nmoney? Who wants to be traveling all around the country constantly \nhaving to raise money? Who wants, every day of the week during your \nreelection cycle when you want to be out on the floor debating issues \nand doing work for people on your State, to have to be on the phone for \nwhatever time, every single day, making these calls?\n  None of it is right. This amendment is just a commonsense amendment, \nsuch a modest amendment, yet it has such major, major ramifications, \nall in the positive and all in the good for how we finance campaigns.\n  This is really one of the great amendments. I thank Senator Harkin \nfor his work on it, and I am very proud to be a part of this effort.\n  I am going to finish by making two other quick points. I say this \nbeing a little facetious, but I do not think it is a bad point to make. \nI say to Senator Harkin and Senator Dorgan, this should be called the \ngood food amendment. The reason I think it should be called the good \nfood amendment is when you no longer have to go to these hotels for the \n$1,000--oh, I forgot, now it is $2,000, actually $4,000--when you no \nlonger have to go to these hotels for these $2,000 and $4,000 \ncontributions\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nand eat the rubber chicken meals, now you get to campaign in the \nneighborhoods. I get to eat Thai food and Vietnamese food and Somalian \nfood and Ethiopian food and Latina and Latino food. You get to be at \nreal restaurants with real people out in the neighborhoods, out in the \ncommunities. You get to stump speak. You get to debate. This is the \ngood food amendment. We will all be healthier if we support this \namendment. I am trying to get to my colleagues through their stomachs, \nI guess.\n  This is the last point I want to make because I want to end on a very \nserious note. The voluntary spending limit for Minnesota would be \n$2,604,158. Could I campaign and have a chance to ``get my message \nout'' on $2.6 million if we would have both candidates agree? \nAbsolutely. Do I, today on the floor of the Senate, want to make a \ncommitment that if this amendment is agreed to and becomes the law of \nthe land that I will abide by this voluntary spending limit if my \nopponent would do so or--I am sorry, it doesn't matter. The answer is: \nYes, I am ready to do this. This would be a gift from Heaven, from my \npoint of view, because I am tired of all of the fundraising. And I \nhaven't even started. I am not even doing what I am supposed to do. I \nam tired of it. So I am ready to say right now, if this amendment \nbecomes the law of the land, I am going to abide by it. I want to be \none of the first Senators to step forward and say I agree.\n\n  I think a lot of Senators will. I think it will be a lot better for \nus, whether we are Democrats or Republicans. It will be a lot better \nfor the people we represent. It will be a lot better for Iowa and \nMinnesota. It will be a lot better for representative democracy. It \nwill be a lot better for our country.\n  This is a great amendment. I hope it gets overwhelming support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Minnesota. The Senator makes a \ngood point. I am going to have some more data on how much money was \nraised in the last cycle and what this might mean, but in terms of \ntime, let's be honest about it. How much time do we spend on the phone \nraising money and traveling on weekends, going here and there? This \nwould help us because now we can spend more time in our States, meet \nwith people, spend more time, as you say, around the coffee tables in \nthe small cafes and restaurants rather than running all over the \ncountry trying to raise money all the time. I think the Senator makes a \ngood point on that. It will bring us closer to representative \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It would bring us closer to the people we represent \nand bring the people closer to us, all of us, in whatever State.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, so far as I see, we have done a lot of \ngood things in the McCain-Feingold bill. We rejected a lot of bad \namendments. It looks good. But all in all, the way our campaigning \nfinancing system is today, it is still an incumbent protection \nsystem. It is still incumbent protection.\n\n  For example, in the 2000 election, the average incumbent raised $4.5 \nmillion, while the average challenger raised $2.7 million. This helps \nto level that playing field a little bit.\n  I also point out the statistics that in the 2000 election cycle, \nSenate candidates spent $434.4 million in hard money. If we had had \nthis voluntary limit in existence in the 2000 election, Senate \ncandidates would have spent $113.4 million, a difference of $321 \nmillion less than Senate candidates would have had to raise in the 2000 \nelection.\n  I think we would have had better campaigns, and we would have had \nbetter issue-oriented campaigns in the 2000 election cycle. That $321 \nmillion represents how many hours, how many days, and how many times \nSenators have to travel all over the country and have to get on the \nphone to raise the money, as Senator Wellstone said, when those \nSenators could be in their home State meeting with their constituents?\n  I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for yielding \nthe time.\n  Mr. President, there are some who continue to insist that, gosh, \nthere is not too much money in politics. In fact, they say there is not \nenough. What we really ought to do is make sure that everything is \nreported and let anyone contribute any amount at any time they want to \ncontribute. I think that is a fairly bankrupt argument.\n  I ask the American people if they think, in September or October of \nan election year as they turn on their television sets, that there is \ntoo little politics or too little money in politics. They understand \nthere is far too much money in this political system. We ought to \nchange it.\n  The Supreme Court, in a rather bizarre twist, which happens from time \nto time across the street, said Congress can limit contributions. That \nis constitutional. But it cannot limit expenditures of campaigns. That \nwould be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court struck down a provision in \na previous reform that had some limits and said: We are going to limit \ncontributions, but you can't limit expenditures.\n  In this debate for nearly 2 weeks about campaign finance reform, \nthere are no serious discussions about limited expenditures, except for \nthe discussion initiated today by Senator Harkin from Iowa. You can't \nget at this problem unless you begin to talk about trying to find a way \nto limit expenditures in campaigns. How do you do that?\n  Some stand up and want to test the waters. Some want to make waves. \nFortunately, the Senator from Iowa wants to make waves. There is a big \ndifference. He wants to do something that works.\n\n  There are some in this debate who want to do just enough to make the \nAmerican people think they have done something but not so much that we \nwould solve the problem.\n  I am for campaign finance reform, some would think, but I am really \nnot for that which has enough grip to solve this problem.\n  You don't solve this problem unless you find a way to deal with this \nquestion of campaign spending.\n  This has become, as some of my colleagues have said, almost like \nauctions rather than elections, with massive quantities of money moving \nin every direction--hard money, soft money, $1 million here, $500,000 \nthere, and $100,000 in this direction.\n  So we have McCain-Feingold. I support McCain-Feingold. But I must say \nit has changed in the last 6 or 8 days. I regret that yesterday the \nMcCain-Feingold bill was changed by my colleagues who said we need to \nadd more hard money into the political system. That is not a step \nforward. That is a retreat. Nonetheless, I will still vote for McCain-\nFeingold.\n  But the Harkin amendment makes this McCain-Feingold bill a better \nbill. It addresses the bull's eye of the target by saying we can \nconstruct a set of voluntary spending limits with mechanisms that will \npersuade people to stay within those limits. Because if someone waltzes \nin and says they are worth a couple billion dollars, that they intend \nto spend $100 million on the Senate seat, if they do not like it, tough \nluck. We have a series of mechanisms now described by my colleague in \nthis amendment that says that is going to cost them. They have every \nright to spend that money, but, by the way, their opponent is going to \nhave the odds evened up because their opponent is going to get twice as \nmuch as they are spending over the voluntary limit through fees that \nare through checkoffs of income tax, from a fund that provides some \nbalance in our political system.\n  The funding of politics has almost become a political e-Bay. It is \nkind of an auction system. If you have enough money, get involved, and \nthe bid is yours. We bid on a Senate seat. Here is how much money we \nhave. We have big friends and bank accounts. So this Senate seat is \nours.\n  That is not the way democracy ought to work. That is not the way we \nought to have representative government work.\n  Some while ago, I was in the cradle of democracy where 2,400 years \nago in Athens, the Athenian state created this system of ours called \ndemocracy. This is the modern version of it. What a remarkable and \nwonderful thing.\n  But democracy works through representative government when you have \nthe opportunity for people to seek public office and the opportunity to \nwin in\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nan election in which the rules are reasonably fair.\n  There are circumstances where that still exists.\n  I come from a family without substantial wealth. I come from a family \nwithout a political legacy. I come from a town of 300 people. I come \nfrom a high school class of nine students. I come from a rural ranching \narea in southwestern North Dakota, and I pinch myself every day \nthinking: What a remarkable privilege it has been for the many years \nthat I have had the opportunity to serve in the Congress. It still \nhappens.\n  But I must say that in modern elections, in cycle after cycle, it is \nless and less likely that someone without massive quantities of money \nis going to be able to be successful against other candidates who have \naccess to barrels of money that they can pour into the television \ncommercials, along with their partners and the independent \norganizations that can pour massive amounts of unlimited money into the \nsame election and affect the result.\n\n  My colleague says we can change that. I like the mechanism that he \nestablishes to do that. I don't think it does violence to the McCain-\nFeingold bill at all. In fact, this bill is reform. If you come to the \nSenate floor and say you support McCain-Feingold because you stand for \nreform of campaign finance, then you must, it seems to me, come to this \nfloor and say you stand for this amendment because this amendment is \nreal reform added to this bill.\n  I will not diminish the McCain-Feingold bill. I have great respect \nfor Senators McCain and Feingold. And I have long supported this \nlegislation and have not wavered from that support. I commend them for \nwhat they have done and for establishing leadership on this issue. Were \nit not for them, we would not be on this floor at this time discussing \nthis subject.\n  Make no mistake. While this may not lead in the polls, this subject \nis important to the preservation and strength of this democracy of \nours.\n  But, I say again, I don't want people to tell me that we must oppose \nthis amendment because we must keep this fundamental bill pure. This \nbill will be better, this bill will be strengthened, and this bill will \nmove further in the direction of reform with the amendment offered by \nSenator Harkin.\n  In the last debate some 6 or 8 years ago in the Senate on this \nsubject, I offered an amendment that was reasonably similar to this. It \nsaid that you establish voluntary spending limits, and if someone goes \nover the spending limit, they pay a fee equal to 50 percent of that \nwhich they are over the spending limit, and the FEC collects the fee \nand transmits that fee to the opponent, which I thought was a delicious \nand wonderful way to penalize those who want to spend millions and \nmillions and millions of dollars in an attempt to buy a seat in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  We ought not have advantages for incumbents. We ought to have \nelections that are contests of ideas between good men and women who \nwant to offer themselves for public service. The outcome should not \nalways be determined by who has the most money.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Iowa is a very significant \nstep in the right direction. It is voluntary spending limits, but \nspending limits that are attached to a construction of a pool of money \nthat would be available through checkoffs available to help challengers \nand others in circumstances where one candidate says they are going to \nopen the bank account and spend millions and millions in pursuit of \npurchasing a seat in the U.S. Congress.\n  I am happy to come today to support this amendment. I say to my \ncolleagues, if you have been on the floor talking about reform in the \nlast 2 weeks, do not miss this opportunity to vote the way you talk. \nThis is reform. This adds to and strengthens McCain-Feingold, make no \nmistake about it.\n  So I am very pleased to support this amendment. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this amendment. I hope we can adopt this amendment because \nthis is a significant step.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time does the Senator from Iowa have remaining on \nthis side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I inquire of my friend and colleague from Kentucky, I \npresume if we need some additional time, as Members come over, we can \nlet it flow. Two and a half hours, is that what we have agreed to on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours evenly divided.\n  Mr. DODD. Two hours.\n  If we need a little time for some reason--obviously, Members may want \nto be heard--I presume we will follow some rule of comity.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I say to my friend from Connecticut, there should \nnot be a problem. I do not think we will be swamped with speakers on \nthis side. We will be glad to try to work to accommodate this and have \nthe vote before lunch.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Iowa and my \ncolleagues, as well, who have spoken today--Senator Dorgan and Senator \nWellstone--for their support of this amendment. I, too, support this \namendment.\n  Senator Dorgan has said it well. Senator Wellstone has said it well. \nThis is true reform. If we are really interested in doing something \nabout the money chase, both in terms of contributions and the rush to \nspend even more in the pursuit of political office in this country, \nthen the Harkin amendment offers a real opportunity for those who would \nlike to do something about this overall problem by casting their vote \nin favor of his amendment.\n  Senator Harkin has explained this amendment very well. It is a \nvoluntary provision. It does level the playing field. I, too, over and \nover again over the past week and a half have expressed my concerns and \nworry about the direction we are going. I made the point the other day \nthat we are shrinking the pool of potential candidates for public \noffice in this country.\n  At the founding of our Nation, back more than 200 years ago, the only \npeople who could seek public office and could vote were white males who \nowned property. Pretty much those were the parameters. Of course, we \nabandoned those laws years ago. Nonetheless, that restricted the number \nof individuals, obviously, who could seek a seat in the Congress--the \nSenate or the House--or a gubernatorial seat.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened over the years, particularly in the \nlast 25 years or so, is we have created new barriers to seeking public \noffice. The largest of those barriers is the cost of running for public \noffice, the cost of raising the dollars, and the cost of getting your \nvoice heard. One of the reasons that has occurred, and one of the \ndifficulties we have had, is because of the Supreme Court decision back \nin 1974 that said money is speech.\n\n  Justice Stevens, to his great credit, in a minority opinion in that \ndecision, said money is not speech; money is property. He was exactly \nright. But the majority of the Court held otherwise. And because of \nthat decision, we have been plagued with our inability to come up with \na structure that would slow down and provide some ability to manage \nwhat has become a reckless system, in my view, that is only available \nto those who can afford to ante up and enter it.\n  There are those, obviously, who will be able to emerge in this \nprocess, even though they do not have the financial resources. But the \nproblem is those are going to become more the exceptions than the rule. \nThat is my great concern and worry; there will be fewer and fewer \npeople, who have great ideas, great ambition, great energy, a great \ndetermination to do something, who can even think about holding or \nrunning for a seat in the Senate or the House of Representatives.\n  We have taken the concept that is included in the Harkin amendment \nand applied it to Presidential contests--not exactly, but at least the \nnotion of public financing. Every single Presidential candidate for the \nlast 25 years has embraced public financing for Presidential races. \nEven the most conservative of those candidates has taken the\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\npublic moneys in order to try to keep down the cost of running for the \nPresidency, and that is an expensive undertaking. It has not made it \ninexpensive to do it, but I would suggest, in the absence of those \nprovisions--and it is a voluntary system--President Bush, the present \noccupant of the White House, did not take public moneys during the \nprimary season, but when it came to the general election, he did. There \nwill be reasons you will hear of why he did, but the fact is, by doing \nso, he accepted limitations on how much would be spent in those races.\n  Ronald Reagan, to his great credit, one of the great heroes of the \nconservative movement, accepted public moneys in both the primary and \nthe general election, as has every other candidate. But what Senator \nHarkin has offered, and those of us who are supporting him--while not \napplying that same set of rules--is the same philosophical idea.\n  Mr. HARKIN. No public financing.\n  Mr. DODD. No public financing, but the notion that we have public \ncontrols, in a sense, limitations on how expenditures are made, if you \nare faced with challengers who are going to spend unlimited amounts of \ntheir own personal resources in order to be heard.\n  I happen to believe, as I said a moment ago, that money is not \nspeech, anymore than I think this microphone that is attached to my \nlapel is speech or anymore than the speaker system in this Chamber is \nspeech. Those are vehicles by which my voice is heard; it is amplified. \nYou can hear me better than you would if I took this microphone off and \nthe speakers were turned off. If I spoke loud enough, you might hear \nme, but in the absence of those technological assistances, my voice \nwould be that of any other person without the ability to have it \namplified.\n  Money allows your voice to be amplified. It is not speech. It just \ngives you a greater opportunity to be heard. So I fundamentally \ndisagree with the Court's decision on the issue of money being speech.\n\n  In fact, the notion of free speech in American politics today is, as \none editorial writer in my home State of Connecticut said, an oxymoron. \nThere is nothing free about political speech in America today. It \nbelongs to those who can afford to buy it. That is what it is. There is \nnothing free about it.\n  So this amendment really does give us an opportunity to control the \nexpenditure side, which is tremendously valuable. As some have said \nrepeatedly over the last several days, we may not get back to this \nsubject matter again, considering how difficult it was to get here. It \nmay have been Senator Dorgan who made the point we owe a debt of \ngratitude to our colleagues from Arizona and Wisconsin, Senator McCain \nand Senator Feingold, for insisting that this debate be part of the \npublic agenda this year; and that if their opponents, or even some of \ntheir supporters, are accurate, it might be another quarter century \nbefore we come back to this debate again, and then the appropriateness \nof the Harkin amendment is even more so. Because if we do not come back \nto the expenditure side of this, at some future date our successors in \nthese seats will be looking at campaigns that are double and triple and \nquadruple the amount we are spending today.\n  If you look at what we were spending 25 years ago--the Senator from \nIowa and I arrived on the very same day in the Halls of Congress; both \na little leaner and had a little more dark hair in those days----\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. DODD. But we have been here together for those many years.\n  In those days, statewide races in Iowa and Connecticut were a \nfraction of what they are today. If we extrapolate those numbers and \nadvance them 20 years or so down the road, we are doubling it, which \nwould probably be around $10 to $13, $14 million to seek a seat in Iowa \nor Connecticut in a contested contest, maybe more. Imagine how \ndifficult it would be for some young person, some young man or woman in \nIowa or Connecticut today, thinking one day they might like to be a \ncandidate for the Senate. We ought to tell them today, if they are \nthinking about it, in the absence of the Harkin amendment being \nadopted, they had better be prepared to finance themselves or have \naccess to something in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 million.\n  The pool of people I know in my State and, I suggest, in Iowa--and \nthe Senator knows his State better than I do--is a relatively small \nnumber of people who could even think about coming to the Senate under \nthat set of circumstances.\n  I applaud the Senator for this amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. I am fearful we are not going to get very far with this. I \nhope I am wrong on that, but I tell the Senator from Iowa, if we don't \npass this today, someday we will. It will take some other outrageous \nset of circumstances, much as it did in 1974, to provoke this \ninstitution to do what it should have done before then. Unfortunately, \nit will probably take that happening again to bring this body and the \nother Chamber around to the point the Senator from Iowa has embraced \nwith this amendment.\n  I commend him for it. I support it. I am hopeful our colleagues will \njoin him in adopting the amendment. This will add immensely to the \nlabel ``reform'' on the McCain-Feingold legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \noutstanding column by George Will on the subject we have been debating \nfor the last 9 days, from this morning's Washington Post, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 29, 2001]\n\n                        The Senate's Comic Opera\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       The overture for the Senate's campaign finance opera--opera \n     bouffe, actually--was indignation about President Bush's \n     decision against cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Reformers \n     said the decision was a payoff for the coal industry's \n     campaign contributions. But natural gas interests, rivals of \n     the coal interests, suffered from Bush's decision--yet they \n     gave Republicans more money ($4.8 million) last year then \n     coal interests gave ($3.37 million).\n       The ``reforming'' senators began their reforming by \n     legislating for themselves an even stronger entitlement to \n     buy television time at a discount, and by voting themselves a \n     right to take larger contributions (up to $6,000, rather than \n     just $1,000) when running against a rich, self-financing \n     opponent. The Supreme Court says the only permissible reason \n     for limiting political speech by limiting money is to prevent \n     corruption or the appearance thereof. The Senate did not \n     explain why it is corrupting to take $6,000 when running \n     against an opponent with a net worth of X but not corrupting \n     when running against an opponent with net worth of 10 times \n     X.\n       The Senate refused to ban, as nine states do, lobbyists \n     from contributing to legislators when the legislature is in \n     session. John McCain, at last noticing the Constitution, and \n     this inhibition on political giving is constitutionally \n     problematic, presumably because it restricts the rights to \n     political expression and to petition for redress of \n     grievances.\n       Constitutional scrupulousness is a sometime thing for \n     McCain, who once voted to amend the First Amendment to \n     empower government to do what his bill now aims to do--ration \n     political communications. For example, his bill would \n     restrict broadcast ads by unions and corporations and groups \n     they support in the two months before a general election or \n     30 days before a primary if the ads mention a candidate.\n       In a cri de coeur revealing the main motive for many \n     ``reform'' politicians--a motive having nothing to do with \n     corruption or the appearance of it--Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) \n     said: ``I'm suffering an independent expenditure missile \n     attack, and I don't have my shield.'' Campaign finance reform \n     is primarily an attempt by politicians to shield themselves \n     from free speech--from, that is, the consequences of the \n     shield James Madison wrote to protect the people from \n     politicians: ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the \n     freedom of speech.''\n       Last Saturday McCain's partner, Wisconsin Sen. Russell \n     Feingold, delivered the Democrats' response to President \n     Bush's weekly radio address. With the reformer's \n     characteristic hyperbole, Feingold attempted to reconnect \n     reform with ``corruption.'' He said: ``Members of Congress \n     and the leaders of both political parties routinely request \n     and receive contributions for the parties of $100,000, \n     $500,000, $1 million.''\n       Well. There are 535 members of Congress. In the last two-\n     year (1999-2000) election cycle, there were 1,564 \n     contributions of $60,000 or more from individuals and \n     organizations. So all those legislators supposedly \n     ``routinely'' receiving such contributions for their parties \n     receive, on average, fewer than two a year. The total value \n     of all 1,564 was $365.2 million, a sum equal to one-\n     fourteenth the amount Procter & Gamble spent on advertising \n     during the same period.\n       The New York Times accurately and approvingly expresses \n     McCainism: ``Congress is unable to deal objectively with any \n     issue, from a patients' bill of rights to taxes to energy \n     policy, if its members are receiving vast\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\n     open-ended donations from the industries and people \n     affected.'' Oh. If only people affected by government would \n     stop trying to affect the government--if they would just shut \n     up and let McCain act ``objectively.''\n       If you doubt that reformers advocate reform because they \n     believe that acting ``objectively'' means coming to \n     conclusions shared by the New York Times, read ``Who's Buying \n     Campaign Finance Reform?'' written by attorney Cleta Mitchell \n     and published by the American Conservative Union Foundation. \n     It reveals that since 1996, liberal foundations and soft \n     money donors have contributed $73 million to the campaign for \n     George Soros, founder of drug legalization efforts and other \n     liberal causes, has contributed $4.7 million, including more \n     than $600,000 to Arizonans for Clean Elections--more than 71 \n     percent of the funding of ACE.\n       Soros and seven other wealthy people founded and funded the \n     Campaign for a Progressive Future. One of those people, \n     Steven Kirsch, contributed $500,000 to campaign ``reform'' \n     groups in 2000--and $1.8 million against George W. Bush. \n     Another reformer, Jerome Kohlberg, donated $100,000 to a \n     group that ran ads saying ``Let's get the $100,000 checks out \n     of politics.''\n       Let's be clear. These people have and should retain a \n     constitutional right to behave in this way, putting the \n     bouffe in the opera bouffe.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a professor of law at the University of \nKentucky College of Law also wrote an excellent op-ed piece in the \nLexington-Herald Leader in my home State on Tuesday, essentially \nechoing many of the arguments a number of us have made against the \nunderlying bill over the last 9 days. I ask unanimous consent that \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington-Herald Leader, Mar. 27, 2001]\n\n               Campaign Finance Bill Treads on Our Rights\n\n                          (By Paul Salamanca)\n\n       I've heard it said that more than a hundred legal academics \n     agree that the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill \n     does not violate the First Amendment. I'm not one of them.\n       Believe it or not, political parties are expressive \n     associations. The First Amendment protects one's right to \n     speak freely, to write freely, to assemble peaceably and to \n     petition the government for redress of grievances (in other \n     words, to complain). The first, second and fourth of these \n     precious, hard-fought liberties are most effectively \n     exercised through association.\n       That's because almost all of us--me included--are too busy, \n     too poor or too inarticulate to speak effectively by \n     ourselves. But when we pool our time, talent and treasure, we \n     can move mountains, expressively speaking. And the third of \n     these liberties, peaceable assembly, explicitly protects \n     association.\n       Because political parties are dedicated to the discussion \n     and formulation of ideas, and to the identification and \n     promotion of people who will implement those ideas, the First \n     Amendment protects the American Civil Liberties Union, the \n     Sierra Club, the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People and the National Right to Life Committee. Like \n     these associations, the Democratic and Republican parties are \n     expressive. Thus, limitation on the amount of money people \n     can give to political parties is constitutionally \n     indistinguishable from a limitation on the amount of money \n     people can give to the ACLU or the NAACP.\n       The upshot of this is simple: The giving of ``soft money'' \n     to political parties is an exercise of First Amendment \n     rights, and a flat ban on soft money is unconstitutional.\n       One argument to the contrary is that soft money is a weak \n     form of bribery. But this argument operates from the \n     implausible assumption that political parties are, in fact, \n     the government. But this cannot be true. If an association \n     formed to criticize the government is, in fact, the \n     government, then we have a case of a shark trying to eat \n     itself.\n       Another provision of McCain-Feingold would ban or sharply \n     limit advertising by private groups that refers to a \n     candidate by name. This too would violate the First \n     Amendment. At its core, the First Amendment is designed to \n     facilitate discussion of political issues and candidates by \n     the ultimate sovereign in the United States: ``We the \n     People.'' So, if the First Amendment doesn't protect a \n     group's right to say ``Vote for X because of X's position on \n     such-and-such issue,'' it wouldn't be worth the toner it \n     takes to print it.\n       Thus, issue advertising, so much maligned these days, is an \n     important form of advocacy. In fact, it's the most effective \n     form of speech available to non-profit expressive \n     associations, such as the NAACP.\n       To preclude such groups from running ads that refer to \n     candidates before elections--or to impose so many regulations \n     on their ability to do so that many would give up trying--\n     would seriously interfere with free speech.\n       There are those who say that issue ads--ads that end by \n     saying something like ``Please call X and tell X that such-\n     and-such a policy is bad'' (in other words, the very ads that \n     McCain-Feingold would limit or ban)--are nothing more than \n     thinly veiled pieces of express advocacy.\n       But this couldn't be a more cruel irony because non-profits \n     would love to expressly advocate the election of X or the \n     rejection of Y without mincing words. The only reason they \n     don't is fear of overly aggressive interpretation of existing \n     federal law by the Federal Election Commission.\n       Indeed, this state of affairs gives rise to two distinct \n     anomalies. First, people watching TV are annoyed by issue ads \n     that don't come right out and express a preference, when the \n     associations running the ads would dearly love not to mince \n     words. Second, people, like Sens. John McCain and Russ \n     Feingold can use this annoyance, which itself is the product \n     of federal regulation, to justify further regulation of \n     speech.\n       And make no mistake: McCain-Feingold would regulate speech. \n     To the extent the bill would fall short of literally banning \n     issue advertising, it would accomplish about the same thing, \n     at least with regard to small associations and associations \n     whose members want to remain anonymous, by imposing onerous \n     accounting and reporting requirements on issue advertisers.\n       McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional. If it passes Congress, \n     the president should veto it--with or without paycheck \n     protection, with or without a severability clause. And \n     Kentucky's senior senator, Mitch McConnell is right to oppose \n     it.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is much not to like in the Harkin \namendment and one provision that has some appeal. I will talk about the \nprovision that has some appeal at the end.\n  As I understand the Harkin amendment, it is taxpayer funding with a \nlittle different twist. What the Senator from Iowa has shrewdly done is \nsuggest that the spending limit in his amendment is voluntary.\n  What in fact happens is, you have candidate A and candidate B. Let's \nassume candidate A, who is a well-known incumbent who doesn't need to \nspend as much to get his message home, is up against an unknown \nchallenger, and that unknown challenger knows he needs to spend more to \nhave a chance to win. As soon as that unknown challenger encroaches \nabove the Government's specified spending limit, the Treasury of the \nUnited States provides $2 out of our tax money for every $1 the \nnoncomplying candidate gets to spend. In other words, a hammer comes \ndown on a noncomplying candidate just as soon as they encroach above \nthe Government-specified speech limit--hardly voluntary.\n  That is sort of like a robber putting a gun to your head and saying: \nI would like to have your wallet but you, of course, really don't have \nto give it to me.\n  If you choose to exercise your right to speak beyond the Government-\nprescribed limit, bad things happen to you. The Federal Treasury of the \nUnited States gives you $2 for every $1 your opponent is spending to \nbludgeon you into submission.\n  The second part of the Harkin amendment is interesting in that it \nrelies on volunteered tax money to provide the funding. This is \ndifferent from the Presidential system where, as we know, we are able, \nif we choose, to check off $3 of tax money we already owe and to divert \nit away from things such as children's nutrition and food stamps and \nother worthwhile activities into a fund to pay for the Presidential \nelections. As I understand the Harkin checkoff, the taxpayer is \nactually asked to volunteer an additional sum of money from his return.\n  I predict to my friend from Iowa, there is going to be darn little \nparticipation in that. We know what the checkoff rate has been among \ntaxpayers when it doesn't even add to their tax bill. The high water \nmark was in 1980, when it was slightly under 30 percent of taxpayers. \nThere has been a steady trend downward to the point last year there \nwere 11.8 percent of taxpayers volunteering money they already owed--it \ndidn't add to their tax bill; it was money they already owed--to go to \npay for buttons and balloons and campaign commercials and national \nconventions.\n  My colleagues get the drift. There is not a whole lot of interest on \nthe part of the American taxpayer to pay for our political campaigns. \nIn fact, we have a huge poll on that every April 15. The most massive \npoll ever taken on any subject is taken on the subject of using tax \ndollars for political campaigns. That poll is taken every April 15 on \nour tax return. Even when it doesn't add to our tax bill, about 10 \npercent of Americans choose to participate; 90 percent choose not to.\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, I don't think this will be a very \nreliable source of funds if the taxpayer actually has to ante up and \nprovide money for a candidate he doesn't know. The chances of an \nAmerican taxpayer choosing to donate money to a nameless candidate is \nvirtually nil, I suggest.\n  A slightly differently nuanced version of taxpayer funding than we \nhad before us earlier, the Kerry amendment, got 30 votes. I hope this \namendment will get no more than 30 votes.\n\n  We have come a long way on this subject. Earlier in the Senate \ncareers of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Iowa and \nmyself, we were actually debating taxpayer funding of elections and \nspending limits for campaigns on the floor of the Senate. That kind of \nbill actually passed the Senate in 1993. We have come a long way.\n  It is noteworthy that the underlying McCain-Feingold bill does not \nhave any PAC ban in it. It doesn't have any tax money in it. It doesn't \nhave any spending limits on candidates in it. We have come a long way.\n  Now all we are debating is whether or not we are going to destroy the \ngreat national parties, which I think is a terrible idea. We will get \nback to that issue later.\n  The Senator from Iowa sort of resurrects one of the golden oldies, \none of the ideas from the past that sort of moved right on out of the \npublic debate, by offering once again an opportunity for the taxpayers \nto subsidize candidates. There is a serious constitutional problem in \nthe Treasury of the United States bludgeoning a noncomplying candidate \nwho chooses to speak as much as he wants to with a 2-for-1 match out of \nthe Treasury, $2 out of the Treasury for every $1 the poor challenger \nis trying to raise to get his name out. It seems to me that has serious \nconstitutional problems.\n  There is one provision in the amendment of the Senator from Iowa I do \nfind intriguing, and I commend him for it. That is the importance of \nthe principle of nonseverability in this kind of debate. As I think our \ncolleagues may remember--if they don't, let me remind them--the last \nthree campaign finance reform bills that cleared the Senate, that \nactually got out of this body, had nonseverability clauses in them. In \nfact, on this subject of campaign finance, it is more common to have \nnonseverability clauses in them than out of them. The norm has been to \nhave nonseverability clauses in campaign finance reform bills.\n  The Senator from Iowa--I commend him for this--links his amendment to \nthe Snowe-Jeffords language in a nonseverability clause. And I commend \nthe Senator from Iowa for doing that because it is a clear \nunderstanding that these kinds of bills are fraught with constitutional \nquestions--fraught with them. And it is entirely appropriate to have \nlinkages within these bills. It doesn't necessarily have to apply to \nthe whole bill. And the amendment that the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nFrist, will be offering early today does not link the whole bill. But \nit is entirely common and appropriate to add nonseverability clauses in \nthese kinds of bills. I commend the Senator from Iowa for recognizing \nthat principle. Even though I don't like the substance of his \namendment, I do think the recognition of the importance of that \nprinciple is worthy of commendation. I commend him for that.\n\n  Mr. President, beyond that, I find not much to like about the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa. I hope it will not be approved. I \ndon't know if we will have other speakers on this side. For the moment, \nI reserve the remainder of my time, which is how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 51 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my colleague from Iowa speaks, I wonder if we might \ndo this. For the purpose of informing our colleagues who are inquiring \nas to when this vote might occur, is it a noon vote? Is that how my \ncolleague feels about that, another half hour?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. DODD. A noon vote. To let people know, why don't we do a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at noon a \nvote occur on the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond and maybe get in a \nlittle colloquy with my friend from Kentucky. I appreciate the struggle \nhe has had with the logic of his argument. But, quite frankly, I think \nthe logic is somewhat unsound. My friend from Kentucky talks about a \nchallenger out there, someone who wants to run for the Senate who has a \nmessage, such as Senator Dodd talked about, someone who has an idea, \nsome convictions and issues they want to bring out. They want to run \nfor the Senate.\n  The Senator from Kentucky says, rightfully, that they need some money \nto get that message out and, by putting this limit on it, they would \nnot be able to spend any more to get their message out than, say, an \nincumbent. Of course, we have access to the airwaves and the newspapers \nand all that kind of stuff. So a challenger might want to have more \nmoney.\n  Well, again, to attack the logic of that is to look at the facts. In \nthe 2000 election, the average incumbent raised $4.5 million--the \nincumbent--us--to get our message out. The average challenger raised \n$2.7 million. So under the present system, the challenger can't get \nthat message out. He is swamped by what we can raise.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will, in a second.\n  Now in the amendment I am offering, they would be equal in terms of \nhow much they could raise to spend. In fact, this amendment would help \nany of those challengers out there to get the message out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Iowa, the problem is that \nspending is not important to the incumbent. As the Senator pointed out, \nthe incumbent is already well known at the beginning of the campaign. \nIf you liken this to a football field, the incumbent is down on the \nopponent's 40-, maybe 35- or 30-yard line at the beginning of the race, \nthe typical challenger is back on his own 5. If they both have the same \namount of money to spend, the incumbent wins. Spending beyond the \nGovernment-prescribed amount is way more important to the challenger \nthan it is to the incumbent.\n\n  So simply adding up the figures doesn't tell you much. I mean, it is \ntrue that incumbents spend more than challengers; but it is almost \nirrelevant to the problem of the challenger, which is to have enough to \nget his message across. Having enough clearly is in the eye of the \nbeholder. We incumbents, of course, will always set the limits low \nenough to make it very difficult for anybody to get at us.\n  For example, I believe the spending limit in Kentucky is $2.5 million \nunder the Senator's proposal. That is about $300,000 or $400,000 more \nthan I spent 17 years ago in a race in which I was outspent by the \nincumbent and won. That is about what two competitive House candidates \nspent last year, each, in one of our six congressional districts.\n  The proposal of the Senator from Iowa would be a big advantage to me, \nunless I happen to have been running against Jerome Kohlberg, about \nwhom we have been talking every day. I will get back to that later \ntoday in another context. That billionaire put this full-page ad in the \nPost a couple days ago. These kinds of people are going to be more and \nmore running the show--people of great wealth. This may help you guys \nbecause most rich people are liberals. We are going to have to come up \nwith really rich conservatives, too, unless I am running against Jerome \nKohlberg, in which case I am going to clearly be outspent. I don't need \nthe Government, if I am a challenger, telling me how much I can spend, \nand I certainly don't need the Government giving the incumbent $2 out \nof the Treasury just as soon as I am beginning to get my message across \nand trying to catch up with that guy to head toward the end zone.\n  So I understand what the Senator is doing. I appreciate his \nrecognition of the importance of nonseverability clauses. But this \nwon't help challengers at all. In fact, it will be a great boon to \nincumbents.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, the Senator's reasoning flies in \nthe face of facts. That is why his reasoning is specious. Look at the \ndata. In the last election cycle, incumbents had $4.5 million, \nchallengers had $2.7 million. I will tell you what; I dare my friend \nfrom Kentucky to go out and ask any\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nchallenger who ran in the last race if they would have accepted this \nkind of a deal. They could spend as much money as the incumbent in the \ncampaign. I will bet you, you would find very few who would turn that \noffer down, if they could keep the incumbent down, keep them at the \nsame level. That is why I say I think the reason flies in the face of \nthe facts.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The challenger might accept it, but it would be good \nfor second place. The point is, if in a typical race, if you are a \nchallenger, your biggest problem, unless you are very wealthy, or a \ncelebrity, or war hero, is that nobody knows who you are. The Senator \nset the spending limits at such a level that almost no incumbent would \never lose.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let's take this analogy of the football field. You are \nright. Both of us have been on the same side. I have been a challenger \nrunning against a sitting Senator, and so have you. And we have run as \nincumbents. We have seen both sides of this. Now, I suppose all things \nbeing equal, I would rather be an incumbent, obviously. But there are \ncertain advantages to not being an incumbent. As I remember, when I \nran, I had an open field. I am on the 5-yard line, the incumbent \nSenator is on the 30-yard line. But guess what. I am out there every \nday. I am in that State every day getting my message out from town to \ntown, community to community, newspaper to newspaper, radio show to \nradio show. The person sitting here has to be in the Senate all year \nlong. So I had a great advantage. The challenger has a great advantage. \nThat field is open. The Senator starting on the 30-yard line goes from \none side, to the other side, to the other side before he gets down to \nthe end of the field. That challenger is open.\n\n  So I have to tell you that even though the incumbent has some \nadvantages of being an incumbent in the newspapers and elsewhere, a \nchallenger has advantages from being out there all the time. You know \nthat as well as I do. We have done that in the past.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It may be an advantage to be out there all the time, \nbut if you don't have the money to be on TV, and the Government tells \nyou how much you can advertise, it is not much of an advantage up \nagainst the incumbent who is getting all this free coverage--the \nadvantage that any incumbent will have no matter how you structure the \ndeal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You are getting that anyway.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is a great asset.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not only are you getting all of this free press and stuff \nfrom being a Senator, you are getting the money, too.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is nothing I can do about you getting publicity. \nThat comes with the territory of being a Senator. I am saying you \nshould not have it both ways; you should not have the money and all of \nthe protections that incumbents have. You can't do anything about all \nthe stuff--the stuff a Senator gets. We can set voluntary limits.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky I know how strongly he feels about \npublic financing. Perhaps my friend was right the other day when he \nsaid polls show that people don't want their tax dollars used for \npublic spending for people such as Lyndon LaRouche. My friend is \nprobably right there. That is why I think there is another hammer--and \nyou are right, this is a hammer--because there is no public financing \nin my amendment unless and until someone exceeds the limits. It is that \nperson who triggers, then, the financing that comes from a voluntary \ncheckoff.\n  Now, my friend says, well, there probably won't be enough money there \nbecause the people are not checking off as much money as they used to. \nIs that right? I think the Senator said that is what is happening. \nWell, the fact is, I have talked to a lot of people about the checkoff. \nDo you know why they don't want to give money to the checkoff? We just \nspend it.\n  We buy more TV ads, we hire more ad agencies, and the price keeps \ngoing up and up. They say: Why should I check off money to give to a \ncandidate and all I do is see more of these soap ads, selling them like \nsoap to me?\n  Under my amendment, a person checking off the money is putting money \ninto a reserve fund to prevent that from happening. There is another \nhammer there because the person who exceeds the limits is the one who \ntriggers the public financing.\n  If my friend is right, that people do not like public financing, that \nis another reason why someone would not exceed the limits. That is \nanother reason why I think people would be more prone to check off the \nmoney because the money would basically be used to prevent this \nunregulated, unlimited spending on ads.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, I do not know if he listened to my \nargument on that, but this will get people to check off more money \nbecause then it would be used not to just add to the coffers of \nspending and buying more TV ads, but it would be put into a reserve \nfund as a hammer to keep us from spending more and more money.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Iowa, he is counting on people \nwho do not contribute to candidates they know to contribute to \ncandidates they do not know, to contribute their money to a nameless \ncandidate and cause with which they might not agree.\n  The Senator from Iowa is correct; under his amendment there would be \nno taxpayer funding provided you complied with the Government speech \nlimit. The problem is, if you do not, your complying opponent gets tax \ndollars from the Government to counter your excessive speech. That is \nthe constitutional problem with the proposal of the Senator from Iowa.\n  I do not think that makes the spending limit voluntary if, when you \nencroach above the Government-prescribed speech limit, the Government \nsubsidizes your opponent. That is more than a hammer, that is a \nsledgehammer.\n  Also, it is worthy to note that all of the challengers who won last \nyear, as far as I can tell--and the Senator from Iowa can correct me if \nI am wrong--I believe all the challengers who won last year spent more \nthan the spending limits in his amendment, further proving my point \nthat a challenger needs the freedom to reach the audience. To the \nextent we are drawing the rules, crafting this in such a way that we \nmake it very difficult for the challenger to compete, we are going to \nwin even more of the time. Of course, incumbents do win most of the \ntime, but we would win more of the time if we had a very low ceiling.\n  In any event, my view is this is clearly unconstitutional. It is \ntaxpayer funding of elections, more unpopular than a congressional pay \nraise, widely voted against every April 15 by the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  We have had this vote in a slightly different way on two earlier \noccasions. The Wellstone amendment got 36 votes; the Kerry amendment \ngot 30. I hope the amendment of the Senator from Iowa will be roundly \ndefeated.\n  I do applaud him, however, for recognizing the importance of \nnonseverability clauses in campaign finance debates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3084-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I saw my colleague from Minnesota, but I \nguess he is not now on the floor. We have a couple minutes. My \ncolleague from Kentucky and I talked about this the other day. He makes \na very good point about the declining participation in the checkoff \nsystem. In fact, the dollar amounts have been raised. If my friend from \nKentucky is correct, originally it was $1 for the checkoff. You are not\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\npaying more in taxes. It is the money you send in. The checkoff of $1 \nof your tax returns would be used for the public financing of \nPresidential races. That number then went up to $3 because there were \nfewer and fewer people who were actually doing the voluntary checkoff.\n  His numbers, I believe, are correct. We have seen a decline in the \nnumber of people who are voluntarily checking off that $3 of their \nFederal taxes they are sending in or that are being withheld to be used \nfor these Presidential races.\n  I am worried about that because I think there is an underlying cause \nfor this. The debate we are having about campaign finance reform, while \nwe are not going to adopt public financing for congressional races \ndespite the fact there is a lot of merit going that route in terms of \ndealing with the constitutional problems that exist in the absence of \nhaving some public financing, there is an underlying reason that I \nthink contributes to that declining statistic, and that is the people \nare disgusted with the whole process.\n  I do not think it is people's lack of patriotism or their lack of \nunderstanding how important it is to contribute to strengthening our \ndemocracy. People are getting fed up. Witness that last year despite \nthe overwhelming amount of attention and advertising on a national \nPresidential race, a race that included Ralph Nader and the Green \nParty, there was Pat Buchanan and the Reform Party, the Democratic \ncandidate, Al Gore, and his running mate from my home State, Joe \nLieberman; President Bush and Richard Cheney. Out of 200 million \neligible voters in this country, only 100 million participated. One out \nof every two eligible voters in this country decided they were not \ngoing to make a choice for President of the United States and Vice \nPresident, not to mention the congressional races, the Senate races, \nand gubernatorial races that occurred.\n\n  On the Federal election for the leader of the oldest continuous \ndemocracy in the world, one out of every two adults in this country \nsaid they were not going to participate. I know some may have had \nlegitimate excuses, but I suspect a significant majority of those who \ndid not participate knew it was election day, did not have some \noverriding family matter that caused them to miss voting. I think they \nmade a conscious decision not to vote. I think they decided they were \nnot going to show up, and I cannot express in our native language \nadequately the deep, deep concern I have over that fact and what \nappears to be a growing number of people.\n  I hear it particularly among younger people. I visit a lot of high \nschools in my home State of Connecticut. I get a sense that too many of \nour younger people are embracing the notions held by one out of every \ntwo adult Americans in the last election, that they are not going to \nparticipate by showing up to choose the leader of our country. I \nsuspect that a good part of the reason is that people are just \ndisgusted by what they see and how elections are run when they see this \nmindless advertising, these 30-second spots, the attack ads that go \nafter each other as if this was somehow an athletic contest rather than \na debate of ideas where we are talking about the future of our country \nand what the priorities of a nation ought to be.\n  I, too, am very concerned with the declining statistics that my \nfriend from Kentucky has identified, but I think it is more a poll not \nabout public financing, I think it is a poll we ought to pay attention \nto, what the American people are saying, at least in the majority of \ncases, I believe: We think the system is not working very well. We \nthink the system is out of control. We think there is too much money in \npolitics; that our voices do not get heard; that we cannot afford to \nparticipate in these contests where contributions of $1,000, now $2,000 \nper individual, that people can write a check now for $37,500 if this \nMcCain-Feingold bill is adopted.\n  Last year--I said this over and over in the past week and a half--\nthere were only 1,200 people in this country who wrote the maximum \ncheck of $25,000; 1,200 people out of 280 million Americans. We now \nhave raised that because this hasn't been enough. We are told you can't \nfinance these campaigns with maximum contributions of $25,000 in \nFederal elections. We are raising it to $37,500. That is per \nindividual, per year. Double that for a primary election. That gets you \nto $75,000. Of course, if it is a husband and wife, it is $150,000. We \nhad to debate that. I commend my colleague from California who \nnegotiated that number down.\n\n  Those who wanted that number higher wanted $100,000 per individual, \n$200,000 for a husband and wife. We are told the system is financially \nbankrupt. We don't have enough money in politics, we are told.\n  That has more to do with these declining numbers of people \nvoluntarily checking off for some of their tax dollars to be used to \npublicly finance the Presidential races in America. I am hopeful the \nadoption of the McCain-Feingold bill, if it is adopted, will at least \nturn people's opinion in a direction that says at least we are \nbeginning to do something about these elections.\n  For those reasons, I commend, again, the principal authors of this \nbill and those who are supporting it. But I don't think it is enough. \nPeople are still turned off, to put it mildly, on how the races are run \nand on how politics is conducted. There will always be some; I am not \nsuggesting we will get 100-percent participation. I oppose any laws \nthat require people to vote as some countries do. We better do a lot \nbetter job in convincing more than just one out of two adult Americans \nthey ought to participate in choosing the leaders of our Nation than we \npresently are.\n  If those numbers continue to decline and we trail the rest of the \nworld as we lecture them about democracy and the importance of \nparticipating, I will say again, you put this country in peril and \nthese institutions that have survived for more than 200 years, and the \npublic support for them will decline. That, more than anything else, is \nwhat ought to preoccupy the attention of each and every one of us, \nregardless of our views on the particular aspects of amendments. Every \nsingle one of us privileged to serve in this Chamber, who have a voice \nand vote on how we might conduct the political debate in this Nation, \nneeds to take notice of what the American public is saying when they go \nto the polls or don't go to the polls on election day and exercise \ntheir right that people have spilled blood for, for over two centuries, \nnot only in our first great revolution but in a civil war that \nthreatened to divide and destroy this country, through two world wars, \nwars in the 20th century and other such contests in which Americans, in \ncountless numbers, lost their lives to protect and defend.\n  We are not asked to put our lives on the line. We voluntarily seek \nthese positions. If we are fortunate enough to be chosen by our \nconstituents to be here, we bear a very high degree of responsibility \nduring the brief amount of time the Good Lord gives us to represent the \nconstituencies that have chosen us to do what is right, not only for \nour own time but that future generations will inherit, as we have \ninherited, from the sacrifices of those who came before us, the \nprivilege of being here to see to it that this wonderful ideal and \nvision of democracy is perpetuated throughout this country for, \nhopefully, centuries to come.\n  For those reasons, I hope while this amendment may be rejected, we \ncould find more common ground between Democrats and Republicans on how \nto restore the public's confidence in the electoral process in this \ncountry. That is at the heart of what McCain-Feingold is all about, \ndespite all the debates about various minutiae in the bill or ideas to \nbe added to it. Our solemn responsibility, in addition to dealing with \nthe issues of the day, is to see to it the process by which we choose \npeople to make those decisions enjoys the broad-based support of the \nAmerican public. It is in jeopardy today. We better take it more \nseriously than we are.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask that the \ntime be charged against the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nbeing offered by my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. \nEarlier this week, Senator Kerry and I offered a similar amendment that \ncalled for voluntary spending limits and partial public financing. \nSenator Harkin's amendment differs in some respects to the proposal \nthat we offered, but it still seeks to alleviate the same problem: How \ncan we reduce the obscene amount of special interest money that is \nbeing spent in Senate campaigns today? And while I know that Senator \nHarkin's amendment will not pass, I nevertheless believe that it is \ntruly needed to reform our campaign finance system.\n  Since 1976, while the general cost of living has tripled, total \nspending on congressional campaigns has gone up eightfold. For the \nwinning candidates, the average House race went from $87,000 to \n$816,000 in 2000. And here on the Senate side, winners spent an average \nof $609,000 in 1976, but last year that average shot up to $7 million.\n  The FEC estimates that last year more than $1.8 billion in federally \nregulated money was spent on federal campaigns alone, and that doesn't \neven count the huge amount of soft money that went into attempts to \ninfluence federal elections. That has been roughly estimated to reach \nas high as nearly another $700 million.\n  I have been calling for public financing of congressional campaigns \nfor a very long time: since 1973, my first year in this body. And, as \nmy colleagues who have been here for a while know, I have taken to this \nfloor again and again over the years to urge us to solve the public's \ncrisis in confidence and do the right thing.\n  To be clear, I would prefer full public financing of campaigns that \nwould reduce spending and completely eliminate the link between special \ninterest money and candidates. I have long held that such a system is \nthe only true, comprehensive reform that would help restore the \nAmerican people's faith in our democracy and allow candidates to \ncompete on an equal footing where the merits of their ideas outweigh \nthe size of their pocketbook.\n  But as the problems in our system have escalated in recent years, so \ntoo has my despair over our failure to see real reforms enacted, not \njust debated. That is why I am here again to see that we take at least \na step toward achieving these much needed reforms. Senator Harkin's \namendment is one such step, and urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 155. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nHawaii (Mr. Akaka) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Delaware be added as a cosponsor of the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been prepared for 2 months now to \nhave this full debate and votes on amendments, and to actually get to a \nconclusion. Senator McCain and I have talked, and Senator McConnell and \nI have talked, and the agreement all along was that we would have \namendments, full debate for 2 weeks, and then we would go to a \nconclusion.\n  I assure the Senate that we are going to do that. We can do it \ntonight at a reasonable hour, we can do it at midnight, or Friday, \nSaturday, or Sunday. But I think we have a responsibility to complete \naction on this bill.\n  I hope the concern I have now that maybe amendments are going to \nstart multiplying when, in fact, there are no more than one or two \namendments that really are still critical that are out there to be \noffered and debated and voted on--maybe there are more. And I don't \nwant to demean any Senator's amendment, but we have been on this now \nfor the agreed-to almost 2 weeks. Anybody who thinks that by just \nbeginning to drag this out and coming up with more amendments, we will \ncarry it over until next week, that is not going to be the case.\n  Everybody has labored--sometimes with difficulty--to be fair with \neach other and give this thing a full airing and get some results, and \nyou can debate about whether they are good or bad as long as you want \nto. At some point, we have to vote and move on.\n  We have very serious problems in this country. We need to address \nthem. We have to pass a budget resolution. We have to take into \nconsideration the needs of the country in terms of funding for \nprograms, whether it is education, agriculture, defense, health care. \nWe need to take whatever actions we can to provide confidence and a \nboost in job security and the economy. We have an energy crisis that \nwill not go away. We need to get on to those issues.\n  Again, not to demean this issue at all--it is very important--but we \nwill have done what we promised to do, and now it is time we begin to \nlook for the conclusion and be prepared to move on to other issues next \nweek. I just wanted to remind Senators on both sides of our discussion \nand my commitment to follow up with the agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader, and I thank Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Dodd, who have managed this bill, I think, with \nefficiency and, I believe, in a total environment of cooperation.\n  But as we said all during last week, a couple times when we only had \ntwo or three amendments, we intended to be done by tonight or the end \nof this week. We have disposed of some. We will have an amendment that \nI think is very important that is about to be addressed soon. After \nthat, there are not any major issues. We should finalize this bill so \nthat we can move forward and none of us has to stay here over the \nweekend.\n  I want to say the majority leader is correct. We all agreed that we \ncould get this thing done in 2 weeks if we allowed the 2 weeks. So \nthere is no reason whatsoever that we should not enter into time \nagreements on specific amendments and a time for a final vote on this \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator McCain. That discussion was not just \nbetween Senator McCain and me, but also with the Democratic leader, \nSenator Feingold--we were all in the loop. We all had an understanding \nof how we would bring this to an eventual conclusion.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the distinguished majority leader, nobody \nmore\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\npassionately opposes this bill than I do, but I am prepared to move to \nfinal passage today. There is one important amendment left on \nnonseverability, which is about to be the pending business before the \nSenate.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, we may have a few sort of cats-and-\ndogs amendments, as Senator Dole used to call them, but we are \nbasically through on this side.\n  Mr. LOTT. Can I inquire of Senator Dodd, does he have any idea what \nmight be outstanding and when we can move to a conclusion on this \nlegislation?\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to, Mr. President. First of all, the past \nweek and a half has been a rather remarkable week and a half in the \nSenate. We have had very few quorum calls. I do not know the total \nnumber of amendments we have considered, but they have been extensive, \nback and forth.\n  I find it somewhat amusing that someone else's amendment is a cat or \na dog, but if it is your amendment, it is a profoundly significant \nproposal.\n  We dealt yesterday with the opposition's efforts to raise the hard \nnumber limits, and now a severability amendment from the opposition. \nThose are fundamentally important amendments but amendments that may \ntry to enhance and strengthen the bill from those who support the \nlegislation are a cat or a dog.\n  Our list has not expanded, I say to the majority leader. The list of \namendments is about the same as it has been. There are about 12 or 13 \namendments. There is a list of 21, which has been the consistent number \nfor the past week. We just dealt with one of them--Senator Harkin's--\nthis morning. It was laid down last night. Senator Bingaman, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Levin come to mind immediately. I \nthink Senator Clinton as well. These do not require much time.\n  We are prepared to move forward, I say to the majority leader, and if \nit takes going into tonight, going into tomorrow to finish it up, \nSaturday, or Sunday, whatever it takes, because I know we want to \nfinish the bill, we fully respect that. I support that.\n  I have an obligation--if I can complete this thought. There are those \non this side who support McCain-Feingold, and have for years, who have \nideas they think will enhance and strengthen this legislation. While \nthis is an important amendment we are about to consider, there are \nother amendments that should be heard.\n  I hope my colleagues will respect the rights of Members to offer \namendments and be heard on them. There certainly is no effort over here \nto delay this at all. We will stay here however long, I am told by the \nleadership. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader cannot be here at this \nmoment, but I am told he takes the position that if it takes being here \nall weekend, we will be here all weekend to complete it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want everybody to understand that I am prepared to do \nthat, too. Instead of that being a threat, it is a promise, No. 1, but \nNo. 2, it is to urge Senators to work with the managers to identify the \namendments we are going to have to consider, and if it can be done by \nvoice vote, let us get time agreements on them. We should be prepared \nto move to table, if that is what is required, too.\n  We have an opportunity to make progress and complete this bill. We \nare going to do that. I want to make sure everybody understands it, so \neverybody needs to start making plans, if we are going to have to stay \nhere Friday and Saturday, and take actions to allow that to happen.\n  Mr. DODD. A point, if I can, Mr. President. I am informed that we \nhave dealt with 24 amendments about equally divided; 24 left, I am \nsorry, both Democratic and Republican amendments.\n  I know, for instance, Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson have an \namendment, one of the outstanding amendments. Maybe it can be worked \nout. Senator Bingaman has one that has been worked out. It is important \nto note there is a good-faith effort obviously to complete this work, \nbut I do not want to see us put in a position now, having considered a \nlot of these amendments, that we are going to start telling people who \nhave had amendments pending--Senator Durbin has been on me and talking \nto me for the past 10 days about when can he bring his amendment up; \nalso Senator Harkin and Senator Levin.\n  I have been trying to orchestrate this the best I can, but I do not \nwant them put in the position of all of a sudden because we completed \nthe amendments the opponents of the legislation care the most about, \nthat we are going to deny or curtail in some way the rights of other \nSenators who care just as deeply about their proposals and not provide \nadequate time for them to be heard.\n  We are prepared to go forward. I know the next amendment is from \nSenator Frist on severability. I have a number of requests, I say to \nthe majority leader, from people who want to be heard on this \namendment. I know the proponents of the amendment do as well.\n  Mr. REID. Before the majority leader leaves the floor----\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I said this morning, I have been working trying to help \nSenator Dodd. One of my assignments has been to work with individual \nSenators. We have had people, as Senator Dodd indicated, who have been \nwaiting the entire 9 days we have been on this floor to offer \namendments. They come to me and Senator Dodd a couple times a day.\n  Looking at simple mathematics, I say to the majority leader, it is \ngoing to be really hard to do this. If we cut down the time by two-\nthirds, it is still going to get us into sometime tomorrow. If that is \nthe case, that is the case.\n  Senator Bingaman, Senator Durbin--these people want to offer their \namendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to Senator Reid, he always does good work, not just \nwith Senator Dodd but with this side, too. He is an ombudsman for us \nall. We do not want to cut off anybody, but all I am saying is we are \ngoing to complete this bill this week and everybody needs to know that. \nIf we go into Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, I only have one commitment, \nand I really did not want to do it anyway, so I will be delighted to \nstay here.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Is there some particular constituency in Mississippi the \nSenator wants to inform?\n  Mr. LOTT. Actually, it is in a State other than my home State.\n  Mr. DODD. I thought the majority leader might want to make that \nclarification. I think we are prepared now to go to the Frist \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 156\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for immediate consideration of my \namendment, which I believe is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself and Mr. \n     Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 156.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make certain provisions nonseverable, and to provide for \n expedited judicial review of any provision of, or amendment made by, \n                               this Act)\n\n       On page 37, strike lines 18 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if \n     any provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act, or \n     the application of a provision or amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder \n     of this Act and amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions and amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, shall not be affected by the holding.\n       (b) Nonseverability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If one of the provisions of, or amendments \n     made by, this Act that is described in paragraph (2), or if \n     the application of any such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, then \n     all the provisions and amendments described in paragraph (2) \n     shall be invalid.\n       (2) Nonseverable provisions.--A provision or amendment \n     described in this paragraph is a provision or amendment \n     contained in any of the following sections:\n       (A) Section 101, except for section 323(d) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971, as added by such section.\n       (B) Section 102.\n       (C) Section 103(b).\n       (D) Section 201.\n       (E) Section 203.\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Expedited review.--Any Member of Congress, candidate, \n     national committee of a political party, or any person \n     adversely affected by any provision of, or amendment made by, \n     this Act, or the application of such a provision or amendment \n     to any person or circumstance, may bring an action, in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground \n     that such provision or amendment violates the Constitution.\n       (2) Appeal to supreme court.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, any order of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia granting or denying an \n     injunction regarding, or finally disposing of, an action \n     brought under paragraph (1) shall be reviewable by appeal \n     directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. Any such \n     appeal shall be taken by a notice of appeal filed within 10 \n     calendar days after such order is entered; and the \n     jurisdictional statement shall be filed within 30 calendar \n     days after such order is entered.\n       (3) Expedited consideration.--It shall be the duty of the \n     District Court for the District of Columbia and the Supreme \n     Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to \n     expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \n     any matter brought under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Applicability.--This subsection shall apply only with \n     respect to any action filed under paragraph (1) not later \n     than 30 days after the effective date of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, can I have a copy of the amendment? We have \nnot seen the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is on its way. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the amendment which has \nbeen offered by myself and Senator Breaux that I believe gives us the \nopportunity--and I encourage my colleagues to pay attention to the \ndebate over the next 2 or 3 hours because it gives us the opportunity \nto assess where we are today in the bill, as amended, and to understand \nthe implications for each of us, for people who are interested in \nparticipating in the political process both today and also for years to \ncome.\n  I am going to refer back, again, to set the big picture and then \nupdate my colleagues, to a diagram that I believe is important. It is \nsimple, but sometimes when we look at all these lines, it is confusing, \nand that is the nature of the whole campaign finance apparatus. This \nchart summarizes that when you pull or push in one area, it has effects \nthroughout the system. It is very important because the issue we are \naddressing is what is called the nonseverability and the severability \nclause in the underlying McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Money flows into the system from the top of my chart down to the \nbottom. This is the political process. At the top of the chart is where \nmoney comes from, and it is all these blue lines. My colleagues do not \nneed to focus on what these blue lines are right now, but I do want \nthem to focus on the funnels, where this money is collected and where \nit goes.\n  As I said before, there are seven funnels, when one looks at all the \npolitical money that comes in and where it goes to affect free speech, \npolitical voice.\n  We have the individual candidate who can receive money from \nindividuals, and we will talk about what we did yesterday in increasing \nwhat I call the contribution limits in terms of the hard dollars, the \nFederal dollars.\n  There have been changes to the underlying McCain-Feingold bill that \nare very positive. What angers people the most is that the individual \ncandidate is losing his or her voice today. It might be a challenger; \nit might be an incumbent. Over time, because of the erosion from \ninflation on the one hand, without any adjustments in the Federal \ndollars of the hard dollars, but also the increasing influence, this is \nwhat angers the American people, the influence issue groups, special \ninterest groups have on the system, all of which, if it grows too much, \nwill overshadow and overwhelm the voice of the individual candidate.\n  They might be talking education, Medicare reform, military defense of \nthe country, but the issue group, the unions, the corporations right \nnow that have to disclose very little, because very little is regulated \nin this arena, have become increasingly powerful at the expense of the \nindividual candidate who is out there doing his or her best, traveling \nacross Tennessee or across any State in this country with a voice that \nno longer is being heard.\n  I say that because it is this relative balance that has gotten out of \nkilter. Members on both sides of the aisle have been doing their best \nto address this over the last 2 weeks.\n  Political action committees, we talked a little bit about that, as \nlong as we understand that corporations, unions, issue groups can all \nchannel money, political action groups, to the individual candidates.\n  The Democratic Party and the Republican Party are in this box on this \nchart, and we traditionally have been able to collect both Federal hard \ndollars and soft or non-Federal dollars. Again, it all has been \ndisclosed. Everything in the green on the chart is fully disclosed. You \ncan hold people accountable to that.\n  That is where the party system has worked. Our party system has \ntraditionally worked to accentuate or amplify the voice of the \nindividual candidate. You can see that the party hard money goes to the \nindividual candidate, the soft money subsequently will be used to \nreinforce that voice of the individual candidate.\n  It is very important to understand this role of the party has real \nvalue in a system today which has changed radically, which, \nunfortunately, has pulled the power away from the individual candidate \nover to the corporations, unions, the special issue groups, groups \ncreated specifically around an issue used to overpower the voice of the \nindividual candidate.\n  Again, this part of the chart--the party hard and party soft money, \nPACs, and individual candidates--has very little disclosure by \ncorporations, unions, issue groups--very little in terms of \naccountability or regulation.\n  What have we done? This is where we are today having not passed the \nunderlying bill as of yet. What have we done over the last 10 days of \nthe discussion? We have had good amendments today that have been \ndebated in a very thoughtful way. We saw the earlier chart with the \nfunnels still on the chart.\n  With the underlying McCain-Feingold and the amendments that have \npassed, we have the following:\n  Yesterday, we increased the contribution limits. We already had \ncontributions defined historically but we increased the hard dollar \nlimits for the individual candidates. We argued yesterday. Some people \nwere for, some were against, and a compromise was reached. We have to \npoint out the fact that the value of the individual contributions, even \nin what we approved yesterday, is not the same value we gave it in 1974 \nbecause it does not meet a correction for inflation. That was increased \nyesterday. That helps a little bit. Again, it is not up to 1974 \nstandards, but it helps to give more voice to the individual candidate. \nThat is why that is important. That is why you had the people who feel \nstrongest about reform coming forward saying, absolutely, on both sides \nof the aisle, we have to increase these limits that individual \ncandidates can receive.\n\n  Second, the underlying McCain-Feingold bill does something very \nimportant. I am spending time with this because we have to see that the \ncompromise achieved in McCain-Feingold has resulted in a balance. We \nhave to be very careful not to disrupt. Not us in the Senate. We have \nspoken on it through an amendment earlier this morning, but we had the \ncareful balance disrupted by the courts, resulting in a detrimental \nimpact on the overall system, which does the opposite of what we as \nelected officials want or the American people want--making the system \nworse.\n  No. 2, McCain-Feingold, as amended today, increased contribution \nlimits but takes out party soft money from individuals, through \ncorporations, unions, issue groups through sponsorships. All the soft \nmoney that comes to the parties is gone. That just about wipes out 50 \npercent of what the Republican Party, say, of the Senate, has, along \nwith the impact it can have. So it diminishes our voice perhaps 20 \npercent, perhaps 50 percent, perhaps 60 percent. Whatever our voice is \nnow, which, again, is fully disclosed, highly regulated, where we can \nbe held accountable, aimed at giving voice to the individual candidate, \nit, today, if McCain-Feingold passed, now is gone. Why? Because we have \neliminated the soft party money.\n  The third key point applying to our amendment, you can see we are \nwiping out the party soft money which gives\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nvoice to the individual candidate. The balancing act achieved in the \nunderlying McCain-Feingold bill is that, since we restricted speech, or \nwe rationed political discourse, or we have in some way put \nrestrictions on the use of resources that affect speech, you sure \nbetter do it out here as well. If you don't, I guarantee the money will \nkeep coming to the system, and the money instead of coming here will \nall flow to the area of least resistance. That is, the special interest \ngroups, the unions, the corporations.\n  It is not any more complicated than that, but I am building up to be \nable to answer why you have the nonseverability.\n  Now I have dollar signs indicated on this chart and I will come back \nto that. They don't mean anything in terms of overall quantity. \nQualitatively, you can see the individual candidate spends money, the \nparty spends money, the party soft money is gone under McCain-Feingold. \nThe restrictions put in for constitutional reasons are the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment; we voted on it earlier today.\n  Put restrictions on speech party soft money here, and you \ncounterbalance that with restricting speech or rationing speech or \nbasically saying 60 days before an election you can't engage fully in \npolitical speech under the Jeffords-Snowe provision.\n  It attempts to limit the role and influence of special interest \nversus candidates and parties through the electioneering provision. It \ndoesn't take care of direct mail, phone calls, or get out the vote. \nThat money can come over and include that, but the electioneering, the \nbroadcast provisions are of Snowe-Jeffords. I will come back to that.\n  The careful balance, achieved by a compromise, no question. As we \nhave gone through this process and as McCain-Feingold was developed in \nnegotiation, it is a compromise, trying to achieve balance. The \nunderlying bill tried to achieve balance and the two provisions we are \ntalking about today are underlying provisions. They are not amendments \nadded on, a poison pill, but two existing provisions we will link \ntogether in this narrow, highly targeted nonseverability clause. Those \nare linking party soft money with the Snowe-Jeffords provision.\n\n  McCain-Feingold has attempted to achieve balance by eliminating party \nsoft money and having the Snowe-Jeffords provision. That balance has \nbeen achieved as crafted by the authors in the original bill and not \naltered by amendments. That is very important because people will say \nwhat about the Wellstone amendment. That is not part of this. It is the \nunderlying provisions. McCain-Feingold is built on that basic \nunderstanding I have just outlined.\n  I argue that the last thing we want to do is upset that balance for \nthe reasons I said. We have the potential for opening the floodgates if \nwe allow party money to be eliminated and all of a sudden we remove, \nfor constitutional reasons or a court does later, the Snowe-Jeffords \namendment.\n  The next chart will show what would happen if all of a sudden we took \nthe restrictions off here and said Snowe-Jeffords is unconstitutional, \nthat is what the courts decided would happen. This is what, \npotentially, might happen if our amendment does not happen.\n  Again, this side of the chart is basically the same as McCain-\nFeingold. We have eliminated the party. As I have said, if you take the \nrestriction on speech, the Snowe-Jeffords restriction on speech, off, \nthe money is going to still come into the system and it can't go this \nway. It can't go to individual candidates because we have limits there, \nthe hard money limits. It has nowhere to go but to flow to the area of \nleast resistance, and the area of least resistance is corporations, \nunions, issue groups that all of a sudden have unregulated, no-limits, \nno-caps--for good constitutional reasons, I argue--and you can see the \ndollar signs. Ultimately, we do exactly what we don't want to do. We \nincrease the interest and the role and the power of the special \ninterests versus the individual candidates and the parties.\n\n  That is the impact. That is the big picture. I think that linkage is \ncritically important.\n  As to the specifics of the amendment, first of all, it addresses this \nbalance. Second, it is narrow, it is targeted, and it is focused. The \nmedia has been saying this is a poison pill because if you strike down \none part of McCain-Feingold the whole bill falls. That is wrong. That \nis false. This is narrow and targeted. It does not apply to the whole \nbill. It links just the two provisions, the Snowe-Jeffords provision \nwith the ban on soft money--nothing else. The linkage is for a good \nreason. It is because the impact on one has an impact on the other. \nThey are complementary; they are intertwined. That is why that \nnonseverability is absolutely critical to prevent the possibility of \nthis happening.\n  The nonseverability clause ties together just those two provisions \nand nothing else. When I say it is narrowly tailored, a narrowly \ntailored nonseverability clause, it is basically because everything \nelse will stand. If the Snowe-Jeffords provision is ruled to be \nunconstitutional and therefore the cap is released, the party soft \nmoney elimination will be invalid; again, coming back to the original \nbalance. Other provisions in the bill stand. It is just those two. The \nother provisions, which will not be affected by this nonseverability \nclause, are provisions such as the increased disclosure for party \ncommittees, the provision clarifying that the ban on foreign \ncontributions includes soft money, the clarification of the ban on \nraising political money on Federal Government property. All of that \nstands. We are talking about just these two provisions to which I have \nspoken.\n  The provisions on independent versus coordinated expenditures by \npolitical parties are unaffected by this amendment. The coordination \nprovisions of the bill, the portions of the bill such as tightening the \ndefinition of independent expenditures, the provisions providing \nincreased reporting of independent expenditures--again, all of these \nprovisions of the McCain-Feingold bill are not excluded as a part of \nour amendment today. It has to be one of the two provisions to which I \nhave spoken.\n  Another point I want to mention, and it will probably be talked about \nover the next couple of hours, is the fact that this narrowly targeted \nnonseverability clause also provides a process for expedited judicial \nreview of any court challenges to these two provisions. The purpose of \nthat clearly is that challenges--we don't want to be held up in court \nwith a lot of indecision over the years.\n  All this does, as part of this nonseverability clause, its purpose, \nis to provide that if the provisions of this legislation that restrict \nthe ever-louder voice of the issue ads--which, again, are poorly \ndisclosed and poorly regulated--are declared unconstitutional, just the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions, then the provision that weakens the voice of \nthe individual candidate and of the party would not be enforceable.\n  Simply put, sort of boiling it down: The person running for public \noffice will not be left out here defenseless, without any voice, if our \neffort in McCain-Feingold as the Snowe-Jeffords provision falls, if the \ncourts say no, we are going to take this cap off here--which clearly, \njust looking at the dollar signs, would put the individual candidates \nagain at a point where they are almost helpless as they are trying to \nmake their point.\n\n  The history of severability legislation I am sure we will go to. I \nwill not address that.\n  Let me answer one question because we were talking as if this were a \npoison pill because people bring in editorials saying this is a poison \npill. It is clear, a poison pill, to me, is if you give somebody a pill \nand they drop dead and they are gone. We are not adding a new entity or \nprovision to the bill. All we are doing is linking two provisions that \nare already in the bill. They are in the underlying McCain-Feingold \nbill. They are not amendments that have been added that are trying to \npoison the bill.\n  The only thing we are doing is working with two underlying provisions \nthat are already in the bill, saying they are inextricably linked and \nhave an impact one on the other.\n  Proponents of the bill--we heard it a lot this morning--told us time \nand time again that this is constitutional, Snowe-Jeffords is \nconstitutional, the ban on party soft money is constitutional. If \npeople really believe that, I think proponents of the bill have nothing \nto fear by this linkage in our nonseverability proposal.\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\n  As we look at what I have presented, we should take this opportunity \nto look realistically at what is happening in campaigns and campaign \nfinance reform: The sources of money, how it is being spent, whether or \nnot it is disclosed, and where the money is going. In all this we need \nto make absolutely sure we do not muffle the voices and diminish that \nrole of the individual candidates out there while increasing the role \nof the special interests or the unions or the corporations.\n  I hope all my colleagues will study this particular amendment, will \ncarefully consider this balanced and narrowly tailored amendment that \naddresses what I believe is a critical, critical issue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Frist, who has done his usual excellent job in laying out his \ncase. I think the concern that is being expressed is a valid concern, \nin that we need to keep in mind the totality of the system as we are \naddressing this issue. That is one of the things that makes me feel \ngood about what happened yesterday, because I think that is exactly \nwhat we were doing.\n  If we, for example, had lost Snowe-Jeffords somewhere along the way \nand just had a soft money ban without any increases in the hard money \nlimit, I think the potential problem that my colleague expressed would \nreally have been a significant one. I do not think that practical \nproblem exists nearly as much as we feared, because even under a worst \ncase scenario, if the disclosure and other provisions of the Snowe-\nJeffords even were to fall and we lost soft money in the system--which \nI think would be a good happening--we have increases in the hard money \nlimit. We have now doubled, under the original bill--we have doubled \nthe amount of money the candidate can have for his own campaign, $1,000 \nto $2,000; $4,000 in a primary, $4,000 in a general election. We have \nalso increased the amount of money that can go to parties.\n  We did not increase it as much as I would like, but we increased it. \nWe also increased the aggregate amount. We also increased and doubled \nthe amount that parties can give to the candidates. We indexed all of \nit.\n  It is not that we are not in the same position we were when McCain-\nFeingold started. We have taken some significant steps in order to get \nsome legitimate, controlled, limited, hard money into the hands of \ncandidates and into the hands of parties that they didn't have when \nthis debate began.\n  The problem that is being addressed today is one of the very kinds of \nthings we were trying to address yesterday. I think this body \neffectively and overwhelmingly addressed it in the compromise amendment \nthat we have. The proponents of the current amendment for \nnonseverability, however, make the case that we shouldn't risk the \nsituation where the soft money limitations or abolitions and the Snowe-\nJeffords requirements with regard to unions, corporations, and others \nwould be struck down; that there would be an imbalance. My first point \nis that we corrected and I think significantly corrected that imbalance \nyesterday.\n  My second point would be that it is not exactly as if Snowe-Jeffords \nwere some kind of a major happening in terms of the overall picture of \nany given campaign. In the first place, none of it kicks in 60 days \nbefore an election. So anything goes up until 60 days. Part of Snowe-\nJeffords is simply a disclosure requirement. It doesn't have anything \nto do with money. A part of Snowe-Jeffords has to do with corporations \nand unions within the last 60 days and their expenditures, and that is \na money situation.\n  Let's say that was knocked out, hypothetically. We are all talking \nhypothetically because obviously none of us knows what a court will do. \nWe have argued the constitutionality of Snowe-Jeffords in the past. For \nthe moment, let's hypothetically say that a 60-day restriction with \nregard to what corporations and unions could do, and nobody else--no \nindividuals, as Senator Wellstone pointed out, for example--is a part \nof this. I compliment my friend for narrowly tailoring this legislation \nso we didn't have to deal with all of that. But that is knocked out.\n  Then we are knocking out some corporate and union money in the last \n60 days of the campaign. That is not insignificant. But I am not sure, \nin the total context of things, that it is all that important. It \ncertainly doesn't justify doing what we may be doing here in terms of \nnonseverability.\n  The first thing we need to understand about nonseverability and \nCongress passing a bill with a nonseverability provision in this is \nthat it is extremely rare. It is rarely done. We asked the \nCongressional Research Service about it. Their information is that \nthere have been 10 bills introduced or considered in the last 12 years \nthat have had a nonseverability provision in them. They further say \nthat there has only been one bill in the last 12 years where we have \npassed legislation that contained a nonseverability clause. It is \nextremely rare in the thousands of bills that passed during that period \nof time of 12 years. I said: How many public laws were there? They said \n12,962. Out of 12,962 pieces of legislation, only 1 of them contained a \nnonseverability clause.\n  That is some indication of the rarity and the significance of what we \nare doing here today, or what is being suggested that we do.\n  There was a principle established a long time ago in this country \nthat is honored by Congress and is recognized by the judiciary--that in \na piece of legislation, which more likely than not will contain several \nprovisions, you can have some parts of it that are constitutional and \nmaybe one part that is not. Strike the unconstitutional part, says the \nCourt, and leave the rest intact.\n\n  That is the normal way we have handled things in this country. It is \nbased upon a concept that I think all of us honor and adhere and we \ntalk a lot about. That is the concept of judicial restraint. We have \nrecognized in this country for a long time--and our courts have \nrecognized for a long time--that they should exercise judicial \nrestraint and make constitutional rulings only when necessary. The \ncourts have adopted their own rulings that militate in that direction \nand cause them not to go off and even consider constitutional issues \nunless they really have to. It is for the reasons that I explained: \nBecause of the concept of restraint and the benefit we get as a country \nand that the judiciary gets for adopting judicial restraint, not \nreaching out to take on more than it should and look for opportunities \nto strike down laws when they are not even really directly presented to \nthem, and so forth.\n  I think the Court said it very well in the case of Regan v. Time, \nInc., with the Supreme Court plurality decision in 1984. This is a \nlittle long, but I think it is important because it gets to the heart \nof what I am saying.\n  The Court said:\n\n       In exercising its power to review the constitutionality of \n     a legislative act, a Federal court should act cautiously. A \n     ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the \n     elected representatives of people. Therefore, a court should \n     refrain from invalidating more of the statute than is \n     necessary. As this court has observed, whenever an act of \n     Congress contains unobjectionable provisions separable from \n     those found to be unconstitutional, it is the duty of this \n     court to so declare and maintain the act insofar as it is \n     valid. Thus, this court has upheld the constitutionality of \n     some provisions of a statute even though other provisions of \n     a statute were unconstitutional. For the same reasons, we \n     have often refused to resolve the constitutionality of a \n     particular provision of a statute when the constitutionality \n     of a separate controlling provision has been upheld.\n\n  I think that states it very well. In summary, I think it has been the \nlaw and the practice of the United States for many years. It is a valid \none. I think we would all agree that it is a valid one.\n  Those are the circumstances. No. 1, the extreme rarity of the \nsituation; No. 2, these longstanding principles that our judiciary has. \nThose are the foundation blocks as we approach this issue this time as \na Congress.\n  What will be the legal effects of a nonseverability clause? Not only \nhas Congress not legislated a nonseverability clause once in the last \n12 years, but there are no cases ever in the history of the country \nwhere Federal courts have been called upon to construe a \nnonseverability clause.\n  We really are in uncharted waters here in terms of how such a clause\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nmight be interpreted. I fear we are getting into an area of unknown \nconsequences, and potential perversive results that we don't fully \nappreciate.\n\n  What will be the probable result? As you think it through, you can \nsee situations very readily that are going to produce perplexities, \nshall we say, that maybe we can resolve here on the floor--I don't \nknow--and determine what intent the proponents have with regard to this \namendment.\n  Article III of our Constitution says there must be a case in \ncontroversy before a person can bring a lawsuit, have it upheld. Any \nlaw professors out there, forgive me for my shorthand as I go through \nthis. I want to touch on the general principles, and I hope I get them \nright.\n  If you are a litigant, someone challenging this act, you have to have \nstanding. There is a criminal aspect to this statute; if you are a \ncriminal and you are convicted, you have standing. As far as the civil \naspects of it are concerned, in any kind of a situation, you have to \nhave a case in controversy, and you have to have standing.\n  That means you have to be injured directly by the provision you are \ndealing with or have been convicted of. If the statute is in force, you \nwill be injured, if you sustained injury or you face imminent injury, \nsomething like that, not just a general public kind of a potential \ninjury. There was a case back in 1974 where some concerned citizens got \ntogether and sued the CIA because they were not disclosing their \nbudget. The courts held that your interests are not any different from \nany other citizen. You have no standing in this lawsuit.\n  That little background has relevance because someone challenging \nthese two provisions will refer to them as the soft money provision and \nthe Snowe-Jeffords provision of the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I request an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield an additional 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It has to do with how the cases would come up. If \nsomeone, let's say, was convicted under the soft money provision--in \nother words, somebody sent some soft money to somebody they weren't \nsupposed to after this law was passed, and they got caught doing that \nand they got charged with and got convicted of it, if you had \nseverability, then that person would clearly have standing with regard \nto the soft money provision they were convicted of. That is all that \nwould be at issue.\n  Presumably, if you had nonseverability the way that the proponents of \nthis amendment would suggest, that person who is affected by the soft \nmoney provision that he is convicted of, presumably he could also \nchallenge the Snowe-Jeffords part of the bill that has no relevance to \nhim. If so, are we telling the Court, by means of this amendment, to \ngive standing to this person to challenge Snowe-Jeffords when they are \nnot affected by Snowe-Jeffords? If so, we are running afoul of article \nIII because the Congress cannot give people substantive jurisdiction or \ngrant constitutional standing for anyone such as that. If we were \ntrying to do that, we certainly would not be exercising judicial \nrestraint.\n  During the course of this debate, I hope we can agree on what we are \ntrying to do by means of this amendment. Do we want to be able to allow \nsomeone who is affected by one provision to be able to challenge the \nother provision? That is the question. If the answer to that is, yes, \nthen we can talk about the constitutional implications of that. If the \nanswer to that is, no, that they can only challenge the provision they \nare affected by, then what about a fellow who is convicted under the \nsoft money provisions, which is held to be constitutional? He goes to \njail. Another person comes along, he is sued under the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovision. That is held to be unconstitutional, which wipes out the \nentire legislation, under this amendment.\n\n  So you have the first individual sitting in jail for a period of time \nunder an act that has been declared unconstitutional. Is that what we \ndesire to do?\n  It is not as easy as it seems. That is one of the reasons Congress \nhas never passed such a law as is being suggested that would allow this \nparticular result. There has never been a Federal case on this subject. \nThere have been a few lower court Federal cases deciding State law. \nSurprisingly, in some of those cases, in interpreting nonseverability \nprovisions, they have ignored them.\n  I say to my friends, even if this nonseverability provision passes, \nwhich I hope it does not, there is a good chance the Court would ignore \nit. And, if not a good chance, depending on how it is interpreted as to \nwhat Congress' intent is, that it will be declared unconstitutional.\n  For reasons set forth in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, a 1992 \nSupreme Court case, the Court made this statement:\n\n       Whether the courts were to act on their own or at the \n     invitation of Congress in ignoring the concrete injury \n     requirement described in our cases, they would be discarding \n     a principal fundamental to the separate and distinct \n     constitutional role of the third branch. One of the essential \n     elements that identifies these cases in controversy is that \n     they are the business of the courts rather than the political \n     branches.\n\n  In other words, Congress, you can't tell us what is a case in \ncontroversy. You can't tell us that there is a case in controversy out \nthere or that a person has standing in a case when he really doesn't. \nThat is for us to decide. If you are attempting to intrude, you are \nviolating the doctrine of separation of powers.\n  I hope my colleagues will not view this amendment favorably. It would \nbe not only a reflection on us, but it wouldn't do the judiciary any \ngood. We are in danger, if we pass this amendment, in one fell swoop, \nof doing something that would be hurtful to two branches of our \nGovernment: the legislative branch and the judicial branch--the \nlegislative branch, us, because after all these years, after 25 years \nwe finally get around to addressing this issue, after going through and \nagreeing or disagreeing, but let's say agreeing on some fundamental \nprinciples that we believe ought to be passed, at the same time, in \nsome cases supporting amendments which, in my estimation, pretty \nclearly have constitutional problems. I don't think that reflects well \non us in what we ought to be doing and how we ought to be doing it. It \ndoesn't reflect well on us when we threaten judicial independence or \njudicial restraint.\n  There are some broader principles involved. Those principles are \ninvolved here. So while I appreciate the concern that has been \nexpressed in terms of balance, in terms of the need for balance--and we \nsaw part of that yesterday--the portion of Snowe-Jeffords that deals \nwith money is a fairly limited segment: Never done this before; \ntreading in uncharted waters; trying to accomplish things we probably \ncannot, in the end, do.\n\n  For all those reasons, I will respectfully urge defeat of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will turn to my colleague from Utah in a \nminute. First, I will take a moment to respond on our time to at least \ntwo of the comments made. It will take just a second.\n  I appreciate the comments that have been made. The first statement \nmade was about the relative importance of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. \nI think it is important because my whole argument is based on this \nbalance of the linkage, the tie between the two. How important is \nSnowe-Jeffords--the significance of not being able to go on the air 60 \ndays prior to an election. We should not underestimate that because, \nreally, it is the balance between giving the candidate voice and the \nspecial interest voice.\n  Our whole argument is if you are going to take voice away from one, \nyou ought to take voice away from the other. If you are going to give \none voice, give the other voice. I point out that Snowe-Jeffords is \nvery important, and that is why we are targeting it in this narrowly \ntargeted amendment. If you just look at special interests, which is in \nred on this chart, versus party ads, the issue ads, I think, disturb a \nlot of people. I can't say that all of these ads were in the last 60 \ndays, but anybody who has watched campaigns knows it is really in the \nlast 2\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\nweeks of most of these campaigns, not 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 \nweeks. The Snowe-Jeffords provision is 60 days. This is just to show \nthat Snowe-Jeffords is critically important, and if we disrupt Snowe-\nJeffords, get rid of that limitation on free speech, there will be an \ninfusion of money even greater than today. The special interest ads--\nagain, the ads that Snowe-Jeffords is directed at--amounted to about \n$347 million in the campaigns we just finished.\n\n  The party ad money, which is predominantly soft money, non-Federal \nmoney, was only $162 million. What we are basically saying is that if \nyou are going to take off the restriction of Snowe-Jeffords and you are \ngoing to allow this money to come flowing into the system, the least we \ncan do for the candidate out there is to allow the party to participate \nwithout unilaterally being challenged and overrun by special interests. \nSo Snowe-Jeffords is critical.\n  No. 2--and other people will comment on this--nonseverability may be \nrare, I guess, in the big scheme of things, but it has been done a \nlot--in fact, three times on campaign finance reform, where you do \nbring people together and you have this rich interaction. Three times \nwe voted for nonseverability clauses on this floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not only is the Senator correct that the last three \ncampaign finance reform bills that cleared the Senate had \nnonseverability clauses in them, the amendment we voted on a few \nmoments ago--the Harkin amendment, which was supported by 31 colleagues \non the other side of the aisle--had a nonseverability clause in it. In \nfact, the Senator from Tennessee is entirely correct.\n  When the subject turns to the first amendment and to the \nconstitutional rights of Americans in these kinds of bills, it is the \nexception not to have a nonseverability clause in it. I am sure the \nother Senator from Tennessee was not suggesting that nobody would have \nstanding to bring a case affecting so many different people's \nconstitutional rights. I am confident, I say to my friend, the junior \nSenator from Tennessee, there will be some Americans who will have a \nstanding to bring a suit against this case. I will be leading them. I \nthank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the distinguished Senator from Kentucky for his \ncomments.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was interested to hear Senator Thompson \nsay we are in uncharted waters, facing unknown results that we don't \nfully appreciate. That is the theme of my comments.\n  I go back to another philosopher, Mark Twain. I can't quote him \nexactly, but he has been quoted as saying something to the effect that \n``prophecy is a very iffy profession, particularly with respect to the \nfuture.'' That is where we are. We are all trying to divine what is \ngoing to happen in the future if McCain-Feingold passes, as I expect it \nwill, and if it should be signed and upheld by the Supreme Court. What \nwould we face?\n  Well, I read in the popular press that on the Democratic side, one of \ntheir leading campaign attorneys is telling them if McCain-Feingold \npasses, the Democrats can kiss goodbye any chance of gaining control in \nthe Senate in the 2002 election. That should cause everybody on this \nside of the aisle to stampede and vote for it. However, there is an \nequally qualified observer who has spoken to our Members and has said \nif McCain-Feingold passes, the Republican Party will go into the \nminority and stay there for 25 years.\n  Now, obviously, one or the other of these has to be wrong in terms of \nwhat is going to happen at the election. But neither one of these \nobservers is an unqualified observer. The reason they have come to \nthese two differing conclusions is that each one is looking at this \nissue through the prism of his own self-interest. If the Democratic \ncampaign lawyer sees the destruction of the Democratic Party and the \nRepublican campaign consultant sees the destruction of the Republican \nParty, I submit to you, as murky as our crystal ball may be, the \nchances are that they are both right--that we are going to see, as a \nresult of the passage of this bill, not the destruction of the party--I \nwon't go to that extent, but certainly a dramatic diminution of party \ninfluence in politics in this country.\n\n  One very practical example that we can expect is the scaling down, if \nnot the elimination, of party conventions because party conventions now \nare financed entirely with soft money which, under this bill, would \nbecome illegal. So we may see party conventions disappear altogether, \nor we may see them become very truncated affairs, which the media may \ndecide is not worth covering. This would be good news for an incumbent \nPresident. This would be bad news for a challenger trying to prevent a \nPresident from seeking a second term. He would be denied the \nopportunity of exposure that comes from a party convention.\n  One of the things we will not see as a result of the passage of \nMcCain-Feingold is the elimination of corruption in politics. \nCorruption comes from the heart of the receiver, not the wallet of the \ngiver. If an individual is corrupt, he is going to stay corrupt, \nwhether or not the ``speech police'' are watching him. He is going to \nfind some way to remain corrupt and to game the system to his \nadvantage. The person of integrity is going to remain a person of \nintegrity, regardless of how many people come waving bills at him to \ntry to get him to change his position solely on the basis of money.\n  Integrity and corruption does not come as a result of participation \nin the political process. Integrity and corruption come from the way \nyou were raised, from the way you make your decisions, from the hard \ncommitments you make along the way in life.\n  There are corrupt people in entertainment and there are people of \nintegrity in entertainment. There are corrupt people in the media and \nthere are people of integrity in the media. There are corrupt people in \npolitics and there are people of integrity in politics, and they will \nnot change on either side just because we pass a bill. So that is the \none prediction of which I can be confident. On these others, we are \nguessing.\n  I let my imagination run. If the political conventions disappear or \nbecome seriously truncated as a result of the passage of this bill, and \nif I were a special interest group with an unlimited wallet, I would \nanticipate holding a major convention of my own and invite certain \nfavored speakers. I would gear it in such a way as to get maximum media \nattention, and those speakers could then get media attention that would \ncome out of attending that convention.\n  I do believe that we are going to see an increase in political \nspending of soft dollars on the part of special interest groups in \ndifferent and inventive ways that we at the moment cannot anticipate. \nOnce again, in the newspaper there is a story of a fundraiser. He \nsigned it himself. He said: Those of us on K Street are already \nfiguring out ways to get around McCain-Feingold and use our soft \ndollars in a fashion to influence the political situation.\n  We are going to see, I am sure, an increase in Harry and Louise kind \nof advertising. Those of us who were on the floor through the debate on \nPresident Clinton's health care plan know how powerful those soft \ndollars were. We know how many those soft dollars were, and we know how \ntotally outside the ambit of McCain-Feingold those soft dollars were. \nIf McCain-Feingold says you cannot give those soft dollars to a party \nto pay its light bill, well, OK, we will give the soft dollars to \nMadison Avenue to influence politics in other ways.\n  One of the other ways the parties are going to be seriously \ndisadvantaged by this bill is in candidate recruitment. Senator Frist \nis the chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. When \nhe goes out and tries to convince a reluctant candidate to challenge a \nDemocratic incumbent, one of the first things that candidate says is: \nIf I do this, will you be there for me? Senator Frist can say now: Yes, \nwe will commit X amount of activity in your behalf. Please, come do \nthis. Do this for the party. Do this for your country. Come do it, and \nwe will be behind you.\n  Senator McConnell has already laid out the financial implications of \nMcCain-Feingold in terms of the\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\namount of money that would be available to the senatorial committee if \nwe had nothing but hard dollars based on actual experience. As Senator \nFrist goes out to recruit candidates, or as Senator Murray goes out to \nrecruit candidates on the other side, she is going to find her ability \nto attract candidates into this situation will be severely reduced.\n  The ultimate answer is: We want you to run, but when it comes to \nfinancial support, you are on your own; you are not going to get any \nsignificant help from the national party in any way because we simply \ncannot do it. We have to use our hard dollars for things for which we \nused to use soft money. We simply are not going to have the resources \nthat we would like to have to help you. We will see many outstanding \ncandidates decide they do not want to run under those circumstances.\n  Make no mistake about it, those in the press gallery who have been \ntalking about the present system being an incumbent protection act, \nwait until we pass McCain-Feingold and I guarantee you an incumbent \nwill really have to foul his nest in order to lose. This virtually \nguarantees that no challenger of any consequence will be able to raise \nthe money and produce the organization to take on an entrenched \nincumbent because the restrictions are so severe that they will not be \nable to do that.\n  What does this have to do with the amendment? Simply this: At least \nas a result of the Wellstone amendment for which I voted, there is a \ndegree of equal damage to the special interest groups. With the \nWellstone amendment in the bill, the bill does not unilaterally damage \nparties and leave special interest groups totally free. Oh, it does \nleave special interest groups huge loopholes, but it at least, on the \nadvertising phase, says the special interest groups have the same kinds \nof problems as the parties.\n  People said to me: Why in the world did you vote for the Wellstone \namendment when it is clearly unconstitutional? I voted for it with my \neyes wide open. I believe it is unconstitutional. I believe the other \nparts of the bill that it seeks equality for are equally \nunconstitutional. But I thought if the time should come, through some \ndark miracle, that McCain-Feingold survives the White House, the \nSupreme Court, and gets into the public stream, I do not want the \nloophole that the Wellstone amendment closed to stay open. If they are \ngoing to find some of it unconstitutional, I want them to find all of \nit unconstitutional. I want that loophole plugged.\n\n  If, indeed, we have the circumstance before the Court where the Court \nsays the Wellstone amendment is unconstitutional, so the special \ninterest groups are off the hook, but all of the corresponding \npressures on parties are constitutional so that parties are under this \nkind of restriction, we are going to see a distortion in the political \nworld that none of us is going to like.\n  I am supporting this amendment that says if the Supreme Court says, \nOK, we are going to strike down the Wellstone amendment as \nunconstitutional, as I hope they do, then we are going to strike down \nall the rest of it as unconstitutional because it all goes together, it \nfits together; it is a legitimate pattern.\n  I happen to think it is a total pattern of the violation of the first \namendment. I have said before I think if James Madison were alive, he \nwould be appalled at the debate, let alone the outcome. I have been \nridiculed for that by members of the press who somehow think it is kind \nof funny to talk about the Founding Fathers, but I still believe the \nFederalist Papers are the best guide we can have as to how we make \npublic policies around here.\n  As we look into our crystal balls, murky as they may be, we have to \ntry to understand what the consequences will be if this bill passes and \nbecomes law. I think the consequences are as I have stated: Parties \nwill be seriously disadvantaged, special interest groups will be \nadvantaged. But I do not want that to be done by the Supreme Court. I \nwant the Supreme Court to tell us, all or nothing.\n  If the Supreme Court says an intrusion on first amendment rights is \nlegitimate when you are dealing with political parties, then that \nintrusion ought to be legitimate when you are dealing with special \ninterest groups. If, on the other hand, they say, no, the first \namendment is so precious that we are going to leave it alone as far as \nspecial interest groups are concerned, why should they not then be \nrequired to say, we will leave it alone with respect to political \nparties?\n  Since when did the Constitution make a difference between the way \npeople assemble themselves in their right of assembly and their right \nto petition and say: If you assemble yourselves in your right of \nassembly and right to petition in a political party, we are going to \ntreat you one way, but if you assemble yourselves in your right to \nassemble and right to petition in a special interest group, we are \ngoing to treat you a different way?\n  The possibility exists that might happen if this amendment is \nadopted. If this amendment is adopted, then the Supreme Court will have \nto make the fundamental decision: Are they going to amend the first \namendment by upholding McCain-Feingold, or are they not?\n  If they decide they are not, then they are not across the board. They \ncannot do it selectively. To me, that is the kind of outcome with which \nHamilton, Madison, and John Jay would all agree. I make no apologies \nfor calling them to this argument because I think this argument \nfundamentally is about the preservation of their handiwork which all of \nus in this Chamber have taken an oath to uphold and defend.\n\n  I do not take that oath lightly. I know my fellow Senators do not \ntake that oath lightly. We should talk about it in those terms. I plead \nwith my colleagues to think in those terms and, therefore, to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the American people have had an incredible civics \nlesson these past few months. No novelist, no playwright, no movie \ndirector--not even the creator of the X-Files--could have dreamed up a \nmore intricate, a more convoluted, or more fantastic plot than the one \nplayed out in our national political arena in last year's Presidential \nelection.\n  For weeks on end, it seemed there was only one topic of conversation: \nWho won the election? And that conversation focused on some of the most \narcane aspects of constitutional law.\n  What if Florida cannot send a slate of electors to the electoral \ncollege? What if they send two slates? Are contested elections a State \nor a national issue? Or for that matter, a county by county issue? Who \nultimately decides the results of a disputed election? Congress? The \nFlorida Supreme Court? Federal district court? The Supreme Court? What \nabout the vote of the people? Doesn't that count?\n  Woven through every one of these questions is a crucial feature of \nour American style of democracy--the separation of powers. This is \nperhaps our Nation's most critical feature, our backbone, if you will.\n  For without a clear cut separation of powers--a separation between \nthe Federal branches of Government, and between the Federal Government \nand the States--our system of Government founders and fails.\n  Prior to the creation of the Federal courts, Alexander Hamilton \nenvisioned in Federalist No. 78 that ``the judiciary is beyond \ncomparison the weakest of the three departments of power.'' Given the \nrecent role the Supreme Court played in last November's Presidential \nelection, Alexander Hamilton's vision was wrong.\n  Our delicate balance of power has tipped in favor of nine justices \nthat have the power to legislate from the bench and have now elevated \nthe Court as the most powerful of the three ``departments of power.''\n  Commenting on the Supreme Court's role in picking the President, \nLaurence Tribe noted that the Justices were ``driven by something other \nthan what was visible on the face of the opinions.''\n  We will continue to ponder whether the Court's decision was derived \nfrom established legal and constitutional principles. Or whether the \nCourt was ``results oriented'' and searched for a\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nrationale to substantiate a decision more political than legal.\n  In our Government this question of the separation of powers never \ngoes away. It is here before us today, in this bill, with this \namendment, with the issue of campaign finance reform. Specifically, it \nconfronts us with the issues of severability and nonseverability.\n  When the Congress of the United States creates a new law of the land, \nhow difficult should it be for another branch of Government to strike \nit down?\n  For the executive branch of Government, the answer has always been \nclear. The President can veto any law we pass. Congress can override a \nPresidential veto with a two-thirds majority in each house. The balance \nof power between Congress and the executive branch is part of our \nnational strength.\n  But what of the balance of power between Congress and the Judiciary?\n  Federal courts have the authority to decide on the constitutional \nlegitimacy of the laws passed by Congress, and to dispose of any \nprovisions of the law they find unconstitutional. It is an ultimate \nauthority dating back to Marbury v. Madison. If the Supreme Court \ndeclares a provision of law to be unconstitutional, it is conclusive.\n  Short of changing the Constitution itself, a step we have taken only \n17 times since the passage of the Bill of Rights, there are no options. \nA finding of unconstitutionality by the Supreme Court effectively voids \ncongressional and Presidential action. This, too, is a vital part of \nthe balance of powers. And I respect it.\n  The nonseverability amendment would alter, even if only slightly, the \nbalance of power between the legislature and the judiciary. Is this a \nwise change to make?\n  I have been grappling with this question these past few days. And \ngrappling, as well, with some of the profound and, I must say, \nunsettling changes that have occurred at the Supreme Court in recent \nyears.\n  My perception and I confess this is my own, of where the Court is \ntoday, and the direction in which it is heading, will carry great \nweight in my ultimate decision about the nonseverability issue.\n  A law professor at New York University wrote an interesting article \non this very topic a few weeks back in the New York Times. The author's \nname is Larry Kramer, and his article, which could hardly be more to \nthe point, was titled ``The Supreme Court v. Balance of Powers.''\n  His main point, which I think he makes quite convincingly, is that:\n\n     the current Supreme Court has a definite political agenda--\n     one devoted chiefly to reallocating governmental power in \n     ways that suit the views of its conservative majority. . . .\n       For nearly a decade, the court's five conservative justices \n     have steadily usurped the power to govern by striking down or \n     weakening federal and state laws regulating issues as varied \n     as gun sales, the environment and patents--as well as laws \n     protecting women and . . . the disabled.\n\n  Many of the Supreme Court's recent decisions have indeed been made by \nthe conservative majority. Decisions are often carried on the basis of \na single vote. Age discrimination--five to four. Gay rights--five to \nfour. Warrantless police searches--five to four. The Federal role in \ndeath penalty cases--five to four. And of course, the selection of the \n43rd President of the United States--five to four.\n  Justice John Paul Stevens, in his dissenting opinion to this last \ndecision, said:\n\n       Although we may never know with complete certainty the \n     identity of the winner of this year's Presidential election, \n     the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the \n     nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of \n     the law.\n\n  This is my own starting point for reflecting on the nonseverability \nquestion. I agree with Justice Stevens. My confidence in the \nimpartiality of the Supreme Court has been shaken. The American \njudicial system has been increasingly politicized. Politicized by the \nunseemly rejection by the Senate of qualified nominees to the Federal \nbench. Politicized by the recent decision by the White House to end the \nhalf century involvement of the American Bar Association in reviewing \nthe qualifications of potential nominees to the Federal bench--a \ntradition that dates back to the Eisenhower administration.\n  With that as context--recognizing that for many the impartiality of \nthe Supreme Court is being called into question--I return to the \nquestion of nonseverability. Is this a Supreme Court to whom we want to \nhand over the absolute authority to rewrite whatever campaign finance \nreform measure ultimately is enacted by Congress?\n  I am not enamored by the idea of granting to the Court--particularly \nthis Court--such authority. Maintaining severability denies them the \nopportunity to sink the entire law on the basis of the \nconstitutionality of one provision.\n  At the same time, I am not enamored by the prospect of allowing this \nSupreme Court to selectively dismantle our campaign finance reform \nmeasures, picking and choosing among the different provisions to find \nones that suit their visions of reform, and rejecting the rest.\n  The last time we tried this in Congress and sent the law across the \nstreet, it had a pretty disastrous outcome. The Supreme Court at that \ntime decided they would limit how we raise money for campaigns. They \nwould not limit, as Congress wanted to, the ultimate amount of money \nspent on campaigns, and then they came in with a decision in Buckley v. \nValeo in 1976 and said, incidentally, millionaires in America, when it \ncomes to campaign financing, are above the law. Now that preposterous \noutcome was rationalized by them and has been capitalized on by \ncandidates since.\n  Campaign finance activist Ben Senturia compared the Buckley decision \nby the Court relating to campaign finance reform to that of a large \ntree in the middle of a ball field. The game can still be played, he \nsays, but it has to be played around the tree.\n  Despite my serious misgivings about this Supreme Court, the \nopportunity severability will give it to move beyond the role of \nconstitutional arbiter, to actually craft their vision of campaign \nfinance reform, I will vote against the Frist amendment for three \nreasons.\n  First, for the good of our Nation, the strength of our Government, \nand the future of the Court, I must still retain the faith and the hope \nthat the Supreme Court will rise above any political consideration to \njudge this law on its constitutional merits.\n  Second, taking my misgivings about the distribution of the Court to \ntheir logical conclusion, Congress would have to raise this matter on \nevery legislative issue we face. That would invite confrontation and \nchaos that would not serve our Nation.\n  Third and finally, I have supported McCain-Feingold and campaign \nfinance reform from the start. I am prepared to set aside my heartfelt \nconcerns over the issue of severability rather than jeopardizing this \ngood-faith effort to clean up the tawdry campaign climate in America.\n  I support the severability provision in this bill and oppose the \nFrist amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves the \nfloor, I express my personal appreciation for his speech. I say that, \nrecognizing that he and I have been in Congress the same length of \ntime. We came together to the House of Representatives. During that \nperiod of time, I have gotten to know him well and I recognize his \nhistory as being a real legislator, a parliamentarian as he was in the \nState of Illinois.\n  This debate has been a very good debate. During the past couple of \nweeks, we have had some very fine presentations made. But when we look \nback on the presentations made, there will not be any better than the \none just made by the Senator from Illinois. Not only did he deliver it \nwell, as he always does, the Senator from Illinois has no peer, in my \nestimation, as someone able to present facts. But here, not only did he \ndo a great job in his delivery, the substance of what he said is really \nmeaningful.\n  For someone such as me who struggled with this issue of severability, \nhe certainly laid the foundation, in effect poured the cement. I have \nno question the Senator from Illinois is right on this issue. I am \npersonally very grateful for having been present to listen to this \nbrilliant presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me join in the comments the Senator \nfrom Nevada made about the presentation of the Senator from Illinois. I \nknow he thought long and hard about this. I am grateful, not only for \nhis decision on this but also for the rationale and presentation he \nmade. I thank him for it.\n  I appreciate very much the way the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, kicked off the debate on our side. He made some very powerful \npoints about how this issue of severability and nonseverability relates \nto the separation of powers and issues of judicial restraint. What I \nwould like to do is use my time to talk about what this means for our \neffort to do something about the campaign financing system in our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is being asked to agree to an amendment \nthat would make two provisions of this bill ``nonseverable'' from one \nanother. What does ``nonseverable'' mean? What does it mean for this \nbill? And what does this vote mean for the cause of reform?\n  My friend John McCain has said that nonseverability is French for \n``kill campaign finance reform.'' That is a pretty good short \ndefinition. But in simple legal and practical terms, the addition of \nthis kind of nonseverability clause means that the soft money and \nSnowe-Jeffords provision, title I and title II of the bill, would \nbecome a single integrated unit for purposes of constitutional \nscrutiny, that its many separate sections would all stand or fall \ntogether if any part of it is challenged in court on constitutional \ngrounds. So, if this amendment passes, and the bill passes into law in \na form that includes this amendment, and some time later a federal \ncourt finds one provision of either the soft money ban or the Snowe-\nJeffords provision to be unconstitutional, then both of those \nprovisions will be struck down, and it will be as if we had never \npassed a campaign finance reform bill at all.\n  Our bill contains an explicit severability clause, added only for \nemphasis. We pass hundreds of bills in each Congress, and each of them \nis deemed implicitly to be comprised of severable parts, unless it \ncontains ``nonseverability'' language. Two weeks ago we passed a \nbankruptcy bill, that ran on for hundreds of pages. I thought it was a \nbad bill, I wish it were not about to become law. Still, I understand \nthat if some part of its hundreds of pages is struck down on \nconstitutional grounds, the rest will stand. The same is true of nearly \nevery bill we have passed or will in the future pass in this body. In \nfact, I am informed that during the last 12 years only 10 bills have \nbeen introduced, let alone passed, that contain a nonseverability \nclause. It is incredibly unusual.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that even without a \nseverability clause, the presumption is that Congress intends for each \nprovision of a bill to be evaluated on its own merits and severed from \nthe bill if it is found to be unconstitutional. In Alaska Airlines v. \nBrock, for example, the Court said:\n\n       A court should refrain from invalidating more of the \n     statute than is necessary . . . Whenever an act of Congress \n     contains unobjectionable provisions separable from those \n     found to be unconstitutional, it is the duty of the court to \n     so declare, and to maintain the act in so far as it is valid.\n\n  That is the general rule. In order to overcome that presumption there \nhas to be specific evidence that Congress would not have passed the \nconstitutional provisions without the unconstitutional provisions.\n  Senator McCain and I have drafted a bill that we believe is \nconstitutionally sound. My record is not the record of a legislator who \nis casual about the first amendment, but some people, out of legitimate \nconcern, and some other people, seeking strategic advantage in their \neffort to kill reform, have raised first amendment questions about the \nSnowe-Jeffords provisions of the bill, which would place restrictions \non the use corporate and union treasury of phony issue ads run on radio \nor TV within 60 days of general election. Similar questions have been \nraised about the Wellstone amendment that extends the Snowe-Jeffords \nrestrictions to issue ads run by independent groups.\n  We knew that our bill would face this scrutiny and we drafted the \nSnowe-Jeffords provision with care and respect for the right to \npolitical speech, but if we, or the author of a successful amendment to \nour bill, has missed the constitutional mark, there are federal courts \nto rule on the question. Ultimately, under our system of government, \nthere is a Supreme Court to give the final word about the \nconstitutionality of any part of our bill that may be challenged. And \nif the Supreme Court says that some piece of our bill is \nunconstitutional, that's the last word, and we would have to accept \nthat.\n\n  But this amendment goes much farther. It would mean that if the \nSupreme Court finds a defect in the Snowe-Jeffords provision, and \nstrikes it down, then the soft money ban will be invalidated as well. \nThis makes no sense. It respects neither the proper rule of the Court, \nnor the proper role of the Congress. We have a Congress to pass laws, \nin this case a set of laws. We have a Supreme Court to tell us when one \nof those laws is unconstitutional and must cease to have effect.\n  I try to avoid cliches in debate, but here I must implore my \ncolleagues, don't vote for an amendment that obliges this Senate and \nthe Court to throw the baby out with the bathwater. In this case, the \nbathwater is the Snowe-Jeffords provision that we have always known \nwill face a constitutional challenge, and while we believe there is a \nstrong argument for it being upheld, we cannot state with any certainty \nthat it will. But the most important provision in our bill, the baby in \nour metaphor, is the soft money ban. The sponsor of this amendment \nknows that he will never get the Court to say that the soft money ban \nis unconstitutional. He holds out hope that Snowe-Jeffords will be \nfound to be constitutionally flawed, so he pins his hopes on the \nextraordinary, mechanistic and, in this case, cynical device of non-\nseverability. It is his only chance, because he knows he can't beat \nreform in the Congress, and he knows he can't possibly beat the most \nimportant part of it in the courts, not in any analysis on the merits.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I add \nthese words of caution: If you vote for this amendment, you are voting \nto place in peril the most important reform measure in this bill. If \nyou vote for this amendment, you vote for a gross departure from \nordinary legislative procedure. If you vote for this amendment, you \nvote to distort the usual proper role of and relationship between the \ncourts and this Congress. If you vote for this amendment, you vote, and \nwill be seen to vote, for maximizing the chances of the enemies of \nreform to prevail against the decisions of this Senate and against the \nwill of the American people.\n  I must also point out to those of my colleagues who have told me \nprivately, or have stated in public that they support a ban on soft \nmoney but cannot vote for the bill because they believe the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment is unconstitutional, you should vote against this \namendment. If you would vote for a bill that includes a soft money ban \nand no provision on issue ads, you should vote here to preserve the \noption for the Supreme Court to uphold a soft money ban and strike down \nthe Snowe-Jeffords amendment.\n  I made this clear in the last few days. I believe this is the vote. \nThis vote is the ultimate test for the Senate in this debate on \ncampaign finance reform. It might be called the campaign finance reform \ntest. The American people are standing by, waiting to see whether this \nbody will pass or fail that test. Do not let them down my colleagues. \nThere are no makeup exams.\n  This is the vote that will decide if we are going to be able to get \nrid of this awful soft money system--to really get rid of it, not just \npass a bill in the Senate, not just pass a bill in the House, not just \nhave the President sign it, but actually have it survive a court \nchallenge and become the law of the land.\n  Before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent a letter sent to \nour Democratic colleagues of the Senate by Representative Meehan and \nRepresentative Frank of the other body on March 22 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2001.\n       Dear Senate Democratic Colleague: We are writing to urge \n     you to oppose any amendment to S. 27--the bipartisan campaign \n     finance reform legislation introduced by Senators John McCain \n     and Russ Feingold--that would invalidate all or other \n     provisions of the bill were one such provision declared \n     unconstitutional by the courts.\n       The House confronted amendments of this nature during \n     debate on the similar Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform \n     legislation in 1998 and 1999. These amendments were soundly \n     defeated--in 1998 by a vote of 155 to 254 and in 1999 by a \n     vote of 167 to 259. 188 of 194 House Democrats voted against \n     a non-severability amendment in 1998, and 202 out of 210 \n     House Democrats voted against this amendment in 1999.\n       The pro-reform majority in the House rightly perceived non-\n     severability to be lacking in public policy justification and \n     precedent. This amendment cedes enormous power to the courts \n     to undo Congress's work in instances where that work is of \n     unquestionable constitutionality. Under non-severability, if \n     a court found one provision of a comprehensive bill to be \n     unconstitutional, the entire bill would be invalidated. While \n     we believe that judicial review is an essential part of our \n     system of checks-and-balances, non-severability tilts the \n     scales too far towards judicial domination. Indeed, we find \n     it strange that some who have decided the prospect of so-\n     called ``activist judges'' overriding the will of officials \n     elected by the people apparently endorse such an assault on \n     Congress's power and prerogatives.\n       The inclusion of non-severability provisions in enacted \n     legislation is extremely rare. At the time the House \n     considered the Shays-Meehan bill in 1999, only three bills \n     had passed in the last decade that had non-severability \n     clauses. Indeed, Congress has often inserted severability \n     clauses in legislation to ensure that constitutional \n     provisions remain in effect. For example Telecommunications \n     Act of 1996 contained a severability clause. If Congress had \n     instead inserted a non-severability clause in the Act, the \n     entire Act would have been invalidated when the U.S. Supreme \n     Court unanimously struck down its so-call ``Communications \n     Decency Act'' provision. The Brady Bill was also protected by \n     a severability clause.\n       Finally, non-severability is an unjustified threat to the \n     laudable effort to clean up our campaign finance system. We \n     believe that soft money contributions to the national \n     political parties should be banned and that campaign ads \n     masquerading as issue discussion should be subject to the \n     same laws governing uncloaked campaign ads. Moreover, we \n     believe that both of these elements of the McCain-Feingold \n     bill pass constitutional muster. We do not believe, however, \n     that tying the fate of one to a court's view of the other--or \n     tying either's fate to a court's view of other provisions of \n     McCain-Feingold--is justified. Soft money contributions at a \n     minimum give rise to an appearance of corruption. That will \n     be the case whether or not other provisions of McCain-\n     Feingold ultimately survive judicial review. Accordingly, the \n     public policy merits weigh strongly in favor of cleaning up \n     as much of our disgraceful campaign finance system as we can. \n     Non-severability may compromise our ability to do so, as well \n     as create an incentive for opponents of reform to offer \n     patently unconstitutional amendments in the hope of poisoning \n     the prospects for reform's survival in the courts.\n       Thank you for you consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marty Meehan,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Barney Frank,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Frist \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The proponents have 53 \nminutes and the opponents have 44 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have been listening carefully to the \nspeeches on the other side of this issue. With all due respect, they \nare somewhat misleading.\n  The last three campaign finance reform bills that passed out of the \nSenate included nonseverability clauses--in 1990, 1992, and 1993. \nMembers of the Senate who voted for that include 23 current Members who \nsupported the bill with a nonseverability clause in it in 1990; 24 of \nthe current Members supported the bill in 1992 with a nonseverability \nclause in it; and 28 of the current Members supported the bill in 1993 \nwith a nonseverability clause in it.\n  It is wholly irrelevant whether most bills do or don't have \nnonseverability clauses. What we are talking about is campaign finance \nreform bills which are fraught with first amendment constitutional \nprinciples, and it has been almost always the rule rather than the \nexception that they include nonseverability clauses in them.\n  It is so common that the Harkin amendment we just voted on and was \nsupported by 31 Members of the Senate on that side of the aisle had a \nnonseverability provision in it tied to Snowe-Jeffords; also, the \namendment we had a couple of hours ago in which 31 Members of the \nSenate on the other side supported.\n  So this notion that somehow it is inappropriate and unwise to have a \nnonseverability clause in a campaign finance bill is utterly and \ntotally baseless and without merit. In fact, that is what is typically \ndone.\n  I say to my friends who support the underlying bill, what are you \nafraid of? There have been numerous discussions and hearings about how \nconstitutional Snowe-Jeffords is. We have had lengthy discussion on the \nfloor by various Members of the Senate.\n  Senator Snowe, of Snowe-Jeffords fame, says it is constitutional. It \nis common sense. It is not speech rationing but informational, and so \non. Senator Snowe referred to 70, as she put it, constitutional \nexperts.\n  Senator Jeffords says: My focus will be on reassuring you that Snowe-\nJeffords is constitutional. He says they took great care in drafting \ntheir language.\n  Senator McCain is, likewise, totally confident that Snowe-Jeffords is \nconstitutional. Senator Thompson, the same.\n  Senator Edwards is on the floor now. He said he is totally confident \nthat Snowe-Jeffords is carefully crafted to meet the constitutional \ntest of Buckley v. Valeo.\n  Senator DeWine offered an amendment to take Snowe-Jeffords out \nearlier today. That was defeated. It is a part of the bill.\n  Those who want to keep that in the bill are totally confident that it \nis constitutional.\n  What are they afraid of?\n  As the author of the amendment, Senator Frist pointed out that there \nis a rationale for linking Snowe-Jeffords and the soft money ban. And \nit is this, I say to my friend from North Carolina: What if I am right \nand they are wrong, and Snowe-Jeffords is struck down, the Democratic \nSenatorial Committee loses 35 percent of its budget, and the Democratic \nNational Committee loses 40 percent of its budget? If candidates are \nunder attack by conservative groups from outside, who is going to rush \nto their defense?\n\n  The party is the only entity in America that will certainly support \nthe candidates that bear its label. There is nobody else you can \ntotally depend on to be there to defend you when you are under assault.\n  There is a rationale for linking Snowe-Jeffords and the party soft \nmoney ban; that is, if we eliminate it, and if all of the Senators who \nare confident, including the Senator from North Carolina, that it is \nconstitutional are wrong, every group in America--conservative, \nliberal, vegetarian, and libertarian--will all have a right to come \nafter our candidates and our parties will be largely defenseless.\n  I asked consent later this afternoon to have some time at 4 o'clock \nto describe to the Members of the Senate the impact of McCain-Feingold \non our political parties. I am going to take the opportunity to do that \nat 4 o'clock. It will be chilling to learn what will happen to our \nparties under this underlying bill.\n  Let me sum up because I see the coauthor of the amendment is on the \nfloor.\n  I don't think this is in any way inappropriate. In fact, it is \ncommon. If the proponents of Snowe-Jeffords are confident it will be \nupheld, I don't know what they are afraid of. We will need the \npolitical parties to defend our candidates if Snowe-Jeffords is struck \ndown.\n  I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Louisiana is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the author of the bill, the \nSenator from Tennessee, for yielding time to me.\n  We have just heard a good explanation of the situation from the \nSenator from Kentucky about the concern of the so-called severability. \nImagine most people in America scratching their heads and asking: What \nin the\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nworld is the Senate talking about --nonseverability, severability, and \neverything else? When we talk about severability, back in Louisiana \nthey think someone lost an arm or a finger. They get very confused when \nwe start talking about severability in legislation as an integral part \nof a bill.\n  We have learned the mistake we make when we craft a carefully \nconstructed compromise that people are allowed to vote for because it \nis carefully balanced with amendments through the legislative process \nand then have that legislation go to a court which says that one part \nof this bill we will take out and we are going to leave everything \nelse, or the court will say they will take out half of it and leave \neverything else. We tried that in 1971 when we wrote the landmark \nFederal elections law. I was running for Congress then and was watching \nit very carefully, not knowing what in the world the results would be. \nBut I looked at it at that time, as the people helped write it, as a \ncarefully crafted compromise. It did not have a nonseverability clause \nin that legislation. When it left this body and it left the House, \na lot of people said: This is a good balance; I got this in it; I got \nthat in it; I got limits on contributions but we got limits on how they \ncan spend it; therefore, I think this is a good package; it makes \nsense; it is reform.\n\n  Because it didn't have a nonseverability clause in it, which we are \ntrying to add in this legislation, when it got to the Supreme Court, in \nits wisdom, said: Well, this can stand and this can't stand; we are \ngoing to eliminate this and we are going to keep that.\n  In essence, what they did was replace the role of the Congress in \nwriting the legislation as they thought in their final words what was \nlegitimate and what was constitutional.\n  Guess what. We ended up for all of these years with a bill that was \ntotally different from what the Congress had carefully crafted. In \nessence, what we ended up with was a bill that limited contributions \nbut had no limits on expenditures. What we thought we were doing was \nsaying, all right, we are going to reduce the money in campaigns, we \nare going to eliminate expenditures, and limit contributions. What we \nended up with was only one-half of the equation. This body, the other \nbody, this Congress and past Congresses learned from that monumental \nmistake.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky pointed out, when we considered campaign \nfinance legislation in subsequent Congresses, we didn't make that \nmistake. We considered it in the 101st Congress, the 102d Congress, and \nthe 103d Congress. And in every one of those Congresses we did not make \nthe same mistake that we made in 1971.\n  We took the position in those acts of the Congress that the carefully \ncrafted compromise was going to have to be accepted or rejected; the \nCourt could not piecemeal it. They could not rewrite it. They could not \ndecide in their wisdom what they thought was legitimate and keep that \nand throw out what they thought was unconstitutional. We did not make \nthe mistake in the previous Congresses that we did the first time.\n  I hope what we do here is to also recognize that we should say that \nthis carefully crafted compromise, the ban on soft money to parties \nplus the restrictions on outside groups running sham ads 60 days before \nan election, are intricately tied together. They are part of the \ncompromise. If you knock out one, you break the deal. Without this \namendment, we will have perhaps only half of the deal being enacted \ninto law and the other half disappearing because of a Court decision.\n  That is not what the role of legislators should be. We should be \nputting together comprehensive packages with intricate amendments and \ncompromises woven together to create a package.\n  There are people who would not be for this legislation, I dare say, \nif they thought the Snowe-Jeffords legislation on money being spent on \nsham ads right before the election were not restricted in this bill. \nWhat do we say to those people who voted for it because of Snowe-\nJeffords being part of it: That somehow it may not be there in the end? \nThey would not have voted for the legislation.\n  It is so significant that we have this nonseverability clause. It is \nvery restrictive, and I want to expand it. I will ask unanimous consent \nto offer an amendment to the Frist-Breaux amendment which will include \nthe soft money ban plus the Snowe-Jeffords amendment plus the Thompson \namendment which increased the hard dollar contributions, that if any \none of those three would be found to be unconstitutional, all three \nwould fall.\n\n  It makes no sense, I agree, to have the ban, for instance, on soft \ndollars to be declared unconstitutional, which it probably is not, but \nif it should be, then you would be left with a hard dollar increase. It \nmakes no sense to say that, well, we could ban or declare \nunconstitutional the Snowe-Jeffords prohibition but yet still have the \nhard dollar increase. All three are integral parts of this compromise. \nI think the Frist-Breaux amendment should be amended to say that if \neither of those three essential ingredients is knocked down as \nunconstitutional, therefore, all three of them would fall. That would \nbe the right thing to do.\n  That doesn't mean the whole bill falls. Everything else is still \nthere: The millionaire's amendment, the lowest unit rate for television \nwould still be there, the ban on foreign contributions, the ban on \nsolicitations. Those are all still improvements in the current system.\n  When I try to explain nonseverability to people, it gets very \nconfusing. I am probably as confused as anyone trying to explain it to \nour colleagues and to the press, and to the general public, who have to \ncover all of this. I try to use the analogy of ANWR which I think makes \nsense. The question of whether we drill for oil in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge is a very controversial and contentious issue. Suppose \nwe came to the floor of the Senate and someone said: All right, I am \nwilling to allow for drilling in ANWR if you double the environmental \nrequirements that would apply to that part of the United States. That \namendment is adopted. People say: Well, with that amendment, I can \nsupport drilling for oil in ANWR because we have an amendment that \ndoubles the environmental protections in that part of the world only.\n  But then that bill goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court \nsays: Oops, sorry, you are all wrong, you can't do doubling of the \nenvironmental protections in only one part of the country. That part of \nthe bill is unconstitutional. But the drilling for oil is OK.\n  How would that treat all the Members of Congress who said: Well, I \ncan vote for the carefully crafted compromise because at the same time \nwe have doubled the environmental protections and therefore it is a \ncomprehensive package and therefore it makes sense? To have the Court \nstrike down the environmental protections while leaving the right to \ndrill would be a sham on the Members of Congress who voted for the \ncarefully crafted compromise.\n  The same is true with regard to this controversial, complicated, \nemotional issue of how we handle campaigns in this country. All of the \ningredients are essential to the compromise. To allow the Court to \nknock out one or two and leave the rest is to put into effect through \nlaw something that was never intended by the people who voted on it to \never occur. When you vote for all of the parts of the bill, you have \nthe right to expect that all of the parts will survive.\n  Someone said: Maybe we should do that for every piece of legislation. \nI say: Well, it may not be a bad idea, but certainly not a bad idea for \nthings that are complicated and carefully crafted and subjected to \nnumerous compromises that are part of the package.\n  I am extremely concerned that we have a situation where we are going \nto ban soft money to the two political parties and somehow leave all of \nthese groups and organizations that are running ads, special interest \ngroups, basically single-interest groups, who will be able to continue \nto use all of the soft money they want to attack candidates for 2 years \nprior to our elections. None of these groups represents, I argue, the \nmore moderate parts of both parties; they tend to be more extreme. Not \nall of them, some of them are moderate, but most are single-issue, one-\nissue groups that generally run only negative advertising against \ncandidates.\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\n  Addressing this with the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, saying that \ncorporate and union contributions cannot fund any of these groups \nwithin 60 days of an election, is an important step. If we don't have \nthe nonseverability and Snowe-Jeffords is knocked out, all of these \ngroups could use corporate money to continue to blast candidates \nwithout us having the same ability to help our parties respond to those \naccusations.\n  I am talking about groups such as those that ran the Flo ads on \nMedicare. None of the people on my side liked those at all. I am \ntalking about groups that ran the Harry and Louise ads which used \ncorporate contributions to run negative ads all the way up to 60 days \nbefore the election, if this amendment goes down. I am talking about \nthe National Rifle Association. To people principally on my side of the \naisle, how many times do we have to see Charlton Heston talking about \nwhy Democrats should not be elected and having corporate contributions \npay for those ads?\n  Those principally on my side who are saying we want to vote for this \nbecause it is a carefully crafted compromise ought to recognize that \nwithout the Frist-Breaux amendment, that carefully crafted compromise \ncould cease to exist. What we have done is to abdicate our \nresponsibility to legislate in a package, not with blinders on, and not \nlooking at reality.\n  I strongly support the nonseverability amendment. I plan at the \nappropriate time to ask that the amendment be modified in order to add \na third category in addition to the soft money prohibition to parties \nand the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. I would add the Thompson amendment \nreflecting the increase in hard dollars, that any one of those three \nbeing declared unconstitutional would bring down all three of those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I would like to get a copy \nof the modification.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, if it is all right, I will hand a copy to \nmy colleague, since he is managing the bill, and allow him the chance \nto review it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, Senators have the right to modify \ntheir amendments. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me speak in opposition to this \namendment. I'll talk briefly about why I oppose the amendment, and \nrespond to the comment by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, who has just modified his amendment.\n  First, it is very important for my colleagues who aren't on the \nfloor, in looking at the precise language of these amendments, to \nrecognize there are really only three provisions, with the \nmodification, that are covered by this amendment. The soft money ban is \nnumber one; the Snowe-Jeffords ban on broadcast ads paid out of union \nand corporation treasury funds 60 days before the election is number \ntwo; number three is the raising of the hard money limit.\n  No one who has looked closely at this question would argue that \neither the soft money ban or the hard money limit increase is subject \nto serious constitutional challenge. The only thing the soft money ban \nhas to do under the Buckley case is for the Court to find that there \nwas a compelling State interest to support that ban. The Court, in \nfact, has already found in Buckley there is such an interest. So as \nthese other Senators have recognized during the course of this debate, \nthere is no serious question about the soft money ban. The soft money \nban--if it passes from this Chamber, and is signed by the President and \npassed by the House--is going to become law.\n  The raising of the hard dollar limit also is not subject to any \nserious constitutional challenge. So what we are talking about is \nSnowe-Jeffords.\n  Now my friend from Kentucky points out that during the course of this \ndebate I have argued that Snowe-Jeffords is constitutional. I don't \nwant to repeat that argument, but I, in fact, believe that Snowe-\nJeffords is constitutional. But I want my colleagues to understand, and \nnot get caught up too much in the morass of this debate, that there is \nonly one issue raised by this amendment as modified, and that is if \nSnowe-Jeffords were found to be unconstitutional by a Court at a later \ntime, do we want the soft money ban and the raising of the hard money \nlimits to stand? That is the simple question raised by this amendment.\n  Now I don't believe a Court will find Snowe-Jeffords to be \nunconstitutional. But the U.S. Supreme Court has done many things in \nthe past that I didn't expect, including some things in recent times. \nSo I have no way of predicting with certainty what the Court will do \nwhen confronted with this question. I do believe Snowe-Jeffords meets \nthe constitutional requirements. So the argument that is made is, if \nSnowe-Jeffords is found to be unconstitutional, we create a strategic \nimbalance in our electoral process.\n  The difference I have with my friends from Kentucky and from \nLouisiana is why we are enacting campaign finance reform. I don't think \nthat the focus of campaign finance reform, and the reason we are doing \nit, is to make sure the strategic balance that now exists is \nmaintained. I think what we are trying to do is take these huge, \nunregulated soft money contributions out of the system. What we are \ntrying to do is restore public faith in our campaign and election \nsystem in this country.\n  It is difficult for me to understand how removing these huge soft \nmoney contributions doesn't contribute to the restoring of that \nintegrity. It obviously does. It may be that if one of these \nprovisions--I think the only one in play is Snowe-Jeffords--is found to \nbe unconstitutional, somewhere down the road there is a strategic \nimbalance. That may be true. But this debate and this law is not about \nus. It is not about what is good for Democrats, it is not about what is \ngood for Republicans, and it is not about what is good for incumbent \nSenators; it is about the American people. It is about whether their \nvoice is going to be heard and whether they believe they have some \nownership in their Government; or, instead, whether we continue to \nperpetuate a system where huge amounts of money flow, unregulated, into \nthe campaign process and ordinary people feel as if their vote makes no \ndifference anymore. Senator Dodd made an eloquent and passionate \npresentation yesterday, or the day before, on this very subject.\n\n  My point is this: The disagreement I have with my colleague from \nKentucky--and it is a fundamental disagreement--is why we are trying to \nenact campaign finance reform. I don't think we ought to be focused on \nourselves, or focused on how we are going to combat a particular ad \nthat may or may not be run against us. I am as practical as anybody \nelse. I understand the way the system works. All of us have lived with \nit. But the baseline for this debate, and what I hope all of my \ncolleagues will use as their touchstone, is not what is good for us, \nnot what is good for Republicans, not what is good for Democrats, but \nwhat is good for the American people.\n  I have great respect for all of my Senate colleagues, including the \nSenators who have authored this amendment, who I know are well \nintentioned, and I don't doubt that. I just think we have a fundamental \ndifference.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will yield for a question now.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I take it the Senator from North Carolina, who supports \nSnowe-Jeffords, which would prohibit all these groups on this chart \nfrom using corporate dollars to attack candidates--these single-issue \nspecial interest groups--is that not an important amendment, that if it \nwere to be declared unconstitutional, the rest of the bill would go \ninto effect? Does this not bother the Senator that without the Snowe-\nJeffords amendment all of these groups would be able to continue to use \ncorporate dollars to attack candidates with no ability for the parties \nto defend them?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My answer to that question is, first, what we do, even \nwithout Snowe-Jeffords, is we prohibit candidates for political office \nfrom raising large soft dollar contributions for these very groups to \nwhich the Senator from Louisiana is referring.\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\n  If our focus is on restoring integrity to the process and the \npublic's perception of ourselves, then getting us out of the process of \nraising soft money dollars, getting soft money, period, out of the \nsystem is a positive thing. And my view is that it helps restore \nintegrity.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Does the Senator think that the Health Insurance \nAssociation of America, or the National Rifle Association really needs \nany help from Members of Congress in raising corporate money to run \nthose types of ads? My point is that those groups don't need Members of \nCongress to help them raise money to do the Flo ads, and the Harry and \nLouise ads. Those are corporate dollars. The pharmacy industry doesn't \nneed Members of Congress to raise money to pay for ads attacking \neverybody in Congress.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, my answer is the very \nanswer I just gave the Senator from Louisiana. We can't stop these \nentities from running ads. What we can do, is stop Members of Congress \nfrom raising huge amounts of money and creating a public perception \nthat we are involved in what is wrong with the system. You are \nabsolutely right. As a matter of pure strategic balance, that there is \nthe possibility there will be a strategic imbalance, I would not argue \nfor a minute about that. But that is not what campaign finance reform \nis about.\n\n  What campaign finance reform is about is restoring integrity to the \nsystem and causing the American people to believe, once again, that the \nsystem has integrity, that it works, and this democracy belongs to \nthem, and that it is their Government. That is the fundamental \ndifference. Anything we do, I strongly suspect, with or without Snowe-\nJeffords, or any of these other provisions, as we have learned from \nexperience, may turn out a year, 5 years, 10 years from now to create \nsome result that we don't expect. I think that is just realistic.\n  But the one thing we know for certain is that the public believes \nthis system is awash in money. These huge, unregulated contributions \nthat are being made to political campaigns are wrong, and we need to \nmake a clear and unequivocal statement that we will not allow that to \nhappen.\n  This debate is not about us. It is about the American people. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes, if I may. I \nthink the Senator from North Carolina has eloquently framed what the \npresent amendment would do and what the consequences are, should the \nFrist-Breaux amendment be adopted--and I am not sure it has been \noffered yet--even if you accept the modification that is about to be \noffered by our friend and colleague from Louisiana. This gets a little \nconfusing. It is hard for people to even hear--despite the fact we live \nin this world--and to even understand the issues of severability, \nnonseverability, hard money, and soft money.\n  This can glaze over the eyes of even the most determined person to \nfollow this debate. It is confusing, but it is very important.\n  Let me try, if I can, to frame this so people may have a clear \nunderstanding, at least as I understand it.\n  If Snowe-Jeffords--the union and corporate disclosure provisions; I \nwill call that Snowe-Jeffords although they are often in different \nplaces--if that falls because it is ruled to be unconstitutional, then \nthe ban on soft money also falls.\n  If the Breaux amendment modifies the Frist amendment, then so would, \nas I understand it, the Thompson-Feinstein amendment, which allowed for \nthe increases in hard money.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Tennessee, who is also \nopposing this amendment--not the author of the amendment but the \nopponent of the amendment--and my friend from California, Senator \nFeinstein, Thompson-Feinstein is not a reform. Thompson-Feinstein was \nthe price we paid to have the votes together on the banning of soft \nmoney.\n  There is no illusion about this. That was not a reform. I know they \nwant to call it that. I reluctantly voted for it, having spoken against \nthe increases in hard money. My friend from Wisconsin and my friend \nfrom Arizona also took similar positions that they did not endorse or \nsupport those increases except that it was necessary to keep the votes \ntogether for the two reforms in this bill: Snowe-Jeffords, disclosure \nelements, and the ban on soft money. Those are the only two reforms in \nthis bill.\n  Thompson-Feinstein is the price we paid for those two reforms \npolitically. I will stand corrected if someone wants to tell me I am \nwrong.\n  Basically that is the deal. We have this increase in hard money, \nwhich I have a hard time accepting, but in exchange for that we get the \ntwo reforms of getting rid of unregulated money and the Snowe-Jeffords \nprovisions. I believe, based on those who know far more about this than \nI do, Snowe-Jeffords should not fall for constitutional reasons, \nalthough my friend and colleague from North Carolina properly points \nout that we have been surprised lately by Supreme Court decisions where \nexperts have told us they would rule one way and they ruled another.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep this in mind, that if, in fact, they \nhave been a supporter of McCain-Feingold, understanding that this is \nnot every reform of the process, and understanding there may be some \nimbalances created here--we are all very much aware of this. My \ncolleague from Utah spoke eloquently about the fact that none of us can \nsay with any certainty exactly where all of this is going to end up. If \nyou took McCain-Feingold as modified up to now and it became the law of \nthe land tomorrow, there is some uncertainty, except this: The \ncertainty that soft money, the unregulated millions of dollars--\nbillions of dollars now have been pouring into campaigns--is going to \nbe stopped.\n  No one is suggesting the ban on soft money is unconstitutional, and \nthat would be a major achievement. We may end up coming back at some \nfuture date, less than 30 years down the road, because we discover \nthere have been unintended consequences in this legislation. Let's not \nlose sight of the fact that the ban on soft money and the Snowe-\nJeffords provisions--assuming they survive--are worthy of this body's \nsupport. The issue of saying they both fall, the ban on soft money and \nthe price we paid for it, as well, if Snowe-Jeffords falls is an \nunequal trade off. I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n\n  Lastly, I say to my friend from Kentucky, there are differences of \nopinion on how we voted on two previous campaign finance reform bills. \nThere was tied severability in those two other bills. It was not \nnonseverability. We linked two provisions. We said if one fell, then \nthe other would fall as well.\n  It was, if you will, a partial severability in those two bills for \nwhich 23 of us, who are still here, voted. We did not vote for \nnonseverability. That is a semantical game in a sense. We voted for \ntied severability, partial severability. That is a side question.\n  The basic issue is my colleagues ought to, with all due respect, \nreject the Frist-Breaux amendment if they believe, as I think a \nmajority of us do, that the ban on soft money and Snowe-Jeffords are \ntruly reforms. We fought too long and too hard not to succeed with \nthose and to link severability is a mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, listening carefully to the Senator from \nConnecticut trying to explain the previous nonseverability clauses that \npassed in 1992 and 1993, those nonseverability clauses included the \nwhole bill, so that if any little portion of the bill that cleared the \nSenate in 1990, cleared the Senate in 1992, cleared the Senate in 1993, \nif any little portion of that bill was unconstitutional, the whole bill \nfell.\n  As I understand the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Louisiana, the whole bill does not fall. It carefully tied \nthe two relevant parts of the amendment, the Snowe-Jeffords language \nand the party soft money ban. The Senator from Louisiana has pointed \nout why those two are relevant and important. He has his whole list of \npeople who are going to be attacking our candidates, and our parties \nare going to have no funds--none, none--to protect them from attack \nfrom outside groups.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask the Presiding Officer whether it would be \nappropriate for me now--I have two requests. First, would it be \nappropriate for me to now ask unanimous consent for a modification to \nthe Frist-Breaux amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Further parliamentary inquiry: If there is an objection \nto the unanimous consent request to modify the Frist-Breaux amendment, \nwould it not be in order at a later date to reoffer a Frist-Breaux \namendment with that modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be in order under this agreement.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmodification to the Frist-Breaux amendment that is pending at the desk \nbe offered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object, and I do intend to \nobject, I know my friend can bring this after--if this amendment \nsurvives a motion to table, of course, he can bring it back, or I \nsuppose he can bring it back separately. My understanding is this \namendment would cause the following result; that is, if either Snowe-\nJeffords or the soft money portion of the bill were struck down, then \nthe Thompson-Feinstein amendment language would fall also at that time. \nFor that reason, I object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator withhold his objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, was the objection finalized or did the \nSenator withhold?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will withhold momentarily.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to my colleague from Tennessee 1 minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 156, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I renew the consent request of the Senator from \nLouisiana that his amendment and the amendment of Senator Frist be \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 37, strike lines 18 through 24 and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), if \n     any provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act, or \n     the application of a provision or amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder \n     of this Act and amendments made by this Act, and the \n     application of the provisions and amendment to any person or \n     circumstance, shall not be affected by the holding.\n       (b) Nonseverability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--If one of the provisions of, or amendments \n     made by, this Act that is described in paragraph (2), or if \n     the application of any such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, then \n     all the provisions and amendments described in paragraph (2) \n     shall be invalid.\n       (2) Nonseverable provisions.--A provision or amendment \n     described in this paragraph is a provision or amendment \n     contained in any of the following sections:\n       (A) Section 101, except for section 323(d) of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971, as added by such section.\n       (B) Section 103(b).\n       (C) Section 201.\n       (D) Section 203.\n       (E) Section 308.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Expedited review.--Any Member of Congress, candidate, \n     national committee of a political party, or any person \n     adversely affected by any provision of, or amendment made by, \n     this Act, or the application of such a provision or amendment \n     to any person or circumstance, may bring an action, in the \n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \n     for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground \n     that such provision or amendment violates the Constitution.\n       (2) Appeal to supreme court.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, any order of the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia granting or denying an \n     injunction regarding, or finally disposing of, an action \n     brought under paragraph (1) shall be reviewable by appeal \n     directly to the Supreme Court of the United States. Any such \n     appeal shall be taken by a notice of appeal filed within 10 \n     calendar days after such order is entered; and the \n     jurisdictional statement shall be filed within 30 calendar \n     days after such order is entered.\n       (3) Expedited consideration.--It shall be the duty of the \n     District Court for the District of Columbia and the Supreme \n     Court of the United States to advance on the docket and to \n     expedite to the greatest possible extent the disposition of \n     any matter brought under paragraph (1).\n       (4) Applicability.--This subsection shall apply only with \n     respect to any action filed under paragraph (1) not later \n     than 30 days after the effective date of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nyielding.\n  For nearly 2 weeks, the Senate has been engaged in an exhaustive but \nilluminating debate on reforming the campaign finance system of the \nNation, the foundation of the rules by which a free people choose their \ngovernment. The consequences could not be more enormous.\n  I believe the Senate has met the best expectations of the American \npeople in this debate. It has been thoughtful, civil, and far reaching. \nIndeed, rather than simply engaging in a narrow changing of the rules, \nwhat has emerged from the Senate is genuinely comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform. It may not have been our intention, I don't believe it \nwas planned, but in the best traditions of the Senate, Members from \nboth political parties, with good ideas, took some basic reform \nlegislation and made it into a workable, comprehensive system.\n  That is what brings this question before the Senate. If these were \nsimply individual changes in the campaign finance system, where some \nwere enacted and some failed, it would be interesting but not of \noverriding consequence. That is not what the Senate has done. This is a \nseries of reforms inextricably dependent on each other. If one or more \nis removed, the Nation will have a radically different campaign finance \nsystem and our system of choosing candidates, and even the people whom \nwe elect, will be altered.\n\n  I understand in the rush to judgment there are some who are prone to \nreform for reform's sake. It is a question of pass anything, get \nsomething done, and we will live with the consequences. But the truth \nis, the campaign finance system of this country is changed only once in \na generation. These rules will last, not simply for us but for those \nwho follow us, not just in this decade but in decades to come.\n  The fact that we have seized this opportunity in these 2 weeks to \nwrite comprehensive changes, far-reaching in nature, is not only to the \ncredit of the Senate but it is a genuine contribution to the country.\n  This is the last great debate of the campaign finance consideration. \nBut in\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nsome ways it is the most profound question because ultimately the \nquestion is whether we have simply decided on a series of ideas that \nwill be thrown out to the American people to challenge in the courts \nwhere others will make the decision or whether we have really designed \na new campaign finance system in the Senate, where it is our \nresponsibility.\n  It is important to look at how each of these provisions is linked \nbecause, as one Member of the Senate, I am only voting for McCain-\nFeingold because of the different provisions and how they are all \nrelated. We eliminate soft money for the political parties. We also \neliminate it from outside interest groups. But we do not want to deny \nthe American people political debate, so we raise the hard money \nlimits. We want to end the monopoly on candidates' time and the growing \nexpense of campaigns, so we lower the cost of television advertising. \nThose are all related and they are all important.\n  My colleagues, what is to happen if the Supreme Court of the United \nStates decides the Senate has decided upon six interrelated provisions \nbut we do not like one--or two? Then the Senate is no longer writing \ncampaign finance reform; we simply made a few suggestions, enacted them \ninto law, and we will let someone else write them.\n  This would not be so perplexing to this Member of the Senate, that we \nmight be yielding in our responsibilities on the question of \nseverability, if not for the fact that the Senate has been at this \nmoment before. This is exactly what happened in 1974. If you do not \nlike the campaign system now in the United States of America, if you \nobject to what has happened in public confidence, the rising expense, \nthe dominance of powerful interests, the rise of soft money \nexpenditures, then you have a responsibility to ensure these provisions \nare inseparable, or the Supreme Court will write this law just as they \ndid in 1974.\n  Here is the most remarkable thing about the campaign finance system \nin the United States: No one ever proposed it, no one ever wrote it, \nand no one ever voted for it. Because the Supreme Court of the United \nStates created it, and that is exactly where we are going again.\n  In 1974--a year in which I did not serve in government, but I \nremember the debate, and some of my colleagues were here--had the \nSenate been presented with the following proposition: We will limit \ncontributions to $1,000 but we will allow unlimited soft money to \npolitical parties and we will allow outside groups to spend their money \nand we will allow wealthy candidates to spend unlimited amounts of \nmoney--if anyone had come to the floor of the Senate with that bill, it \nwould have received no votes. There is not a member of the Democratic \nor Republican Party who would have voted to limit themselves to $1,000 \ncontributions while wealthy individuals could spend unlimited money and \noutside groups had no restrictions at all, with no control on \nexpenditures. No one would vote for such a system. But that is the law \nof the United States of America. It has governed our country for 25 \nyears. If we fail today, it will continue to govern our country.\n\n  That has created all this outrage, and that is the product of not \nhaving a nonseverability clause. That was an attempt to have \ncomprehensive reform. But when the Court ruled provisions \nunconstitutional, rather than meeting our responsibilities, returning \nto the floor of the Senate to rewrite the legislation consistent with \nconstitutional guidelines, ensuring it was comprehensive and met our \nnational objectives, the Senate failed to meet its responsibilities and \nthis problem was created.\n  By what logic do we solve this problem now by returning to the same \nrules, the same yielding of responsibility, to ask the same Court to \nwrite campaign reform legislation once again? I ask my colleagues to \nthink of the system that may not evolve from McCain-Feingold as we have \nvoted upon it but which might evolve from a reasonable action by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  I believe every provision we have agreed to in this Senate, absent \npossibly the Wellstone amendment, is constitutional. It is noteworthy \nthe Senator from Tennessee does not put the Wellstone amendment in his \nnonseverability amendment that he offers the Senate at this moment. I \nbelieve the remainder is constitutional.\n  But if I am wrong and the U.S. Supreme Court decides that Snowe-\nJeffords amendment controlling expenditures by independent groups by \nthe use of unlimited soft money is unconstitutional, mark my words, the \nsystem we are creating in the United States of America is a radical \nchange in how we govern this country and, for all practical purposes, \nit is the end of the two-party system financing national elections as \nwe have known them in our lifetime. That is because under a McCain-\nFeingold bill that no one in this Senate voted for--and I suspect no \none really supports--the system enacted in the United States will be \nthe Democratic and Republican Parties will be limited to hard money \nexpenditures only and independent groups will spend unlimited money \nwith no restrictions or controls. Of all the thousands of organizations \nin America, civic and corporate and labor, of all the thousands of \norganizations, we will have chosen two for these restrictions: The \nDemocratic Party and the Republican Party.\n  In the practical world in which we live, let's consider what this \nwill look like. I, as a candidate, may choose to run for office on a \nprogressive platform, wanting to describe my own views. And good allies \nthat I believe in, such as organized labor or environmental groups or \nwomen's rights groups or civil rights groups, may decide to support me. \nBut they will run my ads. They will decide what I am for, describe my \npositions, and run my advertising.\n  My Republican opponent will be in a similar position. The Chamber of \nCommerce or a business group, a gun advocacy group, will run \nadvertising with soft money, saying what I am against.\n  American politics will be fought over the heads of the candidates--\naerial warfare with the Democratic and Republican Parties in the \ntrenches simply firing at each other. The real battle will be fought by \nsurrogates, and political candidates in the Democratic and Republican \nParties will be nothing but spectators in American politics.\n  This is not the system anyone here wants. Were I to offer it now, no \none would vote for it. It sounds like 1974, doesn't it? It is. And we \ncan have exactly the same result.\n  My colleagues, the Senator from Tennessee has offered an important, \nin some respects the most important, amendment in campaign finance \nreform.\n  It is the difference between a few ad hoc ideas to reform the \ncampaign finance system and ensuring that this is comprehensive and \nfundamentally changes the entire system. Each becomes dependent on the \nother.\n  I asked the Senator from Tennessee to change his amendment in one \nmore respect. I do not want my intentions questioned on the Senate \nfloor. I have voted for campaign finance reform as often as any Member \nof this Congress in the last 20 years--as many times as Senator McCain, \nas many times as Senator Feingold. I will keep voting for reform.\n  My intention to ensure that this is constitutional and comprehensive \nis not because I oppose reform but because I want it to be genuine and \ncomplete. It is because of that that I asked the Senator from Tennessee \nto adjust his amendment. He complied. Under his amendment, not only are \nthese provisions nonseverable, but there would be immediate Federal \ncourt review.\n  Upon action of the district court finding any provision of this \nlegislation unconstitutional, there would be immediate appeal to the \nU.S. Supreme Court to ensure that this Senate had guidance immediately \nso we could return to session and correct any constitutional defects.\n  This, my colleagues, is exactly what this Senate has done in dealing \nwith other legislation that was of questionable constitutional \ncompliance. It is what the Senate and House of Representatives did in \ndealing only a few years ago with the Religious Land Use \nInstitutionalized Persons Act. We ensured that the provisions would \nhave to stand together, and that there would be immediate court review \nif they did not return to the Senate.\n  So I ask the Senate to do what it did to correct what it did wrong in \n1974 and did correctly on three previous occasions to ensure \nconstitutionality and\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\nthat the responsibility for writing this legislation remains here.\n  I do not understand, my colleagues, in fact, if we vote differently. \nThe lessons of 1974 were learned in a very hard way. The American \npeople lost confidence in this Government, and the campaign finance \nsystem evolved which took Members of the Congress away from their \nresponsibilities and dispirited us and our constituents. It is not a \nsystem worthy of a good and great country--but it is the law--because \nwe did not write it. We allowed others to write it. It evolved. It was \nnot thought through or properly conceived.\n  I thought we learned that lesson in 1974 because on the last three \noccasions that we reviewed campaign finance legislation in this \nCongress, we ensured that there was a nonseverability clause.\n  What Senator Frist does today, on three previous occasions this \nCongress assured was in campaign finance legislation. What he does is \nnot the exception. It has been the rule, specifically because of what \nwe learned in 1974. Now Senator Frist brings it to the Senate again.\n  I urge my colleagues to act with caution. This vote has meaning, and \nit will last. It will change the complexity of this entire Congress as \nthe years pass because the access to financing and how we govern this \ncampaign finance system governs who rules, who wins, and who loses, and \nwhat issues come before their institution. It could not be more \nprofound.\n  I urge my colleagues, no matter how they have viewed this question of \nseverability in the past, to think carefully--not reform for reform \nsake, not a slogan, not a campaign statement, but a careful review of \nhow this law will evolve and what it means to this Senate and to this \ncountry.\n  I compliment the Senator from Tennessee for offering it. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey \nleaves, I listened carefully to his remarks, and I also say to the \nSenator from New Jersey that not only were nonseverability clauses a \npart of the three campaign finance reform bills that left the Senate in \n1990, 1992, and 1993, it is a part of the Harkin amendment that we just \nvoted on a couple of hours ago which had the support of 32 Members of \nthe Senate on his side of the aisle.\n  So the notion that somehow nonseverability is unusual or \ninappropriate is absurd. It is more often the case that these are part \nof campaign finance reform bills that we deal with in the Senate.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am glad the Senator noted that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains for the opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 21 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, it continues to be such an excellent \ndebate. I am proud to be a part of it. I commend my colleagues on both \nsides of the issue.\n  I believe it is fair to say that putting nonseverability clauses into \nbills is not at all unusual. Congress passing a bill with a \nnonseverability clause in it is very usual.\n  Let's make sure we are not comparing apples with oranges.\n  Are campaign finance laws so different from anything else that it \nshould be looked upon differently? Because in everything else, \nseverability is the norm. Nonseverability is very unusual. So we say we \ncontinually do it in these bills that we don't ever make into law. But \nwe continue to put them into bills because they are campaign finance \nbills, and they are intricately woven.\n  I suggest if anybody who ever sponsored a bill--especially a large \nbill on the floor of this Senate--thinks this bill is pretty intricate, \nthey think their bill was pretty intricately woven, also.\n  I don't think there is anything that unusual about campaign finance \nregulations except it pertains to how we raise money. That makes it \nunusual.\n  With regard to Buckley, my colleagues, of course, are correct to say \nthe law that was passed in 1974 changed our campaign system in this \ncountry in the aftermath of Watergate. Buckley took a look at it and \nbasically said: Congress, you can limit contributions but you can't \nlimit expenditures.\n  I have often wondered what the Congress would have done had they \nknown that.\n  My friend from New Jersey talks about soft money and all of that that \nwas not relevant back then. That was in play. Certainly the so-called \nbillionaire exception turned out to be in play with regard to Buckley, \nand limiting the expenditures was certainly in play. That was stricken.\n  But what would they have done? Would Congress, knowing they were \ngoing to have their expenditures limited, have raised the ceiling on \nthe contributions? I don't think so. What they were doing was in \nresponse to Watergate. Would they have lowered the contributions? \nBasically, that is what you are talking about--contributions and \nexpenditures. I do not know that Congress would have done anything any \ndifferently had they known what Buckley was going to do. And, if so, \nwhy didn't they?\n  We have been meeting regularly now for 27 years since they did that \ndastardly deed to us, as it has been described to us on the floor. I \ndon't know of any serious attempt to go back and readdress the entire \nissue since that time.\n  I think the longstanding practice we have had in this country both \nlegislatively and in our court systems to be restrained to have \nseverability clauses in most cases is a wise one.\n  I say to my friends who talk about these outside groups that both \nsides have groups that support them and campaign against them. As far \nas I am concerned, let them come on as long as I have the right to go \nout and be happy when groups support me or oppose my opponent, and \nwhatnot. And there will be plenty of each. There is plenty of robust \ndebate out there. It makes us mad sometimes. These people have a first \namendment right to do that.\n  According to an independent study, the House of Representatives the \nlast time had more independent money spent on them than the Democrats \ndid with independent ads.\n  They also said that Senate Democrats had more independent ad money \nspent on them than the Republicans did. Of course, in that battle, and \nthe Presidential race, the Republicans won. And that is one race. If \nyou look at these soft money donors--I say to my friend from Louisiana \nwho is concerned about this aspect, if you look at the large soft money \ndonors, of the top 10 of them, 6 or 7 are Democrats. They will find a \nway to support some of these organizations otherwise. In fact, that is \na concern on our side of the aisle, that they will do that. The \nDemocrats will have more support that way than the Republicans will \nhave.\n  Democrats say: Well, the hard money limits will hurt us more than it \nwill the Republicans.\n  We will never be able to figure out exactly who is marginally helped \nor hurt with all of these. We have never been able to do that before.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 1 more minute from my friend.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. We are in as much equilibrium now probably as we will \never be. Behavior changes. The reason we are so soft money oriented now \nis because we have neglected the hard money, the small dollars, for \nsome time. I think both parties have. If we raise the hard money \nlimits, as we have, and do away with soft money, you will see the \nconcentration back toward the old-time way of raising money--in smaller \namounts, legitimate, limited amounts--that we had since 1974.\n  Don't treat the legislation that was passed that year as a total \nabomination. The fact is, until the mid-1990s, the 1974 law worked \npretty well. We didn't have any Presidential scandals. The money spent \non each side was about the same. Sometimes the challenger won. \nSometimes an incumbent won. We don't like it now because some people in \nthe 1990s showed us some ways to get some whole new money into the \nprocess.\n  That is what we are reacting to now. It is not that law. It is what \nhas been\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\ndone, not just by the courts but the FEC and the Justice Department and \na few others.\n  It is a complicated issue, but it all boils down to this: Are we \nprepared to get rid of the multimillionaire soft dollars that are \ncoming from corporations and unions and wealthy individuals in this \ncountry into our political process? That is what this vote is all \nabout.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Tennessee. He \nmade a very good point at the outset on the severability issue and \nprecedence. We went back the other day and looked at legislation over \nthe last 10 or 15 years. We are told that of the hundreds, thousands of \nbills that passed the Congress, there are about 10 or 11 examples where \nlimited severability was involved, the point the Senator was making.\n  With that, let me turn to my colleagues who seek recognition. Senator \nWellstone has been around all afternoon.\n  I yield Senator Schumer 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I follow Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in adamant opposition to the \nnonseverability amendment. At the outset, let us be very clear about \nthe unmistakable goal of this amendment. It has been signed, sealed, \nand delivered primarily by opponents of the bill for one and only one \npurpose: as a poison pill.\n  Of all the prescriptions for all of the poison pills that our friends \non the other side of this issue have diligently mixed over the last 2 \nweeks, this one is the most lethal.\n  Why do I say that? Because it is aimed straight at the soft money \nban, which is the heart and soul of this bill and has been at the core \nof cleaning up our campaigns since at least 1988. Banning soft money \nfinally ends the practice, unhealthy in any democracy, whereby the \nwealthiest few pour millions and millions into our campaigns with no \nrestriction at all and sometimes no disclosure, as long as the money is \ngiven to a State party.\n  The debate over how much advocacy groups can do is simply a sideshow. \nOnly those who don't believe that banning soft money is key let it \noverride the dominant purpose of this bill, to ban soft money once and \nfor all. Banning soft money is the forest of this effort. It is far \nmore important to the viability of our campaigns to ban soft money than \nregulate sham issue ads. There is no compelling reason to force the \nformer to live or die based on the latter.\n  In medicine, it would be like killing the patient when all he has is \na headache. In warfare, we would destroy the village in order to save \nit. In legislation, it is just plain bad policy.\n  The better policy, obviously, is to see what the Court does. And if \nwe are left with an uneven system we don't like, fix it then. That is \nwhat we always do. That is why we never enact nonseverability clauses. \nOnly once in the last 12 years has a nonseverability provision become \nlaw, though nearly 3,000 bills were passed during that time. Passing \none now will just be a transparent way of saying we never wanted to ban \nsoft money in the first place, and we found a clever way to pass the \nbuck.\n  It would be particularly ironic to do this in the name of preventing \nthe Court from writing our campaign finance laws instead of Congress. \nIt is precisely this amendment that gives the Supreme Court too much \npower, not ordinary severability of the kind we always have and that is \nin McCain-Feingold.\n  If we approve this amendment, we will be asking the Court to dictate \nour campaign finance laws to a far greater extent than in McCain-\nFeingold because the soft money ban, which is constitutional, which we \nand the House have debated for years and which we are poised to enact \nright now, will disappear even if it is not considered by the Court, \nmuch less struck down.\n  Why would we concede that much power to the Court? Most of the time \nthe Senators supporting this amendment talk about the danger of \njudicial activism, but we will be rubberstamping a peculiar and \nvirtually unprecedented form of judicial activism with this amendment.\n  As the great Justice Robert Jackson once wrote of the Supreme Court's \nrole as the final arbiter of our law:\n\n       We are not final because we are infallible--we are \n     infallible because we are final.\n\n  In the area of campaign finance, the Supreme Court has not been \ninfallible, although it certainly is final. We should not tie this \nentire bill to the Court's final decision on any one of dozens of minor \nprovisions.\n  I will close by reemphasizing what the Senators from Arizona and \nWisconsin have so often and eloquently said in the course of this \ndebate. I plead with my colleagues, we cannot let the perfect be the \nenemy of the good. On this side of the aisle, I say to my colleagues, \neven if you are unhappy with the delicate balance of 501(c)(4) \norganizations, even if you realize they may not be limited once the \ncourts get hold of this, don't throw out the baby with the bath water. \nThe good in this bill is more than just good, it is great. It is a \nlandmark achievement, the first serious reform in a generation. And we \nshould strive to preserve it, not kick the can across the street to the \nSupreme Court.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Connecticut my \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nMinnesota is to be recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. That is right. We are down to a very limited amount of \ntime. I have two or three people who want to be heard. I am going to \nask the indulgence of my colleagues, unless the other side would like \nto give us a little time for people who want to be heard. How much time \ndo the proponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. May we have 5?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will yield 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will do it in 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator yields 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Although I don't like doing it in 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think that some of what other Senators have said \nabout the whole being greater than the sum of the parts is, in part, \ntrue. But I think the soft money ban, which is at the heart of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, is important enough that we want to protect it.\n  Second of all, I frankly don't know what the supremely political \nCourt will do. You can argue different ways, but I would hate to see \nthe supremely political Court render a decision taking on one part of \nthe legislation and having the whole bill fall.\n  Third, I would like to point out to my colleagues that the amendment \nI introduced that was passed as a part of this legislation now was \nbased upon the idea of severability. That was an amendment to improve \nthis bill, not to jeopardize this legislation. And so, consistent with \nmy commitment to severability, I will vote against nonseverability.\n  And then, finally, may I say this? How ironic it is that the \namendment I introduced the other night is not even covered by this \namendment that my colleagues introduced on the other side; that the \namendment I introduced the other night that deals with these sham issue \nads and the potential of all the soft money shifting here is still \nseverable. It is so ironic. But I say, no self-righteousness intended, \nconsistent with the principle of improving this bill, not in any way, \nshape, or form trying to jeopardize this bill, I don't even know how I \nam going to vote on final passage. But I certainly am opposed to this \nnonseverability.\n  You see why I wanted to have more time than 3 minutes? I have a lot \nto say.\n  Mr. DODD. The distinguished Senator is always eloquent.\n  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it seems to me it is obvious to almost \nevery Senator that we are sort of reaching a critical moment where we \ndecide whether we are for campaign reform or we are not. At the bottom \nline, that is really what the severability issue is about, even though \nthe severability has been limited now to a major component of the bill: \nIssue ads, i.e., Snowe-Jeffords, versus soft money. The soft money \nfalls, the prohibition on it, only if the Court finds that Snowe-\nJeffords is inappropriate, unconstitutional.\n  I say to my colleagues that the whole purpose of this reform is to \nget rid of the largest component of money that\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\nmost taints the political process, which is soft money. One of the \nreasons people have doubts about their ability to be able to counter \nissue ads, if indeed that prohibition were to fall, is that they \nhaven't been raising hard money, because when you can go to somebody \nand ask for $50,000, $100,000, $500,000, why bother going after the \nsmaller sum of money?\n  So it seems to me what is ignored in this argument is, if indeed you \ndon't have soft money, and if indeed the prohibition on issue ads, if \nSnowe-Jeffords were to fall, you are not defenseless at all, you still \nhave the capacity to spend unlimited amounts of hard money in defense.\n  One of the reasons Senator Wellstone, Senator Biden, I, and others \nare so concerned about the McCain-Feingold bill in the end, though we \nsupport it, is that it ultimately only reduces a portion of the money \nthat is in American politics. It still leaves us in a race, ever-\nescalating, of raising extraordinary amounts of hard money, cavorting \naround the country, still indebted to interests, still asking for large \nsums of money. We are still going to do that. I know Senators McCain \nand Feingold would love to go further if they could.\n  So, colleagues, this vote on severability is really a simple vote \nabout whether or not we are prepared to take the risk of getting rid of \nthe extraordinary amounts of soft money and taking on ourselves the \nburden, if indeed Snowe-Jeffords were to fall, of raising appropriate \namounts of hard money with which to take our case to the American \npeople.\n  I happen to believe very deeply that the bright-line test we have set \nup will withstand scrutiny. All you have to do is read Buckley v. Valeo \nand read the Nixon and Missouri case. The Court makes clear that it is \nprepared to limit contributions where they are clearly contributing to \nthe advocacy of the election of a candidate. Anybody can watch those \nads and tell the difference as to whether they are purely about an \nissue or trying to seek defeat or election of a candidate. I am \nconfident we have drawn a line that will pass constitutional muster.\n  I ask my colleagues to take the risk in favor of reform and eliminate \nthe soft money from American politics. That is what this vote is about.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, am I out of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are now facing one of the major \nhurdles, and perhaps the last major hurdle, between us and successful \nresolution of this issue. We had to fight back a poison pill in the \nform of a so-called paycheck protection. We had to speak clearly that \nwe will not accept soft money in American politics. Then we voted in \nfavor of a very hard-fought and carefully crafted compromise in the \nform of the Thompson-Feingold amendment. Now we face this issue. Have \nno doubt about what this vote is really about. If you vote for this \namendment, you are voting for soft money. That is really what this vote \nis all about.\n  Since this may be the last major obstacle we face, I take the \nopportunity to thank all of my colleagues for the level of this debate, \nthe tenor of this debate. I also thank the thousands and thousands of \nAmericans who have been active in this debate and participated with us \nthrough e-mail, phone calls, and through all communications. Without \ntheir support, we would not be where we are today.\n  I urge a vote in favor of the tabling motion that will be proposed by \nSenator Thompson of Tennessee.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me also commend our colleague. This has \nbeen a good debate, one we can be proud of in this body. I ask for \nrecognition of the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator. I join with my colleague in \nthanking each and every Member of this body for the way this debate has \nbeen conducted. It has been a great example of the way this institution \ncan work.\n  The Senator from Arizona is also right about the ultimate point. This \namendment is couched in rather technical terms--severability or \nnonseverability. But it truly is the whole issue. I said it time and \nagain, but it is the most important thing to point out to people, and \nthat is that we have never allowed unlimited campaign contributions \nfrom corporate treasuries to political parties since 1907. We have \nnever allowed unions to do the same thing from their treasury since \n1947, the Taft-Hartley Act. But now, in the 1990s, the early part of \nthis century, Members of Congress are engaged in asking for $100,000, \n$500,000, and $1 million contributions.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, if you told me even 10 years ago that \nsuch a practice could ever occur in this democracy, I would have been \nstunned. But it is standard procedure today. This vote on this \namendment will decide whether this terribly unfortunate and corrupting \nsystem continues or not. This is the soft money vote. This is where the \nSenate takes its stand. This is the test.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. I presume all time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 22 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Tennessee, the author, has \nbeen very gracious in giving us some time. I am going to return the \nfavor and extend a minute and a half to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I, too, applaud my colleagues and everybody \nwho has participated in the debate over the last 3 hours and really \nover the last 10 days. But over the last 3 hours, I have been quite \npleased with the nature of the discussion, the debate, the issues.\n  It is very clear to our colleagues what this vote is about. Although \nsome will say it is about soft money, it is about voice and it is about \nthe freedom in our process, freedom of political speech.\n  Very briefly, I want to make three points in closing. No. 1, people \nare billing this as a poison pill. Very clearly, we are not adding \nanything. We are linking principally two underlying factors that are \npart of the underlying McCain-Feingold bill and added to the hard money \nthe Thompson amendment. These are linked in a comprehensive, \ncomplementary, integral way. We are addressing just these three. If one \nfalls, the other two come down; if one is unconstitutional, the others \ncome down. Why? Because of balance.\n  All other provisions in this bill, whether it is increased \ndisclosure, the provision clarifying the ban on foreign contributions, \nincluding soft money, the ban on raising money on Federal property, the \nmillionaire amendment--all of those stand, all of those continue \nregardless of what happens with the Frist-Breaux amendment and \nconstitutionality.\n  The second point is, the issue has been made that most bills coming \nout of this body do not have nonseverability clauses, but the point was \nmade that some do. It is in times exactly such as these where we bring \npeople together and knit together in a comprehensive way this balance \nthat is so critical to maintain what we all cherish, and that is \nfreedom of speech.\n  It is in unusual times such as these that a nonseverability clause is \ncalled for. It is this balance. If Snowe-Jeffords falls and the ban on \nsoft money stays, then we increase, not decrease, the role of influence \nof the special interest groups we talked so much about over the last 3 \nhours. That is not the type of reform that Americans want.\n  Third, history. Clearly, there have been precedents, in fact, on \ncampaign finance reform bills that have passed out of this body that \nhave had nonseverability clauses.\n  In closing, I urge support of the Frist-Breaux amendment, as \nmodified, during the course of the debate. It deals directly with the \nmost cherished freedoms that any of us have today, and that is the \nfreedom of speech.\n  If there is one thing that has been pointed out over the last several \ndays, it is that we must be careful whenever we pass a bill that is \ngoing to ration free speech, and that is what we are doing. We must \nmaintain that balance, and the only way to maintain that balance is to \nsupport the nonseverability clause amendment proposed by myself and \nSenator John Breaux.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to table the Frist-Breaux amendment \nNo.\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\n156, as modified, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous order was to recognize the \nSenator from Kentucky for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I assure my colleagues that I am not \nlikely to take 30 minutes. But I thought it was an appropriate time to \nsay that I think we have dealt with the last very significant amendment \nto this bill.\n  I think it is time for Members of the Senate on both sides of the \naisle to take a good hard look at what we have done to the political \nparties--both yours and ours. I asked the pages to hand out this little \nchart.\n  My colleagues, we have reached a point in this debate where I think \nit might be a good idea to take a look at what life in a hard money \nworld is going to look like for our two great political parties. We \nhave taken pretty good care of ourselves in this debate.\n  We have raised the hard money limit for us. I am for that. I think \nthat is a very important step in the right direction.\n  We lowered the broadcast discount so we can buy time cheaper. I voted \nfor that.\n  We tried to protect ourselves against being criticized by outside \ngroups through the adoption of the Wellstone amendment and the Snowe-\nJeffords language.\n  We even adopted the Schumer amendment which would make it difficult \nfor parties to use coordinated expenditures over and above the current \nlimit if the Supreme Court in fact strikes down the coordinated \nexpenditure limit as unconstitutional, which is the case currently \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  We have also defeated the non-severability clause, so that now if the \nCourt strikes down our efforts to limit the ability of outside groups \nto criticize us in proximity to an election, and we are unable through \nthe charting of new turf, new ground, to convince a court that the \nfederalization of our parties is unconstitutional--and no one really \nknows; there is no case law on that--the parties will not be able to \nsupport their candidates against attacks by outside groups. By the way, \nI want you to know that I will be the plaintiff in the case. We will be \nmeeting with the other people who are likely to be the co-plaintiffs in \nthis case in my office next week.\n  But we are left now with the possibility of being saved by the House \nor being saved by the President, who says he is going to sign this \nbill.\n  If none of those things happens, you are looking at the plaintiff. I \nhave no idea what the chances are of getting a Federal district court, \nor the U.S. Supreme Court, for that matter, on appeal, to tell us \nwhether parties have a right of free association and a right of speech \nsomewhat similar to individuals. That is really uncharted turf. We do \nknow this: What we can calculate is what happens to the parties in a \n100-percent hard money world.\n  I hope by now some of you have gotten--I don't see that any of you \nhave gotten--where are our pages with additional copies? I guess they \nthought you all wouldn't be interested in this. I don't know why. Could \nthe pages please deliver those over to the Democratic side? This won't \ntake long.\n  I took a look at the 2000 cycle, the cycle just completed. You will \nsee in the chart before you that the chart depicts the net Federal \ndollars available to the three national party committees.\n\n  Under current law, on the left--if I could call your attention to the \ncolumn on the left, and for those in the gallery, this column is called \n``Actuals.'' This was the last cycle, net hard dollars.\n  The Republican National Committee had net hard dollars to spend on \ncandidates of 75 million; the Democratic National Committee, 48 million \nnet hard dollars to spend on candidates.\n  The Republican Senatorial Committee, net hard dollars to spend on \ncandidates, 14 million; the Democratic Senatorial Committee, net hard \ndollars to spend on candidates, 6 million.\n  The Republican Congressional Committee, $22 million; the Democratic \nCongressional Committee, minus 7 million in the whole cycle, net party \ndollars.\n  Now let's take a look at what the 2000 cycle would have looked like \nunder McCain-Feingold in a 100-percent hard money world. That is the \ncolumn over here on the right. You see the Republican National \nCommittee would have gone from 75 million net hard dollars down to 37 \nmillion net hard dollars; the Democratic National Committee, from 48 \nmillion net hard dollars down to 20 million net hard dollars; the \nRepublican Senatorial Committee, from 14 million net hard dollars down \nto 1 million. That wouldn't even cover the coordinated in New York. The \nDemocratic Senatorial Committee, 6 million net hard dollars down to \n800,000.\n  Welcome to the 100-percent hard money world. You are going to like \nit.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about who wins and who loses. We \nboth lose. This is mutually assured destruction of the political \nparties.\n  I don't think any of you believes seriously that Jeffords, or \nWellstone, or Snowe-Jeffords are going to be upheld in court. This is \nan area of the law I know a little bit about. So the chances are pretty \ngood that all of those groups that Senator Breaux was describing are \ngoing to be out there on both the right and the left pounding away.\n  Maybe your friends in organized labor will be able to help you, or \nthe Sierra Club. Or maybe the NRA will come save some of our people. \nBut under this bill, I promise you, if McCain-Feingold becomes law, \nthere won't be one penny less spent on politics--not a penny less. In \nfact, a good deal more will be spent on politics. It just won't be \nspent by the parties. Even with the increase in hard money, which I \nthink is a good idea and I voted for, there is no way that will ever \nmake up for the soft dollars lost.\n\n  So what have we done? We haven't taken a penny of money out of \npolitics. We have only taken the parties out of politics--mutual \nassured destruction.\n  What is this new world going to be like without parties? Here was a \nfull-page ad in the paper 2 days ago by a billionaire named Jerome \nKohlberg. He happens to mostly like you all, but we have some \nbillionaires, too. They have a perfect right to spend their money any \nway they want to, and they will. These billionaires are the people who \nare underwriting the reform movement with lavish salaries for these \npeople who are hanging around off the side of the Senate telling us \nthat we ought to squeeze the money out of politics.\n  Welcome to the new world, a battle of billionaires over the political \ndiscourse in this country while we have\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\nmade the political parties impotent; impotent in order to satisfy who? \nThe New York Times, the biggest corporate soft money operation in \nAmerica? The Washington Post, the second biggest corporate soft money \noperation in America? I know you all like them because they are \nsympathetic to you, but there are people on our side, too.\n  This is a massive transfer of speech away from the two great \npolitical parties to the press, to academia, to Hollywood, to \nbillionaires in order to satisfy who? I have often said that this issue \nranks right up there with static cling as a matter of concern to the \nAmerican people.\n  This is a stunningly stupid thing to do, my colleagues. Don't think \nthere is anybody out there to save us from this. I am not going to \nembarrass anybody, but I had a lot of frantic discussions over the \ncourse of the last 2 weeks with my friends on the other side of the \naisle, hoping somebody, somewhere, somehow was going to keep this from \nhappening. There is nobody to come to the rescue. This train is moving \ndown the track.\n  This is my main point, in asking for your attention--and I thank you \nfor being here--this is a candid appraisal. This is not a partisan \nobservation. This is a candid and realistic appraisal of life after \nMcCain-Feingold. I am sure there are very few of you who will believe \nthis is going to improve the political system in America.\n  This bill is going to pass later tonight. If I were a betting man, I \nwould bet it is going to be signed into law. I just wanted to welcome \nyou, my friends, to a 100-percent hard money world.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I inquire, I believe there was a similar \nrequest made to respond to the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There are an \nadditional 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin or the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, I had thought, wanted to be heard on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, let me reserve the time for them. I will take 2 \nminutes and say to my friend and colleague from Kentucky, this is a new \nworld. I accept that description. I wouldn't call it necessarily a \nperfect world, but I think for those of us who support McCain-Feingold, \nwe think this is a far better world than the one we have been engaged \nin over the past number of years, as we have watched the explosion of \nunregulated soft money flow into the political process in this country.\n  Senator Bennett of Utah a little while ago said no one can say for \ncertain where this is going to go. That is true. I think we do \nappreciate, those of us who have supported this legislation, that a \nsystem that is devoid of unregulated soft money, and those of us who \nbelieve that the Snowe-Jeffords provisions and the price we paid by \nincreasing modestly the hard money contributions, make this a better \nsystem than the one we presently are operating under. So, yes, it is a \nnew world.\n  I happen to believe it is a vastly better world and that the American \npublic, who have something to say about this and who have been \ndeclining, as my colleague and friend from Kentucky has pointed out, \ndeclining in their checking off on the 1040 forms of moneys to go into \nthe public coffers to support Presidential elections is a good poll \nabout how the public feels--he says about public financing, I think \nabout politics--I am not certain this is going to change entirely the \npublic mood. I think we are taking a giant step forward with the \nadoption of McCain-Feingold in improving the climate and improving the \npublic's confidence and their respect for the political process in this \ncountry.\n  Yes, it is a new world. I think it is a better world.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Massachusetts and then reserve \nthe remainder for Senator Feingold or Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of the \nSenator from Kentucky. I respect the very direct, open way in which he \nhas stated his opposition, and he has done so on the basis of a belief \nsystem. I respect that. I think we all do.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, there is an analogy that is not \ncompletely inappropriate in the sense that when you have found a way to \ndo things and it works pretty easily and you are sort of swimming in it \nbecause it is easy, it is hard to give it up. It is not unlike an \naddiction in a sense. There has been an easy addiction to this flow of \nmoney.\n  When you look at the amounts of money, from $100 million up to $244 \nbillion in a span of 2 years, dozens of times in excess of the rate of \ninflation, you have to ask: What is going on here?\n  I say to my colleagues, for those who fear this new world that has \nbeen defined, there are alternatives. There are other ways to do this. \nI am proud that I can stand as a Senator in the Senate today, having \ngotten elected a different way.\n  In 1996, the Governor of our State and I mutually agreed to limit the \namount of money we would spend--he, a fervent Republican; me, an ardent \nDemocrat. We both agreed to spend the same amount of money. We both \nagreed that each of us would subtract from our total the amount of \nmoney that any independent expenditure ran in favor of the other person \nor that our parties spent on our behalf. We ran a race that was \nabsolutely free from soft money, from party money. We had nine 1-hour \ntelevised debates, and the public knew us both, probably better than \nthey wanted to, and made a decision.\n  We can all run that way. There is adequate capacity in this new world \nto raise countless amounts of hard dollars.\n  Under McCain-Feingold, we have raised the total amounts of money up \nto about $75,000 over 2 years to party and to individual.\n  Nothing stops one Senator from going out and raising as much hard \nmoney as they can access in a 6-year term, in amounts that have now \nbeen raised to $2,000 a person, which means you can visit one couple, a \nhusband and wife, and you can walk out with $8,000. All of us know that \none-half of 1 percent of the people in America even contribute $1,000 \ncontributions.\n  So this is not a dire new world, a brave new world. This is a world \nthe American people are asking us to live by, and countless business \npeople across this country are sick and tired of us coming to them and \nsaying I need $150,000 or I need $500,000 for my party. They look at \nthe committee you serve on and they feel pressured, whether they say it \nor not. Whether you say it or not, it is an appearance.\n  So I say to colleagues, this is a world we can survive in just fine. \nWith 6 years of incumbency, with all of the power of the incumbent, \nwith all of the times you can return home as a Senator and meet with \nconstituents, there isn't one of us who doesn't start with the natural \nadvantage, even under McCain-Feingold.\n  So I suggest respectfully that this is the right world, the world \nwith which we ought to be living. We should not fear the outcome of \nthis particular change. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nensuring that the Senate has a moment to reflect on the implications of \nthis bill. I think it is very important that we pause to evaluate this \nlegislation, and what it will mean for our parties, and for the voters.\n  As my colleagues might imagine, I take a drastically different view \non effects of this legislation than the Senator from Kentucky. I \nrealize that change can be difficult, and even a little scary, but I \nthink it is a mistake to try to scare Members out of voting for this \nbill. This reform is about increasing the public's faith in our work. \nThis bill doesn't destroy the political parties; it strengthens them by \nending their reliance on a handful of wealthy donors.\n  Parties need money to operate, and under this reform, the national \nparties will be able to raise hard money, just as they have for many \nyears. What they won't be able to do is raise the unlimited amounts of \nsoft money. Just like the parties didn't have much, if any, soft money \nfor much of the 1970s and 1980s.\n  Soft money isn't some magic bullet that the parties need to increase \nvoter\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nturnout or voter participation in the democratic process. Throughout \nmuch of the 1970s and 1980s, soft money was mostly absent from party \nfundraising. The parties raised hard money, and ran their parties on \nhard money. It is easy to forget that when we look at fundraising \ntoday, I know, but it is important to remember as we consider this \nbill. We didn't need soft money then, and we don't need it now; that is \na myth that has been perpetuated, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, \nand it is time to put that myth to rest once and for all.\n  Neither party can thrive when they are beholden to the wealthy few. \nSoft money doesn't strengthen the parties, it undermines the spirit \nthat keeps our parties strong. We all know that people, not soft money, \nare the heart and soul of our political parties.\n  With the soft money system, the parties have been operating outside \nthe spirit of the law, and outside the public trust, for too many \nyears. With this bill, we can return the parties to the people who \nbuilt them in the first place. Our democracy demands vibrant political \nparties. No one believes that more than I do. But soft money has, \nironically, cheapened our parties. I feel that is true in my own party, \nand I am deeply saddened to have to say that. Last spring the \nDemocratic Party held a fundraiser where soft money donors in the arena \nsat down to dinner at lavishly decorated tables, while those who could \nonly afford a cheaper ticket actually sat in the bleachers and watched \nthem enjoy their meal. Is that party-building? I think we all know that \nto say that kind of event strengthens the parties is just absurd.\n  The parties aren't strengthened when people across the country, \nRepublicans and Democrats, pick up the newspaper and read that their \nparty is giving access and favors to the wealthy, while they struggle \nto pay for health care coverage, or they worry about how safe their \ndrinking water is. They pick up the paper and see the parties take \nunlimited money from HMOs and big polluters, and they wonder how in the \nworld could their party really stand up for them when they depend so \ncompletely on a wealthy few? The assumption that we can be bought, or \nthat our parties can be bought, has completely permeated our culture. \nI'd guess that there are few if any Members of this body who haven't \nfaced gone home to face the deep skepticism of their constituents on a \ngiven issue, when people felt like they or their party have been \n``bought off'' by a wealthy interest.\n  Soft money, like perhaps no other abuse of our system in history, \ncreates an appearance of corruption. To demonstrate that, I want to put \nin the record two items of interest. The first are the results of a \npoll conducted just last week by ABC News and the Washington Post. This \npoll found that 74 percent of the public now support stricter laws \ncontrolling the way political campaigns raise and spend money. That is \nan 8 percent increase from just a year ago. The poll had a margin of \nerror of plus or minus 3 percent.\n  More important, however, the same poll found that 80 percent of the \npublic thinks that politicians do special favors for people and groups \nwho give them campaign contributions. And 67 percent consider this a \nbig problem. Seventy-four percent of those who believe that politicians \ndo special favors for donors said they think these favors are \nunethical.\n  This is the appearance of corruption. The assumption that politicians \nare on the take, and that money purchases favors. The ``Coin-Operated \nCongress,'' as Pat Schroeder used to say.\n  I have felt so strongly over the past few years that money is setting \nthe agenda that began to speak on the Senate floor during debates on \nsubstantive legislation about the money flowing from companies and \ngroups interested in that legislation. I have called this the ``Calling \nof the Bankroll,'' and since I started this practice in June of 1999, I \nhave called the bankroll 30 times. I think it is important for us to \nacknowledge that millions of dollars are given in an attempt to \ninfluence what we do. The appearance of corruption is rampant in our \nsystem.\n  I have called the bankroll on mining on public lands, the gun show \nloophole, the defense industry's support of the Super Hornet and the F-\n22, the Y2 K Liability Act, the Passengers' Bill of Rights, MFN for \nChina, PNTR for China, and the tobacco industry. I have talked about \nagriculture interests lobbying on an agriculture appropriations bill, \ntelecommunications interests lobbying on a tower-siting bill, and \nrailroad interests lobbying on a transportation appropriations bill. \nI've talked about contributions surrounding the Financial Services \nModernization Act, nuclear waste policy, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, and the ergonomics issue. I have also called the bankroll on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, twice, the Africa trade bill, twice, the \noil royalties amendment to the fiscal year 2000 Interior Appropriations \nbill, twice, and I have Called the Bankroll on three tax bills, and \nfour separate times on bankruptcy reform legislation.\n  I think it is safe to say that the public doesn't think much of the \ncurrent system, and that soft money plays a big part in the public's \nlack of faith in us and the work we do.\n  One of the most important ways I think this bill can change the \nfundraising culture is not just by stopping soft money fundraising, but \nby stopping soft money fundraising by Members of Congress. Soft money \nfundraising is something that many Members of this body find deeply \ntroubling. How many of Members of the Senate enjoy picking up the phone \nand asking a donor for $100,000? How many Senators feel uncomfortable \nexerting pressure on wealthy interests to come through with big \ncontributions to fuel the fundraising contest between the parties?\n  I have said before that I have had Members tell me they felt like \ntaking a shower after asking for a huge contribution. And I recently \nquoted Senator Miller's Washington Post op-ed, where he said that after \nraising soft money, he felt like ``a cheap prostitute who'd had a busy \nday.'' Haven't we had enough? I think we have. When this body voted 60 \nto 40 against the Hagel amendment, which would have put the Senate's \nstamp of approval on the soft money system, I think we really turned a \ncorner in this debate. We joined the rest of the country in recognizing \nthat this system puts our integrity at risk, and that soft money simply \nisn't worth that risk anymore.\n  This bill will reinvigorate the political process, and it will renew \nfaith in the parties, and in each and every one of us. With the passage \nof this bill, we won't have to face the accusations that our parties \nhave been bought off by soft money. We won't have to read about million \ndollar donations or getaways for hundred thousand dollar donors with \nparty leaders, and neither will our constituents. And that will do \nsomething to improve the public's attitude toward us, and I think it \nwill improve our own feeling about the work that we do. All of us take \npride in our work, and in this institution. But we all face nagging \naccusations that unlimited money plays a role in the legislative \nprocess in which all of us play a part. Today we have a rare chance to \nchange that, and I believe we will.\n  I stand here today before my colleagues to say that soft money isn't \ngood for politics. It is time to stop protecting soft money, or \ndefending it as something that strengthens our parties, or the \npolitical life of the nation. Soft money removes people of average \nmeans from the political process, and replaces them with a handful of \nwealthy interests. So to say that soft money is good for parties is to \nsay that people, the party faithful who should be the lifeblood of a \npolitical party, don't really count anymore. That in the quest for \nunlimited contributions, the parties are willing to forgo the trust of \nthe people they purport to serve. I don't accept that point of view. \nAnd I don't think that most of my colleagues do either. Soft money does \na disservice to the work of this Senate, it does a disservice to our \nparties, and most of all, it does a grave disservice to the American \npeople. So let us come together to end the soft money system, and \ndispel the tired myth that soft money is good for democracy once and \nfor all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chart detailing the times I have \ncalled the bankroll be included in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n\n\n                                           THE CALLING OF THE BANKROLL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Bankroll of PAC and Soft\n   Date              Legislation/Issue               Money Contributions                    Forum\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  5/20/99  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations  PACs associated with the  Senate floor statement given live,\n            Conf.

Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of that time. \nLet me turn to our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for the \npurpose of offering an amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before that, I believe Senator \nSpecter's amendment is pending. He expects to have the next Republican \namendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Specter amendment be temporarily \nlaid aside so we can go to Senator Bingaman. Senator Specter will come \nafter that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleagues very much. I have two amendments, \nthe first of which I believe is acceptable to the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 157\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 157.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Presidential Inaugural Committee to disclose \ndonations and prohibit foreign nationals from making donations to such \n                               Committee)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this is a noncontroversial amendment \nthat would simply require that contributions made to a Presidential \ninaugural committee be publicly disclosed, and also it would require \nthat the same rules that govern foreign contributions to our political \ncampaigns be applied as well to inaugural events.\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\n  As I understand it, this is an acceptable amendment. At this time, I \nbelieve we are prepared to go ahead and vote on this by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the amendment?\n  Mr. REID. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield back his \ntime?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment is acceptable to us. I \nyield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 157) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has asked that \nhe be given permission to speak for 4 or 5 minutes before I offer this \namendment. I am certainly pleased to do that. I will yield the floor to \nhim at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner, Mr. Allen, and Mrs. Boxer, are located in \ntoday's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 158\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer another amendment. I \nsend the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Specter amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 158.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide candidates for election to Federal office with the \n opportunity to respond to negative political advertisements sponsored \n                           by noncandidates)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I am here for two reasons: First, to \nexpress my strong support for the bill we have been considering this \nweek and last, this bipartisan campaign finance reform bill which we \nhave come to refer to as the McCain-Feingold bill; second, I am here to \noffer this amendment which I believe will further improve the bill.\n  Our colleague from Kentucky said, as he gave his short statement a \nfew minutes ago, now that all the important amendments have already \nbeen offered and dealt with, he wanted to go ahead with his comments. I \nbeg to differ with him on that conclusion, that all the important \namendments have been offered. This amendment I am offering today I \nbelieve is very important, and I believe it will substantially improve \nthis legislation. It will help to address the increasingly negative \nnature of today's campaign advertising, and it will assist those \ncandidates, whether they are challengers or incumbents, in responding \nto that negative advertising.\n  The debate we are engaged in is long overdue. Congress has not \nrevised its campaign finance laws in any meaningful way since I came to \nthe Congress in 1983. The last significant reform of campaign finance \nlaws was in 1974. Nearly everything about campaigns has changed \nradically since 1974, from the tremendous amount of money that has been \nspent on campaigns to the technologies and methods used to communicate \nwith voters.\n  I congratulate Senator McCain, my colleague from Arizona, and I \ncongratulate Senator Feingold, my colleague from Wisconsin, on their \ndetermination in finally bringing this bill to the Senate floor. I can \nthink of no two individuals in recent memory who have worked harder on \na bipartisan basis in pursuit of basic reform than these two Senators.\n  They have traveled the country, one of them, of course, during the \ntime he was running for President. They have taken the campaign finance \nreform message to every corner of this country. We all in this Senate, \nin my view, owe them a debt of gratitude. I hope our effort is worthy \nof their significant effort. It has been a true labor of genuine reform \nin the interest of better and cleaner democracy, and I am very pleased \nto cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, turning to the amendment I have offered, it is a \nrelatively simple amendment. It proposes to accomplish a central goal, \nand that is to provide candidates for Federal office who are confronted \nwith sham negative issue ads the opportunity to respond to those ads.\n  The amendment states that if a broadcast station, whether it is a \ntelevision station or radio station, permits any person or group to \nbroadcast material opposing or attacking a legally qualified candidate \nfor Federal office, then that station, within a reasonable period of \ntime, must provide, at no charge to the candidate who has been \nattacked, an equal opportunity to respond to those attacks.\n  This requirement would apply in this same period that is discussed in \nthe legislation pending before us in the so-called Snowe-Jeffords \nlanguage; that is, 60 days prior to a general election, 30 days prior \nto a primary election. It is in those two periods of time that the \nrequirements apply.\n  All of us who have run for Federal office in recent years have been \nin the situation about which I am concerned. As a candidate, you are \nout on the hustings; you are conducting a campaign that you hope is \naddressing the issues voters care about; you are trying to give the \npeople in your State, or the people in your congressional district, the \nbest vision you can for where this country should go, what should be \ndone in the State; and you turn on the television in your hotel room \nand see an ad attacking you for some issue on some basis that you \nprobably did not anticipate. You ask yourself the questions: Who is \npaying for the ad? Who is this group? Who do they represent? Where did \nthey get the information that they are using in this attack?\n\n  The process leaves the candidate, more often than not, unfairly \naccused of a position. It leaves voters increasingly cynical about the \ngrowing negative nature of our campaigns.\n  Unfortunately, this is the new world of campaigns in which we live. \nThis is true whether you are Republican, whether you are Democrat, \nwhatever your party affiliation, regardless if you are a challenger or \nincumbent.\n  Through the loopholes in our current campaign finance laws, outside \ninterest groups and political parties are funding\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\nhundreds of thousands of dollars worth of political ads in many of our \nStates. Most of those are very negative and have minimal issue content. \nMost of those ads flood our airwaves right before the election when \nthey will have the biggest impact on the minds of the voters.\n  As noted, congressional authority Norm Ornstein said these ads often \ndominate and drown our candidate communications, particularly in the \nlast weeks of the campaign. While the ads are often effective in a raw \nand practical sense, they are incredibly corrosive; they are frequently \nunfair; they are sometimes very personal in the attacks they make; and \nthey breed voter cynicism and voter apathy toward the electoral \nprocess.\n  We know all too well the gross aspects of the advertising, but now, \nthanks to a number of dedicated reform-minded groups and academicians, \nwe have some real data to back up what we have all known as a matter of \ncommon sense for some time. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU, New \nYork University, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison have teamed \nup to develop a national database of political television advertising \nfrom the 2000 election cycle. They monitored political advertising in \nthe Nation's top 75 media markets, and researchers, through that \nmonitoring, have documented the frequency, the content, and the costs \nof television ads in the 2000 election, which duplicates a similar \nstudy they conducted in 1998.\n  The findings are stunning. Let me give a brief summary of what they \nfound. First, the independent groups alone spent, conservatively \nestimated, about $98 million on media buys for political TV commercials \nin the year 2000. That is roughly a sixfold increase from what they \nspent 2 years before. This is not an inflationary increase; this is a \nsixfold increase in spending by the independent groups on these ads.\n  Second, in the 2000 Presidential election, voters received the \nlargest share of political advertising messages from independent groups \nand party committees, not from the candidates themselves or from the \ncandidate's committees.\n  Third, while all of the unregulated issue ads produced by the parties \nand independent groups are supposed to theoretically cover issue \npositions, since they do not contain these so-called magic words that \nthere has been a lot of discussion about on the Senate floor in the \nlast 2 weeks, the words ``noted by the Supreme Court in the Buckley \ndecision,'' the public does not see these as issue ads. Virtually all \nads sponsored by party committees are viewed as electioneering ads. \nWithin 60 days of the election, 86 percent of the ads produced by \nindependent groups are viewed by voters as electioneering. They are not \nseen as issue ads.\n  Fourth, the chart from the Brennan Center dramatically makes the \npoint I am trying to make; the sham issue ads that are run by these \ngroups become increasingly negative in tone as election day approaches. \nIssue ads by independent groups are far more likely than candidate ads \nor even party ads to attack candidates. Fully 72 percent of the issue \ngroup ads aired in Federal races last year directly attacked one of the \ncandidates in the race in which they were run.\n\n  This chart is entitled ``Growth of Negative Tone of Electioneering \nIssue Ads as Election Day Nears.'' There are three lines on this chart. \nOne is the red line which represents the attack ads. This is according \nto the Brennan Center study. The green line is the contrast ads. The \nblue line is the ads to promote a particular candidate, positive \nadvertising, ``vote for me, I'm your best candidate,'' on Social \nSecurity, Medicare, or whatever issue.\n  Finally, the Brennan Center notes that issue ads that are targeted at \ncandidates are decisively negative in tone and pursue the tact of \nattacking a candidate's character. These ads do not discuss substantive \nissues; they often focus on personal histories of the candidate.\n  The dramatic thing about the chart, which covers the period from \nJanuary to the beginning of November of the year 2000, the negative ads \nare virtually nonexistent, very low level negative ads, until June; and \nthen in the last couple of months of the campaign, the negative ads \noverwhelm the rest of the advertising. These are the negative ads that \nare being run almost exclusively by the independent groups--not by the \ncandidate. The candidates do not want to be associated with negative \nads, so they stay out of this and let the independent groups run the \nvery negative ads.\n  I believe this study I have referred to provides the hard data to \nback up what we have all known for some time. That is, that sham issue \nads are increasing sevenfold each election. They are casting a negative \nand personal tone to campaigns and are particularly effective and \ndominant in the last few weeks before election day. There is not a \nvoter in any one of our States who would not validate these findings \nfrom their personal experience of watching television or listening to \nthe radio. I heard this refrain from people in my State of New Mexico \nconstantly during the last campaign cycle. They thought the airwaves \nwere clogged with ads and that the majority of them were too negative. \nThe complaint is constant by the public. It is well justified.\n  That brings me back to the amendment I am offering. Again, the \namendment is straightforward. Let me make it very clear to people what \nthe amendment does not do. First of all, the amendment does not in any \nway restrict the ability of any candidate to run any ad they want. It \ndoes not put on broadcasters, radio or television broadcasters any \nobligation with regard to those ads, except to run the ads, obviously. \nThat obligation is already there. The amendment does not affect ads \nsponsored by the candidate or the candidate's committee.\n  Second, the amendment does nothing to restrict either the candidate \nor a party or an independent group from running any and all ads they \nwant that are positive or that are contrast ads. On the chart, the \ngreen lines are contrast ads and the blue line is for ads that promote \nthe candidate. We are in no way talking about those in this amendment. \nThere is no requirement on broadcasters to take any action with regard \nto those. They can take those ads sponsored by anybody they want \nwithout incurring any obligation.\n  In the case of an independent group or a party that wants to run \nattack ads, which they are free to do, there is no prohibition against \nrunning attack ads, if they want to run attack ads. The broadcasters \nwho run those ads then have an obligation to provide the candidate who \nis attacked with an opportunity to respond. This is a level playing \nfield kind of amendment. We are saying to broadcasters, if you want to \naccept these attack ads during these short periods of time, 30 days \nprior to a primary, 60 days prior to a general election, you are not \nrequired to, of course; there is no obligation under the Constitution \nor anything else that you accept ads from noncandidates; but if you \nwant to accept these ads, fine, just provide an opportunity for the \ncandidate who is attacked to respond.\n  That is what the amendment does. I think it is a straightforward \namendment. The reason I am offering it is because I believe it will \nhelp improve this bill in a very dramatic way.\n  It will say to all candidates, whether they are challengers or \nwhether they are incumbents in the office, that there will be an \nopportunity for them to respond when they are unfairly attacked.\n  The Brennan Center report--let me quote from that report:\n\n       Candidate ads are much more inclined than group sponsored \n     ads to promote candidates or to compare and contrast \n     candidates on issues. Conversely, issue ads that are \n     sponsored by groups tend to attack candidates and attempt to \n     denigrate their character. These ads tend to be very negative \n     in tone. They do not discuss substantive issues and \n     frequently they focus on personal histories of the candidate. \n     As election day nears, electioneering issue ads become \n     increasingly negative and personal in tone.\n\n  That is what this graph demonstrates. That is why this red line goes \nup and up and up as you get closer to the election.\n  I hope very much we can agree to this amendment. While McCain-\nFeingold's legislation goes to the very heart of the issue that plagues \nus today, the soft money loophole that has allowed sham issue ads to \nproliferate, I believe outside groups will continue to run those ads \nand this brand of negative issue advocacy is, unfortunately, here to \nstay. In that environment, I believe it is essential we provide a way \nto hold outside groups accountable for the content of the ads\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nthey run by providing the opportunity for candidates who are the \ntargets of the ads to respond no matter how poorly or how well their \ncampaigns may be funded.\n  That is what the amendment does. I commend it to the consideration of \nmy colleagues. I think it will substantially improve the legislation \nbefore us. I hope it will be favorably voted on.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank our colleague from New Mexico \nfor proposing this amendment. All of us here, and those who pay any \nattention at all to politics in this country and are confronted with \nthis, as most Americans are, if you look at this chart by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, particularly in that August, September, October period \nof an election year, it is hard not to be confronted with the assault--\nthat is the only way to describe this--of ads on television from one \nend of the country to the next, on every imaginable radio station, \ntelevision station, now cable stations--this bombardment that occurs.\n  What the Senator from New Mexico has graphically demonstrated with \nhis chart is that the overwhelming majority of these ads are the so-\ncalled attack ads. Usually, they are very vicious, designed to not \npromote one's ideas nor one's vision, one's agenda--if they are elected \nto Congress or the Senate or the Presidency or some other office--but \nmerely to try to convince the rest of us why you ought to be against \nsomeone; not why you ought to be for me but why you ought to be against \nmy opponent.\n  The least enlightening part of a campaign is the proliferation of \nthese ads. They do nothing, in my view, to contribute to the education, \nthe awareness of the American people. We have seen an explosion of them \nover the past few years. I suspect this has probably been in the last 6 \nor 7 years, with the explosion of soft money that the McCain-Feingold \nbill seeks to shut down.\n  As I understand, we are not talking about ads where candidate X goes \nafter candidate Y--an individual candidate making a case, although I \nhave problems with that as well, but what the Senator from New Mexico \nis talking about are these issue-based ads where they get away with it \nby merely not putting in a line at the end--they don't say at the end \n``vote for,'' ``vote against,'' but that is hardly a necessary tag line \nafter they have proceeded to just destroy your reputation and probably \nthat of your families and your neighborhood, and any pets you may have \nas well.\n  These are designed to be sort of nuclear bombs on people. We have all \nseen them. Some of them are almost laughable they are so bad, and I \nsuspect the damage may be minimal because they are so bad. \nUnfortunately, many of them are very effective.\n  The theory works, again, if I can get you to hurt my opponent or hurt \nsomeone whom I think may be inimicable to my special interest, you are \nmore likely to vote for the person you know less about or nothing \nabout. So this has become a standard diet to which the American public \nis subjected every late summer and fall of an election year.\n  As I understand it, what the Senator from New Mexico attempts to do \nis address these issue-based ads, ads not from a specified opponent \nbut, rather, from one of these amorphous organizations that, up to now, \nhave had unlimited sources of revenue to come in and destroy a \nreputation without having any fingerprints. You can't find out who \ncontributes the money; you can't find out where they come from; usually \nyour opponent says I know nothing about them; in many cases the \nopponent will hold a press conference to disavow that ad and say I \ndeplore that kind of advertising, while simultaneously winking and \nallowing this process to go forward, distorting the political process.\n  The Senator from New Mexico makes a very valid point in his \namendment. It is something we are getting further and further away \nfrom, by the way. The airwaves in this country belong to the American \npublic. We give people the privilege to utilize those air waves for the \nbenefit of the American public. It is not a right; it is a privilege. \nIt is a limited privilege, based on your sense of responsibility. That \nprivilege or that license can be removed if you abuse it.\n\n  There are numerous examples, almost on a daily basis, where that \nhappens. What the Senator from New Mexico, as I understand it, is \nsuggesting is that if, in your discretion as a radio station or \ntelevision station, you decide to tolerate this kind of political \nadvertising, knowing full well how damaging it can be, then we have the \nright to say to that station you must extend to that candidate an \nopportunity to respond to that kind of garbage.\n  I think this has value. It will have the net effect of ending these \nissue-based ads that destroy people's reputations and destroy any sense \nof understanding of what that particular campaign may be about. To that \nextent, everyone is benefitted--not the candidate so much, in my view, \nbut the voting public who may learn more about what people stand for, \nrather than what some issue group dislikes about a candidate.\n  I am attracted to this amendment. I think it contributes to McCain-\nFeingold. Obviously, there are questions that will be raised about \nconstitutionality. My friend and colleague is a brilliant lawyer. He \nunderstands it well. He has crafted it about as tightly as you can to \nachieve the desired result. I think it is worthy of our support.\n  I look forward at the time this comes up for a vote to support it. I \nurge my colleagues to do so as well. We are all sick and tired of this.\n  I go back to the point I made earlier. We are seeing a declining \nlevel of participation too often in the political life of our country. \nHow sad I think all of us are when we see that. There are a myriad of \nreasons for it, but one of the major reasons is this growing disgust \npeople have over the low level of debate, the way campaigns are \nconducted. It is all done now on television and radio; most of it in \nnegative ads, as this graph so graphically points out.\n  We wonder why only one out of every two eligible adult Americans \nparticipated in the national elections of this past fall. Fifty percent \nof adult eligible Americans stayed home. I know some may have done so \nfor legitimate personal reasons. I suspect a significant majority of \nthose who stayed home did so because they are fed up. They are fed up \nwith the process. They think it is out of control, and one of the \nstrongest pieces of evidence of that is this: a deluge of negative ads \nthat have swamped the airwaves of this country and have the net effect \nof depressing turnout of the vote and disgusting the American public.\n  I think the Senator from New Mexico has offered a very constructive \nsuggestion with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisles to be supportive of it.\n  I see my friend from Arizona is still here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in behalf of the Senator from Kentucky, I \nyield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nappreciate very much what the Senator from New Mexico is attempting to \ndo. He has identified very eloquently an enormous problem that we have \nwith these so-called attack ads which we don't know who paid for and \nwhich are clearly not identified. With passage of McCain-Feingold, I \nthink we will make some progress in that area.\n  I say that also as a person who supports free television time for \ncandidates. I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that when a \nbroadcast station obtains a license, they sign a piece of paper that \nsays they will act in the public interest. I think that Americans \nbelieve free television time for candidates can be very helpful.\n  But this amendment raises many troublesome issues that I, frankly, \ncan't quite fathom.\n  First of all, who would determine if an ad was indeed a negative ad? \nIs there going to be a censorship board? Is there going to be a group \nof Americans who say, OK, watch all of these ads and see which one is \nnegative and which one is not? Is an ad that says: Call your Senator--\nwhich I have seen many\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\ntimes--and ask him or her to save Social Security a negative ad or a \npositive ad?\n  I don't know who makes this determination as to what is indeed a \nnegative ad. Is it the argument of every candidate I have ever known \nthat says that wasn't a negative ad; I was trying to inform the people \nof my district or State about the fact that my challenger is a baby \nkiller?\n  It is very difficult to define what a negative ad is. Suppose we had \nsome organization that could determine that this is a negative ad. What \nif a broadcaster had already sold all their television time? It is the \nlast week of the campaign. It is certainly not unusual that a \nbroadcaster has sold all of their television time in the last 2 or 3 \nweeks. Do they have to pull ads off the air and replace them with the \nads that are mandated by this legislation? I am not sure how you do \nthat either, especially in a Presidential election year. That is time \nalready sold.\n  So the night before the election or 3 days before the election, I \nsay: Wait a minute. My opponent is running attack ads. Now you have to \nrun three times that many on my behalf or against them. However, they \nsay: I am sorry. We have sold all of our time.\n  What is your option then? Suppose they had some television time. What \nis fair ad placement? Reruns of ``Gilligan's Island'' at 2 a.m. or is \nit the evening news? I don't know exactly. One station maybe has a \nhigher rating than the other station. You are going to give me the \nlocal channel 365 versus the CBS, ABC, NBC, or FOX Network.\n  This is very difficult to work out. I am a little surprised that the \nSenator from Connecticut didn't look at some of these problems.\n  I want to repeat. I am for free television time for candidates. I \ndetest the negative advertising. I think it is one of the worst things \nthat has ever happened in American politics, that we have these \nunnamed, unknown groups calling themselves by some attractive name and \nbuy millions of dollars of advertising, and they basically viciously \nattack their opponents.\n  Who decides that?\n  Many years ago, I reminded the Senator from Connecticut they had a \nboard in Hollywood that used to make decisions as to what was \nacceptable and not acceptable. They had problems. I don't know who is \ngoing to be doing that.\n  I want to work with the Senator from New Mexico. I think we have to \ndo something about these negative ads. I tell you the best way is to \ndry up their money, and what you don't dry up fully disclose.\n  I want to work with the Senator from New Mexico. I would like to sit \ndown and see how we could work this out. But in its present form, I am \njust not sure how this amendment can possibly be workable.\n  Finally, I want to say that we just had a major vote, as we all know. \nWe have amendments that are still outstanding.\n  I know Senator McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, will be back \nfairly soon. I understand they have a minimal number of amendments. I \nstill think we can get done in a relatively short period of time.\n  I hope all Senators who have amendments will come over so we can \nstart putting these amendments in order and so we can get time \nagreements, and perhaps not just time agreements but agree to \namendments that are satisfactory to both sides so we can wind up all of \nthis.\n  It is not that I am getting fatigued, but it is that we are sort of \nat a point now where we should bring this to a closure, and I hope we \ncan do that.\n  Reluctantly, at the appropriate time I will be moving to table the \nBingaman amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in behalf of the Senator from Kentucky, I \nyield such time as the Senator from Wisconsin may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Not only is this amendment well-intentioned, but it is offered by \nsomebody who anyone in the Senate knows is not only one of the most \ndecent but one of the best Members of this body.\n  Since I have been here, no one has been easier to work with and \nkinder to me than the Senator from New Mexico. I really appreciate the \ntime which he had for me and Senator McCain. He has been a totally \nstalwart supporter of reform every year, and has been there on every \nkey vote in this debate. I thank him also for the amendment which we \nadopted that requires disclosure of Presidential inaugural funds. That \nis exactly the kind of thing we are trying to accomplish in this effort \nso the public can be fully informed of what is going on with all of \nthese venues where large amounts of money can have a negative impact on \nsome of our most sacred public traditions.\n  That was an important addition to the bill and will result in more \ninformation being available to the public of who is giving large sums \nof money to the inaugural events.\n  Reluctantly, I will oppose this amendment.\n  The bill addresses a number of problems with our system which the \nSenator from Connecticut correctly pointed out must be addressed. It is \na problem that deserves more study. I don't think this particular \napproach is one that I am quite ready to accept. I am willing to look \nat it some more.\n  So I will be taking the same position as the Senator from Arizona, \nbut with a willingness and desire to continue to work on this issue and \nthis idea in the future.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for all of his support.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was going to respond to some of the things \nthe Senator said.\n  Let me also in response to my good friend from Arizona say that there \nare a number of amendments that Members have that have been coming over \nwith great regularity over the last 2 weeks. I have been sitting here \nfor 2 straight weeks. We have had very few quorum calls. I have been \nasking the indulgence of my colleagues to postpone their offering of \namendments over the past 2 weeks while we considered some of these \nother amendments, such as the ones that we most recently rejected \ndealing with severability. But these are serious amendments.\n  Like any other issue, I suppose, depending upon whether it is your \namendment or someone else's amendment, it becomes more serious or less \nserious.\n  But I know my colleagues from Michigan, from Florida, and Illinois, \nalso my colleague from Minnesota, among others, have some amendments, \nsome of which will probably be agreed to. My hope is that certainly \nwill be the case. But others may require a little debate. I apologize \nto them because I don't want them to think this is going to be a rush \ndeal. If they want to be heard, they are going to be heard. I bear some \nresponsibility for having told them to wait while we considered some of \nthese other amendments.\n  I promise you, I am not going to then ask you to somehow be on a fast \ntrack here when you want your amendment considered and debated \nadequately. My hope is you will be able to do it in less amounts of \ntime than we have allocated for every amendment. You get 3 hours if you \nwant it, unless you yield back time or the opponents do. We ought to \ntry to move along if we can. I want you to know, I think your \namendments are serious and they deserve to be heard, debated, and voted \nupon, if you so desire.\n  I apologize for having asked you to wait for a week and a half and \nwant you to know that you will have adequate consideration for your \ntime.\n  I turn to my colleague from New Mexico to respond to any of the \nunfair accusations that have been made about his stunning amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the courtesy of all \nMembers, particularly the Senator from Connecticut and his statement in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  There were several questions raised. Let me be clear so there is no \nconfusion about this. If an independent group or a party committee or \nanybody else wants to run an advertisement endorsing or supporting a \ncandidate for office, this amendment does nothing to restrict that, \nprohibit it, impose obligations on broadcasters, or anything else. That \nis perfectly appropriate. If anybody wants to take an ad out for my \nopponent and run ads in favor of\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nmy opponent, they should be able to do that.\n  If they want to run ads that contrast my opponent's position with my \nposition, that would be these ads that are reflected by the green line \non the chart, it is entirely appropriate, no obligation on the part of \nbroadcasters. This amendment only deals with advertisements which \nattack or oppose a legally qualified candidate.\n  The question has been raised by the Senator from Arizona, who will \ndecide whether this is a negative ad, whether this is an ad that \nattacks or opposes a candidate for public office. My initial reaction \nis to refer to Justice Stewart's great comment when he was told that he \ncould not define ``pornography.'' He said: I may not be able to define \nit, but I know it when I see it. Government can regulate pornography \nbecause of that. The American people know a negative television ad or a \nnegative radio ad when they see it or hear it. The answer to who will \ndecide initially, the person who will decide is the candidate who is \nbeing attacked or the candidate's campaign who is being attacked; they \nwould detect an advertisement that is attacking them by a group is \nbeing run by a broadcasting station and they would presumably go to \nthat broadcasting station and say, this is an advertisement that falls \nwithin the definition of this statute and we would like our time to \nrespond. That is how it would work.\n\n  We have been very specific about what kinds of ads they would be \nentitled to respond to, what kinds of ads they would reply to. The term \n``attacked'' or ``opposed'' means, with respect to a clearly identified \ncandidate, first, A, any expression of unmistakable and unambiguous \nopposition to the candidate. So that is pretty easy to determine. You \ncan listen to an advertisement on radio. You can see an advertisement \non television and determine whether it is, in fact, an unmistakable and \nunambiguous statement in opposition to the candidate. Or, B, if it does \nnot fall within that description, it would be any communication that \ncontains a phrase such as ``vote against,'' ``defeat'' or ``reject'' or \ncampaign slogan or words that when taken as a whole and with limited \nreference to external events, such as proximity to the election, can \nhave no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the defeat of one or \nmore clearly identified candidates, regardless of whether or not the \ncommunication expressly advocates a vote against the candidate.\n  If it could have no reasonable meaning other than to advocate the \ndefeat of the candidate, then it is an advertisement that would entitle \nthe candidate who is being attacked or being opposed the opportunity to \nrespond. That is, we have given a tight definition. It would be up to \nthe candidate or his campaign, first of all, to identify that such an \nad is running, and then they would presumably go to the broadcast \nstation and say: Look, this is what this advertisement is. I should get \nequal time to respond.\n  Of course, the broadcast station at that point has to either say yes \nor no. If they say no, then of course it goes, as all other matters in \nour society, to some judge, presumably. If the candidate wants to push \nthe issue, the judge will decide whether the candidate should have the \nright to respond on that station.\n  A second objection that was raised is, what if the station in \nquestion has already sold all their time. If they have sold all their \ntime, and some of it, of course, to the organization that is running \nthe attack ads, they would have to make room for the candidate to \nrespond during the time period between then and the election on a basis \nthat would be considered equal. He asked: What is fair in ad placement? \nAnd we have used general language here that the candidate would be \nentitled to respond for the same amount of time during the same period \nof the day and week as was used by the person who is doing the attack.\n  I am sure there are details of this that will be debated and \ndiscussed, if this becomes law, as there always is in every piece of \nlegislation we pass. It is pretty clear what we are talking about. We \nare talking about a limited time period, 30 days before a primary, 60 \ndays before a general election. We are talking about ads that involve \nattacking or opposing a candidate for Federal office, and we are \nproviding a pretty precise definition of what ``attack'' or ``oppose'' \nmeans for purposes of this statute applying.\n  I believe this would be an enforceable provision. It would be an \nunderstandable provision. I think it would add greatly to the quality \nof the campaigns that we run in this country. It would be fair to the \ncandidates in the sense that they would have the opportunity to \nrespond. That is all we are saying.\n  In this country, we used to have a fairness doctrine. I know that has \nbecome something of a dead letter, but there used to be an obligation \non the part of broadcasters to provide equal time for people to respond \nwhen there were particularly controversial positions taken and attacks. \nThis is not a fairness doctrine, but this is the same basic concept.\n  When a candidate has been qualified to run for Federal office, \nclearly that candidate is fair game for any attack that the candidate's \nopponent or opponents want to make. There is no obligation on any \nbroadcaster who wants to take those ads by opponents of that candidate. \nBut if the candidate is attacked or opposed by people who are not in \nthe race, by organizations that are not part of the campaign, then that \nis where the candidate should, once again, be given a chance to \nrespond.\n  I believe it is a good amendment. I hope very much we can get a \nfavorable vote on it. I know my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, \nhad indicated earlier he might want to make some comments in reference \nto this amendment. I don't know if he is prepared to do that at this \npoint or if I should yield back my time. I will withhold at this point \nand yield the floor so my colleague from Nevada can speak on the issue.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, everything that I \ncould have said, he said. Anything that I wanted to say, he has said, \nand has done it much better than I could have. Based upon that, I think \nwe should vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Kentucky, I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from New \nMexico, I am in total sympathy of what the Senator's intent is. Let's \ngo back into the language of his amendment:\n\n       The term ``attack or oppose'' means, with respect to a \n     clearly identified candidate--\n       (A) any expression of unmistakable and unambiguous \n     opposition to the candidate.\n\n  Does that mean if I took out an ad and I say I am a better candidate \nthan Mr. Smith and I am opposed to him, is that an attack ad? That is \nthe first definition.\n\n       Any expression of unmistakable and unambiguous opposition \n     to the candidate.\n\n  If I am running and I am a better candidate and I oppose him, we are \nnot going to be able to run an ad that says I oppose Senator Smith or \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I just point out to the Senator that this legislation \nwould not apply at all to any candidate who wanted to run an ad such as \nthe Senator has proposed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Suppose it is the Sierra Club that says we oppose Senator \nMcCain. That is an attack ad? They can't say that?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again, if the Senator will yield, they \nwould certainly be able to run that ad. But if they say we oppose \nSenator McCain, then Senator McCain should have an opportunity to come \non and say, ``I believe people should still vote for me'' in spite of \nthe fact that the Sierra Club, or whoever, opposes him.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So any organization in America that opposes me, no matter \nif it is in the mildest terms, and supports my opponent, therefore, I \nhave the right to go get free television time. I don't quite understand \nthat, frankly. I think what you are doing, probably--the effect would \nbe, one, that the broadcast stations probably would not sell time \nbecause of the requirement to respond, which is, by the way, what \nhappened in the fairness doctrine. What happened in the fairness \ndoctrine, which was a good idea, was that broadcast stations decided \nnot to air any controversial opinion because somebody was going to say, \n``I have another opinion and I have to have free\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\ntime.'' That led to the demise of the fairness doctrine.\n  If someone runs an ad and says, ``I oppose Senator McCain,'' I don't \nthink that should necessarily trigger free television commercial time \nfor me.\n  Let me just continue, if I might. The Senator said this is not unlike \nthe ability of the State to control pornography. The reason the Court \ndecided that we had a right, as far as child pornography was concerned, \nis that it was a compelling State interest. I don't think you can make \nthe same argument in respect to television time or attack ads.\n  Part B says:\n\n       Any communication that contains a phrase such as ``vote \n     against,'' ``defeat,'' or ``reject--\n\n  Boy, we better get out the dictionary because there is a great deal \nof ambiguity of words. I have ``concerns'' about the candidacy of \nSenator Smith. Well, is that in opposition to? Words ``such as,'' I \nthink, are hard. Again, I get back to my fundamental point. It says in \nthe amendment:\n\n       (Such as proximity to an election) can have no reasonable \n     meaning other than to advocate the defeat of one or more \n     clearly identified candidates.\n\n  Who decides that? The Senator says you go to the station and get free \ntime and, if not, you go to a judge. Now you are asking a judge to look \nat every commercial, or you are asking the broadcast station to look at \nevery commercial and make some decision as to whether it is an attack \nad or not. I will tell you if I were on the station, I would say never \nmind; why should I take a risk when I am not sure this ad is an attack \nad or not.\n\n  This is the problem we had when we have gone over and over and over \nthis issue. How do you stop these attack ads without infringing on \nfreedom of speech and not being so vague that it is very difficult to \nstand constitutional muster? The difference between Snowe-Jeffords and \nthis amendment is that Snowe-Jeffords draws a very bright line and it \nsays:\n\n       Show the likeness or mention the name of a candidate.\n\n  That is a very bright line. This is a campaign slogan or words that, \nwhen taken as a whole and with limited reference to external events, \nsuch as ``proximity to an election''--these words--I admit to the \nSenator from New Mexico, I am not a lawyer, but I have been involved so \nlong and so engaged in these issues that words do have meaning, and \nthis amendment is very vague.\n  I am sure we can make a judgment on a lot of ads we have seen and the \nsame ads the Senator and I find disgusting and distasteful and should \nbe rejected. But at the same time, I don't know how we can say, OK, if \nthis station doesn't run my ads, I am going to go to a judge and have \nthe judge make them run my ads. It just is something that would be very \ndifficult.\n  I would love to work with the Senator from New Mexico. He has been a \nsteadfast stalwart for campaign finance reform. I would love to work \nwith him to try to achieve this goal. Frankly, after going around and \naround on this issue, identifying who paid for the ad, full disclosure \nand, frankly, not allowing corporations and unions to contribute to \npaying for these things in the last 60, 90 days, which is part of our \nlegislation, is about the only constitutional way that we thought we \ncould address the issue.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico. He is addressing an issue that \nhas demeaned and degraded all of us because people don't think very \nmuch of you when they see the kinds of attack ads that are broadcast on \na routine basis.\n  As the Senator pointed out, they are dramatically on the increase. I \nwill tell you what. You cut off the soft money, you are going to see a \nlot less of that. Prohibit unions and corporations, and you will see a \nlot less of that. If you demand full disclosure for those who pay for \nthose ads, you are going to see a lot less of that because people who \ncan remain anonymous or organizations that can remain anonymous are \nobviously much more likely to be a lot looser with the facts than those \nwhose names and identity have to be fully disclosed to the people once \na certain level of investment is made.\n  I thank the Senator and I regret having to oppose his amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments. I understand the concerns he has raised. Let me make one \nthing very clear. Snowe-Jeffords is a prohibition against certain acts \nby certain groups. Now, that is a very different kettle of fish than \nwhat I am proposing.\n  My amendment does not in any way prohibit anyone from running ads. \nAll my amendment says is that if an independent group wants to run an \nad that attacks or opposes a candidate, then the candidate is entitled \nto an opportunity to respond to the ad.\n  That is a very different thing than saying, during certain periods of \ntime, groups cannot run ads. So I think the constitutional problem that \npeople have raised with regard to Snowe-Jeffords is much less of a \nconcern than the kind of amendment that I have proposed.\n  This amendment is designed to deal with a particular type of \nadvertisement run by groups other than the candidate and the \ncandidate's committee during certain periods of time. I think we have \nclearly defined what we are talking about. There are many \nadvertisements that would not fall within the definition of attacking \nor opposing a candidate. Certainly, there is nothing here that would in \nany way obligate broadcasters, when they take those kinds of ads. But \nwhen they are running ads that do attack or oppose a candidate, then \nthey would be under an obligation to provide an opportunity to respond. \nI think that is eminently fair, constitutional, and consistent with the \ngeneral obligation that I believe broadcast stations ought to have to \npresent both sides of an issue during a campaign when a candidate has \nbecome qualified for a Federal office. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless the Senator from Arizona has more \ntime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I be recognized?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again I thank the Senator from New Mexico. \nHe has identified a very serious issue. I want to work with him on this \nissue. It is important because his graph dramatically illustrates the \nmagnitude of the problem.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is trying to address one of the most \nserious issues that affects American politics today and makes us much \ndiminished in the eyes of our constituents and the people around the \ncountry.\n  I really do applaud the Senator from New Mexico on this issue. At the \nappropriate time, I will move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of my colleague \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, we are in the process of hotlining the \nvote. If it is all right with my friend from Arizona, the vote on or in \nrelation to the Bingaman amendment can begin at 5 of 6. A couple of \npeople are having meals, and this will give them a chance to get \nonline.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on or in relation to the \nBingaman amendment commence at 5 of 6.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, to take \nplace at 5:55 p.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may we ask for the yeas and nays at this \ntime? Is it an appropriate request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is an appropriate request.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table \ncommencing at 5 of 6.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to make a statement and engage \nin a colloquy with my colleague, Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May we ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I spoke about this amendment last week \nthat I had introduced to try to correct an inequity in the law we \npassed last year that required State and local candidates to file with \nthe IRS as a 527 political organization. I think the purpose of this \nwas not to affect State and local candidates who have no involvement in \na Federal election. I think we did intend to include any PAC that might \nhave an influence on a Federal election.\n  I worked with Senator Lieberman, Senator McCain, and others who were \ninterested in trying to fix this problem. But I did give the commitment \nthat we would not allow the bill to be blue-slipped in the House \nbecause of this amendment. The fact is, we came to an agreement among \nall the parties who worked together on the Senate side that would \ncorrect the problem. Senator Lieberman, Senator McConnell, Senator \nDodd, Senator McCain, and I, all agreed that the language would do the \njob, but I could not get the commitment from the Ways and Means \nCommittee on the House side not to blue-slip the bill even though I \nthink a blue slip was not warranted. I made the commitment on the floor \nI would not do anything to jeopardize the bill procedurally with a \nblue-slip question.\n  This is my question to my colleague from Arizona. I will not pursue \nthe amendment, but I think since everyone has agreed this needs to be \nfixed and we have the language to fix it, I ask the Senator from \nArizona if he would agree to work with me to get this fixed in another \nbill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from Texas, we established a \n$100,000 threshold so those who went above that would be disclosed; \nthat is the outline of the agreement. Senator Lieberman agrees, I \nagree, and I look forward to working with the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to clarify that the $100,000 threshold \nis not on State and local candidate committees but on State and local \nPACs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 72, nays 28, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 60 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--72\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--28\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, a number of Senators are inquiring about how \nwe will proceed for the balance of the evening and when we can expect \nto complete this bill, how long we will go tonight and also, of course, \nwill it be necessary for us to go over until tomorrow and beyond.\n  All along, the commitment and the understanding have been, I believe \nby all parties, that we would spend 2 legislative weeks on this issue \nand we would have a full debate and votes on amendments, and that we \nwould bring to it a conclusion at about this time so we could be \nprepared to move on to other very critical national issues. I am not \nsure exactly how many amendments are still remaining.\n  I know Senator Reid has been working to try to identify exactly what \namendments remain and to move those by consent agreement or voice vote, \nwhere it was possible. I know Senator McConnell has been doing the same \nthing on our side, working with Senator Dodd.\n  I think we are ready to complete action on this legislation. We have \nno more than four amendments on our side, and we think we could be \nprepared to work through those very quickly. I am not sure exactly what \nremains on the Democratic side, but I believe that the opponents and \nproponents are ready to vote. We have been through this. We have not \nmoved toward a filibuster or cloture on either side. Although, in \ntalking to Senator McCain a moment ago, he was saying that, if it were \nnecessary, he hopes that I would file cloture on this bill. Can you \nbelieve those words came from his mouth? If I had to, of course, the \ncloture would ripen on Saturday. I don't think we should end this \nprocess that way.\n  We do need to keep going. I know some Senators have commitments \ntonight they would like to go to. Some Senators have commitments they \nwould like not to have to go to. I have heard--more of the latter, yes.\n\n  So I would like to propose a unanimous consent request. I haven't \nprecleared this with Senator Daschle. He looked over it. We talked \nabout it. I am not exactly sure what his thinking is. I would be \nwilling to consider other ideas if somebody has a good idea about how \nwe can complete it. This is the fairest way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments in order to S. \n27 be limited to 30 minutes equally divided and all other provisions of \nthe consent agreement of February 6, 2001, remain in order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I inquire of the managers, how do we wish to \nproceed? I yield to Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have not had a chance yet to consult \nwith our colleagues. We have 10 remaining amendments on this side. I \nknow Senator Specter has been waiting patiently to offer his amendment.\n  Throughout the week, I have promised our colleagues that if they \nplayed by the rules and waited patiently for their opportunity to offer \ntheir amendments, we would accord them the same opportunity other \nSenators have had throughout the duration of this debate, as the \nmajority leader indicated.\n  This has been a very good debate. No one has talked about the need to \nfile cloture. I hope we will not have any reason to do that in the \nfuture. I believe Senators ought to have an opportunity to have their \namendments considered and have a vote. So until I have had the \nopportunity to consult more carefully with those colleagues who still \nhave outstanding amendments, I have to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then, let me say to colleagues, we will \ncontinue on into the night. We will be having votes. If necessary, to \nhave those votes in a reasonable period of time, we will move to table \nthem. But we will continue as long as it takes to get this bill done.\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\n  When we know more about what we could agree to, we will let you know. \nYou should expect a vote within the next couple of hours.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the majority leader will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. For those who do want to make commitments, would it be \npossible to have a window of a couple of hours with assurance that we \nnot vote within that window?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the majority of those who had talked to me were \nhoping we would not have a window. I think we need to keep our nose to \nthe grindstone and try to complete this legislation. I am not saying it \nwon't happen. I don't think we should make a commitment of a window. My \nwife will be waiting for me to come home and have supper. When we \ncomplete our work, I will go home and have supper with her. She may be \nhungry, but she waits.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That commitment is important above all.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the leader will yield, will it be safe to say that in \nthe next hour or so those who show up on the floor with a tuxedo or \nevening dress are those who want to fulfill their commitments, and \nthose who are not would like to keep voting?\n  Mr. LOTT. Those who show up with a tuxedo, that will count as having \nfulfilled your commitment to the dinner because it would show intent to \nbe there, but a higher calling prevented your presence. You might want \nto don your evening attire and come to the floor and wait for an \nopportunity to vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will change within the hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 140, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 24, strike ``and'', and insert the \n     following:\n       ``or\n       (iv) alternatively, if (iii) is held to be constitutionally \n     insufficient by itself to support the regulation provided \n     herein, which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning \n     other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific \n     candidate; and''\n       On page 8, line 1, by striking ``(iv)'' and replacing with \n     ``(v)''.\n       On page 15, line 19, strike ``election, convention or \n     caucus.'' and insert the following: ``election, convention, \n     or caucus; or alternatively, if subclauses (i) through (iii) \n     of subsection (3)(A) are held to be constitutionally \n     insufficient to support the regulation provided herein, which \n     also\n       (iv) promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or \n     attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of \n     whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or \n     against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no \n     plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or \n     against a specific candidate.''\n       On page 2, after the matter preceding line 1, insert:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the twenty-five years since the 1976 Supreme Court \n     decision in Buckley v. Valeo, the number and frequency of \n     advertisements increased dramatically which clearly advocate \n     for or against a specific candidate for Federal office \n     without magic words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' \n     as prescribed in the Buckley decision.\n       (2) The absence of the magic words from the Buckley \n     decision has allowed these advertisements to be viewed as \n     issue advertisements, despite their clear advocacy for or \n     against the election of a specific candidate for Federal \n     office.\n       (3) By avoiding the use of such terms as ``vote for'' and \n     ``vote against,'' special interest groups promote their views \n     and issue positions in reference to particular elected \n     officials without triggering the disclosure and source \n     restrictions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n       (4) In 1996, an estimated $135 million was spent on such \n     issue advertisements; the estimate for 1998 ranged from $275-\n     $340 million; and, for the 2000 election the estimate for \n     spending on such advertisements exceeded $340 million.\n       (5) If left unchecked, the explosive growth in the number \n     and frequency of advertisements that are clearly intended to \n     influence the outcome of Federal elections yet are \n     masquerading as issue advocacy has the potential to undermine \n     the integrity of the electoral process.\n       (6) The Supreme Court in Buckley reviewed the \n     legislative history and purpose of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act and found that the authorized or requested \n     standard of the Federal Election Campaign Act operated to \n     treat all expenditures placed in cooperation with or with \n     the consent of a candidate, an agent of the candidate, or \n     an authorized committee of the candidate as contributions \n     subject to the limitations set forth in the Act.\n       (7) During the 1996 Presidential primary campaign, \n     candidates of both major parties spent millions of dollars in \n     excess of the overall Presidential primary spending limit \n     that applied to each of their campaigns, and in doing so, \n     used millions of dollars in soft money contributions that \n     could not legally be used directly to support a Presidential \n     campaign.\n       (8) These candidates made these campaign expenditures \n     through their respective national political party committees, \n     using these party committees as conduits to run multi-million \n     dollar television ad campaigns to support their candidacies.\n       (9) These television ad campaigns were in each case \n     prepared, directed, and controlled by the campaign committees \n     of these candidates.\n       (10) The television ads by campaign committees forcefully \n     advocated the election of their candidate and the defeat of \n     their opponent and those television ads were suggestive of no \n     plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or \n     against a specific candidate; however, in the absence of a \n     specific statement to ``vote for'' or ``vote against,'' those \n     television ads were deemed issued ads and not advocacy ads \n     under Buckley v. Valeo.\n       (11) Television ads were coordinated between the candidate \n     committees and the relevant national party committees.\n       (12) Agents of the candidate committees raised the money \n     used to pay for these so-called issue ads supporting their \n     respective candidacies.\n       (13) These television advertising campaigns, run in the \n     guise of being national party issue ad campaigns, were in \n     fact Clinton and Dole ad campaigns, and accordingly should \n     have been subject to the contribution and spending limits \n     that apply to Presidential campaigns.\n       (14) After reviewing spending in the 1996 Presidential \n     election campaign, auditors for the Federal Election \n     Commission recommended that both the 1996 candidate \n     committees repay millions of dollars because the national \n     political parties had closely coordinated their soft money \n     issue ads with the respective presidential candidates and, \n     accordingly, the expenditures would be counted against the \n     candidates' spending limits.\n       (15) On December 10, 1998, in a 6-0 vote, the Federal \n     Election Commission rejected its auditors' recommendation \n     that either of these campaigns repay the money.\n       (16) The pattern of close coordination between candidates' \n     campaign committees and national party committees continued \n     in the 2000 Presidential election.\n       (17) The television ads by the 2000 presidential campaigns \n     forcefully advocated the election of their candidate and the \n     defeat of their opponent and those television ads were \n     suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation \n     to vote for or against a specific candidate; however, in the \n     absence of a specific statement to ``vote for'' or ``vote \n     against,'' those television ads were deemed issue\n       ads and not advocacy ads under Buckley v. Valeo.\n       (18) Television ads in the 2000 presidential election were \n     coordinated between the candidate committees and the relevant \n     national party committees.\n       (19) On January 21, 2000, the Supreme Court in Nixon v. \n     Shrink Missouri Government PAC noted, ``In speaking of \n     `improper influence' and `opportunities for abuse' in \n     addition to `quid pro quo arrangements,' we recognized a \n     concern to the broader threat from politicians too compliant \n     with the wishes of large contributors.''\n       (20) The details of corruption and the public perception of \n     the appearance of corruption have been documented in a flood \n     of books, newspapers and public documents.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nPennsylvania believes he might be able to wrap up his remarks in 15 \nminutes or so?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my hope to be able to do it within \na brief period of time--perhaps as little as 15 minutes, in that range.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment, as modified, seeks to \naccomplish two objectives. One objective is to set forth findings to \nprovide a factual basis to uphold the constitutionality of the statute, \nand the second objective is to insert a definition so that the bill \nwill survive constitutional challenge under the Buckley v. Valeo \ndecision, which has language that required specifically saying ``vote \nfor,'' ``support,'' with ads being deemed to be issue advertisements \nwhere the obvious intent is to extol the virtues of one candidate and \nto comment extensively on the deficiencies of another candidate; and \nnotwithstanding the clear purpose of these ads in the 1996 Presidential \nelection and the Presidential election of 2000, those ads were deemed\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nto be issue ads and, therefore, could be paid for with soft money.\n  The bill as presently written endeavors to provide a bright-line test \nwith the provision of identifying a specific candidate. The reason I am \nable to abbreviate the argument this evening, or the contentions this \nevening, is that we had about 2 hours of debate last Thursday.\n  The critical language in the bill is the reference to a clearly \nidentified candidate for Federal office. Now this may or may not be a \nsufficiently bright line to satisfy the requirements of Buckley v. \nValeo, or in fact it may not be because it does not deal with the kind \nof specific urging of a candidate to ``vote for'' or ``support,'' which \nBuckley has talked about.\n  In Buckley, in a very lengthy opinion, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States said that in order to avoid the constitutional challenge \nfor vagueness, those specific words of support--``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst''--had to be used in order to avoid the vagueness standard of \nthe due process clause of the fifth amendment.\n  What this amendment seeks to do is to provide an alternative test, \nwhich is derived from the decision of the court of appeals for the \nNinth Circuit in the Furgatch case, and this definition is really \nFurgatch streamlined. The original amendment that was offered provided \nthat the context of the advertisement was ``unmistakable, unambiguous, \nand suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to \nvote for or against a specific candidate.''\n  In our debate last Thursday, there were arguments made that the \nlanguage of ``unmistakable'' and ``unambiguous'' left latitude for a \nchallenge.\n  In the amendment which has been modified, it is deemed to be \nsufficient to have the language be ``suggestive of no plausible meaning \nother than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific \ncandidate.''\n  This really sharpens up Furgatch, really streamlines Furgatch in \norder to pass constitutional muster.\n  The findings which have been set forth in the modified amendment seek \nto characterize events which have occurred in the intervening 25 years \nsince the decision of Buckley v. Valeo, reciting how much money has \nbeen paid, the very heavy impact of funding, the ads really, in effect, \nurging the election of one candidate and the defeat of another so that, \nby any logical definition, they would be deemed advocacy ads and not \nissue ads, but they do not meet the magic words test of Buckley v. \nValeo.\n  The expanded test of having ``no plausible meaning other than an \nexhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate'' would make it \nplain that the kinds of ads which have been viewed as being issue ads \nare really advocacy ads.\n  We had an extended debate last Thursday about the impact of this \nlanguage on the balance of what is in the bill at the present time on a \nclearly identified candidate. This modified amendment has been very \ncarefully crafted to meet the concerns that if the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States determines that the language in the underlying bill is \nsufficient, and the language added in this modified amendment is \ninsufficient, that one or the other will be stricken so that there is a \nseverability clause within this amendment as modified.\n  We have already legislated, we have already adopted an amendment to \nprovide for severability. So it may be this is surplusage or it may be \nthat it is necessary, but it does not do any harm to have this \nlanguage.\n  I believe that most, if not all, of the objections which were raised \nlast Thursday have been satisfied in this modified amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  I am not yet asking for the yeas and nays to see if the arguments \nwhich may be presented here are suggestive of some further modification \nwhich would require consent after asking for the yeas and nays, but it \nis my intention, as I have notified the managers, to seek a rollcall \nvote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I can be yielded 5 minutes, \n2\\1/2\\ minutes from either side, because I am not sure if I am for or \nagainst it because I don't have a copy of the final product. May I ask \nthe Senator to yield me 2\\1/2\\ minutes from his side?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes from our side. We are trying \nto determine which version of the amendment is pending. I ask the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, are the references in the findings to--we \nnow have a modified amendment. Are there any references to the specific \ncandidates in the 1996 Presidential campaign left in here?\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I can have the attention perhaps of all of \nmy colleagues on this question. It may be a question in which we are \nall interested. It relates to the findings. For instance, one of the \nfindings here says that both the Clinton and Dole ad campaigns should \nhave been subject to the limits, implying that, in fact, they had \nsomehow or other violated the limits of the campaign despite the 6-0 \nvote of the Federal Election Commission which rejected the \nrecommendation that either of the campaigns repay the money.\n  I happen to agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania on the thrust of \nhis amendment, by the way, because I have always liked the Furgatch \ntest myself. I cannot speak for the floor manager on this side. I do \nnot know where he is. But I do think these findings should be reviewed \nbecause I do not think we want to reach any conclusion that any of the \nexpenditures of the Presidential campaigns violated that law in 1996.\n  The problem was the law was so full of loopholes and we need to close \nthose loopholes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Michigan perhaps call for a quorum \ncall for 5 minutes to see if we cannot sort this out. I thought we had \nan agreement, but perhaps we do not.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as if in morning business for about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Lincoln are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will please call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak \nbriefly as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith of Oregon are located in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 140, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send to the desk a further modification \nof amendment No. 140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 7, line 24, strike ``and'', and insert the \n     following:\n       ``or\n       ``(iv) alternatively, if subclauses (i) through (iii) are \n     held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial \n     decision to support the regulation provided herein, which is \n     also in the aggregate found to be suggestive of no plausible \n     meaning other than an extortion to vote for or against a \n     specific candidate; and''.\n       On page 8, line 1, by striking ``(iv)'' and replacing with \n     ``(v)''.\n       On page 15, line 19, strike lines 3 through 19 and insert \n     the following:\n       ``(A)(i) In general.--The term `electioneering \n     communication means any broadcast, cable, or satellite \n     communication which--\n       ``(I) refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal \n     office;\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\n       ``(II) is made within--\n       ``(a) 60 days before a general, special, or runoff election \n     for such Federal office: or\n       ``(b) 30 days before a primary or preference election, or a \n     convention or caucus of a political party that has authority \n     to nominate a candidate for such Federal office: and\n       ``(III) is made to an audience that includes members of the \n     electorate for such election, convention, or caucus.\n       ``(ii) If subclause (i) of subsection (3)(A) is held to be \n     constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to \n     support the regulation provided herein, then the term \n     `electioneering communication' means any broadcast, cable, or \n     satellite communication which promotes or supports a \n     candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate \n     for that office (regardless of whether the communication \n     expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and \n     which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than \n     an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.''\n       Further, nothing in the subsection shall be construed to \n     affect the interpretation or application of 11 CFR 100.22(b).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the further modification has been made to \nsatisfy some concerns about drafting. I believe the language had been \ndefinitive, but it was faster to make some changes than it was to \ndebate that proposition. And where we are now--if I may have the \nattention of the Senator from Michigan--where we are now is to satisfy \nall the parties that what we are accomplishing on this amendment is \nthat if the Snowe-Jeffords test is held to be unconstitutional by a \nfinal judicial decision, then the modified Furgatch test will be \napplied to define an advocacy advertisement which will satisfy Buckley \nv. Valeo that the advertisement ``is suggestive of no plausible meaning \nother than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific \ncandidate.''\n  The additional sentence has been made: ``Further, nothing in this \nsubsection shall be construed to affect the interpretation or \napplication of 11 CFR, 100.22(b),'' which is the current FEC regulation \non an electioneering communication which follows Furgatch.\n  Then the further modified amendment strikes the findings, and they \nwill be supplemented at a later time because to call through and \nsatisfy all the parties as to the findings would take longer than we \ncan accomplish it simply by full striking, which this further \nmodification does.\n  I believe at this juncture that we have satisfied all the concerns of \nthe varieties of cooks who have been added to the stew.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask the Senator from Kentucky to yield me 20 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are in the process of rapidly completing \nthis bill. I would not have come over to speak, except that it was \nclear to me that, for the moment, nothing was happening. I have not yet \nspoken on it. And while I think it is clear what the outcome will be, I \nat least want to go on record on this issue.\n  Free speech in America is a very funny thing. If a person goes out \nand burns the American flag and they say they are exercising free \nspeech or they dance naked in a nightclub and say that that was \npersonal expression, a league of defenders springs up in America to \ndefend the first amendment of the Constitution. Yet when someone \nproposes that we preserve free speech about the election of our \nGovernment and the election of the men and women who serve the greatest \ncountry in the history of the world, when such a motion is made, it \ndies from a lack of a second.\n  It is astounding to me that free speech in America has come to \nprotect flag burning and nude dancing but yet the greatest deliberative \nbody in the history of the world feels perfectly comfortable in denying \nthe ability of free men and women to put up their time and their talent \nand their money to support the candidates of their choice.\n  I can't help but say a little something about the protagonists in \nthis debate. I would like to begin by saying of my dear friend Senator \nMcCain, with whom I profoundly differ on this issue, I have the highest \nrespect for him. In fact, he has reminded me in this debate of an \nancient god, Antaeus, whose mother was the earth, and every time he was \nthrown to the ground, he became stronger than he had been when he was \ncast down.\n  Having said that, having admired his diligence and his determination, \nI would say that seldom has a more noble effort been made on behalf of \na poorer cause in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  I would like to say of our colleague from Kentucky that he has again \nwon our admiration and our respect. He has been vilified in every media \noutlet in the Nation. Yet his sin is to stand up and defend freedom.\n  You ask yourself: Why do people want to influence the Government? Why \ndo people want to influence the Government of the United States of \nAmerica? It seems to me there are really two reasons: One, they have \nstrong feelings about something. They love their country. They have \nstrong passions and they want to express them. And who would want to \nprevent them from expressing themselves? I say nobody should.\n  The second reason they want to influence the Government is that the \nGovernment spends $2 trillion a year, most of it on a noncompetitive \nbasis. The Government sets the price of milk. The Government grants \nnumerous favors. If we were serious about campaign reform, we would try \nto change the things that lead people to want to influence the \nGovernment for their advantage, and we would want to leave in place a \nsystem where people could express their love and their passions. Yet \nthere is no proposal here to end the Government setting the price of \nmilk. There is no proposal here that would have competitive bidding on \ncontracts. Instead, we single out one source of influence, and that \nsource of influence is money. Our problem is not bad money corrupting \ngood men, our problem is bad men corrupting good money.\n  When I listen to my colleagues talk about this corrupting influence, \nlet me say they apparently have lived a different political life than I \nhave lived. I have never in my 22 years in public office and in the 2 \nyears prior to that, when I ran unsuccessfully for the Senate and lost, \nhad anyone come up to me and say: If you will vote the way I want you \nto vote, I will contribute to your campaign. I am proud that 84,000 \npeople contribute to my campaign, and I believe they contribute to me \nbecause they believe in the things I believe in. I am proud to have \ntheir support. I don't apologize for it.\n\n  Remember this, and this is what is lost in this whole debate: This is \nan Alice in Wonderland debate where black is white and wrong is right. \nIt is a debate that ignores the fundamental nature of the American \npolitical system. Government has power and people want to influence it. \nIf we limit the power of people to spend their money, we strengthen the \npower of people who exert influence in other ways. We don't reduce \npower. We don't reduce whatever corruptive influence may exist among \nthe people who want to influence government. We simply take power away \nfrom some people and, by the very nature of the system, we give it to \nsomebody else.\n  Why should the New York Times have more to say in my election than \nthe New York Stock Exchange? Is the New York Times not a for-profit \ncompany? Why should they have the right to run editorials and write \nfront-page articles that can have a profound impact on your election, \nand they are a for-profit corporation, publicly traded, and yet we say \nin this bill, they, but not others, have freedom of speech? They can \nsay whatever they want to say. But yet the New York Stock Exchange is \ndenied the same freedom. How can that be rational? How can that be \njust?\n  Who says that freedom of speech should belong only to people who own \nradio stations and television stations and newspapers? I reject it.\n  What makes this debate an Alice in Wonderland debate is that the \npeople who support this bill are the very people who will benefit from \ntaking the American people out of the debate by limiting the ability of \npeople to put up their time and their talent and their money.\n  The very groups, the so-called public interest groups, the media, the \nvery people who preach endlessly about this issue and about this bill \nbeing in the public interest, they are the very people who win an \nenhancement of their\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\npolitical power from this bill. What we are hearing identified as \npublic interest is greedy, selfish, special interest. The amazing thing \nis that the voice of freedom and the right of people to be heard is not \nrepresented to any substantial degree on the floor of the Senate.\n  If I should believe, as a free person, that the Senator from Virginia \nis the new Thomas Jefferson and I believe the future of my children \nwill be affected by his political success, don't I have the right to \nsell my house, to sell my car and to use that money to help him be \nelected? Why shouldn't I have that right? Who has the right to take \nthat away from me? No one has the right to take it away from me. But \nthis bill does take it away from me.\n  This distinction between soft money and hard money is a fraud. What \nwe are seeing here is an effort to collect political power and to \nconcentrate it. Our Founders understood special interests. The Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin are not the first people in \nthe history of this country who have ever been concerned about special \ninterests. James Madison understood special interests. He understood \nthat the way you deal with them is to allow many special interests to \nbe created and have them compete against each other.\n  The editorial proponents of this bill see it as somehow corrupting \nwhen somebody contributes money to my campaign. But I wonder if really \nthey support the bill because they know that the contributors of such \nmoney, with that participation and interest, offset the influence of \ntheir editorials and their political power. Why should some people have \nfreedom and not others? That is the profound issue that is being \ndebated here.\n  I suspect this bill is going to pass, but this is not a bright hour \nin American history, in my opinion. The amazing thing--I never cease to \nbe amazed by our system--is there is no constituency for this bill.\n  This is a total fabrication. The constituency for this bill is a \ngroup of special interests who cloak themselves as public interest \nadvocates and it is they who will have their power enhanced by limiting \nthe ability of people to put up their time, talent, and money in \nsupport of candidates. The so-called public interest promotion of the \nbill in editorials across America is coming from the very people who \nwill become more powerful if this bill is adopted.\n  So what we have is an incredible example, cloaked in great self-\nrighteousness, of special interest triumphing over public interest \nthrough the power of the same groups that will have their power \nenhanced if this bill is adopted.\n  If editorialists in America, if Common Cause, and all these similar \ngroups, can induce the Congress to limit freedom of speech to enhance \ntheir power, what strength will those who oppose their views have when \nfreedom of speech has been, in fact, limited? I think that is something \nthat should give us all pause, though I have no doubt there will be no \npause tonight.\n  It is as if we look at the Constitution and we say that what is at \nstake is either protection of the first amendment of the Constitution, \nor whether we are going to get a good editorial in tomorrow morning's \nnewspaper, and the judgement is made that tomorrow morning's newspaper \nis much more important than the first amendment of the Constitution.\n  Let me conclude by quoting, because I never think it hurts to read \nfrom the greatest document in history, other than the Bible--the \nConstitution. Let me read amendment No. 1 of the Constitution, and I \nwill read the relevant points:\n\n       Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.\n\n  If I believe the Senator from Virginia is the next Thomas Jefferson \nand I want to sell my house to support his candidacy, who has the right \nunder the Constitution to deny me that right? No one has that right. \nYet we are about to vote on the floor of the Senate to keep me from \ndoing that.\n  The Constitution says that:\n\n       The right of the people peaceably to assemble and to \n     petition the government for a redress of grievances shall not \n     be abridged.\n\n  If I am not permitted to spend my money to present my grievances to \nmy Government, how am I going to be heard? In modern society, the \nability to communicate depends on the ability to have funds to amplify \nyour voice so it can be heard in a nation of 285 million people.\n  If I don't have the right to use my time and my talent and my money \nto enhance my voice, how can I be heard? Well, what the advocates of \nthis bill are really saying is we don't want you to be heard because we \nmight not like what you have to say.\n  We have a bill before us that says you can't run ads. If I wanted to \nrun ads supporting you, or give you money to spend, I can't do it. We \nare all unhappy that these special interest groups run ads. It hurts my \nfeelings. When people tell my mama that I am this terrible, bad person, \nthat I have sold out to the special interests, my mama asks me, ``Why \ncan they say that?'' How can they say it? You know why they can say it? \nBecause they have the right to say it because of the first amendment of \nthe Constitution. It is not true, but it doesn't have to be true.\n  It amazes me--and I will conclude on this remark--I hear colleagues \ntalk about corruption, corruption, corruption. I wonder if people back \nhome know that there has never been a Congress in American history less \ncorrupt than this Congress. I don't agree with many of the people in \nthis body, but I don't believe there is a person in this body who is \ndishonest.\n\n  I can only speak for myself, but I have never, ever felt compromised \nbecause somebody supported me. I have felt honored, I have felt \ngrateful, but I have always believed they supported me because of what \nI believed. In fact, on many occasions, when people have supported me--\nthe AMA is a perfect example. When I was a young man running for \nCongress, the American Medical Association supported me and just \nthought I was wonderful. Now they don't like me. What changed? They \nchanged; I didn't change. I have always been for freedom. When I stood \nright at this desk and helped lead the effort to kill the Clinton \nhealth care bill, I did it because I believed in freedom, and they \nloved it. Now that they want to kill HMOs, they don't think so much of \nfreedom anymore.\n  But I didn't feel corrupted by them giving me money. They supported \nme because of what I believed in. When they didn't believe it anymore, \nthey changed; I didn't change. So I don't know what is in the hearts of \nthose who feel this corruption. I do not feel it. I think corruption, \nas it is portrayed in the media, has increasingly become a codeword for \nanybody who can speak for themselves and, therefore, doesn't have to be \ntoo concerned about the commentary of some special interest group or \nthe media.\n  I love the Dallas Morning News, especially when they write good \nthings about me. When they endorse me and support me, I like it. But I \nhave 84,000 contributors. The newspaper can go ahead and say whatever \nthey want to say about me because my contributors and supporters have \nensured that I will get to respond and tell my side of the story.\n  What this bill is going to do, and the terrible effect of it if it \ndoes become law, is that it is going to limit the ability of people to \ntell their side of the story. I think that is fundamentally wrong. I \nstill do not understand how someone can burn a flag, and that is \nfreedom of speech; someone can dance naked in a night club, and that is \nfreedom of public expression; but if I want to sell my house and \nsupport somebody that I believe in with all my heart, that is \nfundamentally wrong; that is corrupt.\n  I believe there is salvation. I believe we are going to get salvation \nfrom this bill. I think the salvation is going to come from this \nancient document, our Constitution, because I believe this bill is \ngoing to be struck down by the courts, and that is ultimately going to \nbe our salvation.\n  I want to say to my dear colleague from Kentucky that I admire him, \nand I want to thank him for the great sacrifice he has made to stand up \non behalf of freedom, when very few people are offering compliments, \nand very few pundits are applauding. I am one person who is applauding, \nand I will never, ever forget what you have done. It may not be in an \neditorial, but it will be enshrined in my heart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from Texas \nhow much I appreciate what he had to say. There is no question that he \ngets it. It is all about the first amendment. It is all about the first \namendment and the rights of Americans to have their say.\n  This bill, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, is simply trying to \npick winners and losers. It takes the parties and it crushes them. And \nthe irony of it all is there will be way more money spent in the next \nelection than there was in the last one. It just won't be spent by the \nparties.\n  So we have taken resources away from the parties, which will be spent \notherwise because of all of these other efforts, as the Senator from \nTexas pointed out. And I assure him I will be in court. I will be the \nplaintiff, and we will win if we have to go to court. Efforts to \nrestrict the voices of outside groups will be struck down.\n  I hope we will be able to save the ability of parties to engage in \nspeech that isn't federally regulated, which is what soft money is. It \nis everything that isn't hard money. I thank the Senator from Texas for \nalways being there on so many issues, and especially for the kind \nthings he said tonight about this struggle. It isn't a lot of fun being \nthe national pinata. But there are some rewards.\n  I say to my friend from Texas my reward is that I really could not \nthink of a group of enemies I would rather have than the ones I have \nmade in this debate. I can't think of a single set of friends I would \nrather be associated with than people such as the Senator from \nTexas, who understand what freedom is all about and understand what \nthis debate is all about.\n\n  I say to my colleague, we may lose tonight, but we will ultimately \nwin this no matter how long it takes; we will win it. I thank him so \nmuch for being there when it counts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson \nfrom Florida be allowed to proceed to offer his amendment, 5 minutes \nequally divided, and then there be a voice vote on that amendment, and \nthat we lay aside the Specter amendment in order to permit that to \nhappen; then we immediately vote on the Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 159\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 159.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To prohibit fraudulent solicitation of funds)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PROHIBITION ON FRAUDULENT SOLICITATION OF FUNDS.\n\n       Section 322 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 441h) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``No \n     person'';\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Fraudulent Solicitation of Funds.--No person shall--\n       ``(1) fraudulently misrepresent the person as speaking, \n     writing, or otherwise acting for or on behalf of any \n     candidate or political party or employee or agent thereof for \n     the purpose of soliciting contributions or donations; or\n       ``(2) willfully and knowingly participate in or conspire to \n     participate in any plan, scheme, or design to violate \n     paragraph (1).''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Federal Election Commission \nreports receiving a number of complaints that people have fraudulently \nraised donations by posing as political committees or candidates and \nthat the current law does not allow the Commission to pursue such \ncases.\n  For example, one newspaper reported that after last November's \nPresidential election, both Democrats and Republicans were victims in a \nscam in which phony fundraising letters began popping up in mailboxes \nin Washington, Connecticut, Michigan, and elsewhere. Those letters \nurged $1,000 contributions to seemingly prestigious Pennsylvania Avenue \naddresses on behalf of lawyers purportedly for both George W. Bush and \nAl Gore. About the same time, thousands of similar letters offering \ncoffee mugs for contributions of between $1,000 and $5,000 were sent to \nDemocratic donors from New York to San Francisco.\n  Clearly, one can see the potential for harm to citizens who are \ntargeted in such fraudulent schemes. Unfortunately, the Federal \nElection Campaign Act does not grant specific authority to the Federal \nElection Commission to investigate this type of activity, nor does it \nspecifically prohibit persons from fraudulently soliciting \ncontributions.\n  The FEC has asked Congress to remedy this, and the amendment I offer \ntoday is in response to this request. This amendment makes it illegal \nto fraudulently misrepresent any candidate or political party or party \nemployee in soliciting contributions or donations.\n  I thank my Senate colleagues for their consideration of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. It is \ngoing to protect our citizens from fraudulent solicitation of their \nfunds. It will give the Federal Election Commission the tools it needs \nto address these fraudulent acts which take advantage of our citizens. \nIt implements an important recommendation of the Federal Election \nCommission. I hope our colleagues will all support this amendment.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from Florida. I believe this may be \nhis first amendment. It is a very important amendment. He has made an \nimportant contribution to this Senate in many ways already. It is \nimportant for all of us to recognize the first amendment of the Senator \nfrom Florida that is being accepted, hopefully, tonight, and I \ncongratulate him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n159.\n  The amendment (No. 159) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n             Vote on Amendment No. 140, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 140, as further \nmodified. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Voinovich) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 82, nays 17, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 61 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--82\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--17\n\n     Allen\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\n\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Voinovich\n       \n  The amendment (No. 140), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know Senators are interested in how we \nproceed for the remainder of tonight and tomorrow. I believe we have \ncome up with the best possible arrangement of how we can complete \naction on this bill and be prepared to move on to other legislation.\n  Senator Daschle and I have talked about it and have talked to the \nmanagers and the proponents of the legislation. I think everybody is \nsatisfied that this is a fair way to bring this to a conclusion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments in order to S. \n27 be limited to 30 minutes equally divided and that all provisions of \nthe consent agreement of February 6, 2001, remain in order, except for \nthis change:\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments must be \noffered either tonight or between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. tomorrow and that \nany votes ordered with respect to those amendments occur in a stacked \nsequence beginning at 11 a.m. on Friday, with 2 minutes prior to each \nvote for explanation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the stacked votes the \nbill be immediately read for the third time and passage occur at 5:30 \np.m. on Monday, all without intervening action or debate, and that \nparagraph 4 of rule XII be waived.\n  Also, it has been suggested that we include in this consent, if \nnecessary, a technical amendment that is agreed to by both managers may \nbe in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just covered this with the manager. I want \nto make sure Senator Daschle is aware. A technical amendment may not be \nnecessary. But we want to make sure, if there is a need for a technical \namendment, that there be a way to deal with that but that a technical \namendment would have to be identified and agreed to tomorrow along with \nother amendments before we complete action.\n  The problem is, if we wait until Monday, there is a lot of \nopportunity for mischief to develop.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is \nsuggested that perhaps having a weekend for the staff to go through \nwhatever screening or final review may be helpful. Obviously, I think \nboth managers would have to agree to any technical amendments. So there \nis that assurance. But this would give the weekend to the staff to \nassure that if there is any inadvertent mistake, it be caught prior to \nthe time we vote on final passage on Monday.\n  I also note that it was suggested we may want to include in this \nunanimous consent agreement any second-degree amendments. I don't think \nthat will be necessary because I don't anticipate second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Wouldn't that be in order under the earlier agreement? I \nthink that would be covered by the underlying unanimous consent \nagreement because other than what is specified here----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As long as we make it clear it includes amendments in \nthe second degree.\n  Mr. DODD. The Democratic leader said it well. Any technical \namendments would have to be amendments agreed to by both managers. So \nthat the idea of something coming up late--I make it plural because the \nstaff is apt to encounter more than one. Any technical amendments would \nhave to have the concurrence of both managers.\n  Mr. LOTT. I can understand how the managers might want to obviously \nhave that opportunity. But also we want to have a chance to review it. \nI also see how maybe the Senator from Arizona would want to be included \nin reviewing that.\n  But, again, there is no intent on anybody's part to try to snucker \nanybody. I think the way I worded it, where both managers have to agree \nto it, takes care of the problem. I can understand how the managers \nwould prefer not being dragged around by our very capable staff for 2 \nor 3 hours on Monday, arguing over a technical amendment. However, I \nthink this does give us a way to correct legitimate problems.\n  I say to Senator McConnell, do you want to comment on this?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the leader then confirming no technical amendments \ncould be offered after tomorrow without the consent of both managers?\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the leader yield further?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly, I yield to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One of the remaining issues is--some people would call \nit technical, but I think it is major, and that deals with \ncoordination. A lot of us recognize that the underlying bill needs some \nimprovement on coordination or else we are going to have a lot of \npeople who are going to be crooks who want to participate in the \npolitical process. And they should have the opportunity to participate. \nI have been trying to get language, and I have not seen it. But that is \nnot insignificant and not technical; that is major concern.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe that would have to be one of the regular \namendments, not a technical amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. That will be up tonight.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will it be possible for us to see language tonight?\n  Mr. DODD. Probably not.\n  No. We will get you some.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank both leaders for their cooperation on this. I am \nconfident after tomorrow, if there are technical amendments, they will \nonly be allowed if we are in agreement.\n  On the issue of coordination, we are ready to consider amendments and \nvotes on that issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. I say to Senator Wellstone, did you get wet?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I did.\n  Mr. LOTT. I mean that literally now, not figuratively. I saw you \ndrenched.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Because of you, I tried to run all the way up to \nConnecticut Avenue, and I got wet on the way.\n  I want to ask the majority leader--I am sorry; Mike Epstein, who used \nto work with me, is no longer here or I would have asked him this--but \non technical amendments, is the definition of that that there would not \nbe an up-or-down vote automatically?\n  Mr. LOTT. After the vote tomorrow on the sequence of amendments, \nthere would not be a vote on the technical amendment. It would have to \nbe agreed to. So it would be handled in that way.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think I would object to a technical amendment unless \nthere is an understanding to this effect: If this affected the work of \nany one Senator, that we would be consulted before an agreement.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, we would provide that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is that implicit?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is implicit. Also, it would certainly be the proper \nway to proceed.\n  Are we ready to get this consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank all Senators. I urge those of you who have \namendments, stay and do them tonight, because the 2 hours tomorrow will \ngo very fast. And if you are ready, I hope you will be prepared to \noffer your amendment tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 160\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator \nKerry, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD], for Mr. Kerry, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 160.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a study of the effects of State laws that provide \n                     public financing of elections)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 305.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been agreed to \nby both sides. It is one of these amendments we can move out of the way \nvery quickly. I gather the majority has seen it and approves as well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have no objection to it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 160) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the next amendment will be by Senator \nLevin and Senator Ensign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 161\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration on behalf of myself and Senators Ensign, \nClinton, Dorgan, and Ben Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Ensign, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 161.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the definition of Federal election activity as it \n applies to State, district, or local committees of political parties)\n\n       Beginning on page 3, strike line 12 and all that follows \n     through page 4, line 4, and insert the following:\n       ``(b) State, District, and Local Committees.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), an \n     amount that is expended or disbursed for Federal election \n     activity by a State, district, or local committee of a \n     political party (including an entity that is directly or \n     indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled \n     by a State, district, or local committee of a political party \n     and an officer or agent acting on behalf of such committee or \n     entity), or by an entity directly or indirectly established, \n     financed, maintained, or controlled by or acting on behalf of \n     1 or more candidates for State or local office, or \n     individuals holding State or local office, shall be made from \n     funds subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting \n     requirements of this Act. Nothing in this subsection shall \n     prevent a principal campaign committee of a candidate for \n     State or local office from raising and spending funds \n     permitted under applicable State law other than for a Federal \n     election activity that refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate for election to Federal office.\n       ``(2) Applicability.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding clause (i) or (ii) of \n     section 301(20)(A), and subject to subparagraph (B), \n     paragraph (1) shall not apply to any amount expended or \n     disbursed by a State, district, or local committee of a \n     political party for an activity described in either such \n     clause to the extent the costs of such activity are allocated \n     under regulations prescribed by the Commission as costs that \n     may be paid from funds not subject to the limitations, \n     prohibitions, and reporting requirements of this Act.\n       ``(B) Conditions.--Subparagraph (A) shall only apply if--\n       ``(i) the activity does not refer to a clearly identified \n     candidate for Federal office; and\n       ``(ii) the costs described in subparagraph (A) are paid \n     directly or indirectly from amounts donated in accordance \n     with State law, except that no person (and any person \n     established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such \n     person) may donate more than $10,000 to a State, district or \n     local committee of a political party in a calendar year to be \n     used for the costs described in subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment will allow the use of some \nnon-Federal dollars by State parties for voter registration and get out \nthe vote, where the contributions are allowed by State law, where there \nis no reference to Federal candidates, where limited to $10,000 of the \ncontribution which is allowed by State law, and where the allocation \nbetween Federal and non-Federal dollars is set by the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  This bill that is before us is about limits. We have set limits on \ncontributions by individuals, by PACs, by national parties to State \nparties. It is all about trying to restore some limits to a law where \nthat law has really been completely subverted in terms of contribution \nlimits by the so-called soft money loophole.\n  I think it is perfectly appropriate that the bill set limits. The \nbill has also put some restrictions which are excessive on the use of \nnon-Federal dollars by State parties for voter registration and get out \nthe vote.\n  I think in our efforts over the last couple weeks we have really done \nthe right thing in establishing the limits that we have. We have \nfocused on trying to restore something which was always intended, which \nis contribution limits, but we have also, in our review, done some fine \ntuning. We have done some adjustments.\n  This amendment provides some fine tuning in an area where State \nparties are using non-Federal dollars, dollars allowed by State law, \nfor some of the most core activities that State parties are involved \nin; that is, voter registration and get out the vote.\n  Now the bill does not restrict State parties when it comes to using \nnon-Federal dollars for things such as salaries and rent and utilities, \nnor should it. But it does prohibit altogether--unless this amendment \nis adopted--the use by State parties of non-Federal dollars. These are \ndollars not raised through any effort on the part of Federal \nofficeholders, Federal candidates, or national parties. These are non-\nFederal dollars allowed by State law.\n  The bill, as it is currently written, would prohibit the use of any \nof those dollars for those core activities of State parties that we all \nknow and call by get out the vote, registration activities, and voter \nidentification.\n  In this regard, I believe and our cosponsors believe that the bill \nhas gone too far, that we ought to allow State parties using non-\nFederal dollars, under very clear limits, where there is not an \nidentification of a Federal candidate, where there is a limit as to how \nmuch of those contributions they can use, and where the contributions \nare allowed by State law--that we ought to allow, with the proper \nFederal match, determined by the Federal Election Commission, State \nparties to use these non-Federal dollars in some of the most core \nactivities in which State parties are involved.\n  There is nothing much more basic to State parties than identifying \nvoters who agree with their causes and to try to get those voters to \nthe polls.\n  That is about as core an effort as you can get. Yet unless we make \nthis modification in the bill, we would tell State parties they can't \nuse the non-Federal dollars in any year where there is a Federal \nelection, which is every other year, for those core activities.\n  This amendment, I believe, now has the support of the managers of the \nbill.\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\n They will speak for themselves, of course. But we have worked very \nhard to make sure there are still some limits. We are not eliminating \nthe limits on this spending, nor should we, because if it is unlimited, \nwe then have a huge loophole again where State parties would become the \nfunnel for the Federal campaign money to be poured into. So we keep \nreasonable restrictions, but what we do is, we pull back from the total \nelimination of the use of these non-Federal dollars by State parties \nfor their fundamental basic activity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased to support this with Senator Levin, Senator \nClinton, and others.\n  I ask the Senator from Michigan, isn't it the case that, as currently \nwritten, a Governor and a mayor could not use non-Federal money to \nconduct their own activities for get out the vote, for example, in an \nelection in which there might have been a Federal candidate, and would \nthat not be the case?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Secondly, there are roughly 160 democracies in the world. \nI wonder if the Senator knows--I didn't know until a few minutes ago--\nwhere we rank in the democracies around the world in voter \nparticipation. Before asking whether he knows the right answer, I will \nsay we rank 139th among the democracies in the world in voter \nparticipation. It seems to me we ought to encourage in every \nconceivable way activities that get out the vote, that encourage voter \nparticipation. Is it not the case, that is exactly what this amendment \ndoes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. This amendment is aimed at restoring the appropriate use \nby parties of non-Federal funds which are obtained by those parties in \ncompliance with their own State laws in those very activities which the \nSenator has identified. These are the fundamental activities in a \ndemocracy. We want State parties to be involved in those activities, as \nthe Senator pointed out. We don't want that to become the loophole, \nhowever, for unlimited Federal dollars. That is why this amendment is \ncrafted the way it is.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Finally, if the Senator from Michigan will yield one \nadditional time, let me say the proposal of the Senator from Michigan \nis a modest one. We could have done more, perhaps should have done \nmore. This represents a compromise, a modest compromise, however. It \ndoes the right thing. We don't want to pass campaign finance reform and \nthen produce impediments to those very activities that would encourage \nvoter participation. That would be a step in the wrong direction.\n  I, again, say how pleased I am at the effort tonight and the \nsponsorship by Senator Levin. I am very proud to be a cosponsor. I am \npleased this is going to be accepted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator Dorgan for his cosponsorship, all of our \ncosponsors. I acknowledge the principal cosponsorship of the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I wasn't going to yield the floor to him, but I was going \nto acknowledge him as my principal cosponsor. I am happy to yield to \nthe Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to Senator Levin and Senator Ensign and others, \nI want to be considered a cosponsor as well, Mr. President. I \nappreciate the efforts of Senator Levin and Senator Ensign to work this \nout. This is an important provision that is going to make a difference. \nIt is done in a very thoughtful way, a very responsible way. I think it \nadds again to the value of this piece of legislation. I thank our \ncolleagues for their efforts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Before I yield the floor, I want to add as a cosponsor \nSenator Harry Reid and to thank him for the efforts behind the scenes, \nas is so often true with Senator Reid, making things happen in the \nSenate which otherwise simply would not happen, but doing it in a very \nself-effacing way, a very critically important way. I thank him as we \nask unanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor, and Senator \nCorzine as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor the work we have done together. He started this work and I joined \nhim in it some time ago. We had a few differences on the amendment, but \nwe were able to work those out. I thank the managers of the bill for \nalso working with us to make sure we would be able to include this \namendment in the bill. It is a very important amendment.\n  We look at our turnout of voters today, and we see a continual \ndecline each and every year. The people who have brought the underlying \nbill to the floor are doing it partially because of that decreasing \nturnout. People out there in America are increasingly turned off from \nelections because of negative ads. A lot of those negative ads have \nbeen funded by some of the independent expenditures as well as some of \nthe soft money that has been run through the parties.\n  What this bill, I don't think, intended to do, however, was to limit \nthe activities of actually getting people to the polls, of first \nsigning people up to register to vote and then encouraging them to go \nto the polls.\n  When I was running against Senator Harry Reid back in 1998, the labor \nunions put about 300 people on the ground to get out the vote for \nSenator Reid. It was perfectly within their right to do that. This bill \nwould have limited, though, State parties from doing similar \nactivities. We want to encourage more people to go to the polls, not \ndiscourage people from going to the polls. Let's face it, if more \npeople are not interested in our government, if they are not \nparticipating in this form of government we call a Republic, then our \nRepublic will be doomed. We have to encourage people to go to the \npolls, and part of that is through the State parties.\n  This amendment is going to allow State parties to be funded to the \npoint where they will have the resources to be able to get people to \nthe polls on election day because they will be allowed to spend money \nfor voter ID, for voter registration, and then for what is called get-\nout-the-vote efforts, things that are very important for increasing the \nnumber of people who get to the polls.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for working together on this \namendment. It is a very important amendment. I also thank Senator \nMcConnell for allowing us to bring this amendment up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it is a good amendment. We should move to \nfinal passage, unless there are others who want to speak on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I add my words of support and thank \nSenator Levin and the other cosponsors who have worked hard on this \nmatter.\n  I wish to reiterate the point that, while we are working so hard to \nreform our campaign finance system, we cannot undermine our ability to \nreform the way elections are conducted. For all of the reasons Senator \nLevin and Senator Ensign and others have pointed out, registering \nvoters, getting voters out to the polls is a critical role of parties. \nFrom my perspective, we need to be doing even more to try to promote \nwhat parties used to do, which was that kind of grassroots outreach \nactivity.\n  In reforming the way campaigns are financed, we must not hurt out \nability to reform the way elections are conducted. This amendment would \nensure that State, district or local committees of a political party \nwould be able to continue to provide vital services to our citizenry \nduring Federal elections, from voter registration activities to \nassisting individuals in getting out to vote on Election Day.\n  The 2000 election taught us many things. One of the most important \nwas the significance of having an informed electorate. Too many \ncitizens in the last election were provided with too little information \nabout where and how to vote. Too many citizens experienced unwarranted \nobstacles to registration and voting. As a result, fewer votes were \ncounted, and in the next election fewer people may turn out to vote.\n  The solution to these problems cannot be in the province of \nGovernment alone. America's political parties must play an important \nrole in helping people register to vote, helping them learn\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\nmore about the voting process and helping them turn out at the polls on \nelection day. It is vital to the health of our democratic process. \nLeading up to an election, both parties provide voters with information \non how and where to register to vote. On Election Day, both parties use \ntheir resources to drive elderly voters to the polls, provide answers \nto questions about where and how to vote, and give voters information \nabout where the candidates stand on issues.\n  In the State of New York over the past 2 years, the State Democratic \nParty has conducted an intensive voter education drive in predominantly \nAfrican-American and Latino communities, often our most disenfranchised \ncitizens. This education drive resulted in a surge in voter \nregistration and voter activity in both of these communities throughout \nthe state. Republican parties around the country are also active in \nvoter registration and get out the vote efforts. This type of activity \nshould continue to be supported by our State parties for all elections \nso that all of our citizens fully participate in our democracy.\n  Some will claim that this amendment will bring soft money back into \nfederal campaigns. Let me be very clear, this amendment does not bring \nsoft money back into campaigns. Rather, it allows State and local \nparties to use money that is regulated by States and is capped at \n$10,000 for single contributions in order to support vital election \nservices. That represents an improvement over the status quo, because \nunder current law there is no national cap on such contributions at the \nlocal and State level.\n  I ask my colleagues to rise in support of an amendment that will \nensure that our political parties can continue to use State regulated \nfunds to provide voter education, registration and get out the vote \nservices that we know work. Because helping voters register to vote, \nhelping them to learn how and where to vote, and helping them get out \nto vote are American values we should encourage, not inhibit.\n  It is imperative this amendment pass so we are able to make a very \nclear distinction between the kind of roles and activities that should \nbe conducted by parties and that we look forward to a time when we are \ngoing to be able to take up electoral reform with the same intensity \nthat we have taken up campaign finance reform, which will give us a \nchance to go into more detail as to what our parties could and should \nbe doing in order to promote democracy.\n  I thank our colleague from North Dakota for pointing out where we \nstand when it comes to voter participation. I hope all of our \ncolleagues will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do the Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. DODD. We do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n161.\n  The amendment (No. 161) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 162\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 162.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I have given a copy of the amendment to Senator McConnell \nand I will make copies available to any other Members who would like to \nread it. The amendment is very straightforward. If I can have just a \nmoment or two, I will describe it for those who are interested.\n  It is an amendment relating to disclaimers on television and radio \nads, as well as in print media. It requires of those electioneering \ncommunications--the so-called Snowe-Jeffords ads--that they abide by \nthe same requirements for disclaimer and disclosure as ads for \ncandidates themselves and ads authorized by candidates, and independent \nexpress advocacy ads. It requires, when it comes to these ads, that \nthey also show on the screen, for example, not only the name of the \norganization that is sponsoring the ad, paying for the ad, but also \neither an address, phone number, or Internet Web site.\n  I can give a very inspired speech as to why this is necessary. But I \nthink the concept is very basic. It is that we do not want to restrict \nfreedom of expression, nor in fact do we restrict freedom of deception. \nIf somebody wants to put an ad on that is categorically wrong, whether \nit is a candidate, a party, or any other group, I guess there is an \nAmerican right to that. But we do, I hope, insist on accountability. At \nleast identify who you are. If you are going to be part of our \npolitical process, tell us who you are. That is exactly all this does \nin terms of disclaimer. Whether it is a candidate, whether an ad \nauthorized by a candidate, or so-called electioneering communication, \nthat is what will happen. It applies to printed communications as well.\n  For those keeping track, this was part of McCain-Feingold in both the\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\n105th and 106th Congress--a large portion of it was. It is something \nthat many of us believe, and it was adopted by the House, would \ncomplement the work we have done thus far in the debate.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Illinois. This \nis a very worthwhile amendment. We can all relate to this. We have seen \nthese ads come on and you have to freeze frame it and get a magnifying \nglass to even read the source, where they are coming from. Usually, it \nis a name that has no identification other than something that sounds \nvery good and hardly revealing as to who is responsible for it, let \nalone any address or telephone number that would allow the kind of \ndisclosure that ought to be associated with this kind of advertising.\n  This is a very commonsensical. I think everybody ought to appreciate \nthe effort. I commend my colleague for offering it. I am happy to be a \ncosponsor of it and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from \nIllinois is a clear violation of the Supreme Court decision of McIntyre \nv. Ohio Elections Commission, handed down in 1995, in which the Supreme \nCourt made it abundantly clear that you cannot require disclaimers on \nissue ads.\n  Having said that, I think everybody knows that the Senator from \nKentucky would like to hang as many barnacles as possible on the hull \nof this bill, and I look forward to having one more argument to make \nbefore the courts. Therefore, I have no objection to this being adopted \non a voice vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Who said politics makes strange bedfellows?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do all Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 162) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 163\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nJeffords. It is designed to strengthen the enforcement of the criminal \nprovisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  Four years ago, the Governmental Affairs Committee held hearings on \nillegal and improper activity in the 1996 presidential campaign. As a \nresult of that investigation, we learned about a wide-ranging effort to \ncircumvent the federal election laws by funneling campaign \ncontributions, sometimes from foreign sources, through American \ncitizens to benefit presidential campaigns.\n  While I have voiced my concerns about the quality of the Department \nof Justice's investigation and prosecution of these violators, today I \nam addressing structural flaws in the statute that make it difficult \nfor the more conscientious prosecutors to adequately pursue their \ncases. Specifically: FECA fails to provide for felony prosecutions \nregardless of the severity of the offense. Its three year statute of \nlimitations is too short--for instance, only the administration that \nwins the election can enforce the law prior to the running of the \nstatute of limitations. Finally, there is no sentencing guideline for \nFECA violations. Because of these deficiencies in the statute, our \namendment would make the following changes.\n  First, in the 1996 presidential campaign, the Special Investigation \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee identified at least $2,825,600 in \nillegal contributions to the DNC. Yet, regardless of the extent to \nwhich the laws were broken, all the violations under FECA were still \nmisdemeanors. Our amendment would remedy this problem for the future by \nauthorizing felony prosecutions of FECA violations, but only if (1) the \noffender committed the existing federal offense ``knowingly and \nwillfully'' and (2) the offense involved more than $25,000.\n  Second, criminal violations of FECA are the only federal crimes \noutside of the Internal Revenue Code that have a statute of limitations \nshorter than 5 years. Our amendment conforms FECA's statute of \nlimitations to those of virtually all other federal crimes.\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\n  Third, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which govern federal \njudges' sentencing decisions, do not currently have a guideline \nspecifically directed at campaign finance violations. As a result, \njudges must use guidelines for other offenses, preventing them from \nconsidering factors which should enhance the punishment for FECA \nviolations such as the size of a contribution or its origin. Our \namendment would require the Sentencing Commission to promulgate a \nguideline specifically for violations of FECA and provide for \nenhancement of sentences if the violation involves (i) a contribution, \ndonation or expenditure from a foreign source; (ii) a large number of \nillegal transactions; (iii) a large aggregate amount of illegal \ncontributions, donations or expenditures; (iv) the receipt or \ndisbursement of government funds; or (v) an intent to achieve a benefit \nfrom the government.\n  The changes made in this amendment will provide conscientious \nprosecutors with the tools they need to investigate and prosecute those \nwho violate our campaign finance laws and attack the integrity of our \nelectoral process. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nTennessee in offering this amendment, and I am delighted to be joined \nby Senators Leahy, Collins and Jeffords as cosponsors. Senators \nThompson, Collins and I spent the better part of a year working on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's investigation into fundraising \nimproprieties in the 1996 federal election campaigns. That \ninvestigation sparked a lot of discussion about whether many things \nthat happened in 1996 were illegal or just wrong--things like big soft \nmoney donations, attack ads run by tax-exempt organizations, \nfundraising in federal buildings and the like.\n  But one thing I never heard argument about is whether it was illegal \nto knowingly infuse foreign money into a political campaign or to use \nunwitting straw donors to hide the true source of money that was going \nto candidates or parties. I, for one, had no doubt that the people who \ndid those things in 1996 would be prosecuted and appropriately \npunished.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, many of them were prosecuted, but I \nhave grave doubts about whether they were appropriately punished. I \nknow that there are many who blame the Justice Department for this, but \nwhen I first looked into it a couple of years ago, I was frankly \nsurprised by what I learned--and that is that prosecutors just don't \nhave the tools they need to effectively investigate, prosecute and \npunish people who egregiously violate our campaign finance laws. I \nthink Charles LaBella, the former head of the Justice Department's \nCampaign Finance Task Force, put it best in a memo he wrote assessing \nthe Department's campaign finance investigation. According to press \nreports, LaBella wrote that ``The fact is that the so-called \nenforcement system is nothing more than a bad joke.'' Unfortunately, \nit's a bad joke that has real consequences for the integrity of our \ncampaigns and our democracy.\n  Let me give you one example. Many people are understandably upset \nthat Charlie Trie and John Huang didn't go to jail for what they did in \n'96. But the Federal Election Campaign Act, or FECA, doesn't authorize \nfelony prosecutions. No matter how egregiously someone violates FECA, \nall they can be charged with is a misdemeanor. And people rarely go to \njail for misdemeanors.\n  To get around FECA's limits, prosecutors often charge campaign \nfinance abusers with other federal crimes that are felonies, which is \nwhat they did with Trie and Huang. But that still often doesn't solve \nthe problem. That's because when it comes time for sentencing, judges \nhave to turn to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which still often \nbring light sentences because there is no guideline on campaign finance \nviolations.\n  The guidelines assign what's called a ``base offense level'' for each \ncrime, and then they give a number of factors that, if present, tell \nthe judge either to increase or decrease the offense level. The higher \nthe offense level, the higher the sentence.\n  Because the Guidelines don't have a provision on campaign finance \nviolations, judges have to look for the next closest offense, and they \noften end up using the fraud guideline. But that guideline doesn't take \ninto account the factors that make campaign finance violations so \nharmful, and the factors that are there often aren't particularly \nrelevant to campaign finance violations. For example, there is nothing \nin the guideline that makes judges distinguish between a campaign \nfinance violation involving $2,000 and one involving $2,000,000. So, \nwhen judges calculate the offense level of a defendant who funneled \nmillions of foreign dollars into a US campaign, they don't end up with \na high offense level, meaning that the defendant doesn't get a lengthy \nsentence. The prosecutors know this and the defendants know this, and \nthat must be one of the reasons why prosecutors accepted plea bargains \nfrom John Huang and Charlie Trie--because they knew they wouldn't do \nmuch better even if they won convictions at trial.\n  Our amendment would solve these problems, by putting a felony \nprovision into FECA and by directing the Sentencing Commission to \npromulgate a campaign finance guideline. If those two things happen, we \nwill have greater confidence that those who violate the law will be \nappropriately punished.\n  I understand that some may worry that we are criminalizing \nparticipating in the political process. That is neither the intent nor \nthe effect of this amendment. Our amendment would allow felony \nprosecutions only if, first, the defendant knowingly and willfully \nviolated the law, and second, if the offense involved at least $25,000. \nSo, it would not punish the donor who inadvertently goes over his \ncontribution limits, nor would it go after the Party Committee clerk \nwho makes a record-keeping mistake. Instead, our amendment aims at the \nopportunistic hustlers who come up with broad conspiracies to violate \nthe election laws usually for personal gain by funneling foreign money \ninto our campaigns or using large numbers of straw donors to hide their \nidentity or make contributions they aren't allowed to make the people \neveryone says should be going to jail.\n  Our amendment contains one other provision--one extending FECA's \nstatute of limitations from three to five years. As of now, FECA has \nthe only statute of limitations outside the Internal Revenue Code of \nless than five years. We need to change that so that prosecutors are \ndenied the time they need to pursue complex crimes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about something that we all should \nbe able to agree upon, which is that actions that are already criminal \nand that we all agree are wrong should be punished. None of our \namendment's provisions should be controversial, and I hope that we can \nsee them enacted into law, so that we can go into the next election \ncycle with confidence that prosecutors have the tools necessary to \ndeter and to punish those who would violate our election laws. I thank \nmy colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand this amendment has been cleared \nby both sides. The amendment enhances the criminal enforcement \nprovisions of the FECA legislation by authorizing felony prosecutions \nof willful and knowing violations of that law over $25,000, directs the \nSentencing Commission to promulgate guidelines on campaign finance \nviolations, and extends the FECA statute of limitations for criminal \nviolations from 3 to 5 years.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sure this must be a wonderful idea \nif it was offered by Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson. Therefore, \nI am happy for the amendment to be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 163) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I commend Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold for their extraordinary efforts over the last several weeks, \ntogether with all of our colleagues, in trying to create a system of \ncampaign finance reform that will be truly reflective of elections in \nthe United States--elections about ideas and not just about money \nflowing in from everywhere.\n  Their efforts will be for naught if we don't have the adequate \nenforcement of the laws that we are adopting today and on succeeding \ndays.\n  My amendment would specifically strengthen the Federal Election \nCommission, which is the organization that is charged with enforcing \nall the laws we have been discussing for the last 2 weeks. Observers \nhave called the FEC ``beleaguered,'' a ``toothless watchdog,'' a \n``dithering nanny,'' and a ``lapdog,'' indicating that the state of the \nFEC is rather moribund because they don't have the resources necessary \nor some of the tools necessary to do the job of effectively enforcing \nour campaign finance laws.\n  All of this effort over these several weeks and several years will \namount to very little if we don't give the FEC the resources and tools \nto effectively enforce our campaign finance laws. If we are serious \nabout reform, we need to be serious about giving the FEC these \nresources.\n  My amendment is based upon recommendations made by the FEC \nCommissioners over many years with respect to improving the performance \nof the FEC. As we all know, the FEC is composed of six Commissioners--\nthree Republicans and three Democrats. These recommendations represent \na bipartisan response to the observed inadequacies of the Federal \nElection Commission. First and foremost, my amendment would reauthorize \nthe Federal Election Commission, which hasn't been technically \nreauthorized since 1980. It would also increase the authorized \nappropriations for this Commission. Over the past 2 weeks, we have \ntalked about doubling and tripling money going to candidates. Again, if \nwe are serious about campaign finance reform, we should also talk about \nincreasing the budget of the FEC. Senator Thompson mentioned yesterday \nthat the average amount spent by a winning Senate campaign went from \napproximately $1.2 million in 1980, to $7.2 million in the year 2000.\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  According to the FEC, total campaign spending has increased 1,000 \npercent since 1976. Total campaign finance disbursement activity was \n$300 million in 1976 and exploded to $3.5 billion in the year 2000 \nelection cycle. But the agency responsible for administering these \ncampaign finance laws, the Federal Election Commission, has seen very \nlittle increase in their operating budget over these many years. We \nhave had an explosion of activity, we have had an explosion of \ncontributions, but nothing to keep the FEC in league or in sync with \nthis explosion of campaign spending.\n  Despite all the increased activity, the FEC staff is virtually the \nsame as it was almost 20 years ago. In 1980, the FEC had 270 full-time \nequivalent staff. In 1998, the level was about 303, a very small \nincrease, and at the same time there has been an explosion of \ndonations, an explosion of reports, and increased in activity.\n  It is obvious with all of these activities, with all of these \ntransactions that were reported that the FEC needs to do more and needs \nmore resources to do the job it has been commissioned to do. The FEC is \nexpected to review these financial reports. They are expected to \nenforce the laws, and unless we give them the resources to do that, we \nare going to be in a very sorry state and, indeed, we are in a very \nsorry state today. Because of the onslaught of cases before the FEC, it \nhas to prioritize its enforcement work.\n  It turns out they give certain cases priority status. That means when \nthere is an available attorney, they will put that attorney on the \ncase, but there are so many cases that they eventually become stale. In \nfact, the FEC had to dismiss about half of its enforcement caseload in \nfiscal year 1998 and in fiscal year 1999 due to lack of resources. Due \nto the limited resources they have, they simply cannot keep up with the \nwork. Once again, if we are serious about reform, we should be serious \nabout giving the FEC the resources to do it.\n  Let me move forward and suggest other aspects of the legislation \nwhich is before us today in my amendment. In addition to increasing the \nresources to meet this obvious need, the amendment would also authorize \nthe Commission to conduct random audits in order to ensure voluntary \ncompliance with the campaign act.\n  It is based upon the same premise we use with the Internal Revenue \nService. The idea that somebody would show up and look at your records \nencourages you to keep good records and to follow the law. That same \nprinciple would be effective with respect to the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  In addition to giving authority for random audits, it also would give \nthe Commission the authority to seek an injunction from a Federal judge \nunder specific circumstances.\n  First, there would have to be a substantial likelihood that a \nviolation of campaign finance laws is occurring or is about to occur. \nThere has to be a showing that the failure to act expeditiously will \nresult in irreparable harm to a party affected by the potential \nviolation, and that expeditious action would not cause undue harm to a \nparty affected by the potential violation, and finally, the public \ninterest would be best served by such an injunction.\n  I point out that in order to seek such an injunction, the Commission \nwould have to have a majority vote, 4 out of 6, and since there are \nthree Republicans and three Democrats, this process of injunction would \nnecessarily have to include votes from both Republicans and Democrats. \nI think it is a way to ensure fairness and not abuse this injunctive \npower.\n  In addition to providing these aspects, the amendment would do \nsomething else. It would also increase the penalties for willful \nviolations and knowing violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act. \nThe violations would be increased from $10,000 to $15,000 or an amount \nequal to 300 percent of the violation amount, the greater of those two \nsums.\n  The amendment also includes a provision that would restrict the \nmisuse of a candidate's name. It would require that a candidate's \ncommittee include the name of the candidate, but it also would prohibit \nthe use of that candidate's name by an unauthorized committee or any \nother committee except the party committee.\n  This would, I hope, correct a situation in which committees or \norganizations unrelated to the candidate use the name of the candidate \nand misuse the name of the candidate.\n  Also, the amendment would expedite procedures used by the FEC to \nenforce violations or investigate violations of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act.\n  It would also allow an expedited referral to the Attorney General in \nthe case of a perceived criminal violation of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. Once again, such a referral would require a majority vote \nof the Commissioners, so it would be inherently bipartisan and could \nnot be abused by a partisan faction of the Federal Election Commission.\n  We have for the last several weeks been working diligently, \ncreatively to fashion stronger Federal election campaign laws. But \nwithout my amendment, all of our work might be for nought because \nunless we strengthen the Federal Election Commission, we will not have \nthe enforcement capability to take this legislative design which we \nhave worked over so many days, and make it effective to regulate the \ncampaigns for Federal office in the United States.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Reed seeks to reverse a \ndecision taken in 1979. Back in 1979, under pressure from House \nDemocrats, the Democratic-controlled House and Senate passed the \namendment, signed into law by a Democratic President, which eliminated \nrandom audits.\n  The catalyst was a large number of audits that were commenced \nconsuming enormous amounts of time and money and done in a manner which \nwas viewed as unfair.\n  This provision may present the same problem. I say to my friend from \nRhode Island, we are going to need to look at it overnight. My \ninclination is to oppose it, in which case we will need a rollcall \nvote. At least we can look at it overnight.\n  It is unclear who authorizes the audits, the six appointed members of \nthe Commission or the general counsel appointed by those members? The \nperiod commencing these random audits is extended from 6 months to 12 \nmonths. Campaigns will have to wait 1 year before they even know if an \naudit will begin and if they need to raise additional funds to cover \nthe cost.\n  There is no time limit for commencing audits of PACs or party \ncommittees. The 1979 amendment allowed the Commission to continue \naudits for cause where the FEC reviews the reports to determine if they \nmeet the threshold for substantial compliance.\n  After the review, it takes an affirmative vote of four Commissioners \nto conduct an audit. The only other agency I know that conducts random \naudits is the IRS, and even they are scaling back.\n  Practically speaking, an audit by the FEC takes years, costs tens, \neven hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers and accountants. For \ninstance, the audit of the 1996 Republican Convention concluded just \nmonths before the 2000 convention.\n  To carry out this provision, the FEC will have to double or even \ntriple its audit staff. This is wrong for the FEC to review the record \nbefore commencing an audit, which precisely will no longer be the case \nunder the Reed amendment.\n  We will have more to say about it tomorrow. Suffice it to say, I say \nto my friend from Rhode Island, he gets the drift. I think this is a \nstep in the wrong direction, and I think Members of the Senate need to \nbe apprised of the fact that they may be subjected to these lengthy and \ncostly audits under the Senator's amendment.\n  Maybe we will wake up and see the light and conclude the amendment of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island is a good idea. In any event, we will \nhave to carry it over until tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for bringing this \nup. These were provisions we proposed as well over the last number of \nyears.\n  There are very good concepts here. The random audit races issues can \nbe very expensive. If there is no cause for doing it randomly, there is \na legitimate concern this can be abused by\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\nthose who would like to become a policing action, without any rationale \nfor doing it, other than for the sake of doing it.\n  I would like to sleep on this and take a look at it and see if we can \nmaybe get some agreement to accept it tomorrow, maybe make some \nmodification; rather than dealing with it this evening, see if the \nstaff can work on it, the majority and the minority, to see if we can \ncome up with a proposal to be accepted before we can bring it up for \nconsideration between 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock in the morning. If the \nSenator would agree, that would help.\n  Mr. REED. I have no opposition to working in a purposeful manner.\n  I reassure the Senator of concerns expressed. First, the random audit \nwould have to be approved by the majority of commissioners. This is not \nsomething that would be inherently abusive, since it requires four \ncommissioners, at least one of whom has to be from the opposing party.\n  In addition, the audits would be subject to strict confidentiality \nrules and only when the audits are completed would they be published, \nand not try to insinuate an audit into the newspapers for political \ncampaign purposes.\n  I do believe this is a good way to reach compliance, and it is \nsomething that has been suggested by those people who look closely at \nthe Federal Election Commission.\n  With respect to the lengthening of the time period for audit, the \nlength is increased from 6 months to 12 months for those audits for \ncause. I think that is a reasonable amendment to the current practice. \nI hope it is accepted.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky \nsuggest, I have no opposition to thinking on this overnight and coming \nback.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  I have an amendment I may offer tomorrow, but we will have the staff \nlook at it and get their thoughts on it. We have done a lot of work. \nThere are outstanding amendments, including the amendment of Senator \nReed of Rhode Island, an amendment of Senator Hatch and Senator \nSpecter, and one I want to offer tomorrow morning, if necessary, with \nhalf an hour equally divided. That will be between 9 o'clock and 11 \no'clock and we should be able to wrap this up.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to read into the Record \nexcerpts from the cogent analysis of S. 27 that was prepared by James \nBopp, Jr., General Counsel of the James Madison Center for Free Speech, \nentitled ``Analysis of S. 27, `McCain-Feingold 2001.' '' In this \nanalysis, Mr. Bopp thoroughly demonstrates why this bill violates the \nfree speech and associational rights of individuals, political parties, \nlabor unions, corporations, and ``issue advocacy'' groups.\n  Mr. Bopp begins his analysis by noting whom S. 27 will hurt--the \n``little guy'', as he puts it--and whom it will help, chiefly the \nwealthy and the news corporations:\n\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 is a broad-based and pernicious attack \n     on the rights of average citizens to participate in the \n     democratic process, thereby enhancing the power of already \n     powerful wealthy individuals, millionaire candidates, and \n     large news corporations--the archetypal story of big guys \n     enhancing their power to dominate the little guy.\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 is a major assault on the average \n     citizen's ability to participate in the political process \n     because it targets and imposes severe restrictions on two key \n     citizen groups, which serve as the only effective vehicles \n     through which average citizens may pool their money to \n     express themselves effectively: issue advocacy groups and \n     political parties. However, McCain-Feingold 2001 leaves \n     wealthy individuals and candidates and powerful news \n     corporations unscathed, thereby enhancing their relative \n     power in the marketplace of ideas.\n       Both issue advocacy groups and political parties are \n     private organizations that provide a vehicle for average \n     citizens to effectively participate in the political process \n     by pooling their resources to enhance their individual \n     voices. These organizations participate broadly in our \n     democratic process by advocating issues of public concern, \n     lobbying for legislation, and directly promoting the election \n     of candidates.\n       Issue advocacy groups and political parties enhance \n     individual efforts by association. One individual of average \n     means can accomplish little alone in the public arena, but \n     thousands of average citizens who pool their resources with \n     like-minded individuals can accomplish great things by \n     working together. The right to associate, therefore, is so \n     fundamental to our democratic Republic and the ability of \n     average citizens to affect public policy so important that \n     the United States Supreme Court has recognized it as a \n     fundamental right with powerful constitutional protection.\n       Furthermore, political parties are not just about electing \n     candidates, particularly federal ones. Political parties \n     constitute a vital way by which citizens come together around \n     issues and values expressed in the planks of their party \n     platforms--at all levels of government. Parties advocate \n     these issues in the public forum in addition to lobbying for \n     legislation and engaging in efforts to elect candidates. \n     Parties are just as focused on the promotion of issues as are \n     ideological corporations, such as the National Right to Life \n     Committee or The Christian Coalition of America, and labor \n     unions, such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress \n     of Industrial Organizations, although with a broader spectrum \n     of issues. McCain-Feingold 2001 ignores this reality and \n     treats political parties as simply federal candidate election \n     machines.\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 attacks the abilities of ordinary \n     citizens to participate in the political process in two ways: \n     (1) by focusing restrictive efforts on issue advocacy \n     corporations, labor unions, and political parties--three \n     organizations vital to the ability of average citizens to \n     pool their resources to make their opinions heard, and (2) by \n     imposing sweeping restrictions that reach broadly beyond \n     direct participation in elections to restrict issue advocacy \n     (limiting discussion of issues of public concern, the views \n     of candidates on issues, and grassroots lobbying for favored \n     legislation).\n       If McCain-Feingold 2001 succeeds, the influence of the \n     average citizen would be drastically reduced because \n     association with like-minded individuals is essential to \n     effective participation in the public policy arena. With the \n     little guys locked in the dungeon of nonparticipation, the \n     rich and powerful will run politics, much as they did before \n     the first and foremost campaign reform adopted by our Nation, \n     the First Amendment, which protects the right of association \n     and demands that ``Congress . . . make no law . . . abridging \n     the freedom of speech''--especially speech about those in \n     power and on the critical issues of the day.\n       Campaign finance ``reform'' proposals, notably McCain-\n     Feingold 2001, do not, and could not, eliminate the power of \n     the giant news media corporations, which are protected by the \n     First Amendment from regulation of editorial content and news \n     coverage. Neither may the wealthy be prohibited from spending \n     their own money--either to express their views on public \n     issues and candidates or to advocate their own election. But \n     the wealthy don't need to pool their resources to be \n     effective, they have all the money they need to pay for \n     communications about the issues they care about. Furthermore, \n     millionaire candidates remain unaffected by proposed campaign \n     ``reforms'' because they need not rely on contributions from \n     others--they can spend their own money to campaign--and \n     officeholders of all stripes have the incredible power of \n     incumbency to support their candidacy. Thus, campaign finance \n     ``reform,'' as proposed by McCain-Feingold 2001, strips power \n     from the People and gives it to the already wealthy and \n     powerful.\n       So there are winners and losers under McCain-Feingold 2001. \n     The losers are citizens of average means, citizens groups, \n     advocacy organizations, labor unions, and political parties. \n     The winners are the wealthy, major news corporations, and \n     incumbent politicians. It is small wonder then that the \n     wealthiest foundations and individuals are prime supporters \n     of so-called campaign finance ``reform,'' that the mainstream \n     media is the primary cheerleader for it, and that incumbent \n     politicians are so attracted to it.\n       But in our Republic, founded by the People for the People, \n     the right of the People to speak out on the most critical \n     issues of the day in the political arena through issue \n     advocacy and the right of the people to come together to pool \n     their resources through associations may not be infringed \n     without violating the Constitution. The United States Supreme \n     Court and other federal courts have been stalwart in defense \n     of the citizens' rights of free speech and association. Be \n     assured that if these unconstitutional measures pass, we \n     stand ready to promptly challenge them in the courts with a \n     high probability of success.\n\n  Mr. Bopp then goes on to layout the general principles that the \nSupreme Court has set forth for analyzing government restrictions on \npolitical speech and political association. He states that:\n\n       ``Many of the so-called reforms floating around Washington \n     are in fact nothing more than incumbent protection acts. Many \n     politicians feel threatened by negative advertisements and \n     want to control what is said during campaigns.'' Others want \n     to reduce spending on campaigns.\n       Chief among these proposals is McCain-Feingold 2001, the \n     self-styled ``Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001'' (S. \n     27), sponsored principally by Senators John McCain and \n     Russell Feingold. Though announced with the promise of \n     reducing the corrupting influence of big money, McCain-\n     Feingold 2001 is instead a broad attack on citizen \n     participation in our democratic Republic. This bill shakes a \n     fist at the First Amendment; if passed, it is destined for a \n     court-ordered funeral. The most egregious provisions and \n     their infirmities are discussed below.\n       As noted in the introduction, average citizens must pool \n     their resources to have an effect in the political sphere of \n     issue advocacy,\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\n     lobbying, and electoral activity. The wealthy and powerful \n     have no such need. So ordinary people band together in \n     ideological corporations, labor unions, and political parties \n     to amplify their voices. This right to associate is a bedrock \n     principle of our democratic Republic, powerfully protected by \n     the U.S. Constitution. McCain-Feingold 2001, however, would \n     suppress this ability, along with the foundational \n     constitutional right to free speech.\n       It should be noted at the outset of this analysis that \n     political speech and association are at the heart of the \n     First Amendment protections. As the United States Supreme \n     Court has declared, ``the constitutional guarantee [of the \n     First Amendment] has its fullest and most urgent application \n     precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office.'' \n     Free expression in connection with elections is no second-\n     class citizen, rather political expression is ``at the core \n     of our electoral process and of the First Amendment \n     freedoms.'' Thus, ``there is practically universal agreement \n     that a major purpose of [the First] Amendment was to protect \n     the free discussion of governmental affairs, . . . of course \n     includ[ing] discussions of candidates.''\n       Furthermore, the fundamental right of association was well \n     articulated by the United States Supreme Court in the case of \n     NAACP v. Alabama, when the Court reviewed a suit against the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     brought by the State of Alabama seeking disclosure of all its \n     members.\n       The unanimous U.S. Supreme Court strongly affirmed the \n     constitutional protection for the freedom of association:\n       ``Effective advocacy of both public and private points of \n     view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced \n     by group association, as this Court has more than once \n     recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the \n     freedoms of speech and assembly. It is beyond debate that \n     freedom in association for the advancement of beliefs and \n     ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ``liberty'' assured by \n     the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which \n     embraces freedom of speech. Of course, it is immaterial \n     whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association \n     pertain to political, economic, religious or cultural \n     matters, and state action which may have the effect of \n     curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest \n     scrutiny.''\n\n     Thus, the Court held that ``[i]nviolability of privacy in \n     group association may in many circumstances be indispensable \n     to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where \n     a group espouses dissident beliefs,'' and it, therefore, \n     protected the identity of members of the NAACP form \n     disclosure.\n       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the \n     constitutional protection for association. `[E]ffective \n     advocacy of both public and private points of view, \n     particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by \n     group association. [Consequently,] the First and Fourteenth \n     Amendments guarantee freedom to associate with others for the \n     common advancement of political beliefs and ideas.' The Court \n     then noted that `action which may have the effect of \n     curtailing the freedom to associate is subject to the closest \n     scrutiny.' This highest level of constitutional protection, \n     of course, flows from the essential function of associations \n     in allowing effective participation in our democratic \n     Republic. Organizations, from political action committees \n     (`PACs') to ideological corporations to labor unions to \n     political parties, exist to permit `amplified individual \n     speech.'\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp next explains how S. 27 unconstitutionally \nprohibits and restricts the abilities of outside groups to exercise \ntheir rights to freedom of speech and of association. He first \ndiscusses how the bill's ``electioneering communication'' standard \nsweeps in issue speech and then shows how that standard violates \nSupreme Court precedent:\n\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 prohibits political participation by \n     citizens of average means by broadly defining `electioneering \n     communication' so that issue advocacy expenditures \n     currently permitted become forbidden under federal law for \n     corporations and labor unions.\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 restricts the issue advocacy of \n     ideological, nonprofit corporations and labor unions by first \n     defining `electioneering communication' to include issue \n     advocacy, i.e., `any broadcast, cable, or satellite \n     communication' to `members of the electorate' that `refers to \n     a clearly identified [federal] candidate' `within 60 days \n     before a general . . . election (30 days before primaries),' \n     and then adding it to the list of prohibited activities by \n     corporations and labor unions.\n       The broad definition of `electioneering communication' \n     plainly sweeps in and prohibits a wide variety of issue \n     advocacy communications traditionally engaged in by such \n     organizations. First, Congress is often in session within 60 \n     days before a general election and 30 days before a primary. \n     As a result, grass-roots lobbying regarding a bill to be \n     voted on during this 60 period would be prohibited if the \n     broadcast communication named a candidate by referring to the \n     bill in question (`the McCain-Feingold bill') or by asking a \n     constituent to lobby their Congressman or Senator.\n       With corporations and labor unions prohibited from making \n     such communications, McCain-Feingold 2001 then requires those \n     that may still do so, individuals and PACs, that spend over \n     $10,000 per year, to file reports with the FEC. Among other \n     things, the reports must list every disbursement over $200 \n     and to whom it was made, the candidate(s) to be identified, \n     and the identity of all contributors aggregating $1,000 or \n     more during the year. The $10,000 triggering expenditure \n     occurs when a contract is made to disburse the funds, which \n     might be months in advance--allowing ample time for incumbent \n     politicians, who object to the general public being informed \n     of their voting record or positions on issues, to attempt to \n     discourage the broadcast medium, or to intimidate the person \n     or PAC paying for the ad, from actually running the ad.\n       In sum, the issue advocacy communications of nonprofit \n     corporations and labor unions, are treated like express \n     advocacy communications and organizations doing such issue \n     advocacy are treated like PACs. However, as seen next, there \n     is no constitutional warrant for Congress to regulate issue \n     advocacy or the organizations that primarily engage in it. \n     Period.\n       To protect First Amendment freedom, the Supreme Court has \n     created a bright line between permitted and proscribed \n     regulation of political speech. Government may only regulate \n     a communication that `expressly advocates the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate' (`express \n     advocacy'), by `explicit words' or `in express terms,' such \n     as `vote for,' `support,' or `defeat.' Election-related \n     speech that discusses candidates' views on issues is known by \n     the legal term of art `issue advocacy.' Although issue \n     advocacy undoubtedly influences elections, it is absolutely \n     protected from regulation--even if done by corporations, \n     labor unions, or political parties.\n       Although the First Amendment says that `Congress shall make \n     no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech', the \n     `reformers,' and the incumbent politicians that their efforts \n     would protect, have refused to take ``no'' as an answer. But \n     the federal courts have consistently enforced the First \n     Amendment against all attempts to regulate issue advocacy.\n       The Supreme Court has recognized that the freedom of speech \n     is both an inherent liberty and a necessary instrument for \n     limited representative government. The Court observed that \n     `[i]n a republic where the people[, not their legislators,] \n     are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make informed \n     choices among candidates for office is essential, for the \n     identities of those elected will inevitably shape the course \n     that we follow as a nation.' As a result, `it can hardly be \n     doubted that the constitutional guarantee [of the freedom of \n     speech] has its fullest and most urgent application precisely \n     to the conduct of campaigns for political office.'\n       The seminal case is the 1976 decision of Buckley v. Valeo, \n     where the Supreme Court was faced with constitutional \n     questions regarding the post-Watergate amendments to the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act (`FECA')--which was by far the \n     most comprehensive attempt to regulate election-related \n     communications and spending to date. One of the more \n     nettlesome problems with which the Court struggled was the \n     question of what speech could be constitutionally subject to \n     government regulation. The post-Watergate FECA was written \n     broadly, subjecting any speech to regulation that was made \n     `relative to a clearly identified candidate' or `for the \n     purpose of . . . influencing' the nomination or election of \n     candidates for public office.\n       In considering this question, the Court recognized that the \n     difference between issue and candidate advocacy often \n     dissipated in the real world:\n       ``[T]he distinction between discussion of issues and \n     candidates and advocacy of the election or defeat of \n     candidates may often dissolve in practical application. \n     Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to \n     public issues involving legislative proposals and \n     governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the \n     basis of their positions on various public issues, but \n     campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.''\n       Thus, the Court was faced with a dilemma whether to allow \n     regulation of issue advocacy because it might influence an \n     election or to protect issue advocacy because it is vital to \n     the conduct of our representative democracy, even though it \n     would influence elections.\n       The Court resolved this dilemma decisively in favor of \n     protection of issue advocacy. First, the Court recognized \n     that `a major purpose of [the First Amendment] was to protect \n     the free discussion of governmental affairs . . . of course \n     includ[ing] discussions of candidates.' Thus, the Court \n     concluded that issue advocacy was constitutionally \n     sacrosanct:\n       ``Discussion of public issues and debate on the \n     qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of \n     the system of government established by our Constitution. The \n     First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such \n     political expression in order `to assure [the] unfettered \n     interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political \n     and social changes desired by the people.' ''\n       Second, in order to provide this broad protection to issue \n     advocacy, the Court adopted the bright-line `express \n     advocacy' test which limited government regulation to only \n     those communications which `expressly advocate the election \n     or defeat of a clearly identified\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\n     candidate,' in `explicit words' or by `express terms.' In so \n     doing, the Court narrowed the reach of the FECA's disclosure \n     provisions to cover only `express advocacy.' A decade later, \n     the Court reaffirmed the express advocacy standard and \n     applied it to the ban on corporate and labor union \n     contributions and expenditures in connection with federal \n     elections.\n       Finally, not even the interest in preventing actual or \n     apparent corruption of candidates, which was found \n     sufficiently compelling to justify contribution limits, was \n     deemed adequate to regulate issue advocacy. The Court \n     rejected this interest even though it recognized that issue \n     advocacy could potentially be abused to obtain improper \n     benefits from candidates.\n       In adopting a test that focused on the words actually \n     spoken by the speaker, the Court expressly rejected the \n     argument that the test should focus on the intent of the \n     speaker or whether the effect of the message would be to \n     influence an election:\n       ``[W]hether words intended and designed to fall short of \n     invitation [to vote for or against a candidate] would miss \n     the mark is a question both of intent and of effect. No \n     speaker, in such circumstances, safely could assume that \n     anything he might say upon the general subject would not be \n     understood by some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly \n     clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general \n     advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker in these \n     circumstances wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding \n     of his hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be \n     drawn as to his intent and meaning.\n       ``Such a distinction offers no security for free \n     discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty \n     whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and \n     trim.''\n       Some `reformers' claim that the Court was not sufficiently \n     farsighted to see the effect that issue advocacy would \n     eventually have in influencing elections and, if we only \n     bring this to their attention, then the Court will allow \n     government regulation of it. However, the Court made clear \n     that it was not so naive:\n       ``Public discussion of public issues which also are \n     campaign issues readily and often unavoidably draws in \n     candidates and their positions, their voting records and \n     other official conduct. Discussions of those issues, as well \n     as more positive efforts to influence public opinion on them, \n     tend naturally and inexorably to exert some influence on \n     voting at elections.''\n\n     As a result, the Court explicitly endorsed the use of issue \n     advocacy to influence elections:\n\n       ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they \n     want to promote the candidate and his views.''\n       The several lower federal courts and state courts that have \n     been faced with restrictions on issue advocacy have \n     faithfully adhered to the `explicit' or `express' words of \n     advocacy test according to its plain terms.\n       For example, in Michigan, the Secretary of State \n     promulgated a rule that banned corporate and labor union \n     communications made within 45 days of an election that merely \n     contained the `name or likeness of a candidate.' Two \n     traditional adversaries, Right To Life of Michigan and \n     Planned Parenthood, challenged the rule in separate federal \n     courts and had the rule declared unconstitutional. \n     Consequently, if passed, McCain-Feingold 2001's materially \n     identical `electioneering communication' definition is dead \n     on arrival in the federal courts.\n       The weight of authority is indeed heavy; the express \n     advocacy test means exactly what it says. Campaign finance \n     statutes regulating more than explicit words of advocacy of \n     the election or defeat of clearly identified candidates are \n     `impermissibly broad' under the First Amendment.''\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp then notes that while S. 27 has an exception \nfor not-for-profit corporations so that they would not be banned from \nengaging in core political speech, issue advocacy, the price that the \nbill extorts from these groups from doing so--the disclosure of \nconfidential donor information--is unconstitutional. I will quote Mr. \nBopp's analysis of this part of S. 27, Mr. President, but I should note \nthat because this body has adopted Senator Wellstone's amendment to \nthis bill, not-for-profit corporations now cannot engage in issue \nadvocacy at all within 60 days of an election, even if they divulge to \nthe federal government their confidential donor information. Mr. Bopp \nobserves that:\n\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 makes a very minor exception for \n     nonprofits that (1) permits expenditures for ``electioneering \n     communication,'' (2) applies only to those organizations tax \n     exempt under Sec. Sec. 501(c)(4) or 527 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code, and (3) applies only if they are made by a \n     quasi-PAC established by the corporation, to which \n     contributions can only be made by individuals and with \n     respect to which all receipts and disbursements must be \n     reported.\n       The first thing to be noted about this minor exception is \n     that it only applies to 501(c)(4) and 527 organizations. That \n     means all other nonprofits are excluded from engaging in \n     issue advocacy for a couple of months before an election, \n     including 501(c)(3)s, veterans groups, trade associations, \n     and labor unions.\n       Furthermore, this quasi-PAC is required to report all of \n     its contributors of $1,000 or more. This is a very \n     substantial burden because it exposes contributors to \n     harassment and intimidation by ideological foes. The United \n     States Supreme Court in Buckley held that such burdens \n     could not be applied to issue-oriented groups, as McCain-\n     Feingold 2001 does, because disclosure of private \n     associations is an unconstitutional burden.''\n\n  Next, Mr. President, Mr. Bopp explains how the ``coordination'' \nprovisions of McCain-Feingold effectively prohibits persons from \nexercising their First Amendment right to petition the government for \nredress of grievances, as well as their free speech and associational \nrights. Mr. Bopp notes that:\n\n       McCain-Feingold 2001 also prohibits corporations and labor \n     unions for funding any ``coordinated activity.'' \n     ``Coordinated activity'' is so broadly defined and uses such \n     vague terms that it would ban nearly everything of any \n     conceivable value to a candidate by converting it into a \n     forbidden ``contribution.''\n       ``Coordinated activity'' is ``anything of value provided by \n     a person [including corporations and labor unions] in \n     connection with a Federal candidate's election who is or \n     previously has been within the same election cycle acting in \n     coordination with that candidate . . . (regardless of whether \n     the value being provided is in the form of a communication \n     that expressly advocates a vote for or against a \n     candidate).'' Thus, there are two key concepts to this \n     prohibition: (1) ``anything of value'' and (2) \n     ``coordination.''\n\n  Mr. Bopp first discusses why ``anything of value'' is both vague and \nbroad, and he then explains why a ``coordinated activity'' is also \nextremely sweeping:\n\n       A ``coordinated activity'' includes ``anything of value \n     provided by a person in connection with a Federal candidates' \n     election.'' ``Anything of value'' is breathtakingly broad and \n     vague and any such thing is subject to being coordinated. It \n     provides no limit or notice to organizations subject to civil \n     and criminal sanctions for coordinating it with a candidate.\n       Furthermore, with respect to communications, it is not \n     limited to express advocacy and thus clearly encompasses \n     issue advocacy by an organization. While the courts are \n     currently divided on whether a coordinated communication must \n     contain express advocacy to be subject to regulation or \n     prohibition, no court has suggested that any and all \n     communications are so subject.\n       Under current law, coordination between a candidate and a \n     citizen group exists only when there is actually prior \n     communication about a specific expenditure for a specific \n     project that effectively puts the expenditure under the \n     candidate's control or is made based on information provided \n     by the candidate about the candidate's needs or plans. \n     However, McCain-Feingold 2001 expands ``coordination'' to \n     include, inter alia, mere discussion of a candidate's \n     ``message'' any time during ``the same election cycle,'' \n     i.e., a two-year period or, perhaps, a four-year period, if \n     it relates to a President, or a six-year period if it relates \n     to a Senator.\n       For example, if an incorporated ideological organization \n     praised Sen. McCain for his work on campaign finance \n     ``reform'' early in a session of Congress and worked with him \n     on promoting such ``reform'' legislation, then \n     ``coordination'' would be established and anything of value \n     to Sen. McCain's candidacy would be deemed coordinated, would \n     be a contribution to his campaign, and would be illegal \n     because corporations cannot make contributions to candidates.\n       However, the very notion that American citizens should be \n     punished for communicating, or even working, with their \n     elected officials on a wide range of public issues important \n     to the official and his constituency by having any subsequent \n     efforts to praise the candidate's issue position or to \n     support the candidate in his or her campaign considered a \n     coordinated activity is repugnant to our constitutional \n     scheme of participatory government in a democratic Republic \n     run by and answerable to the People. In a conceptually \n     related context, in Clifton v. FEC, the First Circuit struck \n     down the FEC's voter guide regulations which prohibited any \n     oral communications with candidates in preparation of voter \n     guides. The court held that this rule is ``patently offensive \n     to the First Amendment'' and that it is ``beyond reasonable \n     belief that, to prevent corruption or illicit coordination, \n     the government could prohibit voluntary discussions between \n     citizens and their legislators and candidates on public \n     issues.''\n       And coordination would also be presumed, under McCain-\n     Feingold 2001, if the ideological corporation used the same \n     vendor of ``professional services,'' including ``polling, \n     media advice, fundraising, campaign research, political \n     advice, or direct mail services (except for mailhouse \n     services)'' if the vendor had worked for a candidate and if \n     the vendor is retained to do work related to that candidate's \n     election. Under this scheme, a vendor's decision to do work \n     for a candidate could unilaterally lock an ideological \n     corporation out of otherwise permitted issue advocacy at \n     election time. And even if the corporation has a connected \n     PAC, the PAC would be prohibited from making an independent \n     expenditures of more than $5,000,\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n     since that expenditure would also be deemed to be a \n     contribution.\n       This presumption is also fatally infirm as coordination \n     must be proven. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. \n     v. FEC, the FEC took the position that party expenditures \n     were presumed to be coordinated with their candidates as a \n     matter of law. The Supreme Court rejected this view: ``An \n     agency's simply calling an independent expenditure a \n     `coordinated expenditure' cannot (for constitutional \n     purposes) make it one. . . . [T]he government cannot \n     foreclose the exercise of constitutional rights by mere \n     labels.'' The Court held that there must be ``actual \n     coordination as a matter of fact.'' Congress, therefore, \n     cannot merely recite some factual scenarios wherein it might \n     be possible, or even probable, that coordination with \n     candidates takes place and then presume as a matter of law \n     that it has occurred in such instances. To do so, would allow \n     the government to drastically curtail independent \n     expenditures by mere labels, which cannot be constitutionally \n     limited.\n       Finally, McCain-Feingold finds ``coordination'' if there is \n     any ``general understanding'' with the candidate about the \n     expenditure. This general catchall goes way beyond the narrow \n     understanding that the courts have on what ``coordination'' \n     is. Consistent with other federal courts, the District Court \n     in FEC v. Christian Coalition held that a communication\n       ``becomes `coordinated' where the candidate or her agents \n     can exercise control over, or where there has been \n     substantial discussion or negotiation between the campaign \n     and the spender over a communication's: (1) Contents; (2) \n     timing; (3) location, mode, or intended audience (e.g., \n     choice between newspaper or radio advertisement); or (4) \n     `volume' (e.g., number of copies of printed materials or \n     frequency of media spots). `Substantial discussion' or \n     `negotiation' is such that the candidate and spender emerge \n     as partners or joint venturers in the expressive expenditure, \n     but the candidate and spender need not be equal partners.''\n\n     This is a far cry from a `general understanding.'\n\n  Mr. President, at this point in Mr. Bopp's analysis, he explains that \nthe citizenry needs a bright line not only to protect them from \nprosecution, but to protect them from a punitive investigation simply \nbecause they exercised their First Amendment rights.\n\n       While it may be theoretically possible to do issue advocacy \n     without running afoul of it being a prohibited \n     `electioneering communication' or `coordinated activity,' \n     only the reckless, foolish, or wealthy and powerful are \n     likely to try. Particularly in Washington, D.C., the \n     punishment is in the process. Any organization that does \n     something that could be deemed of value to a candidate can \n     expect to be the subject of an FEC complaint and \n     investigation to ferret out whether the activity was \n     `coordinated.' Thus, publicly praising an officeholder for \n     her vote on a bill invites investigation by the FEC. Daring \n     to tell constituents to get an incumbent to change his \n     position on an upcoming vote could provoke an FEC \n     investigation. This is the world of ubiquitous FEC \n     investigations that all advocacy groups can expect.\n       And these `mere' investigations themselves violate the \n     First Amendment. As the U.S. Supreme Court explained when \n     Congress was busy investigating Communist influence in the \n     1940's and 50's, `[t]he mere summoning of a witness and \n     compelling him to testify, against his will, about his \n     beliefs, expressions or associations is a measure of \n     government interference' with First Amendment freedoms.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp then notes another major impediment to \nindividuals and citizens' groups exercising their First Amendment \nrights, and that is how the bill's coordination provisions interplay \nwith contribution limits. He notes that ``[f]or any individual, and for \nany organization that can actually do a `coordinate activity,' which \nseems to be only a federal PAC, the `coordinated activity' would be \nlimited by contribution limits. So a substantial amount of traditional \n`independent expenditures' by PACs are now swept under the control of \nMcCain-Feingold 2001 and limited because a multi-candidate PAC can only \nmake a contribution of $5,000 per election to a candidate.''\n  Of course, Mr. President, this is only part of the story. As Mr. Bopp \nexplains, S. 27 also violates the free speech and associational rights \nof our political parties in its effort to regulate non-federal money. \nSpecifically, he states that ``[i]n its effort to regulate `soft \nmoney,' McCain-Feingold 2001 has two dramatic adverse effects on \npolitical party activity: (1) it imposes federal election law limits on \nthe state and local activities of national political parties, and (2) \nit dramatically limits the issue advocacy, legislative, and \norganizational activities of political parties. But first it is \nimportant to recall the U.S. Supreme Court's comment that `[w]e are not \naware of any special dangers of corruption associated with political \nparties. . . .' Political parties are merely the People associating \nwith others who share their values to advance issues, legislation, and \ncandidates that further those values. When they do these things, they \nare just doing their historic job as good citizens. The notion that \nthey are somehow corrupt for doing so is both strange and \nconstitutionally infirm.''\n  Mr. President, Mr. Bopp next notes that this bill federalizes state \nand local parties and totally federalizes national parties, which \nengage in a multitude of activities besides federal elections. He \nobserves that ``[a]lthough national parties care about local, state, \nand federal elections, they are treated by McCain-Feingold 2001 as if \nthey only care about federal elections. As to state and local political \nparties, if there is a federal candidate on the ballot, they too are \ntreated as if only the federal candidate matters. In short, McCain-\nFeingold 2001 federalizes the state and local election activities of \nnational, state, and local political parties.''\n  Mr. Bopp then explains how this federalization occurs: ``As to \nnational political parties, this happens as a result of the total ban \non national political parties receiving `soft money.' This happens to \nstate and local political parties as a result of the definition of \n`federal election activity,' which governs political party expenditures \nif any federal candidate is on the general election ballot, and which \nincludes `voter registration' during the 120 days before an election, \n`voter identification, get-out-the-vote activity, or [any activity \npromoting a political party].' Therefore, if state and local political \nparties do `federal election activity,' they must use `hard money,' \ni.e., money subject to FECA restrictions, for such activity if a \nfederal candidate is on the ballot. These activities are traditional \nactivities that state and local parties have always done and the \nnational political parties have supported. The fact that there is a \nfederal candidate on the ballot, along with the state and local \ncandidates for whom state and local parties have the greater concern, \ndoes not justify federalizing and limiting these activities.''\n  Mr. Bopp concludes his analysis of S. 27 by explaining the \nconstitutional problem with the bill's prohibition on the parties' use \nof non-federal dollars to engage in issue discussion. He first notes \nthat under the bill `` `federal election activity' includes `a public \ncommunication that refers to a clearly identified [federal] candidate .  \n.  . and that promotes or supports a candidate or opposes a candidate .  \n.  . (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a \nvote for or against a candidate) .  .  .' Presently, political parties, \nlike any other entity, may receive and spend an unlimited amount of \nmoney on issue advocacy. McCain-Feingold 2001 would virtually eliminate \nthis basic constitutional freedom for national political parties, by \nprohibiting the receipt of all `soft money,' and severely limit it for \nstate and local political parties, by requiring only hard money to be \nused if a federal candidate is involved. Because McCain-Feingold 2001 \nprohibits the raising of `soft money' by national political parties, \nthey have no such money available for issue advocacy, legislative, and \norganizational activities. It treats political parties as if they were \njust federal-candidate election machines. As a result, McCain-Feingold \n2001 has effectively amputated these other important, historical \nactivities of political parties.''\n\n  Mr. President, the constitutional problems with such restrictions on \nparties are explained in detail by Mr. Bopp as follows:\n\n       [T]hese restrictions fail constitutional muster. Political \n     parties enjoy the same unfettered right to issue advocacy as \n     other entities, which is especially appropriate because \n     advancing a broad range of issues is their raison d'etre. \n     `Reforms' banning political parties from receiving and \n     spending so-called `soft money' cannot be justified as \n     preventing corruption, since the Supreme Court has already \n     held that interest insufficient for restricting issue \n     advocacy in Buckley.\n       If individuals and narrow interest groups enjoy the basic \n     First Amendment freedom to discuss issues and the position of \n     candidates on those issues, how can political parties, which \n     have wide bases of interests that are necessarily tempered \n     and diffused, be deprived of the right to engage in such \n     issue advocacy?\n       However, proponents of abolishing `soft money' argue that \n     this is simply a `contribution limit.' The fallacy of that \n     argument, of\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\n     course, is that the Supreme Court has justified contribution \n     limits only on the ground that large contributions create the \n     reality or appearance of quid pro quo corruption, which, as \n     discussed above, cannot justify a limit on issue advocacy.\n       Furthermore, the proposed ban on soft money contributions \n     cannot be justified on the theory that political parties \n     corrupt federal candidates, which the Supreme Court has \n     already rejected. In Colorado Republican, the FEC took the \n     position that independent, uncoordinated expenditures by \n     political parties ought to be treated as contributions to the \n     benefitted candidate. Such treatment would have resulted in \n     allowing individuals, candidates, and political action \n     committees to spend unlimited amounts of money on independent \n     expenditures to advocate the election of a candidate, while \n     limiting the amount a political party could spend for the \n     same purpose.\n       The Supreme Court disagreed with the FEC, noting that `[w]e \n     are not aware of any special dangers of corruption associated \n     with political parties'' and, after observing that \n     individuals could contribute more money to political parties \n     ($20,000) than to candidates ($1,000) and PACs ($5,000) and \n     that the ``FECA permits unregulated `soft money' \n     contributions to a party for certain activities,' the Court \n     concluded that the `opportunity for corruption posed by these \n     greater opportunities for contributions is, at best, \n     attenuated.' The Court continued in this vein with respect to \n     the FEC's proposed ban on political party independent \n     expenditures, which has direct application to McCain-Feingold \n     2001's ban on soft money contributions:\n       ``[R]ather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive \n     influence of political parties, the legislative history [of \n     the Act] demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance \n     what was seen as an important and legitimate role for \n     political parties in American elections.  .  .  .\n       ``We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law \n     controls the outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution \n     that grants to individuals, candidates, and ordinary \n     political committees the right to make unlimited independent \n     expenditures could deny the same right to political \n     parties.''\n\n     The concurring justices also found little, if any, \n     opportunity for party corruption of candidates because of \n     their very nature and structure.\n\n       The Supreme Court echoed the same theme with respect to the \n     independent expenditures of political action committees:\n       ``The fact that candidates and elected officials may alter \n     or reaffirm their own positions on issues in response to \n     political messages paid for by PACs can hardly be called \n     corruption, for one of the essential features of democracy is \n     the presentation to the electorate of varying points of \n     view.''\n\n     If this is true of PACs, then a fortiori there can be no \n     corruption or appearance of corruption resulting from issue \n     advocacy by political parties.\n\n       In addition, the Supreme Court in MCFL provided further \n     guidance on whether the threat of corruption is posed by an \n     organization such as a political party. The Court considered \n     the ban on independent expenditures by corporations under 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 441b. The MCFL Court evaluated whether there was \n     any risk of corruption with regard to an MCFL-type \n     organization that would justify such a ban on its political \n     speech. While MCFL considered whether an ideological \n     corporation was sufficiently like a business corporation to \n     justify the ban on using corporate dollars for independent \n     expenditures, there are several transferable concepts to \n     evaluating the threat of corruption posed by a political \n     party.\n  The concern raised by the FEC in MCFL was that Sec. 441b served to \nprevent corruption by `prevent[ing] an organization from using an \nindividual's money for purposes that the individual may not support.' \nThe Court found that `[t]his rationale for regulation is not compelling \nwith respect' to MCFL-type organizations because `[i]ndividuals who \ncontribute to [an MCFL-type organization] are fully aware of its \npolitical purposes, and in fact contribute precisely because they \nsupport those purposes.' `[I]ndividuals contribute to a political \norganization in part because they regard such a contribution as a more \neffective means of advocacy than spending the money under their own \npersonal direction.' `Finally, a contributor dissatisfied with how \nfunds are used can simply stop contributing.' Thus, the Court held that \nthe prohibitions on corporate contributions and expenditures in \nSec. 441b could not be constitutionally applied to non-profit \nideological corporations which do not serve as a conduit for business \ncorporation contributions.\n       Political parties similarly pose no risk of corruption \n     because people give money to parties precisely because they \n     support what the political party stands for. A contribution \n     to a political party is for the purpose of enhancing advocacy \n     of the issues the party represents. Any individual unhappy \n     with the use of the money may simply quit contributing and \n     leave the political party. In sum, the threat of corruption \n     cannot justify a limit on issue advocacy and, even if it \n     could, political parties pose no threat of corruption to \n     their candidates.\n       Finally, the Supreme Court also found that, just as \n     independent expenditures of interest groups pose no danger of \n     corrupting candidates, neither do those of political parties. \n     And while no one disputes that expenditures on express \n     advocacy actually coordinated with candidates are properly \n     contributions to the candidate because of the possibility of \n     quid pro quo corruption, the Court held that coordination \n     must be proven as a matter of fact; it cannot be presumed. \n     `Reforms' may not presume coordination where it does not \n     actually exist.\n       Thus, there is no justification, in either policy or law, \n     for the severe limits on national, state, and local political \n     parties that McCain-Feingold 2001 imposes.\n\n  Thus, Mr. President, Mr. Bopp has thoroughly shown the myriad of \nconstitutional problems from which this bill suffers, and I am \nconfident that the Supreme Court will ultimately validate his analysis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nthe letter authored by Laura Murphy, Director of the Washington, D.C. \noffice of the American Civil Liberties Union and Professor Joel Gora of \nthe Brooklyn Law School. In this letter, Ms. Murphy and Professor Gora \nanalyze S. 27, ``The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001'' and \nthoroughly discuss its many constitutional infirmities.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n         American Civil Liberties Union, Washington National \n           Office,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: The McCain-Feingold bill, also misnamed as \n     ``The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001'' (S. \n     27) is a destructive distraction from the serious business of \n     meaningful campaign finance reform. Meaningful campaign \n     finance reform would develop comprehensive programs for \n     providing public resources, benefits and support for all \n     qualified federal political candidates. Since 25 years of \n     experience have shown that limits on political funding simply \n     won't work, constitutionally or practically, it is time to \n     seek a more First Amendment-friendly way to expand political \n     opportunity. Public financing for all qualified candidates is \n     an option that provides the necessary support for candidacies \n     without the imposition of burdensome and unconstitutional \n     limits and restraints. The ACLU has long argued for this, but \n     instead we must use our time today to condemn the ill-\n     conceived iterations of McCain-Feingold that are non-remedies \n     to our national campaign finance woes and are wholly at odds \n     with the essence of the First Amendment.\n       Simply put, the McCain-Feingold bill is a recipe for \n     political repression because it egregiously violates \n     longstanding free speech rights in several ways: It stifles \n     issue advocacy in violation of the First Amendment; it \n     criminalizes any constitutionally-protected contact that \n     groups and individuals may have with candidates (through bans \n     on so-called ``coordination''); and it virtually destroys \n     political parties in an unconstitutional fashion.\n\n        I. S. 27 Erodes Robust Citizen Speech Prior to Elections\n\n       As Virginia Woolf stated, ``If we don't believe in freedom \n     of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it \n     at all.'' Clearly, the authors and supporters of McCain-\n     Feingold despise any form of issue advocacy that has the \n     audacity to mention candidates for federal office by name. \n     The bill virtually silences issue advocacy (redefined as \n     ``electioneering communications'') in three ways:\n       Section 201 requires accelerated and expanded disclosure of \n     the funding of issue advocacy.\n       Section 202 effectively criminalizes issue advocacy as a \n     prohibited contribution if it is ``coordinated'' in the \n     loosest sense of that term with a federal candidate.\n       Section 203 bans issue advocacy completely if it is \n     sponsored by a labor union, a corporation (including such \n     non-profit corporations organized to advance a particular \n     cause like the ACLU or the National Right to Life \n     Committee or Planned Parenthood, unless they are willing \n     to obey the government's stringent new rules) or other \n     similar organized entity. Even an individual who receives \n     financial support--from prohibited contributors such as \n     corporations, unions or wealthy individuals--is also \n     barred from engaging in ``electioneering communications.''\n       The bill would impose these limitations on communications \n     about issues regardless of whether the communication \n     ``expressly advocates'' the election or defeat of a \n     particular candidate. Nor is there any requirement of even \n     showing a partisan purpose or intent. Instead, during 60 days \n     before a primary or 30 days before a general election, any \n     such communication is subject to the new controls simply by \n     identifying any person who is a federal candidate, which will \n     usually be an incumbent politician.\n       These restraints and punishments are triggered by the \n     making of any ``broadcast, cable, or satellite \n     communication'' which ``refers to a clearly identified \n     candidate for Federal office'' within 60 days of a general or \n     runoff election or 30 days of a primary election or \n     convention, ``made to an audience that includes members of \n     the electorate'' for such election or convention. This \n     distinction between broadcast, cable and satellite from\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n     those communications through other media bears no relevance \n     to the only recognized justification for campaign finance \n     limitations or prohibitions, namely, the concern with \n     corruption. Suppressing speech in one medium while permitting \n     it in another is not a lesser form of censorship, just a \n     different form.\n\n\n  A. These Issue Advocacy Restrictions Would Have Adverse, Real-Life \n                              Consequences\n\n       Had these provisions been law during the 2000 elections, \n     for example, they would have effectively silenced messages \n     from issue organizations across the entire political \n     spectrum. The NAACP ads--financed by a sole anonymous donor--\n     vigorously highlighting Governor Bush's failure to endorse \n     hate crimes legislation--is a classic example of robust and \n     uninhibited public debate about the qualifications and \n     actions of political officials. By the same token, last \n     Spring, when New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a candidate for \n     the United States Senate, any broadcast criticism of his \n     record on police brutality as mayor of New York, undertaken \n     by the New York Civil Liberties Union, would have subjected \n     that organization to the risk of severe legal sanctions and \n     punishment under these proposals. The Supreme Court in cases \n     from New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) \n     through Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) to California \n     Democratic Party v. Jones, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (2000) have \n     repeatedly protected full and vigorous debate during an \n     election season. The provisions of the pending bills would \n     silence that debate.\n       Second, the ban on ``electioneering communications'' would \n     stifle legislative advocacy on pending bills. The blackout \n     periods coincide with crucial legislative periods, including \n     the months of September and October as well as months during \n     the Spring. During Presidential years, the blackout periods \n     would include the entire Presidential primary season, \n     conceivably right up through the August national \n     nominating conventions. For example had this provision \n     been law in 2000, for most of the year it would have been \n     illegal for the ACLU or the National Right to Life \n     Committee to criticize the ``McCain-Feingold'' bill as an \n     example of unconstitutional campaign finance legislation \n     or to urge elected officials to oppose that bill! The only \n     time the blackout ban would be lifted would be in August, \n     when many Americans are on vacation!\n       During the 104th Congress, for example, the ACLU identified \n     at least 10 major, controversial bills that it worked on that \n     were debated in either chamber of the Congress within 60 days \n     prior to the November 1996 general election. This legislation \n     includes several anti-abortion bills including so-called \n     partial birth abortion legislation, public disclosure of the \n     CIA budget, creation of a federal database of sex offenders, \n     new federal penalties for methamphetamine use, prohibition on \n     discrimination of gays and lesbians in the workplace, same-\n     sex marriage prohibition, anti-immigration legislation and \n     school vouchers, among others. This pattern of legislating \n     close to primary and general elections has only been repeated \n     in subsequent Congresses.\n\n\n       B. Why These Limitations Run Afoul of the First Amendment\n\n       Under the reasoning of Buckley v. Valeo and all the cases \n     which have followed suit, the funding of any public speech \n     that falls short of such `express advocacy' is wholly immune \n     from campaign finance laws. Speech which comments on, \n     criticizes or praises, applauds or condemns the public \n     records and actions of public officials and political \n     candidates--even though it mentions and discusses candidates, \n     and even though it occurs during an election year or even an \n     election season--is entirely protected by the First \n     Amendment.\n       The Court made that crystal clear in Buckley when it \n     fashioned the express advocacy doctrine. That doctrine holds \n     that the FECA can constitutionally regulate only \n     ``communications that in express terms advocate the election \n     or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,'' and include \n     ``explicit words of advocacy of election or defeat.'' 424 \n     U.S. at 44, 45. The Court developed that doctrine because it \n     was greatly concerned that giving a broad scope to FECA, and \n     allowing it to control the funding of all discussion of \n     policy and issues that even mentioned a public official or \n     political candidate, would improperly deter and penalize \n     vital criticism of government because speakers would fear \n     running afoul of the FECA's prohibitions. ``The distinction \n     between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of \n     election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in \n     practical operation. Candidates, especially incumbents, are \n     intimately tied to public issues involving legislative \n     proposals and government actions. Not only do candidates \n     campaign on the basis of their positions on various public \n     issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public \n     interest.'' Id. at 42-43. If any reference to a candidate in \n     the context of advocacy of an issue rendered the speech or \n     the speaker subject to campaign finance controls, the \n     consequences for the First Amendment would be intolerable.\n       Issue advocacy is freed from government control through a \n     number of other doctrines the courts have recognized as well. \n     First, the constitutional right to engage in unfettered issue \n     advocacy is not limited to individuals or cause \n     organizations. Business corporations can speak publicly and \n     without limit on anything short of express advocacy of a \n     candidate's election. See First National Bank of Boston v. \n     Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978). (Of course, media corporations \n     can speak publicly and without limitation on any subject, \n     including editorial endorsements of the election or defeat of \n     candidates, i.e. ``express advocacy'', see Mills v. Alabama, \n     384 U.S. 214 (1966).)\n       Contributions to issue advocacy campaigns cannot be limited \n     in any way, either. See Citizens Against Rent Control v. \n     Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 (1981). Finally, issue advocacy may \n     not even be subject to registration and disclosure. See \n     McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995); \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 821, 843-44 (1975) (holding \n     unconstitutional a portion of the FECA which required \n     reporting and disclosure by issue organizations that \n     publicized any voting record or other information ``referring \n     to a candidate''). The rationale for these principles is not \n     just that these various groups have a right to speak, but \n     also that the public has a right to know and a need to hear \n     what they have to say. This freedom is essential to fostering \n     an informed electorate capable of governing its own affairs.\n       Thus, no limits, no forced disclosure, no forms, no \n     filings, no controls should inhibit any individual's or \n     group's ability to support or oppose a tax cut, to argue for \n     more or less regulation of tobacco, to support or oppose \n     abortion, flag-burning, campaign finance reform and to \n     discuss the stands of candidates on those issues.\n       That freedom must be preserved whether the speaker is a \n     political party, an issue organization, a labor union, a \n     corporation, a foundation, a newspaper or an individual. That \n     is all protected ``issue advocacy,'' and the money that funds \n     it is all, in effect, ``soft money.'' Those who advocate \n     government controls on what they call ``sham'' or ``phony'' \n     or ``so-called'' issue ads, and those who advocate outlawing \n     or severely restricting ``soft money'' should realize how \n     broad their proposals would sweep and how much First \n     Amendment law they would run afoul.\n       Finally, it is no answer to these principled objections \n     that this flawed bill would permit certain non-profit \n     organizations to sponsor ``electioneering communications'' if \n     they in effect created a Political Action Committee to fund \n     those messages. Under governing constitutional case law, \n     groups like the ACLU and others cannot be made to jump \n     through the government's hoops in order to criticize the \n     government's policies and those who make them. In addition, \n     most non-profits would be unwilling to risk their tax status \n     or incur legal expenses by engaging in what the IRS might \n     view as partisan communications. Moreover, the groups would \n     still be barred from using organizational or institutional \n     resources for any such communications. They would have to \n     rely solely on individual supporters, whose names would have \n     to be disclosed, with the concomitant threat to the right of \n     privacy and the right to contribute anonymously to \n     controversial organizations that was upheld in landmark cases \n     such as NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449 (1958). This holding \n     guaranteed the opportunities that donors now have to \n     contribute anonymously--a real concern when a cause is \n     unpopular or divisive.\n\n         II. S. 27 Assaults the Free Speech of Issue Advocates\n\n       The second systemic defect in this bill is its grossly \n     expanded concept of coordinated activity between politicians \n     and citizens groups. Such ``coordination'' then taints and \n     disables any later commentary by that citizen group about \n     that politician. By treating all but the most insignificant \n     contacts between candidates and citizens as potential \n     campaign ``coordination,'' the bill would render any \n     subsequent action which impacts that politician as a \n     regulated or prohibited ``contribution'' or ``expenditure'' \n     to that candidate's campaign. These provisions violate \n     established principles of freedom of speech and association.\n       Under existing law, contact coordination between a \n     candidate or campaign and an outside group can be regulated \n     as coordinated activity only where the group takes some \n     public action at the request or suggestion of the candidate \n     or his representatives, i.e., where the candidate is the \n     driving force behind the outside group's action. See Federal \n     Election Commission v. Christian Coalition, 52 F. Supp. 2d 45 \n     (D. D.C. 1999). Under the bill, however, the definition of \n     coordination is expanded in dramatic ways with severe \n     consequences, thereby prohibiting certain kinds of contact \n     with candidates. A coordinated activity can be found whenever \n     a group or individual provides ``anything of value in \n     connection with a Federal candidate's election'' where that \n     person or group has interacted with the candidate then or in \n     the past in a number of ways. This includes, for example, \n     instances which the outside person or group has ``previously \n     participated in discussions'' with the candidate or their \n     representative, ``about the candidate's campaign strategy . . \n     . including a discussion about .  .  . message. . .''\n       Section 214 of the bill thus imposes a year round \n     prohibition on all communications that are deemed ``of \n     value'' to a federal candidate. The bill wrongly asserts that \n     issue groups are ``coordinating'' if they merely discuss \n     elements of the lawmaker's message with the lawmaker or his \n     or her staff anytime during a two year period. For example, \n     if a veteran's group suggests to a candidate how best to talk \n     about the flag amendment in order to win the hearts and minds \n     of voters, the group then can't run ads in Senator McCain's \n     state praising him for protecting the flag.\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n       Once such so-called coordination is established it triggers \n     a total ban on issuing any communication to the public deemed \n     of value to the candidate, and it defines such communication \n     as an illegal corporate contribution! These rules act as a \n     continuing prior restraint, which bars the individual or \n     group from engaging in core First Amendment speech for the \n     lawmaker's entire term of office. Even if such an \n     organization has a connected PAC, it can no longer engage in \n     any independent expenditure affecting the lawmaker because by \n     merely speaking to the candidate or his or her staff it has \n     engaged in illegal ``coordination.'' Here again, the bill \n     attempts to impose another gag rule on issue advocacy \n     organizations.\n       Translated into the way in which citizen advocacy groups \n     work, this means that a group cannot urge a candidate to make \n     a particular proposal a part of the candidate's platform if \n     the group subsequently plans to engage in independent \n     advocacy on that issue. Likewise, a group like the National \n     Rifle Association could not discuss a gun control vote or \n     position with a Representative or Senator if the NRA will \n     subsequently produce a box score that praises or criticizes \n     that official's stand. Similar to the ban on coordination \n     (Section 202) discussed earlier in this letter, banning \n     ``coordination'' of ``electioneering activity'' resulting in \n     a long blackout period when an outside group or individual \n     can be blocked from broadcasting information about a \n     candidate, this ban--on coordination of ``anything of \n     value''--can operate month in and month out throughout the \n     entire two or six year term of office of the pertinent \n     politician. That is why the AFL-CIO, among other groups, is \n     so concerned about the treacherous sweep of the anti-\n     coordination rules. See ``Futile Labor: Why Are The Unions \n     Against McCain-Feingold?'' The New Republic, March 12, 2001, \n     pp. 14-16.\n       Thus, these coordination rules will wreak havoc on the \n     ability of the representatives of unions, corporations, non-\n     profits and even citizen groups to interact in important ways \n     with elected representatives for fear that the taint of \n     coordination will silence the voices of those groups in the \n     future. The First Amendment is designed to encourage and \n     foster such face-to-face discussions of government and \n     politics, see Buckley v. American Constitutional Law \n     Foundation, 525 U.S. 182 (1999), not to drive a wedge between \n     the people and their elected representatives .\n\nIII. S. 27 Allows the Unconstitutional Virtual Destruction of Political \n                                Parties\n\n       In addition to its disruptive and unconstitutional effect \n     on issue groups and issue advocacy, S. 27 also would have a \n     disruptive if not destructive effect on political parties in \n     America by totally shutting off the sources of funding that \n     support so much of what American political parties do. It \n     would cast a pall over the vital democratic work that \n     political parties perform. These unprecedented restrictions \n     on soft money would make parties less able to support \n     grassroots activity, candidate recruitment and get-out-the-\n     vote efforts.\n\n\n   A. The Bill Represents a Three-pronged Attack on Political Parties\n\n       (1) Section 101 of the bill completely eliminates all \n     ``soft money'' funding for all national political parties and \n     all of their constituent committees and component parts. \n     Under current law there are no federal restrictions on \n     raising, spending or routing such soft money by federal state \n     or local parties or their candidates or office holders. Under \n     McCain-Feingold, all of the funding for all of the vital \n     party activities described above would become illegal, unless \n     it came only from individuals, in small dollar amounts. In \n     other words, political parties may only raise and spend \n     highly regulated ``hard money'' for virtually everything they \n     do.\n       (2) Section 101 of the bill also bars any federal candidate \n     or officeholder from having any contact whatsoever with the \n     funding of any ``federal election activity'' by \n     any organization unless that activity is funded strictly \n     with hard money. The scope of ``federal election \n     activity'' is extremely broad and encompasses the \n     following activities if they have any connection to any \n     federal election or candidate: (1) voter registration \n     activity within 4 months of a federal election, (2) voter \n     identification, get-out-the-vote activity or ``generic \n     campaign activity,'' (3) any significant ``public \n     communication'' by broadcast, print or any other means \n     that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and \n     ``promotes,'' ``supports,'' ``attacks,'' or ``opposes'' a \n     candidate for office (regardless of whether the \n     communication contains ``express advocacy''). Under this \n     rule, a candidate would attend an NAACP Voters Rights \n     benefit dinner at his or her peril, if funds were being \n     raised for any ``federal election activity'' such as \n     getting people to the polls on election day. The same \n     might be true for one who attended an ACLU Bill of Rights \n     Day fund raiser, when the ACLU produces a box score on \n     civil liberties voting records during an election season.\n       (3) The bill also reaches and regulates all State and local \n     political parties and bans them from raising or spending soft \n     money for any ``Federal election activity'' also or any \n     activity which has any bearing on a federal election. It \n     basically federalizes all of the restrictions and limitations \n     of the FECA.\n\n\n    B. Political Party Activity is Protected by the First Amendment\n\n       Political funding by political parties is strongly \n     protected by the First Amendment no less than political \n     funding by candidates and committees. The only political \n     funding that can be subject to control is either \n     contributions given directly to candidates and their \n     campaigns (or partisan expenditures explicitly coordinated \n     with campaigns) or communications that constitute express \n     advocacy. These can be subject to source limitations (no \n     corporations or unions or comparable entities) or amount \n     restraints ($1,000, or $5,000 in the case of PACs). All other \n     funding of political activity and communication is beyond \n     presumptive constitutional control. That would include soft \n     money activities by political parties.\n       Parties are both advocates for their candidates' electoral \n     success and issue organizations that influence the public \n     debate. Get-out-the-vote drives, voter registration drives, \n     issue advocacy, policy discussion, grass-roots development \n     and the like are all activities fundamentally protected by \n     the First Amendment and engaged in by a wide variety of \n     individuals and organizations. An issue ad by the ACLU \n     criticizing an incumbent Mayor on police brutality is an \n     example of soft money activity, in the broadest sense of that \n     term, as is an editorial on the same subject in The New York \n     Times. We need more of all such activity during an election \n     season, not less, from political parties and others as well.\n       The right of individuals and organizations, corporate, \n     union or otherwise, to support such issue advocacy traces \n     back to the holding in Buckley that only those communications \n     that ``expressly advocate'' the election or defeat of \n     identified candidates can be subject to control. The Supreme \n     Court in the 1996 Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Committee v. FEC, 518 U.S. 604 (1996) case noted the varying \n     uses of soft money by political parties. In the recent case, \n     Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Governmental PAC, 528 U.S. 377 \n     (2000), which upheld hard money contribution limits, the \n     Court's opinion was silent on whether soft money could be \n     regulated at all. Although certain individual Justices \n     invited Congress to consider doing so, the case itself had \n     nothing to do with soft money.\n       To be sure, to the extent soft money funds issue advocacy \n     and political activities by political parties, it becomes \n     something of a hybrid: it supports protected and \n     unregulatable issue speech and activities, but by party \n     organizations often more closely tied to candidates and \n     officeholders. The organizational relationship between \n     political parties and public officials might allow greater \n     regulatory flexibility than would be true with respect to \n     issue advocacy by other organizations. Thus, for example, \n     disclosure of large soft money contributions to political \n     parties, as is currently required by regulation, might be \n     acceptable, even though it would be impermissible if imposed \n     on non-party issue organizations. But the total ban on soft \n     money contributions to political parties raises serious \n     constitutional difficulties.\n       Just last year, the Supreme Court reminded us once again of \n     the vital role that political parties play in our democratic \n     life, by serving as the primary vehicles for the political \n     views and voices of millions and millions of Americans. \n     ``Representative democracy in any populous unit of governance \n     is unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band \n     together in promoting the electoral candidates who espouse \n     their political views. The formation of national political \n     parties was almost concurrent with the formation of the \n     Republic itself.'' California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 \n     U.S. 567 2402, 2408 (2000). As Justice Anthony M. Kennedy put \n     it in his separate opinion in Colorado Republican Federal \n     Campaign Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 518 U.S. \n     604 (1996): ``The First Amendment embodies a profound \n     national commitment to the principle that debate on public \n     issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open. \n     Political parties have a unique role in serving this \n     principle; they exist to advance their members' shared \n     political beliefs.'' Id. at 629.\n       While electing candidates is a central mission of political \n     parties, they do so much more than that. They engage in issue \n     formulation and advocacy on a daily basis, they mobilize \n     their members through voter registration drives, they \n     organize get-out-the-vote efforts, they engage in generic \n     party communications to the public. Much of these activities \n     are supported by what S. 27 would deem as soft money. The \n     bill before you would dry up these significant sources of \n     funding for those party activities. It would basically starve \n     the parties' ability to engage in the grass roots and issue-\n     advocacy work that makes American political parties so vital \n     to American democracy.\n\n\n    C. S. 27 Diminishes the Ability of Political Parties to Compete \n      Equitably with Others Who Choose to Speak During Campaigns.\n\n       Finally, the law unfairly bans parties, but no other \n     organizations, from raising or spending soft money. That \n     would mean that anyone else--corporations, foundations, media \n     organizations, labor unions, bar associations, wealthy \n     individuals--could use any resources without limit to attack \n     a party and its programs, yet the party would be defenseless \n     to respond except by using limited hard money dollars. The \n     NRA could use unregulated funds to mount ferocious attacks on \n     the Democratic Party's stand on gun control, and the Party \n     would be effectively silenced and unable to respond. \n     Conversely, NARAL could mercilessly attack the Republican \n     Party's stand on abortion, using corporate and foundation \n     funds galore, and that\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n     Party would likewise be stifled from responding in kind. A \n     system which lets one side of a debate speak, while silencing \n     the other, violates both the First Amendment and equality \n     principles embodied in the Constitution.\n       The Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001 is not \n     reform at all, but is a fatally flawed assault on First \n     Amendment rights.\n       Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director.\n     Joel Gora,\n       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School and Counsel to the \n     ACLU.\n\n\n                             change of vote\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent to change my vote on rollcall vote \nNo. 41 from yea to nay. This change will not affect the outcome of the \nvote. The amendment at issue was adopted by a vote of 70-30 and if \nenacted will require broadcasters to charge political candidates the \nlowest rates offered by the broadcast, satellite or cable stations \nthroughout the year.\n  While I believe the goal of this amendment is laudable I am concerned \nthat it could unsettle the balance of support for the underlying \nlegislation. Further, I believe it could provide political candidates \nwith an unfair economic edge in the purchasing of air time.\n  On the first point, it should be clear to all that the McCain-\nFeingold legislation was carefully crafted to ensure meaningful \ncampaign finance reform while recognizing the rights of all Americans \nto continue their participation in our electoral process. This is a \ndelicate balance and I would regret to see this bill lose the support \nof such important participants in the political process as our nation's \nbroadcasters.\n  I believe that political candidates should not be gouged in their \npurchase of air time but I remain unconvinced that such is the normal \nand usual practice today. Other groups, be they charitable or civic \noriented, should not be disadvantaged because of efforts to lower the \nrates for political candidates. For the reasons stated above I believe \nthis issue should not be considered on this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    1996 Campaign Finance Violations\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in 1997, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee spent a year in investigating some of the worst campaign \nfinance abuses in our Nation's history. Despite a number of obstacles, \nwitnesses fleeing the country, people pleading the fifth amendment, \nentities failing to comply with subpoenas, our Committee uncovered \nnumerous activities that were not only improper but illegal. To date, \n26 individuals and two corporations have been prosecuted or indicted \nfor campaign finance violations arising from the 1996 Federal \nelections.\n  Specifically, what we uncovered was a pattern of abuse in which \naccess to people in power was bought with large campaign contributions. \nWhat made that possible was unregulated, unlimited soft money. Time \nafter time we heard about contributions of tens and hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in exchange for which access was granted. In fact, \none of the key reasons I have fought for the McCain-Feingold bill is to \neliminate this opportunity for abuse.\n  There is no question in my mind that the enormous soft money \ncontributions we examined led to corruption and the appearance of \ncorruption to the American public. The committee's findings are \ncontained in a six volume, 10,000 page report, S. Rpt. No. 105-167, the \ncommittee's depositions, S. Prt. No. 106-30, and the committee's \nhearings, S. Hrg. No. 105-300). The facts and findings contained in \nthese documents clearly provide the basis for a determination that \nunlimited soft money contributions lead to corruption and the \nappearance thereof.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee appropriately \nputs in context the work we are doing on the bill before us. The record \nin the Senate is replete with the compelling need for this legislation. \nIn particular, we learned during the 1997 hearings that some of the \nmost egregious conduct we uncovered, wasn't what was illegal, but what \nwas legal. That was the real problem.\n  The 1997 Senate investigation collected ample evidence of campaign \nabuses, the most significant of which revolved around the soft money \nloophole. Soft money contributions of hundreds of thousands, even \nmillions, of dollars, were shown to have undermined the contribution \nlimits in Federal law and created the appearance of corruption in the \npublic's eye. The Republican and Democratic national political parties \nthat solicit and spend this money use explicit offers of access to the \nmost powerful, elected officials.\n  Roger Tamraz, a large contributor to both parties and an unrepentant \nwitness at our hearings, became the bipartisan symbol for what is wrong \nwith the current system. Roger Tamraz served as a Republican Eagle in \nthe 1980s during Republican administrations and a Democratic Trustee in \nthe 1990s during Democratic administrations. Tamraz's political \ncontributions were not guided by his views on public policy or his \npersonal support for or against the person in office; Tamraz gave to \nhelp himself. He was unabashed in admitting his political contributions \nwere made for the purpose of getting access to people in power. Tamraz \nshowed us in stark terms to all-too-common product of the current \ncampaign finance system, using unlimited soft money contributions to \nbuy access. And despite the condemnation by the committee and the press \nof Tamraz's activities, when asked at the hearing to reflect on his \n$300,000 contribution to the Democrats in 1996, Tamraz said, ``I think \nnext time, I'll give $600,000.''\n  As I said, most of the appearances of impropriety revealed during the \n1997 investigations involved legal activities. Virtually every foreign \ncontribution of concern to the Committee involved soft money. Virtually \nevery offer of access to the White House or to the Capitol or to the \nPresident or to the Speaker of the House involved contributions of soft \nmoney. Virtually every instance of questionable conduct in the \nCommittee's investigation involved the solicitation or use of soft \nmoney.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill recognizes that the bulk of troubling \ncampaign activity is not what is illegal, but what is legal. It takes \ndirect aim at closing the loopholes that have swallowed the election \nlaws. In particular, it takes aim at closing the soft money and issue \nadvocacy loopholes, while strengthening other aspects of the Federal \nelection laws that are too weak to do the job as they now stand.\n  The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it. The \nissue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow it. \nCongress alone writes the laws. Congress alone can shut down the \nloopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election laws.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in recent days there has been much \nspeculation regarding my position on retaining the severability of the \ncampaign finance reform bill being considered by the Senate.\n  First let me start by reiterating my strong and unwavering commitment \nto meaningful campaign finance reform. Since I arrived in the Senate, \nI, along with many of my colleagues, have championed an overhaul of our \ncampaign finance system. Our system demands more disclosure and \naccountability, we should reduce the amount of money in the system, we \nshould ensure that the voice of every American can be heard, and we \nmust require fairness.\n  I admire Senator McCain and others for their courage and persistence \nin pursuing this goal. Senator McCain has shown himself to be a real \nleader, and I enjoy working with him in the Senate.\n  I believe the McCain/Feingold bill is a carefully crafted, balanced \nbill. There have been a number of amendments to this bill, some of \nwhich I have supported; some I've opposed. Campaign finance reform, in \naddition to reforming the excesses of the current system, must be fair \nand not favor any one party or group over another. If the court, at \nsome later date, finds that some part or parts of our reform effort do \nnot pass constitutional muster, that ruling should not be allowed to \ntip the scales to the benefit or detriment of one class of actors with \nregard to their ability to engage in political debate. As strongly as I \nbelieve in reforming our campaign finance laws, I also believe we \nshould do a better job of supporting our public schools, providing more \nand better access to quality\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nhealthcare, protecting our environment, and creating family wage jobs. \nIf my, or the people who share my positions, ability to communicate \nthose positions is altered to a greater or lesser extent than those \nwith other opinions, then what we have left will be fundamentally \nunfair. The balance of this bill could change depending on the court's \ninterpretation. The severability issue goes directly to this point.\n  Which leads me to why I believe this year's effort is different from \nprevious efforts in one very significant and fundamental way. Today, we \nknow more about the Supreme Court than we did just a few months ago. We \nknow that the court is not beyond interpretations that would appear to \nfavor one party over another. And that has given me pause, and, I would \nthink, it may give my colleagues pause, when we consider the \napplication of this law, how it will be tested in court, and what we \nmay end up with as a result.\n  If the Supreme Court decided to uphold limits on the amount of soft \nmoney flowing to our parties, while allowing special interest groups to \nspend unlimited sums to attack or defend candidates, then we will turn \nthe electoral process over to those same special interests who we seek \nto limit.\n  In this debate, too often, people who have differed with the sponsors \nhave been characterized as wanting to ``kill'' the bill. Contrary to \nthose assertions, this bill, with or without non-severability, is about \nto pass the Senate.\n  After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against the non-\nseverability amendment. I have made this judgement with strong \nreservations about how the Court could interpret the law we pass.\n  I am not willing to participate in enacting a precedent for \nseverability that could impact a wide range of bills to come before the \nSenate. Rather than adding a non-severability clause to this bill the \nCongress should act quickly to meet the challenges that may be \npresented by any future court action, and fashion a set of campaign \nfinance laws that will serve to strike a balance and ensure fairness.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reformers frequently assert that there \nis a great desire throughout the land for their campaign finance \nscheme. The truth is there is not, nor has there ever been, a \ngroundswell of public demand for even the concept of ``reform,'' let \nalone an unconstitutional assault by the Federal Government on the \nconstitutional freedom of citizens, groups and parties to participate \nin America's democracy.\n  On that note, I would ask that a March 22, 2001 article in the \nWashington Times entitled ``Nation Yawns at Campaign Finances,'' be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Mar. 22, 2001]\n\n                   Nation Yawns at Campaign Finances\n\n                           (By Donald Lambro)\n\n       Campaign finance reform may be the No. 1 issue in the \n     Senate right now, but outside of Washington it does not even \n     make the top-40 list of most important problems facing the \n     country.\n       Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, with the help of \n     favorable national news media coverage, has managed to drive \n     the issue to the top of the Senate agenda this week--ahead of \n     education, health care, Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts \n     and other issues that score much higher in poll after poll.\n       Polls show that Americans strongly support the overall \n     concept of campaign reform, but it does not appear on most \n     lists of what concerns them the most, or if it does, comes in \n     dead last.\n       ``We've asked people what is the most important problem \n     facing the country and watched campaign finance reform \n     languish at the bottom of every list of 20 to 25 issues,'' \n     said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Atlanta.\n       Compared to other issues, campaign finance long has been in \n     the basement of public priorities,'' the ABC News Web site \n     said in an analysis earlier this week.\n       ``Most people have more pressing concerns, and most doubt \n     reform would effectively curb the role of money in \n     politics,'' it concluded.\n       The Pew Research Center asked 1,513 adult Americans last \n     month what is ``the most important problem facing the country \n     today.'' Campaign finance reform did not specifically appear \n     among its list of 45 responses.\n       Morality/ethics/family values tops the list with \n     12 percent, followed by education (11 percent), the \n     economy and jobs (13 percent), crime (8 percent), health \n     care (6 percent), and energy costs (6 percent).\n       Other polls similarly place the issue at the bottom of the \n     issue rankings. An ABC News poll taken in January ranked it \n     16th out of 18 issues. It was last among 16 issues in the \n     general election.\n       Mr. McCain made campaign finance reform the centerpiece of \n     his unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential \n     nomination last year, but polls showed that most of those who \n     supported him in the primaries did so for other reasons--such \n     as his patriotism and character--not for his signature issue.\n       Only 9 percent of the voters in the New Hampshire primary \n     said the issue was their biggest concern. There was even less \n     concern on the Democratic side.\n       The issue all but disappeared in the general election. It \n     was seldom raised by Al Gore, and George W. Bush, who opposes \n     the McCain campaign finance reform bill, rarely mentioned the \n     issue unless asked about it.\n       Asked how campaign finance reform was playing in Georgia, \n     Mr. Ayres replied facetiously: ``It's a burning issue. It's a \n     topic that dominates every dinner table conversation. You \n     can't go into a supermarket check-out line without hearing \n     everyone talk about it.''\n       In fact, Mr. Ayres, ``It's an elite, media-driven, \n     editorial page issue that concerns'' very few people. \n     Virtually every poll seems to confirm that view.\n       When a Princeton Survey poll released earlier this month \n     asked 1,200 people what should be Mr. Bush's top priorities \n     this year, campaign finance reform barely registered at the \n     bottom of the list with a minuscule 3 percent.\n       What were the top concerns of most people? Education (29 \n     percent), the economy (20 percent), tax cuts (15 percent), \n     Medicare, (14 percent), and Social Security (13 percent). \n     Even foreign policy, at 4 percent, scored higher than \n     campaign reform.\n       ``People care more about how the taxpayers' money is being \n     spent than about how the politicians are raising money for \n     their campaigns,'' Mr. Ayres said.\n       The fact that the Senate is spending so much time on an \n     issue they rate very low, or not at all, ``just feeds the \n     suspicion that Congress spends a lot of time on issues that \n     people don't really care much about,'' he said.\n       ``It doesn't show up as a high priority issue, not because \n     people don't want reform, but because they don't believe that \n     they are ever going to get it,'' said independent pollster \n     John Zogby.\n       But for most Americans, Mr. Zogby conceded, ``it's just not \n     a passionate issue.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have authored a number of op-eds on \nthis subject over the years and I ask unanimous consent that the most \nrecent, appearing March 23, 2001, in USA Today, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Mar. 23, 2001]\n\n                       ``Reform'' Hurts Freedoms\n\n\n opposing view: bill unfairly restricts parties' ability to challenge \n                               incumbents\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       Next week, in its debate over changing campaign-finance \n     laws, the Senate will consider a constitutional amendment \n     overriding the First Amendment and thereby allowing the \n     government to restrict all spending on communications ``by, \n     in support of, or in opposition to'' candidates for public \n     office.\n       So empowered, Congress could ban ``soft money'' and even \n     make it illegal for corporate-owned newspapers to endorse or \n     mention political candidates within 60 days of an election. \n     Currently, the media is specifically exempted from federal \n     campaign-finance law, even though these corporate \n     conglomerates exert tremendous influence on the political \n     system. You could call this exemption the media's \n     ``loophole.''\n       The McCain-Feingold bill less forthrightly but just as \n     effectively restricts the constitutional freedom of citizens \n     groups and parties to speak out on issues, and elections. \n     McCain-Feingold makes it illegal for citizen groups to \n     criticize members of Congress in TV or radio ads, unless they \n     register with the federal government and conform to a litany \n     of restrictions. Such restrictions on political speech are \n     sure to be declared unconstitutional, as have 22 similar \n     efforts previously struck down in federal court.\n       McCain-Feingold also attack the national parties, making it \n     illegal for them to pay for issue advocacy, voter turnout and \n     such mundane overhead expenses as utilities, accountants, \n     computers and lawyers (necessary to comply with existing \n     complex campaign-finance laws) with funds outside the current \n     strict ``hard money'' limits. Hard money refers to funds that \n     can be given directly to candidates and is subject to severe \n     contribution limits (limits not adjusted for inflation since \n     they were created in 1974).\n       McCain-Feingold would starve the parties. Few are moved by \n     the parties' plight until they consider that candidates \n     running against incumbent congressmen have only one reliable \n     source of support: parties.\n       Without party soft money, liberal news media and ``special \n     interest'' groups would move closer to total domination of \n     the American political environment. If banned, party soft \n     money (which already is publicly disclosed and therefore \n     accountable) will\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\n     give way to the shadowy world of special-interest soft money, \n     where there is no public disclosure and no accountability. \n     That does not meet anyone's definition of ``reform.''\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Sessions would like to speak on the bill at \nthe conclusion of the session. Perhaps he could wrap it up for us \ntonight. We will see everyone at 9 o'clock in the morning. At the \nconclusion of his remarks, unless floor staff has an objection, he will \nput us in recess.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as we consider this legislation, I am \nnot sure it is possible for any of us, I certainly have not, figured \nout who might be the winner and loser in this legislation. Who would \nget the most benefits, which party, which candidates, those things are \ninteresting and, in fact, significant. I am just not terribly worried \nmyself.\n  I think about my campaigns and if they limit all contributions to \njust $100 per person and nobody else could contribute, nobody else \ncould run a negative ad or positive ad about me, I would feel \ncomfortable about that. I believe I can raise more $100's than any \nlikely opponent I am facing. I could get my message out and it will be \na good competitive race and that will be fine.\n  I wish it could be that simple sometimes. I faced two opponents who \nspent more than $1 million against me in the Republican primary. I know \nwhat it feels like to be frustrated by ads coming in against you.\n  I think this legislation transcends all the complexities and all the \ndebate we have had tonight and over the last 2 weeks about soft money, \nhard money, issue ads, independent groups, independent expenditures, \nand all of that. It is a very complicated matter. I think that has \ncaused us at some point to lose our contact with the fundamental \nquestions with which we are dealing.\n  In my view, I have concluded, unfortunately, that on what is \nconstitutional and what is good public policy, this legislation does \nnot justify our support and should not be passed by this body.\n  America has always been a country of raucous debate, uncontrolled, \nexaggeration, negativity, at times emotional. That is the way we are. \nSometimes I wish it were not so. Others complained on the floor of the \nSenate about negative ads against them. I had those run against me \nalso. In my election, I raised a lot more hard money than my opponent, \nbut he had equal time on television and it was mostly soft money. They \ncame in from the Democratic Party or the Sierra Club and they ran ads \nagainst me. I know it wasn't a little environmentalist raising this \nmoney. It was money given to them so they could use it in certain \ncampaigns in favor of Democratic candidates. That is the way life is. \nIt is frustrating at times to see ads such as that pound on you.\n\n  Soft money didn't help me in this past campaign. I say that to say I \nresent and reject the assertion that those of us who are concerned \nabout the serious public policy and constitutional questions involved \nare somehow advocating that because we have a self-interest in it, some \npersonal agenda that will help them beat their opponent and get \nreelected. There may be a tendency for some, but it is not for me.\n  The problem is whether or not we are furthering or constraining \npolitical debate in America. Some believe, for example, that depictions \nof violent sex acts of all kinds, depictions of child pornography, are \nprotected by the first amendment. Some believe that the act of burning \na flag of the United States is free speech. Some of these same people, \nhowever, see things differently on this bill.\n  On the question of pornography and child pornography, and those \nquestions, people can go either way. The Supreme Court has sort of \nsplit in a lot of different ways. These forms of speech and press are \nquasi-speech. Depictions or acts of burning a flag were never what our \nFounding Fathers were fundamentally concerned about. They were \nconcerned in early America about political speech, the right to speak \nout on public policy issues and say what you wanted to say.\n  James Madison, the father of our Constitution, whose birth we \ncelebrated earlier in the month, the 250th anniversary of his birth, in \ntalking about our goal in America as to free elections and people you \nchose could be elected, said: The value and efficacy of this right to \nelect and vote for people for office depends on the knowledge of \ncomparative merits and demerits of the candidates for public trust, and \non the equal freedom, consequently, of examining and discussing these \nmerits and demerits of the candidate's respectively.\n  That suggests this is what America was founded about, to have a full \ndebate about candidates and their position on issues. When do you do \nthat? You do that during the election time. Not 2 years before an \nelection.\n\n  I believe the contributing of money to promote and broadcast or \namplify speech is covered by the first amendment. I do not think that \nis a matter of serious debate. Some have suggested otherwise. They said \nmoney is just an inanimate object. But if you want to be able to speak \nout and you cannot get on television, or you cannot get on radio, or \nyou cannot afford to publish newspapers or pamphlets, then you are \nconstrained in your ability to speak out.\n  The Supreme Court dealt with this issue quite plainly in Buckley v. \nValeo in 1976. A string of cases since that time have continued that \nview.\n  In Buckley they said the following:\n\n       The first amendment denies government [that is, us] the \n     power to determine that spending to promote one's political \n     views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       In a free society, ordained by our Constitution, it is not \n     the government, not the government but the people \n     individually as citizens and collectively as associations and \n     political committees who must retain control over the \n     quantity and range of debate on public issues in a public \n     campaign.\n\n  What is that Court saying? That Court is saying the right to decide \nwho says what in a political environment is the right of the people and \nassociations of people. They have that right. The Government does not \nhave the right to restrain them and restrict that and to limit their \ndebate, even if it is aimed at us in the form of a negative ad and it \nhurts our feelings and we wish it had not happened. We do not have the \nright to tell people they cannot produce honest ads, hard-hitting ads \nagainst us. If we ever get to that point, I submit, our country will be \nless free, you will have less ability to deal with incumbent \npoliticians who may not be the kind that are best for America.\n  In the Buckley case the Court held that political contributions \nconstitute protected speech under the first amendment.\n  I remain at this point almost stunned that earlier in this debate 40 \nMembers of this Senate voted to amend the first amendment of the \nConstitution of the United States. Fortunately, 60 voted no. We had 38 \nvote yea in 1997 or 1998, and last year it dropped down to 33. But this \nyear 40 voted for this amendment. It would have empowered Congress and \nState legislators, government, to put limits on contributions and \nexpenditures by candidates and groups in support of and in opposition \nto candidates for office. Just as they outlined in Buckley.\n  That is a thunderous power we were saying here, that we were going to \nempower State legislatures and the U.S. Congress to put limits on how \nmuch a person and group could expend in support of or in opposition to \na candidate. Think about that. Where are our civil libertarian groups?\n  I have to give the ACLU credit, they have been consistent on this \nissue. They have studied it. They know this is bad, and they have said \nso. But too many of our other groups--I don't know whether they are \nworried about the politics of it or what, but they have not grasped the \ndanger to free speech and full debate we are having here.\n  It seems to me we are almost losing perspective and respect for the \nfirst amendment that protects us all. In this debate we have focused on \nwhat the courts have held with regard to the first amendment and to \ncampaign finance. I remain confident that significant portions of the \nlegislation as it is now pending before us will be struck down by \nFederal courts.\n\n  We ought not to vote for something that is unconstitutional. We swore \nto uphold the Constitution. If we believe a bill is unconstitutional, \nwe should not be passing it on the expectation that someday a court may \nstrike it down, even if we like the goal. If it violates the \nConstitution, each of us has a duty, I believe, to vote no. The idea \nthat we\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\ncan pass a law that would say that within 60 days of an election a \ngroup of union people, a group of businesspeople, a group of citizens, \ncannot get together and run an ad to say that Jeff Sessions is a no-\ngood skunk and ought not be elected to office, offends me. Why doesn't \nthat go to the heart of freedom in America? Where is our free speech \ncrowd? Where are our law professors and so forth on this issue? It is \nvery troubling to me, and I believe it goes against our fundamental \nAmerican principles.\n  I will conclude. I make my brief remarks for the record tonight to \nsay I believe this law is, on balance, not good. I believe its stated \ngoal of dealing with corruption in campaigns is not going to be \nachieved. I believe it is the case with every politician I know, that \nvotes trump money every time anyway. If you have a group of people in \nyour State you know and respect, you try to help them. Just because \nthey may give you a contribution doesn't mean that is going to be the \nthing that helps you the most. Most public servants whom I know try to \nserve the people of the State and try to keep the people happy and do \nthe right things that are best for the future.\n  I believe this bill is not good, that the elimination of the corrupt \naspects we are trying to deal with will not ultimately be achieved. At \nthe same time, I believe we will have taken a historic step backwards, \nperhaps the most significant retrenchment of free speech and the right \nto assemble, and free press, that has occurred in my lifetime that I \ncan recall. This is a major bit of legislation that undermines our free \nspeech.\n  I know we have talked about all the details and all the little \nthings. There are some things in this bill I like. I wish we could make \nthem law. But as a whole, we ought not pass a piece of legislation that \nwould restrict a group of people in America from coming together to \nraise money and speak out during an election cycle, 60 days, 90 days, \n10 days, 5 days, on election day--they ought not be restricted in that \neffort. In doing so, we would have betrayed and undermined our \ncommitment to free speech and free debate that has made this country so \ngreat.\n  Mr. President, I will proceed to see if I can close us out for the \nnight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3141-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague, Senator \nAllen. We would like to address the Senate for a period not to exceed \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, today, just hours ago, Senator Allen and I were \ninformed of the loss of one of our Members of Congress from the State \nof Virginia, Norman Sisisky. It has been my privilege to have served \nwith him in Congress throughout his career. Our particular \nresponsibilities related to the men and women of the Armed Forces--I \nserving on the Senate Committee on Armed Forces and he on the House \nNational Security Committee.\n  Our Nation has lost a great patriot in this wonderful man who started \nhis public service career in 1945 as a young sailor in the U.S. Navy. \nIn total, he served some 30 years, including his Naval service, service \nin the Virginia General Assembly, and in the service of the Congress of \nthe United States.\n  The men and women of the Armed Forces owe this patriot a great deal, \nfor he carried forth his earliest training in the Navy until the last \nbreath he drew this morning. They were always, next to his family, \nforemost in his mind.\n  Throughout his legislative career in the Congress, many pieces of \nlegislation bear his imprint and his wisdom on behalf of the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, it is a great loss to the Commonwealth of Virginia, \nthis distinguished public servant. It is a great loss to me of a \nbeloved friend, a dear friend. My heart and my prayers go to his \nwidow--a marriage of some 50 years--and to his family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just thank my two colleagues for \nbringing this information to the Senate. I came into the House of \nRepresentatives with Norman Sisisky. What a terrific person he was to \nwork with. He had a wonderful sense of humor, was very dedicated, as my \nfriend pointed out, to his country. He was very patriotic, and he was a \nreal fighter for his district.\n  I want to associate myself with the eloquent words of Senator Warner \nand Senator Allen.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I echo the words of the senior Senator from \nVirginia, John Warner. Norman Sisisky was a man who was loved all \nacross Virginia. As the Senator said, he started his career in the \nDepression and served in the armed services. He also was a very \nsuccessful businessman in the private sector. While he was a strong \nadvocate for the armed services and the strength of our Nation, he also \nbrought forth commonsense business principles of logistics and \nefficiency, whether it was in the days he was in the general assembly \nor in his many years of service in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  He clearly was one of the leaders to whom people on both sides of the \naisle would look. When there was a need for getting good, bipartisan \nsupport, obviously, folks would go to Senator Warner. On the Democrat \nside, they looked to Norm Sisisky. Norm Sisisky cared a great deal, as \nSenator Warner said, about the men and women who wear the uniform. He \nwanted to make sure they had the most advanced equipment, the most \ntechnologically advanced armaments for their safety when protecting our \ninterests and freedoms abroad.\n  He was a true hero to many Virginians, not just in his district but \nall across the Commonwealth of Virginia, always bridging the partisan \ndivides, trying to figure out what is the best thing for the people of \nAmerica and also freedom-loving people around the world.\n  I will always remember Norm Sisisky as a person. I will always \nremember that smiling face, and he had that deep voice and that deep \nlaugh, hardy laugh.\n  He was one who was always exuberant, always passionate, no matter \nwhat the effort, what the cause. You could be standing on the corner \nwaiting for the light to change, and Norm would be carrying on with \ngreat passion and vigor about whatever the issue was. He would thrive \non figuring out: Here is the way we will maneuver through the \nbureaucracy to get this idea done.\n  He truly was a wonderful individual. Everyone here speaks of him as a \nfellow Member of the House of Representatives.\n  When I was Governor, this man went beyond the call of duty. We were \ntrying to get the department of military affairs to move from Richmond \nto Fort Pickett to transform that base which had been closed.\n  Norm Sisisky spent weekends talking with members on the other side of \nthe aisle in the Virginia General Assembly, beyond the call of duty, to \nmake sure we could move the headquarters to Fort Pickett and that the \nenvironmental aspects were cleaned up at no expense to the taxpayers, \nkeep the facility open, and transform it to commercial use to benefit \nthe entire Blackstone community.\n  The people in Southside Virginia will be forever grateful for what \nNorm Sisisky  did in making sure Fort Pickett is there as a military \nfacility for guard units in the Army, as well as private enterprise \nefforts and helping protect the jobs and people of that community.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I will yield shortly.\n  Congressman Norm Sisisky was a great Virginian. He was a great \nAmerican. I know our thoughts and prayers are there for his wife Rhoda. \nI know at least two of his sons very well, Mark and Terry, as well as \nRichard and Stuart.\n  Our prayers and thoughts go out to them. We tell them: Please realize \nNorm still lives on in you, in your blood, and also his spirit.\n  We also share our grief with his very dedicated and loyal staff who \nshared his passion for the people of Virginia and the people of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may add to what my distinguished \ncolleague said, we shall work together to\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nsee whether or not an appropriate portion of Fort Pickett--he just \nloved that base--can appropriately bear his name. It would mean a great \ndeal to the men and women of the armed forces. We will do that.\n  Mr. ALLEN. That is a great idea.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as with Senator Boxer, I came to the House \nof Representatives in 1982. One of the freshman House Members was Norm \nSisisky. Like Senator Allen, I can see that smile. He had an infectious \nsmile. He was a friend. I enjoyed my service with that class of 1982. \nPart of my memories will always be Norm Sisisky. \n  I join in the comments made by my friends from Virginia and the \nSenator from California in recognizing a great public servant in Norm \nSisisky. \n  Mr. WARNER. We thank our colleague for his remarks.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to the Senators, oh, the \ngossamer thread of life cut short so quickly for such a great servant \nof the State of Virginia and of the United States of America with whom \nI had the privilege of serving in the House. He never met a man he did \nnot like, and he was passionate about Government service. I thank my \ncolleagues for calling this sad news to our attention and for the \nopportunity to respond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, briefly, I do not claim a close \nrelationship with Norm Sisisky, but I have had the great privilege of \nserving on the Armed Services Committee with Senator Warner for the \nlast 18 years, and I can remember every year when we would go into \nconference with the House of Representatives, Norm would be there. He \nwould be championing the positions he felt strongly about and that were \nimportant to the people of Virginia. I also mourn his loss and \nrecognize the important loss it is to Virginia and to this Congress.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3142-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO PUNCH GREEN\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the great Oliver Wendell Holmes \nonce said, ``To live fully is to be engaged in the passions of one's \ntime.'' Few Oregonians--and few Americans--have lived a life as full as \nAlan ``Punch'' Green's. Alan Green was known to us who loved him as \n``Punch.'' I say that few have lived a life as full as Punch's because \nfew have made such a positive difference in the passions of our time.\n  Punch passed away last Friday at the age of 75. And as his many \nfriends--myself included--struggle to get used to the fact that we can \nno longer call Punch for his straightforward advice, I would like to \npay tribute here on the Senate floor to this remarkable Oregonian.\n  Punch was a member of what has been termed ``The Greatest \nGeneration.'' Like so many others of that generation, Punch willingly \nrisked his life for our country, as he served with distinction in the \nPacific theater during World War II. And when he returned to Oregon \nfollowing the war, Punch dedicated much of his life to making Oregon \nand America a better place in which to live, work, and raise a family.\n  He founded and ran a number of businesses, where he earned a \nreputation as a caring and fair manager. He became active in the \nRepublican Party, serving as chair of campaigns for Presidents Ford, \nReagan, and Bush, and serving as a trusted mentor to countless other \ncandidates, myself included. Indeed, when I began my campaign for the \nSenate, one of the first people I sought out for advice and support was \nPunch Green, and I could not have asked for a more loyal friend.\n  Punch loved his home city, the city of Portland, OR, and he \nunderstood the importance of ensuring that Portland remained true to \nits name. As a commissioner and as President of the Port of Portland, \nPunch skillfully guided the port through an era of major growth and \nexpansion. Punch's leadership on these issues came to the attention of \nPresident Reagan, who chose Punch to serve as chair of the Federal \nMaritime Commission, a post he filled with great skill for 4 years.\n  Punch was nearing what many consider ``retirement age'' in the 1980s, \nand he certainly had earned the right to take it easy and spend time \nwith his family. But Punch was always willing to answer the call of his \ncountry, and former President Bush was calling. In 1989, Punch packed \nhis bags and accepted President Bush's request to serve as United \nStates Ambassador to Romania.\n  Punch arrived at the embassy in Bucharest just 2 weeks before the \nfall of the Ceausescu dictatorship. As tensions mounted in that country \nand explosions could be heard in the distance, Punch evacuated women \nand children from the embassy, and slept on his office couch for 10 \ndays. Punch would later tell me that one of the highlights of his life \nwas waving an American flag from the embassy window to the thunderous \napplause and cheers of thousands of Romanian citizens who were \ncelebrating the end of Ceausescu's bloody reign. Punch's leadership in \nRomania at this critical time was recognized in 1992, when he received \nthe State Department's Distinguished Honor Award.\n  When his assignment in Romania came to its conclusion, Punch returned \nto Portland, where he continued to provide his inimitable leadership to \na variety of worthy causes. One which was especially close to his heart \nwas that of the Oregon Humane Society, which now has a beautiful new \nfacility in Portland, thanks, in no small part, to Punch's vision and \ngenerosity.\n  My thoughts today are with Punch's wife, Joan, his three daughters, \nand eight grandchildren. The Greek poet Sophocles once wrote that ``One \nmust wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.'' \nAlthough Punch left us much too early, it is my prayer that those who \nloved him will take solace in the fact that as he neared the evening of \nhis time here on Earth, Punch could look back at a life rich with \nfamily, rich with friends, and rich with making a difference in the \npassions of our time, and he could say that the day has indeed been \nsplendid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3142-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3142-S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH--RECOGNIZING PROMINENT WOMEN OF ARKANSAS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as we celebrate the remaining days of \nNational Women's History Month, I want to call attention to several \nextraordinary women from my home state of Arkansas who have devoted \ntheir lives to improving our communities and lending a hand to those in \nneed.\n  But before I talk about them individually, I first want to say a few \nwords about a woman who is special not only to many generations of \nArkansans but to the members of this body. That woman is Hattie \nCaraway.\n  In 1932, Hattie Caraway of Arkansas became the first woman ever \nelected to the United States Senate after winning a special election to \nfill the remaining months of her husband's term. Arkansans elected \nHattie Caraway to the Senate two more times, and she served in the U.S. \nSenate until January, 1945.\n  Senator Caraway became the first woman to chair a Senate Committee \nand the first woman to take up the gavel on the Senate floor as the \nSenate's presiding officer. And when she finished her term, her Senate \ncolleagues honored her for her service with a standing ovation on the \nSenate floor. Quite a feat for a woman back in 1945 especially since \nwomen had just won the right to vote only 25 years earlier!\n  There is no doubt that Hattie Caraway's service in the Senate paved \nthe way for women seeking elective office. Thirty-one women have \nfollowed Hattie Caraway to the Senate, and today, a record high of 13 \nwomen are serving in the Senate at the same time. Combined with the 59 \nwomen in the U.S. House of Representatives, a record total of 72 women \nserve in the U.S. Congress today.\n  Another woman who is paving the way for women in politics in Arkansas \nis County Judge LaVerne Grayson. Judge Grayson last November became the \nfirst female county judge to serve Boone County, Arkansas.\n  Before attaining her judgeship, Judge Grayson was a nurse and Public \nHealth Investigator Supervisor at the Arkansas Department of Health who \nhelped\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\nestablish one of the first AIDS programs in northwest Arkansas. She was \nalso an active community leader, serving with the American Red Cross, \nthe LPN Advisory Board, the Salvation Army, and the North Arkansas \nCollege Board of Trustees. Judge Grayson is revered for her talents and \nher ability to balance her time effectively between a busy career and \nfamily, something which all working mothers aspire to do.\n  Other female leaders in Arkansas government have taken their talents \nto universities. Dr. Jane Gates of Jonesboro, who was a member \nJonesboro Civil Service Commission, is now a Professor at Arkansas \nState University. Through her classes on public policy and government, \nDr. Gates draws on her experience in government to encourage young \nwomen and men to seek public office.\n  That brings me to another woman who is making a difference in \neducation. Dr. Trudie Reed, who is the President of Philander Smith \nCollege in Little Rock, has effectively promoted the contributions of \nAfrican-Americans and has spearheaded a successful capital campaign \ndrive to increase the college's endowment. Under Dr. Reed's leadership, \nthe historically-black college has grown to be one of the best \neducational institutions in Central Arkansas. Over the past year, the \ncollege has received over $18 million dollars from various foundations \nand donors. With the money, the college will build a new library and a \nnew science building.\n  Other women I want to mention today have made great contributions to \ntheir communities. Spurred by the tremendous love and joy she has \nexperienced from adopting two children from Korea and Thailand, Connie \nFails of Little Rock has reached out to many families throughout \nArkansas and across the nation to help them adopt a child \ninternationally.\n  In addition to running a successful clothing boutique in Little Rock, \nConnie works in her spare time as an international adoption escort, \ntraveling to foreign countries and escorting adoptive children to new \nhomes all across the United States. She has also served as the private \nsector representative to the White House for the Hague Convention. \nConnie has helped many children, particularly disabled children from \ndisadvantaged countries, find safe, permanent, and loving homes.\n  Another woman who has reached out to help her community is Donna \nHolmes of El Dorado. For the past two years, Donna has been the \nChairman of Interfaith Help Services, which is a seven-member church \ncollaborative effort that provides financial assistance to \nunderprivileged residents in the form of medical assistance, dental \nassistance, monthly expense assistance, and a food pantry.\n  I recently nominated Donna for the Mitsubishi Motors Unsung Heroine \nAward, which honors women who have gone beyond the call of duty to \nserve those in need. Mitsubishi has donated $5,000 to Interfaith Help \nServices, and PBS will produce a documentary about Donna this spring. I \nam so proud and grateful for Donna's incredible efforts. Under her \nleadership, Interfaith Help Services has helped over 6,900 single \nparents, children, and families since 1991.\n  As we recognize the great accomplishments women have made over the \ncenturies, it is with great respect and admiration that I pay personal \ntribute to the women of Arkansas today. Their achievements in the areas \nof government, education, and community service have made them \noutstanding local role models for young women and girls who aspire to \nmake positive differences in their communities.\n  As the youngest woman to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, I share their \ndesire to make our nation a better place for our children. I am humbled \nby and thankful for their work and am glad to have the opportunity to \nrecognize them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3143-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BILL RADIGAN OF VERMILLION, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened today to learn of \nthe passing of a dedicated public servant and a dear friend to South \nDakota and to me. Bill Radigan spent his entire life serving those \naround him, and he will certainly be missed.\n  As a young man, Bill joined the Army Air Corps, so that he could \nserve his country during World War II. After the war, he returned to \nhis hometown of Vermillion, SD to continue what would become a lifelong \ncommitment to public service. He served Clay County with the U.S. \nPostal Service for 35 years and coordinated Vermillion's school bus \nsystem. Thousands across the State benefitted from Bill's work with the \nAmerican Legion and the VFW, where he served as secretary of the South \nDakota Teener Baseball program for more than 30 years, and as State \nQuartermaster/Adjunct for nearly 50 years. For 55 years he was a member \nof the Vermillion Volunteer Fire Department, where he served as \nsecretary-treasurer. Bill was a dedicated husband to his wife Susie, \nthe loving father of 11, and a grandfather to many.\n  In 1988, Bill ran for, and was elected to, the Vermillion City \nCouncil. Six years later he was elected mayor. Vermillion has been well \nserved by its mayor, and, under his leadership, the city has embarked \non a number of exciting projects that will sustain the community's \nprosperity well into the future.\n  Bill Radigan's list of accomplishments is certainly impressive. But \nthose activities only began to scratch the surface of who Bill was and \nwhy he will be missed. Bill didn't engage in public service because he \nwanted to add to a list of accomplishments. He simply saw something \nthat needed to be done, and he stepped forward to answer the call. From \nserving in the military, to agreeing to help drive busloads of children \nto school, no job was too daunting, or too insignificant, for Bill \nRadigan.\n  As a mayor, Bill was universally recognized as someone who was fair, \nwho truly valued citizen involvement in the governing process, and who \ncared deeply about his community. From the business community to \ncollege students, Bill Radigan truly valued every Vermillion citizen's \nthoughts on the issues confronting the city. I have never heard of \nanyone who thought they were treated unfairly by Bill Radigan, and even \nthose with whom he disagreed found him sincere and honest. Bill Radigan \nwas effective because he based every decision he made as mayor on what \nhe thought was best for the community. We could all learn a lot from \nBill Radigan's commitment to his community and his approach to \ngovernment.\n  I wish to express my sincere condolences to Bill Radigan's family and \nto the people of Vermillion. Mayor Radigan was a dedicated father, a \nmodel public servant, and a wonderful person. We will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3143-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3143-S3144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, earlier this week, a Today Show reporter \ninterviewed Mr. Bob Stuber, a former police officer from California, \nwho maintains a website called Escapeschool.com. Mr. Stuber's website \ngives advice to students who may one day find themselves caught in the \ncrossfire of a shooting at school. The former police officer offers \npractical information in this day and age, such as what gunfire sounds \nlike, what to do when a student hears gunfire, and what a student \nshould look for in a hiding place.\n  It is simply heart breaking that this type of advice is even \nnecessary. Yet, students in school are increasingly worried for their \nsafety. Escapeschool.com is a valuable resource because in addition to \ngiving advice to students, it also gives advice to schools and \ncommunities to try to prevent such shootings, and information for \nparents who want to communicate with their children about these events.\n  I encourage students and parents to look at this website and talk to \neach other about some of the dangers associated with guns. I also \nencourage my colleagues to look at the website with the hope that we in \nCongress can restart a dialogue about how to limit youth access to guns \nand reduce such shootings in American schools.\n  I ask consent to print in the Record excerpts from the transcript of \nthe interview with Mr. Bob Stuber.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Bob Stuber Discusses His Escapeschool.com Program to Teach Children \n                  What To Do During a School Shooting\n\n  (Soledad O'Brien, co-host)\n       O'Brien. You give very specific advice. I want to get into \n     some of it. If there is a shooting at a school, what should a \n     student do?\n       Mr. Stuber. One of the very first things a student needs to \n     know is that it's very hard to tell the difference between \n     firecrackers and gunfire. Lots of times when you hear about \n     these reports, you hear people say, `I thought it was \n     firecrackers. I went to see, and then I saw a shooter.' If \n     you hear a sound, and you're not sure what it is, assume it \n     could be gunfire and begin to take that defensive posture. It \n     doesn't mean you have to jump under a table, just start \n     thinking that way. That's the very first thing they need to \n     know.\n       O'Brien. If it becomes clear that it is gunfire, should a \n     student run?\n       Mr. Stuber. Absolutely! There are certain policies in place \n     in some of the schools where under the best case scenario, \n     they want them to go to a certain room and hide, and if you \n     can do that, that's fine. But most of the time, you can't. \n     Then we start talking about running. You want to keep this \n     thing logical. Kids need to know how to run. For instance. . \n     .\n       O'Brien. Where to run.\n       Mr. Stuber. Right. Where you--you don't want to run in a \n     straight line. You want to either run in a zigzag fashion or \n     you want to turn a corner because bullets don't turn corners. \n     If you're going to hide and you pick a car, you want to hide \n     at the front of the car where the engine block is, because \n     that can stop a bullet. The middle of the car, the back of \n     the car can't. Those little tips, and they're not \n     frightening, those little tips are the things that make a \n     difference.\n       O'Brien. Do you think a student should hide in a--in a \n     shooting?\n       Mr. Stuber. Yeah, absolutely. What we think students should \n     do first of all is--is, know the difference between cover and \n     concealment. What they want to find is cover. For instance, a \n     big tree with a giant trunk, that's cover. That will hide you \n     and protect you. A hedge is concealment. It will hide you, \n     but it won't protect you. Students have to find a place to \n     hide where they can be safe. So the very first thing you \n     begin to teach them, what to look for in a hiding spot.\n       O'Brien. If students are inside the classroom, is the best \n     advice to stay inside the classroom? Or is the best advice to \n     leave that classroom as soon as possible?\n       Mr. Stuber. It really--it really depends. There is no \n     absolutes. If you can stay in that classroom, the teacher can \n     lock the door. You can line up against the--the opposite \n     wall, and--and you're going to be safe, that's fine. But if \n     this action is coming down the hall, and it's coming to your \n     classroom, you have to get out of there. So then you have to \n     know, how should I get out? Should I go down the hall or \n     should I go to the window, try to escape through the window? \n     You know, we work with kids all the time. We--we set \n     scenarios up. In one case I remember, we had kids go to the \n     window to make an exit and because the windows wouldn't open, \n     they naturally said, `Well, we have to go down the hall.' \n     They didn't think they could break the window and make an \n     exit. You have to tell them that.\n       O'Brien. In one recent school shooting, there was an armed \n     officer inside the school which managed to bring the shooting \n     to a close pretty quickly.\n       Mr. Stuber. Right.\n       O'Brien. Do you think then that that's an indication that \n     that's the way to go? Schools should have armed officers in \n     the hallways?\n       Mr. Stuber. Well, you know, in the last two shootings, it \n     kind of helped out, but there is no strong evidence that says \n     it's a preventive tool. It was good that they were there. I'm \n     not so sure schools have to go in that direction. There's so \n     little data right now, you can't make a conclusive \n     observation. So right now what we're trying to center on is \n     the techniques that the students themselves can practice \n     while all the data is being collected to make definitive \n     prevention prognosis.\n       O'Brien. It seems critical that students report any threats \n     that they hear. And yet time and time again, we hear that \n     they don't. Oh, there were threats. They didn't think it was \n     important.\n       Mr. Stuber. Right.\n       O'Brien. They didn't believe them. How do you make the \n     threats actually get to the notice of the teachers?\n       Mr. Stuber. That is a big deal. You know, in almost every \n     one of these shootings there has been threats, rumors or \n     jokes. And some students haven't reported them. One of the \n     reasons some students give is that there was no system for \n     reporting anonymously. Schools have to provide a system where \n     the student can report anonymously. It--because if the person \n     finds out that you're the one that reported him, you're--you \n     may end up getting in more trouble. So students are reluctant \n     to report. They're also thinking, `Well, I'm going to get my \n     friend in trouble.' Look, it's like being at the airport. No \n     jokes allowed in this area. Parents and schools have to tell \n     them, report. Even a joke, you have to report.\n       O'Brien. Some good advice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3144-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3144-S3146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RADIATION EXPOSURE COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to imagine the \nfollowing nightmare:\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\n  You have spent years in the uranium mines helping to build America's \nnuclear programs. As a result, you have contracted a debilitating and \ntoo often deadly radiation-related disease that has caused severe \nemotional and physical suffering. Most of life's joys have long since \nended.\n  Your only solace is that the government is going to pay you for this \nsuffering. Certainly, the money will never be enough to compensate you \nfor what you've lost, but at least your medical bills will be paid. At \nleast, if you lose this fight your family will be left with money.\n  However, when you open the Justice Department letter that you have \nlong awaited, it reads:\n\n       I am pleased to inform you that your claim for compensation \n     under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act has been \n     approved. Regretfully, because the money available to pay \n     claims has been exhausted, we are unable to send a \n     compensation payment to you at this time. When Congress \n     provides additional funds, we will contact you to commence \n     the payment process. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n  Unfortunately, my fellow Senators, this is not a bad dream, but \nrather the terrible reality for hundreds of uranium miners, federal \nworkers, and downwinders who have contracted these deadly radiation-\nrelated diseases. One such individual is Bob Key.\n  Bob Key helped build our nation's nuclear arsenal and end the Cold \nWar through his difficult work as a uranium miner. Little did he know \nat the time that the uranium was slowly ravaging his body. As a result, \nMr. Key has spent many years enduring the grueling pain associated with \npulmonary fibrosis, which requires him to be hooked to an oxygen tank \nfor hours on end. Recently, Mr. Key, 61, needed a tracheotomy simply to \nhelp him breathe.\n  Yet, despite his enormous suffering, Mr. Key has not received the \n$100,000 compensation from the government for which he is entitled \nunder the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990. Instead, he \nreceived a five-line IOU from the Justice Department stating that there \nwas not enough money to indemnify him for his suffering. This is a \ndisgrace.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Key's horror story is a familiar one for many \nuranium miners, federal workers, and downwinders from New Mexico, \nColorado, Arizona, and Utah. In some cases,the miners have died and \ntheir loved ones are left holding nothing but a Justice Department IOU. \nIn 1990, when we passed the Domenici-authored Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act, we never envisioned that these miners would receive \nIOUs. However, the fund is now bankrupt because of expansions in the \nprogram and Congress' failure to appropriate enough money.\n  This injustice must be rectified. I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto remedy this lack of funding. Those who gave so much for our nation's \nsecurity through their work on our nuclear programs must be compensated \nfor the enormous price they paid. Anything less is unacceptable.\n  Senator Hatch and I have introduced two bills that will provide full \nfunding for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund. We proposed \nlegislation seeking $84 million in emergency supplemental \nappropriations to pay those claims that have already been approved as \nwell as the projected number of approved claims for fiscal year 2001. \nThis legislation would also make all future payments for approved \nclaims mandatory.\n  With this legislation, we will ensure that those who gave so much for \nour nation will at least receive their deserved benefits. We must never \nagain let their sacrifice go unanswered. I again ask my Senate \ncolleagues to help us right this wrong and give these victims their \njust compensation. I ask unanimous consent that the March 27 New York \nTimes article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 27, 2001]\n\n     Ill Uranium Miners Left Waiting As Payments for Exposure Lapse\n\n                         (By Michael Janofsky)\n\n       Grand Junction, Colo., March 20.--For all the reminders of \n     Bob Key's cold war effort, mining uranium for American \n     nuclear weapons programs, none stands out more than the tank \n     of oxygen tethered to his throat. Mr. Key, 61, has pulmonary \n     fibrosis, a scarring of the lungs that is often fatal. A \n     recent tracheotomy helps air flow to his lungs through a tube \n     connected to the tank.\n       A decade ago, Congress recognized the contributions of Mr. \n     Key and other uranium miners and passed the Radiation \n     Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990. Signed by President \n     George Bush, the law established one-time payments of up to \n     $100,000 to miners or their families and to people who lived \n     downwind from the nuclear test sites in Nevada. Last year, \n     Congress increased the payout to $150,000, added new medical \n     benefits and expanded the number of workers eligible.\n       But after years of smooth operations, the program is broke. \n     Scrambling last year to pass President Bill Clinton's final \n     budget, lawmakers never debated the Justice Department's \n     request for additional money to cover the expanded program \n     even as new applications were pouring in, and by May, nothing \n     was left. And Congress has been reluctant to act until it \n     decides how to apportion the federal surplus and how much to \n     cut taxes.\n       As a result, for the first time, claims from hundreds of \n     eligible applicants like Mr. Key have been held up, with many \n     of the applicants receiving i.o.u. letters from the Justice \n     Department, which administers the program, saying their \n     requests will be processed only after Congress appropriates \n     more money.\n       And the demand is only increasing. Claims from another \n     1,600 applicants under the original law are pending, and the \n     department estimates that as many as 1,050 new applicants are \n     expected to file for benefits this year, a number that would \n     raise the cost of the program to more than $80 million.\n       ``It's been a bureaucratic travesty,'' said Representative \n     Scott McInnis, a republican from Grand Junction, a city in \n     western Colorado, who introduced legislation this year \n     seeking $84 million to restore the program. ``These people \n     are due their compensation. There is nothing to be \n     adjudicated. The money is owed. The debt is due.''\n       For now, Congress has not decided how or when to continue \n     the program. Lawmakers are discussing the possibility of \n     legislation as part of the current year's budget to provide \n     money right away.\n       Meanwhile, almost 200 people who have been approved for the \n     money are still holding the i.o.u.'s,  including relatives of \n     some miners who have died of their illnesses while \n     waiting.\n       ``Just since January, we've lost five clients, and I'm sure \n     there are more we're not aware of,'' said Keith Killian, a \n     lawyer here who represents former uranium miners and their \n     families. Rebecca Rockwell, a private investigator in \n     Durango, Colo., said she represented the families of at least \n     10 clients with i.o.u. letters who have died.\n       Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Senator Orrin G. \n     Hatch of Utah, both Republicans, have introduced legislation \n     similar to Mr. McInnis's, asking for enough money to pay all \n     claims through this year and to make the program a permanent \n     entitlement so Congress does not have to authorize spending \n     each year. They have urged President Bush to include money \n     for the program in a supplemental budget proposal for the \n     current fiscal year.\n       But miners and their families have been told that no new \n     spending is likely until Congress resolves its fiscal issues, \n     a process that could delay disbursement of the miners' money \n     for months, even a year.\n       ``I'm bitter about it,'' said Mr. Key, who worked in the \n     mines from 1959 through 1963 and, like other mine workers, \n     said he was never warned of the health consequences of \n     exposure to uranium.\n       ``I wonder how well those guys in Washington would do, see \n     how they would like it, tied to a chain like I am 24 hours a \n     day,'' Mr. Key said. ``I know I owe taxes this year. I'm just \n     going to tell them to take it out of my i.o.u.''\n       Worried that he will not live long enough to receive a \n     check because of his lung disease, Jack Beeson, 67, a former \n     miner from Moab, Utah, said: ``We worked in those mines, \n     waiting for our golden years. Well, now it's our golden \n     years, and it's done nothing but cost us gold. This is no way \n     to live. I felt I was doing the government a service. Now, I \n     feel they're doing me a disservice.''\n       To many of the former miners who extracted uranium from \n     hundreds of mines in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona, \n     the i.o.u.'s are insulting. From the 1940's through 1971, \n     when mining for the nuclear weapons program ended, they \n     regarded themselves as patriots, equal to servicemen. The \n     relatively high wages paid by the mines were a lure, but so \n     was the idea that uranium mining was crucial to national \n     security.\n       Lorna Harvey's father, Loren Wilcox, was a cattle rancher. \n     But he disliked Russia so much, Ms. Harvey said, that he took \n     a mining job in 1954 and worked it for two and a half years. \n     ``He felt we needed to protect ourselves,'' she said. Mr. \n     Wilcox died of lung cancer in 1969 at 62.\n       Most workers had no idea that the yellow ore they were \n     mining could destroy their health. Wayne Hill, 69, who has \n     lung cancer, said a tin cup hung at the entrance to one mine \n     for miners and drivers to drink water dripping out of the \n     rocks. ``It was cool, clear water,'' he said. ``I didn't know \n     it was going to make me light up.''\n       So little was known or revealed about the health \n     consequences of uranium exposure that workers used uranium \n     dust for fertilizer and uranium rocks for doorstops. ``My \n     mother made earrings out of it,'' Ms. Harvey said.\n       With deaths and illnesses mounting and ample scientific \n     evidence to show that uranium exposure was a cause, Congress \n     passed\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\n     legislation to compensate the miners in 1990. And for nearly \n     10 years, the Justice Department's annual requests for \n     financing the program were met. To date, $268.7 million has \n     been paid to 3,595 people. About the same number were denied \n     because they lacked proper medical records or copies of \n     company logs that showed how long they had worked in the \n     mines.\n       The financial crunch arose when Mr. Clinton expanded the \n     program at a time Congress appropriated only $10.8 million to \n     cover existing claims, an amount that was exhausted quickly. \n     Efforts by Mr. Domenici and others to cover the shortfall, as \n     well as the new applicants, failed.\n       Some of the i.o.u. holders have lost hope of seeing the \n     money. Darlene Pagel's husband, Duane, died of pulmonary \n     fibrosis in 1986 at 55. Since then, Ms. Pagel said, she has \n     worked two jobs to pay off his medical bills, which still \n     amount to $26,922.\n       ``He didn't know uranium could kill him,'' she said. ``If \n     he'd have known he would have been dead at 55, he never would \n     have taken the job.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3146-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3146-S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  25TH ANNIVERSARY OF WASHINGTON METRO\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, tomorrow, March 29, 2001, the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority will celebrate the 25th Anniversary \nof passenger service on the Metrorail system. I want to take this \nopportunity to congratulate WMATA on this important occasion and to \nrecognize the extraordinary contribution Metro has made to this region \nand to our Nation.\n  For the past quarter century, the Washington Metro system has served \nas a shining example of a public investment in the Washington \nMetropolitan area's future. It provides a unified and coordinated \ntransportation system for the region, enhances mobility for the \nmillions of residents, visitors and the federal workforce in the \nregion, promotes orderly growth and development of the region, enhances \nour environment, and preserves the beauty and dignity of our Nation's \nCapital. It is also an example of an unparalleled partnership that \nspans every level of government from city to state to federal.\n  Since passenger service first began in 1976, Metrorail has grown from \na 4.6 mile, five station, 22,000 passenger service to a comprehensive \n103-mile, 83 station, and 600,000 passenger system serving the entire \nmetropolitan region, and with even more service and stations on a fast \ntrack toward completion. Today, the Metro system is the second busiest \nrapid transit operation in the country, carrying nearly one-fifth of \nthe region's daily commuters traveling to the metropolitan core and \ntaking more than 270,000 vehicles off the roads every day. It is also \none of the finest, cleanest, safest and most reliable transportation \nsystems in the Nation.\n  Reaching this important milestone has not been an easy task, by any \nmeasure. It took extraordinary vision and perseverance to build the 103 \nmile subway system over the past twenty five years and, as the \nWashington Post has recently underscored in two articles about the \nMetro system, it will require an equal or even greater commitment to \naddress the challenges that lie ahead. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the first of these articles be included in the Record \nimmediately following my statement.\n  The great communities throughout the world are the ones that have \nworked to preserve and enhance their historic and natural resources; \nprovide good transportation systems for citizens to move to their \nplaces of employment and to public facilities freely; and invest in \nneighborhoods and local business districts. These are among the things \nthat contribute to the livability of our communities and enrich the \nlives of our citizens. I submit that the Metro system and the regional \ncooperation which it has helped foster has helped make this region a \ncommunity in which we can all be proud.\n  This week's celebration is a tribute to everyone involved in the \ncontinuing intergovernmental effort to provide mass transit to the \npeople of the Washington Metropolitan area--those local, State and \nfederal officials who had the vision to begin this project 25 years ago \nand who have worked so steadfastly over the years to support the \nsystem. This foresight has been well rewarded and I join in celebrating \nthis special occasion.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2001]\n\n             Region's Subway System Begins to Show Its Age\n\n                          (By Lyndsey Layton)\n\n       As Washington's Metro trains hummed to life 25 years ago, \n     many people didn't know what to expect. It was, after all, \n     among the first U.S. subway systems built from scratch, \n     rather than cobbled together from several existing railroads, \n     as in New York and Boston.\n       But from its opening on March 27, 1976, Metro was a new \n     American monument. Embraced by locals and tourists, it became \n     a $9.4 billion model for moving people swiftly between \n     suburbs and the city. Riders have lately flocked to Metro \n     faster than it can buy rail cars to carry them, a fortune \n     never anticipated by its designers.\n       The Metro would provide to be far more than a people mover. \n     It shaped the region in dramatic ways, turning the village of \n     Bethesda into a small city, reviving sagging Clarendon, \n     pumping new life into downtown by creating mass transit \n     access that eventually lured the MCI Center and its \n     professional sports teams to Gallery Place.\n       The Metro system has become--among many other things--a \n     gathering place, a unifier, a matchmarker, a land developer, \n     an economic power and a community planner.\n       But while Metro fulfilled some dreams, it left others \n     unrealized. Ideas that made sense when the subway was built \n     turned out to be mistakes. Escalators open to the sky are \n     falling apart after decades of soaking in rain and snow. The \n     two-track design of the railroad is too simple for increasing \n     demands for service.\n       Metro is lapping up tax dollars to keep its aging equipment \n     running.\n       And the rail lines don't reach where most movement now \n     takes place: suburb to suburb. Transit managers have grand \n     visions for Metro's next 25 years: They want to connect major \n     suburbs with rail and to use the more flexible bus system to \n     follow the market, joining suburbs, carrying the spillover \n     from rail lines, stepping in to fill gaps.\n       They dream of a transit system that forges the region's \n     destiny for the next quarter-century as it did for the past.\n\n\n                           Molding the Region\n\n       The transit system has sprouted restaurant rows in Bethesda \n     and Ballston, shops and offices in Pentagon City and around \n     Union station, affordable housing in Virginia Square, \n     economic revival on U Street. Metro means cheap mobility for \n     college students.\n       It has helped diversify the inner suburbs, encouraging \n     immigrants from Bolivia and Peru to settle in Arlington. It \n     made it possible for many of the 300,000 federal employees to \n     buy single-family homes in close-in communities and work in \n     downtown Washington. It even gave a name to the neighborhood \n     of Friendship Heights, which most called Chevy Chase in the \n     days before the subway station.\n       Metro has tied together a region fractured by state lines, \n     race and class.\n       ``You've got people of different races, different classes, \n     different job descriptions, from city and from suburb, old \n     and young, able and disabled,'' said Zachary Schrag, a \n     graduate student at Columbia University who is writing his \n     dissertation about the Metro. ``And they actually treat each \n     other pretty civilly most of the time.''\n\n\n                             Moving People\n\n       Alan Sussman studies Torah on the Red Line. Frank Lloyd \n     takes his twin girls for all-day rides as a cheap diversion. \n     Oren Hirsch, 14, always tries to claim the seat directly \n     behind the operator so he can peer through the smoked-glass \n     window and watch the controls and the track bed rushing under \n     the train.\n       Metro is carrying about 600,000 passengers a day on its \n     trains and 500,000 on buses, making it the nation's second-\n     busiest transit system behind New York's.\n       That's a ranking that none of the original planners dreamed \n     of when they were designing the system in the late 1060s.\n       ``I'm a believer, and it has even outstripped my \n     expectations,'' said Cleatus Barnett, 73, who was appointed \n     to the Metro board of directors in 1971 and is the longest \n     continually serving member.\n       The subway takes more than 270,000 cars off the road each \n     day, Metro officials say. Those cars would have used more \n     than 12 million gallons of gasoline a year and needed 30 \n     additional highway lanes and 1,800 acres of parking.\n       Mary Margaret Whipple, a state senator from Arlington and a \n     past member of the Metro board, puts it this way, ``One \n     hundred thousand people a day go underneath Arlington on the \n     Metro system instead of through Arlington in their cars.''\n       As highway traffic gets worse, subway ridership has soared. \n     Ridership records are shattered regularly, thanks in part to \n     a robust economy, strong tourism, a new transit subsidy \n     extended to federal workers and fares that haven't increased \n     since 1995.\n\n\n                            an early vision\n\n       Before it opened, Metro had trouble recruiting workers, who \n     were wary abut toiling in the dark underground. ``All people \n     knew about subways was New York,'' said Christopher Scripp, a \n     Cleveland Park Station manager, who was a Metrobus driver \n     when he became one of the first subway employees.\n       The architect, Harry M. Weese, had been sent on a tour of \n     European subways with instructions to combine the world's \n     best designs into a new American monument.\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\n       Weese dreamed big, and a legion of engineers followed his \n     concept to launch a transit system that would eventually cost \n     $9.4 billion and stretch 103 miles across two rivers, two \n     states and the District.\n       With their coffered concrete arches and floating mezzanines \n     lighted dramatically from below, the stations were celebrated \n     by everyone from architecture critics to construction \n     workers.\n\n\n                            design problems\n\n       But planners can see only so far into the future. What they \n     failed to recognize as a service area--the edge cities \n     outside the orbit of downtown Washington--has left Metro with \n     the challenge of trying to be useful to people who don't live \n     or work where the subway lines run.\n       They plotted a hub-and-spoke pattern of five lines with 83 \n     stations stretching from the suburbs to the center of the \n     District to ferry federal workers from homes to offices. But \n     development patterns have since strayed, creating suburban \n     communities and office centers far from the subway lines in \n     upper Montgomery, Howard, Southern Maryland, western Fairfax, \n     Loudoun and Prince William.\n       Those patterns are going to intensify. In another 25 years, \n     two-thirds of all daily trips in the region will be from \n     suburb to suburb, according to the region's Transportation \n     Planning Board. Transit advocates have been lobbying for \n     several years for a Purple Line to connect Bethesda in \n     Montgomery County with New Carrollton in Prince George's \n     County. Advocates say the Purple Line is the best bet for a \n     fast connection between the counties, since the proposed \n     intercounty connector linking I-270 and I-95 has been \n     sidelined.\n       Metro planners are also looking at ways to connect Prince \n     George's County with Alexandria by running rail over the new \n     Woodrow Wilson Bridge.\n       Metro has started several new suburb-to-suburb bus routes, \n     though it acknowledges buses are a far cry from rapid rail \n     service.\n\n\n                          changing communities\n\n       The original 103-mile Metro system was finished in January, \n     when the final five stations opened on the Green Line in the \n     District and Prince George's. While Metro is primarily a \n     people mover, it also can change the look and feel of a \n     community, for better or worse. Even in neighborhoods that \n     waited many years for Metro service, people have mixed \n     feelings about living on the subway line.\n       ``The more accessible transportation is, the more likely \n     developers are going to come into your neighborhood and price \n     you out,'' said Brenda Richardson, a consultant who runs her \n     firm, Women Like Us, from he rented home five blocks from the \n     new Congress Heights Station.\n       ``People here are worried about being displaced. We feel \n     like we stayed here when things were awful, and now that the \n     community is a prime place for development, we're going to be \n     booted out.... Gentrification to a lot of black folks means \n     the white folks are coming.''\n       Communities like Arlington and Bethesda either require \n     affordable housing near Metro stations or offer incentives to \n     developers who set aside a portion of a project to affordable \n     housing.\n       Richardson wants a similar protection in the District. ``I \n     don't like the idea that Metro can destabilize communities,'' \n     she said. ``There needs to be some sort of policy that is set \n     so that when Metro comes into neighborhoods, developers are \n     not at liberty to push out longtime residents, seniors and \n     renters.''\n       Exactly how Metro changes a community has plenty to do with \n     the decisions made by the community's own planners and \n     leaders.\n       Metro is the reason some places, like Bethesda or the \n     stretch between Rosslyn and Ballston in Arlington, have seen \n     thriving ``urban villages'' sprout up around their stations \n     while other spots, such as Rhode Island Avenue in the \n     District or Addison Road in Prince George's have stations \n     that are relatively isolated and undeveloped.\n\n\n                           arlington's model\n\n       Arlington County is widely seen as the gold standard for \n     molding growth around Metro. Along the five-station corridor \n     from Rosslyn to Ballston, which opened in 1979, Arlington \n     leveraged the subway stations to attract jobs, housing and \n     commercial development.\n       ``There is no better success story,'' said Stewart \n     Schwartz, of the Coalition for Smarter Growth.\n       The story starts with Arlington leaders, who recognized \n     early on that Metro could be powerful enough to revitalize \n     the sagging commercial corridor between Rosslyn and Ballston.\n       They fought to change the route of the subway, which had \n     been planned along the median of I-66, and convinced \n     Arlington taxpayers it would be worthwhile to pay extra to \n     burrow the subway underground and pull it south to run \n     between Wilson and Clarendon boulevards.\n       They worked with residents to establish a vision for the \n     development they wanted and wrote zoning laws to make it \n     happen. The plan was high-density, high-rise office, retail \n     and residential space next to the stations, with a gradual \n     tapering in height so that single-family homes remained \n     untouched just two or three blocks away.\n       The streets around the stations welcome pedestrians, not \n     cars. There is no Metro parking.\n       ``We were willing to go through a major community \n     transformation in order to maximize the value of this transit \n     system,'' Whipple said. ``The feeling was that people could \n     live and work near transit, and it should have a beneficial \n     effect. And it has. We simply don't have the kinds of traffic \n     problems that exist elsewhere.''\n       With offices, shops and housing near Metro, the station \n     becomes as much destination as origin. Trains are full coming \n     and going.\n       That's not the case for most suburban Metro stations. \n     ``Most of the trains leave most of the stations most of the \n     time essentially empty,'' said Ed Risse, a Vienna-based \n     consultant who has closely studied the link between urban \n     development and public transit systems such as Metro. ``In \n     the morning, it's crowded and uncomfortable. But going in at \n     midday and out in the morning, there are huge amounts of \n     unused capacity. Looking ahead to the next 30 years, we need \n     to much more efficiently use that capacity.''\n\n\n                            Other Approaches\n\n       Fairfax County, meanwhile, largely squashed attempts to \n     develop commercial and retail property around its Orange Line \n     Metro stations. Risse worked on five different projects to \n     develop land around the Vienna Metro station--they all failed \n     to win approval.\n       County supervisors said they recognize that some \n     development may be healthy at some stations and have approved \n     a new zoning category that allows higher-density projects \n     near Metro.\n       But Risse said the county is far from ready to embrace \n     ``transit villages.''\n       ``If you undertake transit-related development at Vienna or \n     any of those stations, it's a long, acrimonious process,'' he \n     said. ``There are vocal people who want to drive to the \n     station, park and use it. A larger group wants others to \n     drive to the station so they can keep driving. And the third \n     group lives near the station and doesn't want anything built \n     there.''\n       By contrast, Prince George's County has struggled to lure \n     developers to its Metro stations. Most of its larger \n     employers near Metro stations are federal agencies. Many of \n     its stations are hard to reach by foot and are surrounded by \n     large parking lots or garages.\n       ``prince George's took a $10 billion investment and put it \n     on the shelf,'' Schwartz said. ``The bottom line is, today \n     there are four spurs of the Metro system in Prince George's--\n     more than any other jurisdiction--and very little \n     development.''\n       Prince George's planners forecast little additional \n     development 25 years form now. Using projections made by \n     local counties, the Metropolitan Washington Council of \n     Governments created a map that predicts regional development \n     by 2025. It shows that Prince George's offices expect few \n     projects to be built around their Metro stations.\n       Metro was one of the first transit agencies in the country \n     to sell or lease land it owns near stations. To date, Metro \n     has approved about 40 such projects, of which 27 have been \n     built and generate about $6 million in annual revenue for the \n     agency. Metro has identified about 400 additional acres it \n     wants to develop.\n\n\n                            Roads and Rails\n\n       Critics, such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, say Metro \n     could be more aggressive in developing projects around its \n     stations and that too much land is developed to parking and \n     roads. The environmental group says Metro should instead \n     develop shops, offices and restaurants so people would ride \n     the trains to--as well as from--the station, to invigorate \n     the community. But Metro General Manager Richard A. White \n     said the system has historically stayed out of local affairs.\n       Meanwhile, the road network carries the load that Metro \n     can't. The high-tech corridor of Northern Virginia, the \n     biotech community in Montgomery County and the Navy's \n     expanding air station in Southern Maryland are fed by \n     congested highways or the overwhelmed Capital Beltway.\n       While 40 percent of the region rides mass transit into the \n     core of Washington, the remaining 60 percent travel by \n     automobile. And when you consider the total number of daily \n     trips taken throughout the Washington region--including outer \n     suburbs far from Metro--the percentage carried by transit \n     drops to about 5 percent.\n       ``There's just a limited number of people who can use it,'' \n     said Bob Chase, of the Northern Virginia Transportation \n     Alliance. ``If you live in Ballston and work in Farragut \n     Square, fine. But that's not a lot of people.''\n       Still, the subway has a strong public image.

Mr. President, five years ago today the Congress, without \ndissent in the Senate, took a historic step in reigning in the federal \ngovernment's regulatory machine and protecting the interest of small \nbusinesses. My Red Tape Reduction Act, what others call the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, ensured that small \nbusinesses would be given a voice in the regulatory process at the time \nwhen it could make the most difference: before the regulation is \npublished as a proposal.\n  This act provides a number of provisions that have proven to make the \nregulatory process more attentive to the impact on small businesses, \nand consequently more fair, more efficient and more effective. Perhaps \nthe best known of these provisions is the requirement that OSHA and EPA \nconvene panels to receive comments from small businesses before their \nregulations are proposed. This gives these agencies the unique \nopportunity to learn up front what the problems with their regulation \nmay be, and to correct these problems when it will cause the least \ndifficulty. This has resulted in significant changes being made, and in \none case, EPA abandoning a regulation because they recognized that the \nindustry could deal with the issue more effectively on their own.\n  Experience with this panel process had proven to be an unequivocal \nsuccess. The former chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration stated that, ``Unquestionably, the SBREFA panel process \nhas had a very salutary impact on the regulatory deliberations of OSHA \nand EPA, resulting in major changes to draft regulations. What is \nimportant to note is that these changes were accomplished without \nsacrificing the agencies public policy objectives.''\n  Another provision of the Red Tape Reduction Act that was just \nexercised, was the Congressional Review Act, which gave Congress the \nability to invalidate those regulations determined to be truly \negregious and beyond repair. Thankfully, we had this measure available \nas a last resort to dispose of the Clinton OSHA ergonomics regulation, \nwhich was a monument to regulatory excess and failure to appreciate the \nimpact on small businesses.\n  Finally, one other provision of the Red Tape Reduction Act is just \nnow being invoked. The Red Tape Reduction Act corrected the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act's lack of enforcement by giving interested parties the \nopportunity to bring a legal challenge when they believed that an \nagency is in non-compliance. Litigation is now moving through the \ncourts that takes advantage of this provision and will hold agencies \naccountable for their actions.\n  While the Red Tape Reduction Act has been a resounding success, it is \nclear that more needs to be done. Too many agencies are still trying to \nevade the requirements to conduct regulatory flexibility analyses that \nwill identify the small business impacts of their regulations. We now \nrealize that the IRS should also be required to conduct small business \nreview panels so that their regulations will impose the least amount of \nburden while still achieving the mission of the agency.\n  These and other issues shall be addressed in future legislation that \nI will introduce. For now, let us all appreciate and celebrate the \nbenefits that the Red Tape Reduction Act brought to both the agencies \nand small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3148-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WORK OPPORTUNITY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Jeffords to introduce S. 626, the Work \nOpportunity Improvement Act of 2001. This legislation would permanently \nextend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, and the Welfare-to-Work, \nW-t-W, tax credit. The measure would also modify WOTC's eligibility \ncriteria to help those receiving food stamps qualify for the credit.\n  Over the past 5 years these tax credits have played an integral part \nin helping a million and a half of America's working poor transition \ninto the work force. WOTC was enacted in September of 1996, and W-t-W a \nyear later, in order to provide employers with the financial resources \nthey would need to recruit, hire, and retain individuals who have \nsignificant barriers to work. Traditionally, employers have been \nresistant to hiring those coming off the welfare rolls not only because \nthey tended to be less educated and have little work place experience, \nbut also because welfare dependency fosters self esteem problems which \nneed to be surmounted. But these hiring tax incentives have clearly \ndemonstrated that employers can be enticed to overcome their natural \nresistance to hiring less skilled, economically dependent individuals \nprovided they are supplied adequate financial incentives. No other \nhiring tax incentive or training program has been nearly as successful \nas WOTC and W-t-W in encouraging employers to change their hiring \npractices.\n  A vibrant public-private partnership has developed over the past 5 \nyears where-by government has provided the incentives and program \nadministration support required to induce employers to participate. \nEmployers have responded by changing their hiring practices. Many \nemployers have established outreach and recruitment programs to target \neligible individuals. States have made these programs more employer-\nfriendly by continually improving the way they are administered. But \ntime and again, we hear from both employers and the State job services, \nwhich administer the programs, that the continued uncertainty \nsurrounding short-term extensions impedes expanded participation and \nimprovements in program administration. A permanent extension would \ninduce many of the employers now participating to expand their \nrecruitment efforts and encourage the States to commit more time and \neffort to perfecting their administration of the program. This in turn \nwould mean that even more individuals would be helped to transition \nfrom welfare dependency to work. Precisely because these programs have \nproven to be such successes over the past 5 years that we believe they \nshould be made permanent.\n  In addition to making the WOTC and W-t-W programs permanent, our \nlegislation would improve the WOTC program by increasing the age \nceiling in the food stamp category from age 21 to age 51. This would \ngreatly improve the job prospects for many absentee fathers and other \nvulnerable males who are less likely to qualify under other categories. \nMaking absentee fathers eligible for the WOTC credits would provide \nemployers with the incentive to hire them and in so doing provide them \nwith the sense of personal responsibility and community involvement \nthat are essential first steps to their assuming their responsibility \nas parents.\n  We urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation to permanently extend the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and \nWelfare-to-Work tax credit programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3148-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3148-S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Today \nI again rise to honor the Lady Boilermakers for again making a trip to \nthe NCAA Final Four. And this year, I also want to honor the women's \nbasketball team of the University of Notre Dame as Indiana is \nexceptionally proud to have not one, but two women's basketball teams \nreaching the 2001 NCAA Final Four.\n  Notre Dame last represented Indiana in the women's NCAA Final Four in \n1997. This year the Notre Dame women have achieved an exceptional sixth \nconsecutive tournament appearance and eighth overall tournament \nappearance under Head Coach Muffet McGraw. Coach McGraw and All-\nAmerican, Big East Player of the Year Ruth Riley have led the team to \nan outstanding 32-2 record, a school high for victories in one season.\n  Purdue's women have persevered through adversity to achieve success \nas they suffered the loss of team member Tiffany Young in a 1999 \ntraffic accident. Team members experienced other personal losses and \nserious injuries, yet with skill and determination they have become the \nfirst team to reach the Final Four under three coaches: Lin Dunn in \n1994, Carolyn Peck in 1999, and now current Coach Kristy Curry. Coach \nCurry, Big Ten Player of the Year Katie Douglas, and the rest of the \nLady Boilermakers hold an impressive 30-6 record.\n  We celebrate the dedication of these women, their victories, and the \ntradition of sportsmanship and excellence present throughout Indiana. \nWe send these two teams our best wishes as they proceed to their \nrespective semifinal games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3149-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF ROWLAND EVANS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the best example of the free \npress was Rowland Evans and the best brief on this outstanding \njournalist was from his partner, Robert D. Novak, in the Washington \nPost, Thursday, March 29. I ask consent that the brief be included in \nthe Record for his friends that knew him and for the millions more that \nwere informed by his writing.\n  The brief follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 29, 2001]\n\n                        Rowland Evans, Reporter\n\n                          (By Robert D. Novak)\n\n       On Monday morning, Dec. 17, 1962, I returned from my \n     honeymoon and found multiple phone messages from Rowly Evans \n     on my desk in the Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. \n     Evans, a reporter for the New York Herald-Tribune, asked me \n     at a subsequent lunch to collaborate with him in a daily \n     newspaper column.\n       The goal was a product short on ideology, long on \n     reporting. Our column first appeared on May 15, 1963, and ran \n     in this space under our double byline until Evans retired \n     from the column 30 years later. Over the years, I fear, we \n     became more ideological. But we promised ourselves that every \n     column would contain some information, major or minuscule, \n     never previously reported.\n       We kept that promise, thanks to Evan's energies. Several \n     obituaries noting the death of Rowland Evans from cancer on \n     March 23 described him as a conservative. More appropriately, \n     he should be remembered as a reporter and a patriot.\n       His model was the column written by the Alsop brothers--\n     Joseph and Stewart--who combined dogged reporting with a \n     passion for the security of the United States. Like Joe \n     Alsop, Evans belonged to the Washington of black-tie dinner \n     parties, still flourishing when our column began.\n       Rowly snagged stories on the Georgetown party circuit, \n     including an exclusive on U.S. plans for an electronic wall \n     to protect south Vietnam. But he relied mostly on old-\n     fashioned reporting, featuring relentless interrogation of \n     sources. Senators, Cabinet members and anonymous staffers \n     lured to lunch or breakfast at the Metropolitan Club found \n     themselves facing a questioner who insisted on answers. He \n     traveled everywhere for stories, covering the Vietnam, Six-\n     Day and Gulf wars, often at great physical risk.\n       Readers who thought they could spot the principal author of \n     our columns would be surprised to learn that I was not \n     responsible for ``Reassessing Goldwater,'' published on April \n     9, 1964. Since at that time I had close contact with Sen. \n     Barry Goldwater, it was assumed that I had written the column \n     disputing the conventional wisdom that Mr. Conservative was \n     dead for the Republican presidential nomination. After much \n     shoeleather reporting, Evans came to the conclusion that \n     Goldwater quite likely would be the nominee.\n       He flourished when reporting on national security, using a \n     melange of sources both prominent and shadowy. He was ahead \n     of everybody in forecasting the breakdown of Soviet satellite \n     rule in Poland and Czechoslovakia. In 1979, one Evans column \n     after another exposed Soviet cheating on arms control \n     agreements that U.S. officials tried to ignore. Evans \n     considered that work the high point of his long career.\n       Nothing he did ever caused more trouble than his tough \n     reporting on Israeli intransigence. Evans was not anti-Israel \n     and certainly not antisemitic. He went to Lebanon in 1982 to \n     cover an Israeli invasion of Lebanon that he deployed. But he \n     found Palestinian atrocities in Sidon, Lebanon, that \n     suggested ``the PLO has become permeated by thugs and \n     adventurers.'' Although the late Yitzhak Rabin was his \n     friend, he did not feel that the United States should be tied \n     to the decisions of the Israeli government.\n       Our column encountered the most criticism when he \n     investigated, years after the event, the Israeli attack that \n     sank the U.S. Navy communications intelligence ship Liberty \n     during the Six-Day War. It was not anti-Israeli bias that \n     caused Evans to probe an incident that both governments \n     wanted to hide. Rather, it was outrage--born of patriotic \n     fervor--over the needless death of 34 U.S. Naval personnel \n     that he laid at the feet of Israeli defense forces.\n       That same outrage had led Evans as a Yale freshman on Dec. \n     8, 1941, to protest the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor by \n     enlisting in the Marine Corps, taking him to combat on \n     Guadalcanal.\n       American security was his guiding star. It led him to \n     support U.S. efforts to save Vietnam from communist \n     oppression, though that stance eventually put him in \n     opposition to his friend Robert F. Kennedy. It led him away \n     from his family's ties with Democrats and toward the Reagan \n     Revolution.\n       He was the life of every party be attended. But behind the \n     charm of a Philadelphia society boy was a tough Marine who \n     loved his country and never wavered in seeking the \n     truth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3149-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BRYANNA HOCKING WINS MITCHELL SCHOLARSHIP\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

These scholarships are awarded to \nindividuals between the ages of 18 and 30 who have shown academic \ndistinction, commitment to service, and potential for leadership.\n  Bryanna will be an excellent student ambassador to Ireland. In May \n2000, she received a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service from \nGeorgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service. An active \nmember of her community, she was founder and co-chair of the Georgetown \nWomen's Guild, which organized forums and discussions at the University \non women's issues and served on the executive board of the Georgetown \nCollege Republicans.\n  Bryanna is an aspiring journalist, an ambition sparked by her \nconcerns about how the media dealt with the Balkans, Rwanda, and other \nareas where ethnic strife led to genocide. Bryanna hopes that she can \ncombine her passion for journalism and international affairs in a \ncareer in which she contributes to increased harmony among the world's \npeoples. I congratulate her and wish her luck in her peace and \ndevelopment studies at the University of Limerick.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3149-4", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3149-S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DR. GEORGE W. ALBEE, DISTINGUISHED VERMONTER\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Friday April 5, a distinguished \nretired Vermonter, Dr. George W. Albee will receive the American \nPsychological\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nAssociation's Presidential Citation for the work he has done in the \nfield of psychology over the last 50 years.\n  Dr. Albee and his family moved to Vermont in the early 1970's, after \na long and prolific career at Case Western Reserve University in \nCleveland. He taught and wrote at the University of Vermont for the \nnext 25 years, and was an active and influential member of Vermont's \nacademic community.\n  Dr. Albee's career began in a small office at APA's national \nheadquarters in Washington in the early 1950's. In the fall of 1953, he \nwent to Finland after landing a Fulbright Professorship at Helsinki \nUniversity. He returned to accept a job in the Department of Psychology \nat Western Reserve University, and was named George Trumbull Ladd \nDistinguished Professor of Psychology in 1958.\n  Under President Eisenhower, Albee was the Director of the Task Force \non Manpower of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health. The \nbook that he wrote, coupled with the work and recommendations of the \ncommission, helped lead to the establishment and development of \ncommunity mental health centers.\n  He also served as a consultant to the U.S. Surgeon General, the Peace \nCorps, and headed President Carter's Commission on Mental Health in \n1977.\n  Prior to moving to Vermont, Albee was elected President of the \nAmerican Psychological Association where he served with distinction \nduring a turbulent time of change in the psychological and psychiatric \ncommunities.\n  He was always known in Vermont as a leader also willing to wade into \ncontroversy and fight for the causes he believed in. In 1977, he began \nan annual conference at UVM on the Primary Prevention of Psychopathogy, \nwhich over the years have brought scholars and policy makers from \naround the country and around the world to discuss ways to shape local \nstate and national policies on a range of important public policy \nareas.\n  In addition to his prolific writings, Dr. Albee taught thousands of \nundergraduate and graduate students at UVM. His contribution to Vermont \nand our nation has been profound. I am honored to consider him and his \nwife Margaret friends--and am proud that he has raised four children, \nall of whom are contributing in their own ways to making this world a \nbetter place.\n  A previous award Dr. Albee received articulated better than I his \ncontribution to the field of psychology. Its says:\n\n       Dr. Albee has had an active role in plotting the direction \n     and independence of professional psychology. He saw and \n     articulated early the need for an independent profession of \n     psychology, freed from the domination of older professions \n     and older models. His ``Declaration of Independence for \n     Psychology'' has been reprinted endlessly. His argument and \n     clinical psychology students should be trained in a service \n     center operated by psychology was widely accepted. His study \n     of the nation's manpower needs and resources in mental health \n     was one of the major influences in developing the community \n     mental health center movement. He has been a frequent critic \n     of the mental health establishment, but he has been as \n     sharply critical of his own field when it seemed tempted to \n     yield principle for power and status. At times of greatest \n     crisis, however, George W. Albee has helped find ways of \n     compromise which have held psychology together.\n\n  I congratulate Dr. Albee for this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3150-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3150-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/29/senate-section/article/S3150-3", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe ``Fort Smith INS Suboffice Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Smith INS Suboffice \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Immigration and Naturalization Service office in \n     Fort Smith, Arkansas, is an office within the jurisdiction of \n     the district office in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n       (2) During the past 10 years, the foreign national \n     population has grown substantially in the jurisdictional area \n     of the Fort Smith office.\n       (3) According to the 2000 census, Arkansas' Hispanic \n     population grew by 337 percent over the Hispanic population \n     in the 1990 census. This rate of growth is believed to be the \n     fastest in the United States.\n       (4) Hispanics now comprise 3.2 percent of Arkansas' \n     population and 5.7 percent of the Third Congressional \n     District of Arkansas' population.\n       (5) This dramatic increase in immigration will continue as \n     the growing industries and excellent quality of life of \n     Northwest Arkansas are strong attractions.\n       (6) Interstates 540 and 40 intersect in Fort Smith and air \n     transportation is readily available there.\n       (7) In the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, \n     Congress directed the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     to review the staffing needs of the Fort Smith office.\n       (8) A preliminary review shows that the Fort Smith office \n     is indeed understaffed. The office currently needs an \n     additional adjudication officer, an additional information \n     officer, a part-time ``jack-of-all-trades'' employee, 2 full-\n     time clerks, and 1 additional enforcement officer.\n       (9) A suboffice designation would enable the Fort Smith, \n     Arkansas, office to obtain additional staff as well as an \n     Officer-in-Charge who would have the authority to sign \n     documents and take actions related to cases which now must be \n     forwarded to the New Orleans District Office for approval.\n       (10) The additional staff, authority, and autonomy that the \n     suboffice designation would provide the Fort Smith office \n     would result in a reduction in backlogs and waiting periods, \n     a significant improvement in customer service, and a \n     significant improvement in the enforcement of the immigration \n     laws of the United States.\n       (11) The designation of the Fort Smith office as a \n     suboffice would show that the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service is--\n       (A) committed to facilitating the legal immigration process \n     for those persons acting in good faith; and\n       (B) likewise committed to enforcing the immigration laws of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary for each fiscal year to establish and operate an \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service suboffice in Fort \n     Smith, Arkansas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Biden, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 645. A bill to require individuals who lobby the President on \npardon issues to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and \nto require the President to report any gifts, pledges, or commitments \nof a gift to a trust fund established for purposes of establishing a \nPresidential library for that President after his or her term has \nexpired; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this legislation follows consideration by \nthe Judiciary Committee of the pardons issued by former President \nClinton on January 20, the last day of his administration, and seeks to \nreform and correct a couple of major gaps which are present in existing \nprocedures in two respects; stated succinctly, to require that \nlobbyists, such as Jack Quinn, be required to register and that \ncontributions to Presidential libraries be subject to public \ndisclosure.\n  I offer this legislation on behalf of myself, Senators Leahy, Hatch, \nKohl, Biden, Feinstein, Sessions, Grassley, and Clinton.\n  The public record is filled with the details as to what happened with \nthe notorious pardon of Marc Rich, who was a fugitive for some 17 \nyears, where a pardon was granted at the very last minute without the \npardon attorney at the Department of Justice being informed of the \nsituation until 1 a.m. on January 20.\n  When the pardon attorney called the White House to try to get some \ninformation about Marc Rich and Pincus Green, he was told that they \nwere ``traveling abroad.''\n  When the pardon attorney testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing \nunder my questioning, and testified that they were ``traveling \nabroad,'' he about broke up the hearing room, for that characterization \nto be made of someone who had been a fugitive for 17 years.\n  In granting the pardon, former President Clinton notified Ms. Beth \nDozoretz, who was very active in lobbying for the pardon, at 11 o'clock \non January 19, some 2 hours in advance of telling the pardon attorney, \nand there had been extensive lobbying by Ms. Denise Rich, the former \nwife of Marc Rich.\n  The legislation we are introducing will require that someone such as \nJack Quinn be registered as a lobbyist.\n  Without going into the details--and they are set forth in the \nJudiciary Committee hearing--there were major efforts made to keep this \nactivity under the so-called radar screen so that nobody would know \nabout it.\n  This legislation would require someone in Jack Quinn's position to \nregister and be known publicly, and then with the kind of public \npressure which would be brought, I think it highly likely that a pardon \nsuch as that granted to Marc Rich would never have been granted.\n  The second provision deals with contributions for pledges or \ncommitments to raise money for Presidential libraries. This legislation \nprovides that there should be public disclosure of those contributions, \npledges, or commitments to raise money, where those pledges or \ncommitments are made during the term of office.\n  A pledge to contribute money to a Presidential library has a great \nmany of the same characteristics as a campaign contribution. The \nquestion is raised about whether or not there is favoritism or \ninfluence sought from that kind of a monetary contribution. By having \nthe public disclosure, then it would be within public view.\n  That is the essence of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry into the \npardons and commutations issued by former President Clinton on January \n20, 2001, has disclosed major gaps which can be addressed through \nlegislation. Today I am introducing a bill to address two of these \nsubjects.\n  My bill requires individuals who urge officials in the White House to \ngrant clemency to register as lobbyists. There is currently no \nrequirement for them to do so. This bill will also require the \ndisclosure of donations or pledges of $5,000 or more, or commitments to \nraise $5,000 or more for presidential libraries while the President is \nstill in office. Such donations, pledges or commitments are not \ncurrently subject to disclosure, creating a situation where individuals \ncould make large contributions to the President's library foundation in \nthe hope of influencing favorable action by the President.\n  The Senate investigation of the pardons matter has been forward-\nlooking from the beginning. The objective of the inquiry was to get the \nfacts out in the open. Once the facts were known, the question was \nwhether legislative remedies were appropriate.\n  This legislation does not deal with the President's power to grant \nexecutive clemency since any changes in that power would require a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Former President Jimmy Carter called the pardon of fugitive \ncommodities trader Marc Rich ``disgraceful,'' and Democratic \nRepresentative Henry Waxman said that ``the failures in the pardon \nprocess should embarrass every Democrat and every American.'' The \noutrage over former President Clinton's last minute pardons is bi-\npartisan, and I expect there will be bi-partisan support for this \nlegislation to fix the problems disclosed by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee inquiry.\n  The pardons of Marc Rich and Pincus Green have sparked the most \npublic\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\noutrage, and rightly so. The actions of Hugh Rodham, who took more than \n$400,000 for his limited work on the clemency requests for Almon Glenn \nBraswell and Carlos Vignali, Jr., and Roger Clinton, who is reportedly \nunder investigation for trying to peddle access to the White House in \nrelation to pardons, are similarly outrageous. There are undoubtedly \nothers who made money from the pardons process, or at least tried to do \nso. But let us at least identify them as what they are--lobbyists. When \nyou get paid money, in some of these cases, lots of money, to argue for \na pardon because you know the President of the United States, or \nsomeone like a relative who is close to the President, what you are \ndoing is lobbying. Shining sunlight on the activities of these pardon \nlobbyists will further the cause of good government.\n  In a February 18, 2001 op-ed in the New York Times, former President \nClinton said that he had decided to grant Rich and Green clemency for a \nnumber of legal and foreign policy reasons, but it's hard to see how \nthe facts of the case add up to a pardon. Rich fled to Switzerland in \n1983, shortly before he was indicted on 65 counts of racketeering, tax \nevasion, mail fraud, wire fraud, violation of Department of Energy \nregulations, and trading with the enemy. Then he tried to renounce his \ncitizenship. Although he could afford the best lawyers in the business, \nRich refused to return to the United States to plead his case in court. \nAt the time of his pardon, he was still listed on the Justice \nDepartment's list of top international fugitives. Over the course of \nseventeen years and three administrations, Rich repeatedly tried to get \nthe Justice Department to offer him a deal on favorable terms. When \nthat failed, he orchestrated a plan last year to get a grant of \nexecutive clemency to wipe out the charges against him so he would \nnever even have to stand trial. In the end, Mr. Rich got his pardon, \nbut the way he got it shows the need for requiring pardon lobbyists to \nregister.\n  In late 2000, after failing to get the Southern District of New York \nto make a deal that didn't involve any jail time for Rich and Green, \nthe Rich legal team began seriously pursuing a pardon strategy. There \nis some disagreement on the timing of the decision to seek a pardon, \nbut the important point is that, once the decision was made to take the \ncase to the White House, the Rich legal team wanted to keep their \nactivities out of public view so the Southern District of New York, or \nsomeone else who would oppose the pardon, wouldn't weigh in and scotch \nthe deal.\n\n  There is some evidence that the Rich legal team was considering \nseeking a pardon as early as March, 1999. A log from the law firm of \nArnold and Porter cites a March 12, 1999, memorandum from Carol Fischer \nto Robert Fink, one of Mr. Rich's lawyers. The document is titled \n``Legal Research re: Pardon Power.'' Clearly there was some \nconsideration of seeking a pardon, or there wouldn't have been a need \nto do research on the pardon power.\n  On February 10, 2000, Robert Fink wrote an e-mail to Avner Azulay, \nwho works for Mr. Rich in Israel. Fink told Azulay that the latest \nefforts to make a deal with the Southern District of New York had \nfailed because the Department of Justice would not negotiate unless Mr. \nRich returned to the United States to face the charges. Azulay replied \nthe same day, saying that ``The present impasse leaves us with only one \nother option: the unconventional approach which has not yet been tried \nand which I have been proposing all along.''\n  There is also a March 20, 2000 e-mail from Azulay to Fink. In this e-\nmail, Azulay tells Fink that ``We are reverting to the idea discussed \nwith Abe which is to send DR [Denise Rich] on a ``personal'' mission to \nNO1. [undoubtedly President Clinton] with a well prepared script.''\n  Mr. Quinn has testified that the idea of a pardon did not receive \nserious consideration until late in the year, but these e-mails raise \nquestions about that assertion. Under ordinary circumstances, it would \nbe of no interest when the Rich team made a decision to seek a pardon, \nbut it is important in this case because there are other e-mails \nshowing that they tried very hard to keep their efforts secret. For \nexample, in a December 26, 2000 e-mail, Fink told Quinn that ``Frankly, \nI think we benefit from not having the existence of the petition known, \nand do not want to contact people who are unlikely to really make a \ndifference but who could create press or other exposure.''\n  Later, in a January 9, 2001, e-mail, Quinn told Fink, ``I think we've \nbenefitted from being under the press radar. Podesta said as much.'' \nHow did they benefit? They benefitted by not having the U.S. Attorney \nfrom the Southern District of New York weigh in with the White House, \nby not having the kind of scrutiny from the press that the case has had \nsince January. Does anyone seriously believe that former President \nClinton would have granted this pardon if the story had broken, with \nall the details out in the open, in early January instead of after the \npardon was already a done deal? Of course not. Jack Quinn counted on \nbeing under the radar, and it worked.\n  This legislation will make it harder for the Jack Quinn's of the \nfuture to stay under the radar. When pardon lobbyists are required to \nregister, they won't be able to hide their actions until it is too late \nfor anyone to act. If Jack Quinn had been required to register as a \nlobbyist when he started urging officials at the White House to grant \nclemency to Rich and Green, the chances are good that this story would \nhave had a different ending.\n  This legislation would also cover the activities of Hugh Rodham, who \nmade more than $400,000 working to get clemency for Almon Glenn \nBraswell and Carlos Vignali, Jr. Mr. Braswell is the subject of an \nongoing investigation related to allegations of tax evasion, and \nclearly should not have been granted a pardon. Mr. Vignali was one of \nthe top members of a drug smuggling organization that shipped more than \n800 pounds of cocaine from the Los Angeles area to Minnesota. He was \nnot a likely candidate to have his sentence commuted, and the Pardon \nAttorney reportedly recommended that the request be denied. Several of \nthe members of the drug ring who had smaller roles that Vignali did are \nstill sitting in jail.\n\n  But Carlos Vignali got a pardon. Hugh Rodham's role should have been \nsubject to public disclosure since he had close family ties to the \nWhite House, reportedly lived at the White House for the last several \nweeks of the Clinton Administration and had documents shipped to \nhimself there.\n  Roger Clinton was also reportedly involved in several attempts to get \npaid for getting pardons for his friends. This matter, like several \nothers, is reportedly being investigated by the U.S. Attorney for the \nSouthern District of New York. It remains to be seen what she will \nfind, but we don't have to wait for the end of her investigation to \nknow that if an individual trades on his access to the White House to \nmake money, that's lobbying, and he or she should be required to \nregister as a lobbyist.\n  The second part of this bill requires the public disclosure of \ndonations or pledges of $5,000 or more, or commitments to raise $5,000 \nor more for presidential libraries while the president is still in \noffice. There are presently no requirements to make such donations \npublic, and the Clinton library foundation has resisted efforts to \nreview it's donor list.\n  Presidential libraries are a relatively new phenomenon, with only ten \nof them in existence. Under current law, presidential libraries are \nbuilt with private funds, then turned over to the National Archivist \nfor operation. Amendments to the Presidential Libraries Act have \nmandated the establishment of an endowment to cover some of the costs \nof operating the library. These goals are usually met through the \nestablishment of a charitable organization, a 501(c)(3) corporation.\n  Former Presidents Carter and Bush did not raise any money for their \nlibraries while they were in office because they were concentrating on \ngetting re-elected. Because both of these Presidents lost their re-\nelection bids, they never faced a situation of having to raise money \nfor a library while they were still in office.\n  Former Presidents Reagan and Clinton, as two term Presidents, began \nraising money for their libraries during their second terms. Officials \nfrom the Reagan library have said that the library fund received \nseveral large contributions from corporate donors while\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nformer President Reagan was still in office, but the big corporate \ndonations tailed off rapidly when the President left office.\n  It is not necessary to suggest that there was any wrongdoing on the \npart of former President Reagan or of former President Clinton to \nrealize that a donor could make a large donations to a presidential \nlibrary in the hope of receiving a favorable action from the President \nin exchange for the donation. The fact that these donations can be made \nwithout public disclosure makes them a matter of even greater concern.\n  The Rich case highlights the need for public disclosure of donations \nwhile the President is still in office. Denise Rich, Marc Rich's former \nwife, was deeply involved in trying to get a pardon for Rich. She also \ngave at least $450,000 to former President Clinton's library \nfoundation. Beth Dozoretz, former finance chair of the Democratic \nNational Committee who pledged to raise $1 million for the Clinton \nlibrary, also worked on the Rich pardon.\n  Ms. Dozoretz's involvement in the Rich case is remarkable in that the \nformer President spent far more time talking to her about it than he \ndid talking to the prosecutors in the Southern district of New York. \nMs. Dozoretz had at least three conversations with former President \nClinton about the Rich pardon, including one at 11 p.m. on January 19, \n2001, the night before the pardon was actually issued.\n  Ms. Dozoretz had been scheduled to meet with my staff, but she \nchanged attorneys and declined to be interviewed. But we found out that \nshe had called the President on the night of January 19, at about 11 \nP.M. to thank him for granting the pardon for Marc Rich. If Ms. \nDozoretz knew of the Rich pardon in time to call the President at 11 \nP.M. on the evening of January 19, she found out about the decision at \nleast two hours before Pardon Attorney Roger Adams, the official who \nwas charged with actually writing up the pardon warrant. Mr. Adams \ntestified that he had not heard that Rich and Green were being \nconsidered for clemency until almost 1 A.M. on the morning of January \n20. Mr. Adams was told by the White House counsel's office that there \nprobably wouldn't be much information available on Rich and Green \nbecause they had been ``living abroad'' for several years. That was a \nstrange way of saying they were fugitives, but Mr. Adams was later able \nto figure that out himself. He had his staff research the Internet to \nsee what he could learn about these two men, and he learned that they \nwere on the Justice Department's list of most wanted international \nfugitives. When he relayed his concerns to the White House, he was told \nto prepare the pardon documents anyway.\n  Ms. Dozoretz has refused to say from whom she learned that the \nPresident had decided to grant Rich's clemency request, but she \napparently knew before the official who was charged with overseeing the \npardon process. Ms. Dozoretz has asserted her privelege against self-\nincrimination under the Fifth Amendment, so we have no way of knowing \nexactly how she learned that the decision had already been made on \nJanuary 19.\n  But we do have other relevant information. First, Beth Dozoretz \npledged to raise $1 million for the Clinton library. Former President \nClinton spoke to Ms. Dozoretz on January 10, 2001, when she was with \nMs. Rich in Aspen. According to a January 10, 2001, e-mail from Robert \nFink to Jack Quinn, Ms. Dozoretz received a phone call from POTUS, the \nPresident, on January 10. Mr. Fink went on to quote former President \nClinton as saying ``that he wants to do it and is doing all possible to \nturn around the WH counsels.'' Ms. Dozoretz has denied saying that the \nPresident was trying to turn around the WH [White House] counsels, but \nshe has not offered any explanation for what happened. It has been \nasserted that the message was garbled, but that explanation is \ninconsistent with the facts. All of former President Clinton's top \nadvisers in the White House--including his Chief of Staff, John \nPodesta; his White House Counsel, Beth Nolan; and Bruce Lindsey, one of \nhis closest political advisers who held the title of Assistant to the \nPresident--looked at the facts and recommended against a pardon. That \nis consistent with the former President having to turn around his White \nHouse counsels.\n  Former President Clinton was unable to turn around his counsels, but \nin the end it didn't matter. He issued the pardons anyway, and created \na firestorm. When a President ignores the advice of his closest \nadvisors, there isn't much we can do since the power of executive \nclemency is in the hands of the President alone. But the Congress can \nand should ensure that bad judgement on the part of a President does \nnot undermine the public's confidence in government. The two provisions \nin this legislation will help to restore public confidence in the \npardon process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DISCLOSURE OF LOBBYING ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO \n                   PRESIDENTIAL PARDONS.\n\n       Section 3(8) of the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (2 \n     U.S.C. 1602(8)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A)--\n       (A) in clause (iii), by striking ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in clause (iv), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) the issuance of a grant of executive clemency in the \n     form of a pardon, commutation of sentence, reprieve, or \n     remission of fine.''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)(xii), by striking ``made to'' and \n     inserting ``except as provided in subparagraph (A)(v), made \n     to''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1978.\n\n       Section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (5 \n     U.S.C. App) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) If the reporting individual is the President and is \n     currently serving as the President, the identity of the \n     source, a brief description, and the value of all gifts, \n     pledges, or commitments of a gift aggregating $5000 or more \n     for the establishment of a Presidential library for that \n     President after his or her term has expired received from any \n     source other than a relative of the President during the \n     preceding calendar year. Information required to be reported \n     under this paragraph shall be made publicly available in \n     accordance with this Act.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania to introduce legislation aimed at making our government \nmore open and accountable to the American people. We are pleased to be \njoined by six other members of the Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch, \nKohl, Biden, Feinstein, Sessions, Grassley, and by the new junior \nSenator from New York, Senator Clinton.\n  Our bill closes two loopholes in the laws governing what government \nofficials and those who lobby them must disclose. First, it amends the \nEthics in Government Act of 1978 to require the President to report any \ngifts or pledges of $5,000 or more to a presidential library during the \nPresident's term in office. Second, it adds to the list of individuals \nwho must register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 those who \nlobby on behalf of a client for a grant of executive clemency.\n  This legislation builds on a hearing held by the Judiciary Committee \non February 14, 2001, relating to the pardons granted by President \nClinton in his last days in office. I said then that we needed to view \nthese pardons as a whole and in their historical and constitutional \ncontext, not focus exclusively on one or two controversial cases. In \nthis way, we could learn valuable lessons for the future.\n  The legislation that we introduce today is a pragmatic and forward-\nlooking response to customs and practices that long predate the last \nAdministration. As I have noted before, the controversies surrounding \nPresident Clinton's pardons are not unique.\n  Other presidents raised substantial funds for their libraries while \nstill in office. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation opened its \ndoors and began fundraising in February 1985, nearly four years before \nPresident Reagan left office. By November 1991, the Foundation had \nraised between $45 and $65 million. Much of that amount came in large \nlump sums from big corporations, a source of funding that reportedly \ndried up when President Reagan returned to private life.\n  Fund raising for the Bush library also began while the president was \nstill\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nin the White House. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, in an article dated \nMay 25, 1997, quoted former Bush aide Jim Cicconi as saying that fund \nraising for the library remained ``low key'' and ``very discreet'' \nuntil the president left office in 1993. Established in 1991, while the \npresident was campaigning for reelection, the George Bush Presidential \nLibrary Foundation initially consisted of three people, including Mr. \nCicconi and the president's son, George W. Bush.\n  I should add that the donor lists for the Reagan and Bush libraries \nwere not and have never been disclosed to the public, a failure of \ntransparency for which President Clinton, but not his predecessors, has \nbeen roundly criticized.\n  President Clinton was also not the first Chief Executive to grant \nclemency to friends or family members of major contributors. The very \nfirst pardon granted by the elder President Bush went to Armand Hammer, \nthe late chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, who pleaded \nguilty in 1975 to making illegal contributions to Richard Nixon's \nreelection campaign. Not long before he received his pardon, Hammer \ngave over $100,000 to the Republican party and another $100,000 to the \nBush-Quayle Inaugural Committee. The team of lawyers that won Hammer \nhis pardon included former Reagan Justice Department official, Theodore \nOlson. While Mr. Olson's name is well-known now, he was recently \nnominated to be Solicitor General, it was more important at the time \nthat he was a close friend of C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel, \nand Richard Thornburgh, the Attorney General.\n  Let me note one more example from the end of the first Bush \nAdministration: In January 1993, two days before leaving the White \nHouse, President Bush pardoned Edwin Cox, Jr., the son of a wealthy \nTexas oilman. The Cox pardon was lobbied for by Bill Clements, the \nformer governor of Texas, who contacted James Baker, then White House \nChief of Staff. Not surprisingly, Mr. Baker mentioned the Cox family \nlargesse in a note to the White House Counsel, referencing Edwin Cox \nSr. as a ``longtime supporter of the president's.'' The Cox family had \nin fact contributed nearly $200,000 to the Bush family's political \ncampaigns and to other Republican campaign committees. Shortly after \nthe president pardoned his son, Cox Sr. made a generous contribution to \nthe Bush Presidential Library. His name is now etched in gold on the \nexterior of the Library alongside the names of other ``benefactors,'' \nthose contributing between $100,000 and $250,000.\n  I mention these Bush-era pardons because they demonstrate that \npardons which have become controversial and appear improper given the \nconfluence of insider lobbying and financial contributions are not \nunique to the end of President Clinton's term in office. The bill we \nintroduce today will bring a greater degree of transparency into the \nclemency process and so reduce the appearance of impropriety that may \notherwise attach to a presidential pardon.\n  I thank Senator Specter for the thoughtful and even-handed manner in \nwhich he conducted the Committee's hearing last month, and commend him \nfor seeking constructive and bipartisan solutions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD.\n  S. 646. A bill to reform the Army Corps of Engineers; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Corps of \nEngineers Reform Act of 2001. I am joined today in this effort by my \ncolleague in the other body, Congressman Ron Kind.\n  As I introduce this bill, I realize that it is a work in progress. \nReforming the Corps of Engineers will be a difficult task for Congress. \nIt involves restoring credibility and accountability to a federal \nagency rocked by recent scandals, and yet an agency that we in \nWisconsin, and many states across the country, have come to rely upon. \nFrom the Great Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps is involved \nin providing aids to navigation, environmental remediation, water \ncontrol and a variety of other services to my state. My office has \nstrong working relationships with the Detroit, Rock Island, and St. \nPaul District Offices that service Wisconsin, and I want the cloud over \nthe Corps to dissipate so that the Corps can continue to contribute to \nour environment and our economy.\n  This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an \namendment last year to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to \ncreate independent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. My \ninterest in an independent review amendment was shared by the Minority \nLeader, Mr. Daschle, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and a \nnumber of taxpayer and environmental organizations including: the \nLeague of Conservation Voters, American Rivers, Coast Alliance, \nEarthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Izaak Walton League of America, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and Taxpayers for Common \nSense.\n  In response to my initiative, the bill's managers, Senator Smith and \nSenator Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their Manager's Package \nwhich should help get the Authorizing Committee, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the additional information it needs to develop \nand refine legislation on this issue through a one year study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, NAS, on peer review. As part of the \ndiscussions with the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, over the amendment I intended to \noffer, they have agreed that as the NAS conducts its review, they will \nhold hearings on the issue of Corps reform and on this bill. It is my \nhope that through hearings the NAS study and my bill can dovetail \nnicely so that we have a fully vetted bill which can then be fine-tuned \nby the NAS recommendations. I feel that this body should pass a serious \nreform bill this year.\n  The bill I introduce today addresses more than the issue of \nindependent review of Corps Projects. The bill is a comprehensive \nrevision of the project review and authorization procedures at the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers. The aim is to increase transparency and \naccountability, to ensure fiscal responsibility, to balance economic \nand environmental interests, and to allow greater stakeholder \ninvolvement.\n  The National Research Council recently completed a study of the \nCorps' analysis of a proposed extension of several locks on the Upper \nMississippi River, Illinois Waterway after approximately $50 million \nwas spent examining the feasibility of the proposed project. The \nNational Research Council made several recommendations to revise the \ninland waterway and water resources system planning. And, as I \nmentioned, a second National Research Council study, required by the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000, is now examining whether the \nCorps should establish a program of independent review of projects.\n  This bill builds on the key recommendations of the National Research \nCouncil study:\n  The Corps should have project review by an interdisciplinary group of \nexperts outside the Corps of Engineers,\n  The Corps should include a broader range of stakeholders in the \nplanning process,\n  The Corps should revise the water resources project planning \nframework in their internal planning documents (known as the Principles \nand Guidelines) so that ecological concerns are not considered \nsecondary to economic benefits.\n  The bill achieves this by creating both Stakeholder Advisory \nCommittees and Independent Review Panels. Currently, the Corps goes \nthrough a multi-step process leading to project approval and \nconstruction. In the existing process, the public has limited \ninvolvement and environmental costs can be underestimated.\n  Stakeholder Advisory Committees--comprised of a balance of local \ngovernment, other federal agencies, interest groups reflecting social, \neconomic, and environmental interests, and interested private \ncitizens--are authorized to provide input in the planning process. The \nCorps is required to form a Committee under the bill upon receipt of a \nwritten request to the Corps by any person to do so. The Committee is \ncomprised of volunteers, and is allowed to provide input to the Corps \nbeginning in the early project stages, such as the drafting of a \nfeasibility study for a project, and conclude at the release of a draft \nenvironmental impact statement when the broader public is\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nbrought into the project. The Corps is also restricted so that they can \nspend no more than on the staffing or operations of $250,000 a \nCommittee. In addition, Committee meetings must meet the requirements \nof the Federal Advisory Committee Act, FACA. Any Committee expenses are \nto be considered as part of the total costs of the project.\n  The bill also provides a comprehensive review of water resources \nprojects by a panel with expertise in biology, engineering and \neconomics. The projects that will become subject to review include any \nprojects, or significant modifications to existing projects:\n\n       with an estimated cost of over $25 million (approximately \n     40 percent of the projects funded through the Water Resources \n     Development Act),\n       for which the Governor of an affected State requests \n     independent review,\n       that are determined to have significant adverse impacts on \n     fish and wildlife after implementation of proposed mitigation \n     plans by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, For which the head \n     of another Federal Agency charged with reviewing the \n     project determines that the project has a significant \n     adverse impact on environmental, cultural, or other \n     resources under their jurisdiction, or\n       Determined by the Corps to be ``controversial'' in its \n     scope, impact, or cost-benefit analysis.\n\n  To address concerns that the Independent Review Panel needs to be \ntruly independent, the Office of Independent Review is established \nwithin the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Works. This \noffice, located in the Pentagon, provides the greatest amount of \nindependence for the review process since the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary is separate from and above the Chief of Engineers who runs \nthe Corps. Independent reviews are required to be completed in 180 days \nafter they start. They are able to run concurrently with the \nEnvironmental Impact Statement Process under NEPA, and, ideally, will \nconform to that time frame.\n  As with the Stakeholder Committees, the costs of these Panels are \ncapped at no more than $500,000. Any panel expenses are to be \nconsidered as part of the total costs of the project and a Panel's \nproduct is required to be released to the public and to be submitted to \nCongress.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will increase transparency of the \nCorps' decision-making process through greater accessibility by the \npublic and interested stakeholder groups. While there are heartening \nsigns of reform in the Corps Civil Works program, Congress should be \nworking to create an independent process to help affirm when the Corps \ngets it right and help to provide a means for identifying problems \nbefore taxpayer funded construction investments are made. Today we \nbegin that work in earnest.\n  I feel that this bill is a practical first step down the road to a \nreformed Corps of Engineers. Independent review would catch mistakes by \nCorps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps officials to \njustify questionable projects, and would provide planners desperately \nneeded support against the never ending pressure of project boosters. \nThose boosters, Mr. President, include Congressional interests, which \nis why I believe that this body needs to champion reform--to end the \nperception that Corps projects are all pork and no substance.\n  I wish it were the case, that I could argue that additional oversight \nwere not needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is need for \nadditional scrutiny. In the Upper Mississippi there is troubling \nevidence of abuse. There is troubling evidence from whistleblowers that \nsenior Corps officials, under pressure from barge interests, ordered \ntheir subordinates to exaggerate demand for barges in order to justify \nnew Mississippi River locks. This is a matter which is still under \ninvestigation, and I hope that no evidence of wrongdoing will \nultimately be found. Adequate assessment of the environmental impacts \nof barges is also very important. I am also concerned that the Corps' \nassessment of the environmental impacts of additional barges does not \nadequately assess the impacts of barge movements on fish, backwaters \nand aquatic plants. We should not gamble with the environmental health \nof the river. If we allow more barges on the Mississippi, we must be \nsure the environmental impacts of those barges are fully mitigated.\n  I am raising this issue principally because I believe that Congress \nshould act to restore trust in the Corps if we are effectively going to \naddress navigation and environmental needs. The first step in restoring \nthat trust is restoring the credibility of the Corps' decision-making \nprocess.\n  Unfortunately, Congress now finds itself having to reset the scales \nto make economic benefits and environmental restoration co-equal goals \nof project planning. Our rivers serve many masters, barge owners as \nwell as bass fisherman, and the Corps' planning process should reflect \nthe diverse demands we place on them. I want to make sure that future \nCorps projects no longer fail to produce predicted benefits, stop \ncosting more than the Corps estimated, and do not have unanticipated \nenvironmental impacts. This bill will help us monitor the result of \nprojects so that we can learn from our mistakes and, when possible, \ncorrect them. As a first step, I have committed myself to making Corps \nreform a priority in this Congress with this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify provisions relating to the Gun-Free Schools \nAct; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Dorgan and I are \nintroducing a bill to make four important changes to the current Gun-\nFree Schools Act, GFSA.\n  I am a proud sponsor of the Gun-Free Schools Act, which was enacted \nas part of the Elementary-Secondary Education Act in 1994. The law \nrequires states receiving federal elementary-secondary education funds \nto have a state law requiring local school districts to expel from \nschool for a period of not less than one year students who bring \nweapons to school.\n  A March report (ED-OIG/S03-A0018) prepared by the Inspector General, \nIG, of the U.S. Department of Education, highlights several \nimprovements needed to clarify the law. This bill makes those important \nclarifications.\n  The IG's report, called a ``perspective paper,'' resulted from an \naudit that Senator Dorgan and I requested to examine the enforcement of \nthe GFSA in seven States.\n  We live in a society today that is much different than when I grew \nup. Our nation is awash in guns and our children live in a culture of \nviolence, bombarded by horrific images in movies, television, and video \ngames. Combine these factors with a lack of parental supervision and \nthis combustible mix has exploded again and again on too many school \ncampuses.\n  In just the last few weeks alone, we've seen this mix erupt within \njust a few miles of each other in the San Diego area.\n  On March 5, a troubled young man named Charles ``Andy'' Williams \nbrought a .22-caliber revolver to school, fired at random, killing two \nstudents and wounding 13 others at Santana High School, in Santee, \nCalifornia. And on March 22, an eighteen year-old shot five students at \nGranite Hill High School in El Cajon, California. Fortunately, in this \ncase, no one was killed.\n  The Los Angeles Times summed up this epidemic aptly on March 6 and \ncalled on public officials to act, saying ``Nothing of course, assures \nthat tragedy can be prevented, but leaders from the classroom to the \nWhite House can clearly take more steps to promote school safety.''\n  Now I know that gun laws are not the only answer to solving this \nproblem, but they do represent part of the answer. But the fact is that \neven the most simple, rational, and targeted\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nmeasures to deter guns from falling into the hands of our young people \nhave been cast aside.\n  The fact is that there are some simple steps we can take to limit the \nnumber of guns from reaching our children. We can close the loophole on \nthe importation of high capacity ammunition clips. We can include \ntrigger locks on every gun purchased.\n  And we need to continue with measures that are working. The Gun Free \nSchools Act is a targeted fix that is working. And the bill we are \nintroducing today refines this law slightly to make it work even \nbetter.\n  This legislation will close several loopholes in current law under \nwhich allows some students to escape punishment who bring guns to \nschool.\n  Because the law effectively imposes a one-year expulsion for students \nwho have ``brought'' a weapon to school, students who ``have'' or \n``possess'' a weapon in school can go ``scot-free.''\n  Under current law, for example, a student could use a firearm that \nwas technically ``brought'' to school by another student. The student \ncould then possess it in his or her backpack or locker and thus \npotentially make it available to others and go unpunished because he or \nshe did not technically ``bring'' it to school.\n  Another loophole that the bill addresses is the definition of school. \nThe current prohibition on guns in schools applies to ``a school.'' \nThis could be interpreted to mean literally the school building.\n  Our bill clarifies that school means ``any setting that is under the \ncontrol and supervision of the local education agency'', i.e., the \nschool district. Without this change, a student could wield a firearm \non the football field, on the school bus or in the parking lot and \npossibly evade punishment under this law.\n  Here are the four changes made by this bill: Under the current law, \nstates are required to have a law requiring a one-year expulsion of \nstudents who have ``brought a weapon to a school'' in order to receive \nfederal education funds.\n  The change our bill proposes is to add to current law, ``or to have \npossessed a firearm.'' We are proposing this change because punishing \nonly people who ``bring'' a weapon to school leaves a glaring loophole \nin the law.\n  Without this change, students who ask friends to bring a weapon to \nschool or who obtain a weapon from someone who has ``brought'' it to \nschool, but carry it around or use the weapon, would not be covered \nsince current law uses the term ``brought.'' Current law could be \ninterpreted to mean that students can have a gun at school as long as \nthey do not actually ``bring'' it into the school. I believe this \nchange is an important clarification.\n  The IG's report says that without this change, states and school \ndistricts may ``incorrectly implement the Act, resulting in non-\ncompliance or the submission of erroneous information on disciplinary \nactions under the Act.'' This is because current law does not ``specify \nexpulsion as the consequence for students found in possession of a \nfirearm.''\n  Under current law, school districts and states are required to report \nexpulsions. They are, however, required to report incidents. An example \nof this would be when students bring a weapon to or possess weapons in \nschools, for which no disciplinary action is taken.\n  Without reporting all incidents in which students have or possess \nweapons in schools, it is impossible to determine if school officials \nare in fact enforcing the law, if they are actually expelling students.\n  The IG's audit cites an example at one Maryland school in which a \nstudent who brought a firearm to school was not expelled. Instead, the \nschool's administrators allowed the student to withdraw from school and \nthe school did not inform the school district of the incident. Police \narrested the student. So action was taken, but the incident itself did \nnot appear in the annual report because technically the student was not \nexpelled.\n  Similarly, the IG found that in one California district, school \nofficials did not expel a student ``involved in a firearm incident'' \nbecause the student was arrested and did not return to school.\n  In these cases, the students did face legal consequences for their \naction, but the weapons incidents were not reflected in the school's \nreport because the law requires reporting only expulsions, not \nincidents.\n  The bill would add several new reporting requirements. School \ndistricts and states would have to report, 1. all firearms incidents; \n2. each modification of an expulsion, e.g., when an administrator \nshortens an expulsion, which is allowed under current law; and 3. the \nlevel of education in which the incident occurs, elementary, middle, \nhigh school.\n  Only by thorough reporting can public officials, the Department of \nEducation, and the Congress know how well the law is working and how \neffectively it is being enforced.\n  These proposed changes should remedy that deficiency.\n  There are two additional changes we are proposing based on the IG's \nwork. The Department of Education has incorporated these two changes in \ntheir guidance to states and school districts, but I believe these \nchanges should be codified in the law so they cannot be changed \nadministratively.\n  The prohibition on weapons in ``school'' applies ``to a school,'' \nwhich implies that this means the building only. For many years, the \nU.S. Department of Education interpreted this to mean the school \nbuildings only.\n  Under that approach, therefore, a student could bring a weapon to \nschool and leave it in an unlocked car, where it would still be readily \navailable to students throughout the school day.\n  Interpreted strictly to mean ``school buildings,'' that policy also \nallowed guns on athletic fields, in equipment sheds, and in school \nyards. As one Virginia legislator put it, ``you could legally come to a \nPTA meeting packing a weapon.''\n  Fortunately, the Department has corrected its guidance to school \ndistricts to clarify that the prohibition on bringing guns to schools \napplies to the entire school campus. The guidance states, ``The one-\nyear expulsion requirement applies to students who bring weapons to any \nsetting that is under the control and supervision of the local \neducation agency.''\n  Under our bill, weapons would be allowed to be kept in cars and \ntrucks on school property only if the weapons are ``lawfully stored \ninside a locked vehicle on school property.'' This provision is an \neffort to recognize that in some communities students may go hunting \ndirectly after school.\n  Under current law, the chief school administrator in a school \ndistrict can modify an expulsion on a case-by-case basis.\n  Our bill would require that all modifications be put in writing. The \nIG found inconsistent reporting of modifications. This change should \nestablish one consistent, clear policy and should provide a record of \nexpulsions that are modified.\n  Guns have no place in schools. Congress made this clear in 1994 when \nwe adopted the Gun-Free Schools Act.\n  This is a good law that should remain in place. The bill we introduce \ntoday makes some important clarifications in that law and strengthens \nit.\n  The latest Annual Report on School Safety reports that 3,930 students \nwere expelled for bringing a firearm to school. One student is one too \nmany, in my view.\n  The latest incidents in California are but another disturbing \nreminder of the ``culture of violence'' that so pervades our society. \nAll of us must ask why students resort to guns to deal with their \ngrievances or vent their frustrations. Clearly, we must take strong \nsteps to address the underlying societal issues and to get guns out of \nthe hands of youngsters.\n  This bill is one small, yet important, step to ensure that no more \nschoolchildren die from weapons violence. I urge my colleagues to enact \nthis bill promptly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              The Gun-Free Schools Refinement Act--Summary\n\n       Amendments to the current Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994. \n     These changes are based on the March 2001 report of the U.S. \n     Department of Education's Inspector General (ED-OIG/S03-\n     A0018).\n\n\n                        1. ``Brought a Weapon''\n\n       Current law: Requires states to have a law requiring a one-\n     year expulsion of students who have ``brought a weapon to a \n     school.''\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\n       Proposed Change: Adds ``or possessed a weapon.''\n\n\n                        2. Entire School Campus\n\n       Current law: The prohibition on bringing a weapon to school \n     applies ``to a school.''\n       Proposed Change: Clarifies that the prohibition on bringing \n     guns to schools applies to entire school, specifically ``any \n     setting that is under the control and supervision of the \n     local education agency,'' unless a gun is lawfully locked in \n     a vehicle.\n\n\n                   3. Report Incidents, Modifications\n\n       Current Law: Requires only reporting of expulsions.\n       Proposed Changes: Requires the reporting of--\n       1. All weapons incidents;\n       2. Each modification of an expulsion (e.g., when an \n     administrator shortens an expulsion); and\n       3. The level of education in which the incident occurs \n     (elementary, middle, high school).\n\n\n                      4. Modifications in Writing\n\n       Current Law: Allows states' laws to allow the chief \n     administering officer of a school district to modify one-year \n     expulsions on a case-by-case basis.\n       Proposed Change: Requires that all modifications of \n     expulsions be put in writing.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Feinstein in \nintroducing the Gun-Free Schools Refinement Act. As my colleagues may \nremember, Senator Feinstein and I were the principal authors of the \nGun-Free Schools Act of 1994, and as a result of this law, more than \n13,000 students have been expelled from school between 1996 and 1999 \nfor bringing a gun to school. That is more than 13,000 potential \ntragedies that have been avoided because we as a nation adopted a \n``zero tolerance'' policy toward bringing a weapon into our school \nclassrooms and hallways.\n  Despite the Gun-Free Schools Act, however, school shootings still \noccasionally occur, and even one of these incidents is too many. That's \nwhy, nearly two years ago, Senator Feinstein and I asked the Department \nof Education Inspector General to conduct a review of the Gun-Free \nSchools Act to ensure that states and local school districts are \nvigorously enforcing this important law.\n  The Inspector General completed this review and issued her final \nreport in February, 2001. Fortunately, the IG found no evidence that \nstates or school districts were intentionally ignoring instances where \nstudents brought weapons to schools. However, while we were glad to \nlearn that schools are generally trying to comply with the spirit of \nthe law, the IG did find some instances where schools and states have \nnot complied with the letter of the law. This may result in uneven \nenforcement of the Gun-Free Schools Act. Therefore, the IG recommended \nin March that Congress consider making a number of technical changes to \nthe Gun-Free Schools Act to clarify areas of the statute where schools \nwere confused about what was required in the enforcement of their \n``zero tolerance'' policies.\n  The Gun-Free Schools Refinement Act would make four changes to the \n1994 law: First, this legislation clarifies that the law applies to \nstudents who ``possess'' a gun in school, not just those who \n``brought'' a weapon to school, as the law currently reads. A common-\nsense interpretation of the law would compel schools to expel students \nwho possess firearms in school, even if they were not the ones who \nphysically brought the guns there. This change merely codifies a \ncommon-sense reading of the law so that it applies to students who \neither bring or possess a weapon at school.\n  Second, this bill clarifies that the Gun-Free Schools Act applies not \njust to the school buildings but to the grounds and any other setting \nunder the jurisdiction of the school. What is meant by a ``school'' is \nnot currently defined by the statute, but the Department of Education \nhas already determined in its implementation guidance that a ``school'' \nmeans any area under the supervision of the school, such as buses or \noff-campus athletic events or field trips. This change codifies the \nDepartment's reasonable definition. I do want to mention, however, that \nthis change would still allow schools the flexibility to permit rifle \nclubs, hunter safety education, or other sanctioned school activities, \nas long as these limited purposes provide reasonable safeguards to \nensure student safety and are otherwise consistent with the intent of \nthe Gun-Free Schools Act.\n  This bill also requires that schools report all incidents of students \nbringing a gun to school, even if a student's expulsion is ultimately \nshortened using the case-by-case exception provided for in the Gun-Free \nSchools Act. Technically the law requires schools to report only \nexpulsions, and the IG found that this has led to considerable \nconfusion among schools about whether they also need to report \nshortened expulsions. The Department of Education has already taken a \nstep in the right direction toward addressing this issue by revising \nthe reporting form that schools use when reporting firearm incidents. \nThis will further clarify for states and schools the data they need to \nreport.\n  Finally, this legislation requires that modifications to one-year \nexpulsions, which are made on a case-by-case basis by the chief school \nofficer, be made in writing. This will simply ensure that school \nofficials, parents or other appropriate individuals will have access to \na written record explaining why the expulsion was shortened.\n  In summary, I think these are simple, straightforward, and sensible \nchanges to the Gun-Free Schools Act. I urge my colleagues to join me \nand Senator Feinstein in making these technical changes when the Senate \ndebates upcoming legislation reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 650. A bill to amend the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the \nexportation of Alaska North Slope crude oil; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this year the spotlight on energy policy \nhas increased. One issue that is key for this country is our oil \nsupply. Americans are very dependent on gasoline, and it is imperative \nthat we address this problem.\n  First on the demand side of the equation, we should increase the \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy standard for SUVs and light trucks so \nthat it equals the standard for cars. That would save 1 million barrels \nof oil per day. By becoming more energy efficient, the amount of our \ndependence on oil will decrease.\n  Second, we also need to focus on the supply side of the picture. For \nexample, we should protect the American supply by banning the \nexportation of crude oil from Alaska's North Slope. And, today, I am \nintroducing, along with Senator Wyden, legislation to do just that.\n  For 22 years, from 1973 to 1995, the export of Alaska North Slope oil \nwas banned. We banned it to reduce our dependence on imported oil and \nto keep gasoline prices down.\n  Unfortunately, at the behest of oil producers, the ban was lifted in \n1995. The General Accounting Office has stated that lifting the export \nban resulted in an increase in the price of crude oil by about $1 per \nbarrel. In fact, some oil companies used their ability to export this \noil to artificially increase the price of gasoline on the West Coast.\n  With the spotlight on energy policy, President Bush and others have \ncalled for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, (ANWR). It \nmakes no sense to destroy a beautiful, pristine sanctuary, one of the \nmost remarkable wildlife habitats in the world, for oil that will only \nlast six months. And this call to destroy ANWR comes even in the face \nof the possible export of American oil that is being drilled in areas \nalready open to drilling.\n  For a little under a year now, no North Slope oil has been exported. \nBut this has been done voluntarily--and in one case mainly to ensure \nthat a proposed merger was approved by the FTC. Although there are no \nexports now, the threat exists and given our current situation, this \nban is necessary to preclude any chance of exporting this oil.\n  This is oil that is on public lands, and that is transported along a \nfederal right-of-way.

A bill to provide for the establishment of an assistance \nprogram for health insurance consumers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Jeffords, Collins, Mikulski, Wellstone and \nClinton, in introducing bipartisan legislation that we believe can make \na real difference in the lives of health care consumers in this nation. \nThe Health Care Consumer Assistance Act provides grants to States to \ncreate, or expand upon, health care consumer assistance, or health \nombudsman programs.\n  In 1997, the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection \nand Quality in the Health Care Industry noted that consumers have the \nright to accurate information and assistance in making decisions about \nhealth plans. One model program, the Administration on Aging's Long \nTerm Care Ombudsman Program, has been highly successful for twenty five \nyears in promoting quality living and health care for nursing home \nresidents nationwide.\n  Now more than ever, people need this kind of assistance to navigate \nthe health care system. The Health Care Consumer Assistance Act would \ncreate a grant program for states to establish private, non-profit, \nindependent entities to operate statewide ombudsman programs. Each \nstate ombudsman program would be a ``one-stop'' source for information, \ncounseling and referral services for health care consumers.\n  Last summer, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Consumer \nReports magazine released the results of a survey on consumer \nsatisfaction with health plans. This survey is part of a larger project \nexamining ways to improve how consumers resolve problems with their \nhealth insurance plans. The survey found that while most people who \nexperienced a problem with their plan were able to resolve them, the \nmajority of those surveyed were confused about where to go for \ninformation and help.\n  Over the past few years, a growing number of states have taken steps \nto give patients new rights in dealing with their health insurance \nplans. For example, more than 30 states now have an external review \nprocess for residents to appeal adverse decisions by their health \nplans. While the majority of those surveyed thought the ability to \nappeal a decision to an independent medical expert would be helpful, \nonly one percent had actually used the process available in many \nstates. In fact, most consumers were unaware this option even existed, \nmuch less how to use it.\n  The legislation we introduce today seeks to remedy this information \ngap by providing grants to states that wish to establish health care \nconsumer assistance programs. These programs are designed to help make \nhealth care consumers more educated and effective as they seek to \nunderstand and exercise their health care choices, rights, and \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe that the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act would \ncompliment a Patient's Bill of Rights that includes a strong appeals \nprocess and access to legal remedies. It may, in fact, actually serve \nto ease the ongoing debate about litigation. By empowering health care \nconsumers with information and effective strategies for making sure \nthey get the care they have paid for when they need it most, the \nchances that a health-related dispute will end up in court are \ndrastically minimized. When a person is sick and in need of medical \ncare, the last thing they want is to have a protracted legal battle, \nthey simply want the care that will make them better.\n  Under this bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will \nprovide funds to eligible states to create or contract with an \nindependent, nonprofit agency, to provide a variety of information and \nsupport services for health care consumers, including the following: \neducational materials about strategies for health care consumers to \nresolve problems and grievances; operate a 1-800 telephone hotline for \nconsumer inquiries; coordinate and make referrals to other private and \npublic health care entities when appropriate; and conduct education and \noutreach in the community.\n  The concept of a health care consumer assistance program has gained \nconsiderable support over the past several years as states have \ncontemplated the patient protection issue and several states have taken \nsteps to create these programs. Governors and state legislatures in \nmany states including, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, \nNebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin \nhave introduced or enacted health care ombudsman legislation. However, \na Families USA survey of existing programs has found that while some \nstates have successfully launched their programs, other state \ninitiatives have faltered due to a lack of sufficient funding.\n  I believe that Americans deserve access to the information and \nassistance they need to be empowered and informed health care \nconsumers. As the health insurance system becomes more confusing and \ncomplex, it becomes critically important that consumers have a place \nwhere they can go for counseling and assistance. As health plan options \nbecome more complicated, people need a reliable, accessible source of \ninformation. State health care consumer assistance programs have proven \ntheir ability to meet this challenge. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in advancing this important and timely legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 651\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumers \n     Assistance Fund Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All consumers need information and assistance to \n     understand their health insurance choices and to facilitate \n     effective and efficient access to needed health services. \n     Many do not understand their health care coverage despite the \n     current efforts of both the public and private sectors.\n       (2) Federally initiated health care consumer assistance and \n     information programs targeted to consumers of long-term care \n     and to medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are effective, as are a \n     number of State and local consumer assistance initiatives.\n       (3) The principles, policies, and practices of health plans \n     for providing safe, effective, and accessible health care can \n     be enriched by State-based collaborative, independent \n     education, problem resolution, and feedback programs. Health \n     care consumer assistance programs have proven their ability \n     to meet this challenge.\n       (4) Many states have created health care consumer \n     assistance programs. The Federal Government can assist the \n     States in developing and maintaining effective health care \n     consumer assistance programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. GRANTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     establish a fund, to be known as the ``Health Care Consumer \n     Assistance Fund'', to be used to award grants to eligible \n     States to enable such States to carry out consumer assistance \n     activities (including programs established by States prior to \n     the enactment of this Act) designed to provide information, \n     assistance, and referrals to consumers of health insurance \n     products.\n       (b) State Eligibility.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section a State shall prepare and submit to the \n     Secretary an application at such time, in such manner, and \n     containing such information as the Secretary may require, \n     including a State plan that describes--\n       (1) the manner in which the State will ensure that the \n     health care consumer assistance office (established under \n     subsection (d)) will assist health care consumers in \n     accessing needed care by educating and assisting health \n     insurance enrollees to be responsible and informed consumers;\n       (2) the manner in which the State will coordinate and \n     distinguish the services provided by the health care consumer \n     assistance office with the services provided by the long-term \n     care ombudsman authorized by the Older Americans Act of 1965 \n     (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), the State health insurance \n     information program authorized under section 4360 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 1395b-\n     4), the protection and advocacy program authorized under the \n     Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act of \n     1986 (42 U.S.C. 10801 et seq.), and any other programs that \n     provide information and assistance to health care consumers;\n       (3) the manner in which the State will coordinate and \n     distinguish the health care consumer assistance office and \n     its services from enrollment services provided under the \n     medicaid and State children's health insurance programs under \n     titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 \n     et seq. and 1397aa et seq.), and medicare and medicaid health \n     care fraud and abuse activities including those authorized by \n     Federal law under title 11 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1301 et seq.), and State health insurance departments \n     and health plan programs that perform similar functions;\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n       (4) the manner in which the State will provide services to \n     underserved and minority populations and populations residing \n     in rural areas;\n       (5) the manner in which the State will establish and \n     implement procedures and protocols, consistent with \n     applicable Federal and State confidentiality laws, to ensure \n     the confidentiality of all information shared by consumers \n     and their health care providers, health plans, or insurers \n     with the office established under subsection (d)(1) and to \n     ensure that no such information is used, released or referred \n     without the express prior permission of the consumer in \n     accordance with section 4(b), except to the extent that the \n     office collects or uses aggregate information;\n       (6) the manner in which the State will oversee the health \n     care consumer assistance office, its activities and product \n     materials, and evaluate program effectiveness;\n       (7) the manner in which the State will provide for the \n     collection of non-Federal contributions for the operations of \n     the office in an amount that is not less than 25 percent of \n     the amount of Federal funds provided under this Act; and\n       (8) the manner in which the State will ensure that funds \n     made available under this Act will be used to supplement, and \n     not supplant, any other Federal, State, or local funds \n     expended to provide services for programs described under \n     this Act and those described in paragraphs (3) and (4).\n       (c) Amount of Grant.--\n       (1) In general.--From amounts appropriated under section 4 \n     for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall award a grant to a \n     State in an amount that bears the same ratio to such amounts \n     as the number of individuals within the State covered under a \n     health insurance plan (as determined by the Secretary) bears \n     to the total number of individuals covered under a health \n     insurance plan in all States (as determined by the \n     Secretary). Any amounts provided to a State under this \n     section that are not used by the State shall be remitted to \n     the Secretary and reallocated in accordance with this \n     paragraph.\n       (2) Minimum amount.--In no case shall the amount provided \n     to a State under a grant under this section for a fiscal year \n     be less than an amount equal to .5 percent of the amount \n     appropriated for such fiscal year under section 5.\n       (d) Provision of Funds for Establishment of Office.--\n       (1) In general.--From amounts provided under a grant under \n     this section, a State shall, directly or through a contract \n     with an independent, nonprofit entity with demonstrated \n     experience in serving the needs of health care consumers, \n     provide for the establishment and operation of a State health \n     care consumer assistance office.\n       (2) Eligibility of entity.--To be eligible to enter into a \n     contract under paragraph (1), an entity shall demonstrate \n     that the entity has the technical, organizational, and \n     professional capacity to deliver the services described in \n     section 4 throughout the State to all public and private \n     health insurance consumers.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to promote the development of affordable, quality \nrental housing in rural areas for low-income households; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce legislation I \noffered last year to promote the development of affordable, quality \nrental housing for low-income households in rural areas. I am pleased, \nalong with Senator Jeffords, Senator Leahy, and Senator Wellstone, to \nintroduce the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of 2001.''\n  There is a pressing and worsening need for quality rental housing for \nrural families and senior citizens. As a group, residents of rural \ncommunities are the worst housed of all our citizens. Rural areas \ncontain approximately 20 percent of the nation's population as compared \nto suburbs with 50 percent. Yet, twice as many rural American families \nlive in bad housing than in the suburbs. An estimated 2,600,000 rural \nhouseholds live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or \nwithout indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n  Substandard housing is a particularly grave problem in the rural \nareas of my home state of North Carolina. Ten percent or more of the \npopulation in five of North Carolina's rural counties live in \nsubstandard housing. Rural housing units, in fact, comprise 60 percent \nof all substandard units in the state.\n  Even as millions of rural Americans live in wretched rental housing, \nmillions more are paying an extraordinarily high price for their \nhousing. One out of every three renters in rural America pays more than \n30 percent of his or her income for housing; 20 percent of rural \nrenters pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing.\n  Most distressing is when people living in housing that does not have \nheat or indoor plumbing pay an extraordinary amount of their income in \nrent. More than 90 percent of people living in housing in the worst \nconditions pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs.\n  Unfortunately, our rural communities are not in a position to address \nthese problems alone. They are disproportionately poor and have fewer\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\nresources to bring to bear on the issue. Poverty is a crushing, \npersistent problem in rural America. One-third of the non-metropolitan \ncounties in North Carolina have 20 percent or more of their population \nliving below the poverty line. In contrast, not a single metropolitan \ncounty in North Carolina has 20 percent or more of its population \nliving below the poverty line. Not surprisingly, the economies of rural \nareas are generally less diverse, limiting jobs and economic \nopportunity. Rural areas have limited access to many forces driving the \neconomy, such as technology, lending, and investment, because they are \nremote and have low population density. Banks and other investors, \nlooking for larger projects with lower risk, seek metropolitan areas \nfor loans and investment. Credit in rural areas is often more expensive \nand available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas.\n  Given the magnitude of this problem, it is startling to find that the \nfederal government is turning its back on the situation. In the face of \nthis challenge, the federal government's investment in rural rental \nhousing is at its lowest level in more than 25 years. Federal spending \nfor rural rental housing has been cut by 73 percent since 1994. Rural \nrental housing unit production financed by the federal government has \nbeen reduced by 88 percent since 1990. Moreover, poor rural renters do \nnot fair as well as poor urban renters in accessing existing programs. \nOnly 17 percent of very low-income rural renters receive housing \nsubsidies, compared with 28 percent of urban poor. Rural counties fared \nworse with Federal Housing Authority assistance on a per capita basis, \nas well, getting only $25 per capita versus $264 in metro areas. Our \nveterans in rural areas are no better off: Veterans Affairs housing \ndollars are spent disproportionately in metropolitan areas.\n\n  To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, I believe that the \nfederal government must come up with new solutions. We cannot simply \nthrow money at the problem and expect the situation to improve. \nInstead, we must work in partnership with State and local governments, \nprivate financial institutions, private philanthropic institutions, and \nthe private and nonprofit sectors to make headway. We must leverage our \nresources wisely to increase the supply and quality of rural rental \nhousing for low-income households and the elderly.\n  Senator Jeffords, Senator Leahy, Senator Wellstone, and I are \nproposing a new solution. Today, we introduce the Rural Rental Housing \nAct of 2001 to create a flexible source of financing to allow project \nsponsors to build, acquire or rehabilitate rental housing based on \nlocal needs. We demand that the federal dollars to be stretched by \nrequiring State matching funds and by requiring the sponsor to find \nadditional sources of funding for the project. We are pleased that more \nthan 70 housing groups from 26 states have already indicated their \nsupport for this legislation.\n  Let me briefly describe what the measure would do. We propose a $250 \nmillion fund to be administered by the United States Department of \nAgriculture, USDA. The funds will be allotted to states based on their \nshare of rural substandard units and of the rural population living in \npoverty, with smaller states guaranteed a minimum of $2 million. We \nwill leverage federal funding by requiring states or other non-profit \nintermediaries to provide a dollar-for-dollar match of project funds. \nThe funds will be used for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and \nconstruction of low-income rural rental housing.\n  The USDA will make rental housing available for low-income \npopulations in rural communities. The population served must earn less \nthan 80 percent area median income. Housing must be in rural areas with \npopulations not exceeding 25,000. Priority for assistance will be given \nto very low income households, those earning less than 50 percent of \narea median income, and in very low-income communities or in \ncommunities with a severe lack of affordable housing. To ensure that \nhousing continues to serve low-income populations, the legislation \nspecifies that housing financed under the legislation must have a low-\nincome use restriction of not less than 30 years.\n  The Act promotes public-private partnerships to foster flexible, \nlocal solutions. The USDA will make assistance available to public \nbodies, Native American tribes, for-profit corporations, and private \nnonprofit corporations with a record of accomplishment in housing or \ncommunity development. Again, it stretches federal assistance by \nlimiting most projects from financing more than 50 percent of a project \ncost with this funding. The assistance may be made available in the \nform of capital grants, direct, subsidized loans, guarantees, and other \nforms of financing for rental housing and related facilities.\n\n  Finally, the Act will be administered at the state level by \norganizations familiar with the unique needs of each state rather than \ncreating a new federal bureaucracy. The USDA will be encouraged to \nidentify intermediary organizations based in the state to administer \nthe funding provided that it complies with the provisions of the Act. \nThese intermediary organizations can be states or state agencies, \nprivate nonprofit community development corporations, nonprofit housing \ncorporations, community development loan funds, or community \ndevelopment credit unions.\n  This Act is not meant to replace, but to supplement the Section 515 \nRural Rental Housing program, which has been the primary source of \nfederal funding for affordable rental housing in rural America from its \ninception in 1963. Section 515, which is administered by the USDA's \nRural Housing Service, makes direct loans to non-profit and for-profit \ndevelopers to build rural rental housing for very low income tenants. \nOur support for 515 has decreased in recent years--there has been a 73 \npercent reduction since 1994--which has had two effects. It is \npractically impossible to build new rental housing, and our ability to \npreserve and maintain the current stock of Section 515 units is \nhobbled. Fully three-quarters of the Section 515 portfolio is more than \n20 years old.\n  The time has come for us to take a new look at a critical problem \nfacing rural America. How can we best work to promote the development \nof quality rental housing for low-income people in rural America? My \ncolleagues and I believe that to answer this question, we must comply \nwith certain basic principles. We do not want to create yet another \nprogram with a large federal bureaucracy. We want a program that is \nflexible, that fosters public-private partnerships, that leverages \nfederal funding, and that is locally controlled. We believe that the \nRural Rental Housing Act of 2001 satisfies these principles and will \nhelp move us in the direction of ensuring that everyone in America, \nincluding those in rural areas, have access to affordable, quality \nhousing options.\n  I request that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 652\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n        Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There is a pressing and increasing need for rental \n     housing for rural families and senior citizens, as evidenced \n     by the fact that--\n       (A) two-thirds of extremely low-income and very low-income \n     rural households do not have access to affordable rental \n     housing units;\n       (B) more than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 \n     percent) live in either severely or moderately inadequate \n     housing; and\n       (C) substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 rural \n     renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental units are \n     overcrowded.\n       (2) Many rural United States households live with serious \n     housing problems, including a lack of basic water and \n     wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and \n     overcrowding, as shown by the fact that--\n       (A) 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in the \n     United States live with some kind of serious housing problem;\n       (B) approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have multiple \n     housing problems; and\n       (C) an estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in \n     substandard housing with severe structural damage or without \n     indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n       (3) In rural America--\n       (A) one-third of all renters pay more than 30 percent of \n     their income for housing;\n       (B) 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 percent of \n     their income for housing; and\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n       (C) 92 percent of all rural renters with significant \n     housing problems pay more than 50 percent of their income for \n     housing costs, and 60 percent pay more than 70 percent of \n     their income for housing.\n       (4) Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, \n     jobs and economic opportunity are limited because--\n       (A) factors that exist in rural environments, such as \n     remoteness and low population density, lead to limited access \n     to many forces driving the economy, such as technology, \n     lending, and investment; and\n       (B) local expertise is often limited in rural areas where \n     the economies are focused on farming or natural resource-\n     based industries.\n       (5) Rural areas have less access to credit than \n     metropolitan areas since--\n       (A) banks and other investors that look for larger projects \n     with lower risk seek metropolitan areas for loans and \n     investment;\n       (B) credit that is available is often insufficient, leading \n     to the need for interim or bridge financing; and\n       (C) credit in rural areas is often more expensive and \n     available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas.\n       (6) The Federal Government investment in rural rental \n     housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as evidenced by \n     the fact that--\n       (A) Federal spending for rural rental housing has been cut \n     by 73 percent since 1994; and\n       (B) rural rental housing unit production financed by the \n     Federal Government has been reduced by 88 percent since 1990.\n       (7) To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the \n     Federal Government must work in partnership with State and \n     local governments, private financial institutions, private \n     philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including \n     nonprofit organizations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act $250,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud, once again, to rise and offer \nmy support for the Rural Rental Housing Act. This important legislation \nwill help reaffirm the federal government's commitment to provide \nquality affordable housing in rural areas. I joined Senator Edwards in \nintroducing this bill last year, and look forward to the opportunity to \ndebate this issue in the 107th Congress.\n  The need for a new federal program to encourage production, \nrehabilitation and acquisition of rural rental housing has never been \nmore evident than it is today. Families in small towns across the \ncountry find themselves with fewer and fewer options for a safe and \naffordable place to live. In my home state of Vermont, like many other \nstates across the country, housing costs have soared out of reach of \nmost low-income families and rental vacancy rates have fallen to \nalarmingly low levels. For those people fortunate enough to find an \navailable apartment it is increasingly difficult to afford the rent the \nmarket demands.\n  Despite this trend, the federal government has continued to scale \nback their commitment to rural housing programs over the last decade. \nMoney for production has dropped nearly 88 percent since 1990, and \nfunding for subsidized housing has fallen by 73 percent since 1994. \nThis decline has made it incredibly difficult to maintain the existing \nhousing stock, little less produce the number of units need to meet \ndemand. In Vermont four thousand rental units were built with federal \nassistance between 1976 and 1985, but during the next ten years this \nnumber fell to under two thousand--nearly half of what was produced the \ndecade before, despite the rising need. Nationwide it is estimated that \nnearly 2.6 million\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nhouseholds live in substandard conditions, often without proper \nplumbing, heat or electricity.\n  The Rural Rental Housing Act will provide $250 million dollars for a \nnew matching federal grant program to address this situation. These \nfunds will complement existing programs run by the Rural Housing \nService at Department of Agriculture and will be used in a variety of \nways to increase the supply, the affordability, and the quality of \nhousing for the most needy residents, the lowest income families and \nour elderly citizens. Most importantly, this program is designed to be \nadministered at the state and local level and to encourage public-\nprivate partnerships to best address the unique needs of each state.\n  I think it is time for the Senate to take action to address the needs \nof our country's most rural populations. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this bill and I encourage my colleagues to add their support.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I offer my support for the Rural \nRental Housing Act of 2001. Communities in every state in this country \nare suffering from a critical lack of affordable housing. Many rural \nareas have been particularly hard hit. This bill takes an important \nstep toward re-establishing the production and preservation of \naffordable housing as a National priority. It assures that the needs of \nrural communities are not forgotten. I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of \nthis bill, and urge all of my colleagues similarly to support this \nlegislation.\n  The time has come for the federal government to get back in the \nbusiness of producing affordable housing. Until we do, we will not get \nat the issue underlying the current affordable housing crisis: the \nrapid erosion of affordable housing stock. Every year, in fact, every \nday, we see the demolition of old affordable housing units without \nseeing the creation of an equivalent number of new affordable housing \nunits. And while there can be no question that some of our existing \naffordable housing units should be demolished, we have yet to meet our \nresponsibility to replace the old units that are lost with new, better, \naffordable units. Our current policy simply results in too many \ndisplaced families, families who are forced to sometimes double-up or \neven become homeless in worst-case scenarios, overburdening otherwise \nalready fragile communities.\n  The housing needs of rural communities are particularly pronounced. \nRural households pay more of their income for housing than do urban \nhouseholds. They are less likely to receive government-assisted \nmortgages; they tend to be poorer than urban households. They have \nlimited access to mortgage credit, and they are often targeted by \npredatory lenders. Rural communities have a disproportionate share of \nthe nation's substandard housing. They often have an inadequate supply \nof affordable housing. Development costs are higher in rural \ncommunities than in urban areas, and rural communities have a limited \nsecondary mortgage market. Many low-income rural families have only \nlimited experience with credit and lending institutions, and they often \nlack an understanding of what it takes to get a home loan. Compounding \nthis problem is a lack of pre- and post-purchase counseling for rural \nhomeowners.\n  Despite the critical housing needs of rural communities, direct \nlending for new or improved rural rental housing is currently at its \nlowest funding level in more than 25 years. The Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, has oversight of most of the federal rural housing \nassistance programs. The primary sources of funding for rural housing \nassistance, the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Loan Program, which \nmakes direct loans to developers and cooperatives to build rural rental \nhousing and the Section 521 Rental Assistance Program (which provides \nrent subsidies to low-income rural renters), have seen their funding \nlevels steadily eroded since the mid-eighties. As a consequence, right \nnow the rate of housing assistance to non-metro areas is only about \nhalf that to metro areas.\n  Unfortunately, while funding levels for rural housing assistance \nprograms have been decreasing, the need for affordable rural housing \nhas been increasing. According to an analysis of 1995 American Housing \nSurvey, AHS, data, 10.4 million rural households, 28 percent, have \nhousing problems. When considering only rural renters, the problem \nbecomes even more pronounced. Thirty-three percent of all rural renters \nare ``cost burdened,'' paying more than 30 percent of their income for \nhousing costs. Almost one million rural renter households suffer from \nmultiple housing problems. Of these households, 90 percent are severely \ncost burdened, paying more than 50 percent of their income for rent. \nSixty percent pay more than 70 percent of their income for housing. \nNearly 60 percent of tenants in Section 515 housing are elderly, \ndisabled or handicapped. The average tenant income is less than $8,000 \na year, and the average income of tenants who receive Section 521 \nhousing assistance is $7,300 per year. Ninety-eight percent of them are \neither low-income, 88 percent, or very-low income, 10 percent, and 75 \npercent are single female or female-headed households.\n  The ``Rural Rental Housing Act of 2001'' is intended to promote the \ndevelopment of affordable, quality rental housing in rural areas for \nlow income households. The bill would authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture, directly or through specified intermediaries, to provide \nrural rental housing assistance in the form of loans, grants, interest \nsubsidies, annuities, and other forms of assistance to finance eligible \nprojects. It would require that no state receives less that $2 million. \nIt would limit the amount of assistance to 50 percent of the total cost \nof eligible projects, unless the project is smaller than 20 units and \nis targeted to very-low income tenants, then assistance can total up to \n75 percent of the total cost. It would require that properties \nacquired, rehabbed, or constructed with these funds remain affordable \nfor low-income families for at least 30 years, and it would give \npriority to low-income families, low-income communities, or communities \nlacking affordable rental housing. Finally, it would authorize \n$250,000,000 in appropriations for each fiscal year 2002 through 2006.\n  I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this important legislation, and \nlook forward to working with Senators Edwards, Jeffords, and Leahy to \nensure its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, \n        Mr. Graham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Carper, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Miller, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 653. A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto provide grants to States to encourage media campaigns to promote \nresponsible fatherhood skills, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Responsible \nFatherhood Act of 2001 with Senator Pete Domenici. Our bill aims to \nencourage fathers to take both emotional and financial responsibility \nfor their children.\n  Many of America's mothers, including single moms, are heroic in their \nefforts to make ends meet while raising good, responsible children. \nMany dads are too. But an increasing number of men are not doing their \npart, or are absent entirely. The decline in the involvement of fathers \nin the lives of their children over the last forty years is a troubling \ntrend that affects us all. Fathers can help teach their children about \nrespect, honor, duty and so many of the values that make our \ncommunities strong.\n  The number of children living in households without fathers has \ntripled over the last forty years, from just over 5 million in 1960 to \nmore than 17 million today. Today, the United States leads the world in \nfatherless families, and too many children spend their lives without \nany contact with their fathers. The consequences are severe, A study by \nthe Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency found that the best \npredictor of violent crime and burglary in a community is not the rate \nof poverty, but the rate of fatherless homes.\n  When fathers are absent from their lives, children are: 5 times more \nlikely to live in poverty; twice as likely to commit crimes; more \nlikely to bring weapons and drugs into the classroom; twice as likely \nto drop out of school; twice as likely to be abused; more likely to \ncommit suicide; over twice as\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nlikely to abuse alcohol or drugs; and more likely to become pregnant as \nteenagers.\n  I have had the opportunity to work with and visit local fatherhood \nprograms in Indiana. I have talked to fathers as they work to re-engage \nwith their children, learn how to be better parents, and gradually \nbuild the trust that allows them to be involved emotionally, as well as \nfinancially, with their children. I visited the Father Resource \nProgram, run by Dr. Wallace McLaughlin in Indianapolis. This program is \na wonderful example of a local, private/public partnership that \ndelivers results. It has served more than 500 fathers, primarily young \nmen between the ages of 15 and 25, by providing father peer support \nmeetings, pre-marital counseling, family development forums and family \nsupport services, as well as co-parenting, employment, job training, \neducation, and life skills classes.\n  The fathers there were eager to tell me about the profound impact \nthese programs have made in their lives, and the lives of their \nchildren. One said to me, ``After the six week fatherhood training \nprogram, the support doesn't stop . . . I was wild before. The program \ntaught me self-discipline, parenting skills, and responsibility.'' \nAnother said, ``As fathers, we would like to interact with our kids. \nWhen they grow into something, we want to feel proud and say that we \nwere a part of that.'' And yet another, ``The program showed me how to \nhave a better relationship with my child's mother, and a better \nrelationship with my child. Before those relationships were just \nfinancial.'' While the program's emotional benefits to families are \ndifficult to measure, we do know it is helping fathers enter the \nworkforce. Over eighty percent of the men who have graduated from the \nprogram are currently employed.\n  This type of investment is a fiscally responsible one, it helps get \nto the root cause of many of the social problems that cost our society \nand our government a great deal of money: The cost to society of drug \nand alcohol abuse is more than $110 billion per year. The social and \neconomic costs of teenage pregnancy, abortion and STDs has been \nestimated at over $21 billion per year. The federal government spends \n$8 billion a year on dropout prevention programs. Last year, the \nfederal government spent more than $105 billion on poverty relief \nprograms for families and children.\n  All this adds up to a staggering price. My legislation, The \nResponsible Fatherhood Act of 2001, does three primary things to help \ncombat fatherlessness in America. First, it creates a grant program for \nstate media campaigns to encourage fathers to act responsibly. Second, \nit funds community efforts that provide fathers with the tools \nnecessary to be responsible fathers. Finally, the bill creates a \nNational Clearinghouse to assist states with their media campaigns and \nwith the dissemination of materials to promote responsible fatherhood.\n  Senators Voinovich, Lincoln, Lugar, Johnson, Miller, Landrieu, \nBreaux, Graham, Lieberman, Kohl, and Carper also join me in the \nintroduction of The Responsible Fatherhood Act of 2001. This \nlegislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by \nCongresswoman Julia Carson, and has the endorsement of the \nCongressional Black Caucus.\n  President Bush has included funding for responsible fatherhood in his \nbudget blueprint and I encourage him to continue to make this \ninitiative a priority. Collectively, I hope we are able to pass \nresponsible fatherhood legislation prior to Father's Day this year.\n  I know that government cannot be the lone answer to this problem. We \ncannot legislate parental responsibility. But government can encourage \nfathers to behave responsibly, inform the public about the consequences \nof father absence, and remove barriers to responsible fatherhood.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 657. A bill to authorize funding for the National 4-H Program \nCentennial Initiative; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation authorizing \nfunding for the National 4-H Program Centennial Initiative.\n  In 2002 we will celebrate the centennial of the founding of the 4-H \nprogram. This important youth development program operates in each of \nthe 50 states and more than 3,000 counties. The program is carried out \nthrough the cooperative efforts of: youth; volunteer leaders; land \ngrant universities; federal, state and local governments; and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Last year over 6.8 million youth ages 5 to 19 participated in the 4-H \nprogram. Over 600,000 volunteer leaders work directly or indirectly \nwith youth through the 4-H program.\n  The legislation I am introducing today recognizes the important role \nof 4-H in youth development. I am pleased that Senator Harkin has \njoined with me as a cosponsor.\n  In celebration of its centennial, the National 4-H Council has \nproposed a public-private partnership to develop new strategies for \nyouth development for the next century. The funding authorized in this \nbill will allow the National 4-H Council to convene meetings and hold \ndiscussions at the national, state, and local levels to form strategies \nfor youth development. From input provided through these sessions, a \nfinal report will be prepared that summarizes the discussions, makes \nspecific recommendations of strategies for youth development, and \nproposes a plan of action for carrying out those strategies.\n  Because 4-H is an important program for youth in each of our states, \nI am hopeful that there will be strong support for this initiative from \nmy colleagues. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATIONAL 4-H PROGRAM CENTENNIAL INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 4-H Program is 1 of the largest youth development \n     organizations operating in each of the 50 States and over \n     3,000 counties;\n       (2) the 4-H Program is promoted by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture through the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service and land-grant colleges and \n     universities;\n       (3) the 4-H Program is supported by public and private \n     resources, including the National 4-H Council; and\n       (4) in celebration of the centennial of the 4-H Program in \n     2002, the National 4-H Council has proposed a public-private \n     partnership to develop new strategies for youth development \n     for the next century in light of an increasingly global and \n     technology-oriented economy and ever-changing demands and \n     challenges facing youth in widely diverse communities.\n       (c) Grant.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, the Secretary of Agriculture shall make a \n     grant to the National 4-H Council to be used to pay the \n     Federal share of the cost of--\n       (A) conducting a program of discussions through meetings, \n     seminars, and listening sessions on the National, State, and \n     local levels regarding strategies for youth development; and\n       (B) preparing a report that--\n       (i) summarizes and analyzes the discussions;\n       (ii) makes specific recommendations of strategies for youth \n     development; and\n       (iii) proposes a plan of action for carrying out those \n     strategies.\n       (2) Cost sharing.--\n       (A) In general.--The Federal share of the cost of the \n     program under paragraph (1) shall be 50 percent.\n       (B) Form of non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of \n     the cost of the program under paragraph (1) may be paid in \n     the form of cash or the provision of services, material, or \n     other in-kind contributions.\n       (d) Report.--The National 4-H Council shall submit the \n     report prepared under subsection (c) to the President, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, the Committee on Agriculture of the \n     House of Representatives, and the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2002.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lugar, the \nchairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, to \nintroduce this legislation to authorize a national effort to strengthen \n4-H's youth development program. With the\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\n4-H program set to observe its centennial year in 2002, this \nlegislation is a fitting tribute to the tremendous contributions 4-H \nhas made over the years to youth development in both rural and urban \ncommunities.\n  The 4-H program is uniquely positioned to continue and expand upon \nits record of service to our youth all across America and across our \nmany diverse communities, from farms to inner cities. 4-H is federally \nauthorized, carried out through state land-grant universities and \nsupported with public and private resources, including from the \nNational 4-H Council. However, the key to 4-H's success is the \nmultitude of volunteers who make the 4-H program work at the local \ncommunity level.\n  This legislation will authorize a new initiative for developing and \ncarrying out strategies for strengthening 4-H youth development in its \nsecond century. Working through public-private partnerships, the \nNational 4-H Council will start at the grassroots level with a program \nof discussions around the country involving meetings, seminars and \nlistening sessions to address the future of 4-H youth development. \nBased on the information and ideas gathered, a report will be prepared \nthat summarizes and analyzes the discussions, makes specific \nrecommendations of strategies for youth development and proposes a plan \nof action for carrying out those strategies.\n  The objective, of course, is to build on the tradition and success of \n4-H to develop new approaches for youth development that are \nappropriate and effective in the 21st Century. Youth today face ever-\ngrowing pressures, demands and challenges far different from those of \nthe past. 4-H has a great deal to offer them, but to be fully \nsuccessful 4-H must adapt to the realities of an increasingly complex \nand rapidly changing world. 4-H must also be responsive to the widening \ndiversity of the local communities where its contributions really make \na difference.\n  In short, 4-H can expand its fine record of service and accomplish \neven more in its second century by developing new strategies for youth \ndevelopment. That is exactly what this legislation is designed to help \nachieve. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 658. A bill to amend title 32, United States Code, to authorize \nunits of the National Guard to conduct small arms competitions and \nathletic competitions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with Senator \nJeffords to introduce legislation that will allow the National Guard to \nparticipate fully in international sports competitions. Currently, \nmembers of the National Guard are involved in a myriad of athletic and \nsmall arms competitions, but their authority for such activities is \nunclear. This legislation will make it easier for the Guard to support \nthe competitions and allow them to use their funds and facilities for \nsuch events. This is basic but necessary legislation.\n  The National Guard is already participating in these events. The \nVermont National Guard hosted the 2001 Conseil International du Sport \nMilitaire, CISM, World Military Ski Championships at the Stowe ski area \nthis month. This military ski event united military personnel from more \nthan 30 countries, promoting friendship and mutual understanding \nthrough sports. More than 350 international athletes competed in such \nevents as the biathlon, giant slalom, cross country, and military \npatrol race. They tested their skill and mettle in the beautiful Green \nMountains, where the recent nor'easter added to the already bountiful \nsnow cover there.\n  But it takes a lot more than a 3-foot base of powder to carry off \nthese competitions. It takes clear authorities, regulations, and \nresources. This legislation will allows these important events to \ncontinue with full participation of the National Guard. I urge the \nSenate to join Senator Jeffords and me in sponsoring this legislation \nand moving it quickly through the legislative process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONDUCT OF SMALL ARMS COMPETITIONS AND ATHLETIC \n                   COMPETITIONS BY THE NATIONAL GUARD.\n\n       (a) Preparation and Participation Generally.--Section 504 \n     of title 32, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (2);\n       (B) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting:\n       ``(3) prepare for and participate in small arms \n     competition; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) prepare for and participate in qualifying athletic \n     competitions.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:\n       ``(c)(1) Units of the National Guard may conduct a small \n     arms competition or qualifying athletic competition in \n     conjunction with training required under this chapter if such \n     activity (treating the activity as of it were a provision of \n     services) meets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1), \n     (3), and (4) of section 508(a) of this title.\n       ``(2) Facilities and equipment of the National Guard, \n     including military property and vehicles described in section \n     508(c) of this title, may be used in connection with \n     activities carried out under paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) Except as otherwise provided in an applicable \n     provision of an appropriations Act, amounts appropriated for \n     the National Guard may be used to pay the costs of activities \n     carried out under this subsection and expenses incurred by \n     members of the National Guard in engaging in activities under \n     paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (a), including \n     participation fees, costs of attendance, costs of travel, per \n     diem, costs of clothing, costs of equipment, and related \n     expenses.\n       ``(d) In this section, the term `qualifying athletic \n     competition' means a competition in an athletic event that \n     necessarily involves demonstrations by the competitors of--\n       ``(1) skills relevant to the performance of military \n     duties; or\n       ``(2) physical fitness consistent with the standards that \n     are applicable to members of the National Guard in \n     evaluations of the physical readiness of members for military \n     duty in the members' armed force.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendments.--(1) The heading of such section \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 504. National Guard schools; small arms competitions; \n       athletic competitions''.\n\n       (2) The item relating to such section in the table of \n     sections at the beginning of chapter 5 of title 32, United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n``504. National Guard schools; small arms competitions; athletic \n              competitions.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Sectional Analysis\n\n       Section XXX amends 32 U.S.C. Sec. 504 to allow the National \n     Guard to use appropriated funds to support certain costs of \n     members of the National Guard involved with small arms and \n     other athletic training and competitions to promote morale \n     and military readiness. Although the Department of Defense \n     (DOD), Air Force (USAF), and Army (DA) regulations allow use \n     of appropriated funds to support sports programs, there are \n     some things under general fiscal law principles for which \n     appropriated funds can not be used, unless specifically \n     authorized by law. The Active Components cover these costs \n     with non-appropriated funds. Unlike the Air Force and the \n     Army, the National Guard receives no non-appropriated funds \n     for Morale, Welfare, Recreation (MWR) sports activities and, \n     therefore, can not cover costs associated with sports \n     programs with such funds. Section XXX addresses this \n     inconsistency and provides authority for NGB to spend \n     appropriated funds on items the Active Components generally \n     cover with non-appropriated funds.\n       Departmental, national, and international sports \n     competition programs are run by the Army and the Air Force. \n     AR 215-1 and AFI 34-107 outline the requirements for soldier/\n     airmen athletes to apply to compete at this higher level as \n     individuals or as part of departmental teams. 10 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 717 provides specific statutory authority to use \n     appropriated funds to purchase personal furnishings for \n     soldier/airmen competitors at this level. This authority, \n     however, can not be used to support the NG sports program \n     because implementing regulations require control and approval \n     at the departmental level. DODD 1330.4, AR 215-1, chap. 8, \n     AFI 34-107. The NG competitive sports program, as with other \n     MACOM level and below sports programs within the Active \n     Components, maintains intramural level sports programs to \n     support athletes who will train to compete for positions on \n     the departmental teams authorized by 10 U.S.C. Sec. 717. \n     Section XXX authorizes the NG to use appropriated funds to \n     support a MACOM level sports program on par with Active \n     Component MACOMs.\n       Section XXX places two limits on NGB sports activities to \n     ensure any training, participation, or holding of sports \n     events enhances military readiness. First, the amendment \n     allows preparation for and participation in sports events \n     that ``require skills relevant to military duties or involve \n     aspects of physical fitness that are evaluated by the\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\n     armed forces in determining whether a member of the National \n     Guard is fit for military duty.'' Second, the amendment \n     requires the National Guard hold only sports events that \n     ``meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1), (3), and \n     (4) of section 508(a)'' of title 32, United States Code. This \n     limitation allows the National Guard Bureau to hold sporting \n     events only if: (1) such event ``does not adversely affect \n     the quality of training or otherwise interfere with the \n     ability of a member or unit of the National Guard to perform \n     the military functions of the member or unit; (2) ``National \n     Guard personnel will enhance their military skills as a \n     result of'' participation in the sports event; and (3) the \n     event ``will not result in a significant increase in the cost \n     of the training.'' 32 U.S.C. 508(a)(1), (3), (4). These \n     limitations safeguard one of the purposes of competitive \n     sporting events within DOD, namely to enhance military \n     readiness.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, It is with great pleasure that Senator \nLeahy and I today to introduce the National Guard Competitive Sports \nEquity Act.\n  Passage of this bill will allow the National Guard to utilize \nappropriated funds in support of National Guard Sports Programs, \nNational Guard Bureau sanctioned competitive events and associated \ntraining programs.\n  The National Guard Competitive Events and Sports program adds value \nto the National Guard by enhancing the National Guard's competitive \ntraining programs through participation in military, national and \ninternational sports competitions. The National Guard Competitive \nSports Program trains, coordinates and participates in events such as \nthe Pan Am Games, World Championships and Olympic Games, Competition \nInternational Sports Militaire, CISM, and manages the World Class \nAthlete Program.\n  The National Guard Sports Office manages four core programs that \ninclude marksmanship, biathlon, parachute competition and marathon \nprograms.\n  This legislation is important because it will allow these programs to \ncontinue to flourish and provide the National Guard training resource \nequity on par with similar programs available to active duty soldiers.\n  Under current law, active component services are able to utilize \nMorale, Welfare and Recreation, MWR funds for training, allowances, \nentry fees, personal clothing and specialized equipment in support of \ntraining and competitive events. The Guard does not receive or have \naccess to similar funding sources. The Guard is forced to use training \nfunds potentially earmarked for other events or not participate.\n  This important legislation will allow this program to continue and \nprovide the National Guard with the funding flexibility it requires to \nmaintain this highly successful program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Helms, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 659. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nadjust the labor costs relating to items and services furnished in a \ngeographically reclassified hospital for which reimbursement under the \nmedicare program is provided on a prospective basis; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nGeographic Adjustment Fairness Act of 2001. I am pleased to have the \nsupport of several of my colleagues including Senators Craig, Hagel, \nCochran, Lincoln, Roberts, Helms, Dayton, and Hutchinson. These members \nrecognize the need for adequate reimbursements for rural health \nfacilities. I am also grateful to Representative Bart Stupak who will \nbe introducing this legislation in the House.\n  The Medicare Geographic Adjustment Fairness Act will amend the Social \nSecurity Act to redirect additional Medicare reimbursements to rural \nhospitals. Currently, hospitals throughout the country are losing \nMedicare reimbursements, which results in severe implications for \nsurrounding communities.\n  As you know, in an attempt to keep Medicare from consuming its \nlimited reserves, Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \nBBA, which made sweeping changes in the manner that health care \nproviders are reimbursed for services rendered to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. These were the most significant modifications in the \nhistory of the program.\n  All of the problems with the BBA, whether hospitals, nursing \nfacilities, home health agencies, or skilled nursing facilities, are \nespecially acute in rural states, where Medicare payments are a bigger \npercentage of hospital revenues and profit margins are generally much \nlower. These facilities were already managed at a highly efficient \nlevel and had ``cut the fat out of the system.'' Therefore, the cuts \nimplemented in the BBA hit the rural communities in Idaho and \nthroughout the United States in a very significant and serious way.\n  In the 106th Congress, the Senate did a tremendous job of bringing \nforth legislation that adjusted Medicare payments to health care \nproviders hurt by cuts ordered in the BBA. While this was a meaningful \nstep, the Senate must continue to address the inequities in the system.\n  My bill would expand wage-index reclassification by requiring the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to deem a hospital that has been \nreclassified for purposes of its inpatient wage-index to also \nreclassify for purposes of other services which are provider-based and \nfor which payments are adjusted using a wage-index. In other words, \nthis legislation would require the Secretary to use a hospital's \nreclassification wage-index to adjust payments for hospital outpatient, \nskilled nursing facility, home health, and other services, providing \nthose entities are provider-based. This change should have been made in \nBBA when Congress required that prospective payment systems be \nestablished for these and other services. As such, this change would \naddress an issue that has been left unaddressed for several years.\n  It makes sense that, if a hospital has been granted reclassification \nby the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board for certain \ninpatient services, it also be granted wage-index reclassification for \noutpatient and other services. It is estimated that this provision \nwould help approximately 400 hospitals, 90 percent which are rural. \nFurthermore, this provision would be budget neutral.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate share my commitment of promoting \naccess to health care services in rural areas. Expanding wage-index \ngeographic reclassification will allow hospitals to recoup lost funds \nand use those funds to address patients' needs in an appropriate, \neffective, and meaningful way. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor \nthe Medicare Geographic Adjustment Fairness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Nickles, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 661. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe 4.3-cent motor fuel excise taxes on railroads and inland waterway \ntransportation which remain in the general fund of the Treasury; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrepeal the 4.3-cent federal excise tax on railroad and inland waterway \ntransportation fuels. This tax was signed into law by President Clinton \nin 1993 in order to help reduce the federal budget deficit. Now that \nthe budget is in surplus, however, the tax is no longer needed. \nRailroad and barges should not continue to be the only forms of \ntransportation that must pay this tax for purposes of deficit \nreduction, particularly during this time of high fuel prices. I am \npleased to be joined in my efforts by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nBreaux, the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Jeffords, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln.\n  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 imposed a Federal \nexcise tax of 4.3 cents per gallon on all transportation fuels. The \nrevenue raised from the tax was dedicated to deficit reduction, so tax \nrevenue was deposited in the general fund instead of into any of the \ntransportation trust funds. Prior to the 1993 act, the gasoline, \naviation and diesel fuel excise taxes had been considered to be ``user \nfees.'' The revenue raised from these taxes was deposited into the \ntransportation trust funds and was dedicated to improving highways, \nairports and waterways. There is\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nno railroad trust fund. Therefore, the 1993 act was a significant \ndeparture from previous treatment of transportation fuel taxes.\n  In 1997, Congress redirected the 4.3-cent gasoline excise tax back \ninto the highway trust fund and the 4.3-cent aviation fuel excise tax \nback into the airport and airway trust fund as a part of the surface \ntransportation reauthorization bill, TEA-21. The 1997 law restored the \ngasoline and aviation taxes to their previous status as true user fees. \nThe revenue collected from these taxes are once again used for the \nbenefit of our highways and airports. However, the final version of \nTEA-21 did not touch the tax on inland waterway barge fuel or railroad \nfuel, so that tax revenue is still being deposited in the general fund.\n  Last Congress, the Senator from Rhode Island, John Chafee, led the \neffort to repeal the 4.3-cent excise tax on railroad and barge fuel. \nThe 106th Congress actually voted to repeal the tax as part of the \nTaxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. Unfortunately, the bill was \nvetoed by President Clinton.\n  I am pleased to carry on the work of our former colleague by \nintroducing this bill to repeal the 4.3-cent tax on railroad and barge \nfuel effective this year. I believe the time has come to repeal the \n4.3-cent tax, since it provides no benefit to the railroad and barge \nsystems, and it only imposes a burden on these two industries that are \nimportant to my home state of Tennessee. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to repeal this outdated tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Santorium, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dorgan, and \n        Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 662. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish headstones or markers for \nmarked graves of, or to otherwise commemorate, certain individuals; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, according to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, today some 1,500 American World War II-era veterans, members \nof the so-called Greatest Generation, will pass away. Tomorrow about \nthe same number will pass away. That daily number will gradually rise \nin the weeks, months, and years to come. Most of them were not career \nsoldiers, but they answered the call to serve our country. Many bravely \nconfronted our enemies in distant lands, in battles that we regard as \nhistory, but that they remember as their personal stories. Midway \nIsland, Omaha Beach, and Iwo Jima are just a few of the places hallowed \nby their deeds. Through their strength and dedication these veterans \nhave earned the respect and gratitude of all Americans to follow.\n  As these veterans pass away, their families are rightfully seeking to \npreserve the record of their loved ones' service to our nation. One way \nin which they are seeking to record that service is to secure official \nburial recognition. But, because of a provision of current law, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs is prohibited from providing an official \nheadstone or grave marker to as many as 20,000 of these families each \nyear.\n  The law I am referring to dates back to the Civil War era, when our \nnation wanted to ensure that our fallen soldiers were not buried in \nunmarked graves. Thus, the law instructs the VA to provide a grave \nmarker for veterans who would otherwise lie in unmarked graves. Of \ncourse, in this day and age, a grave rarely goes unmarked. Today, \nvirtually every deceased veteran is buried in a marked grave, or in \nsome other way duly memorialized by surviving family members. Until \n1990, the surviving family members of a deceased veterans could receive \nfrom the VA, after a burial or cremation, a partial reimbursement for \nthe cost of a private headstone, a VA headstone, or a VA marker. The \nchoice was solely up to the vet's surviving family members. However, \nbudgetary belt tightening measures enacted in 1990 eliminated the \nreimbursement component and precluded the VA from providing a headstone \nor a marker where the family had already done so privately. That \nmeasure has left the VA without any recourse when dealing with veterans \nfamilies who have made private burial arrangements, other than denying \ntheir request for official headstones or grave markers.\n  The inequity created by the current law is not difficult to \nunderstand. A family who is aware of this peculiarity in the law can \nsimply request the official headstone, or in most cases grave marker, \nprior to making private arrangements for a headstone or marker. The VA \nwill examine the request, find that the veterans grave has not been \nmarked, and provide the marker, bestowing the appropriate recognition \nfor service to the Nation. The family is then able to incorporate the \nVA marker into its private arrangements as the family deems fit.\n  However, many, if not most, families do not know about the \npeculiarities of the law in this area. Most families are unaware of the \ncurrent law and act as any family would in a time of loss and grief: \nthey make private and appropriate arrangements to commemorate the \ndeceased. For most, the idea of checking with the VA at this most \ndifficult time is the farthest thing from their minds, but the effect \nof not doing so is absolute and final. When families purchase a private \nheadstone, as nearly every family does these days, they unknowingly \nforfeit the opportunity to receive a government headstone or marker.\n  The Guzzo family of West Hartford, CT is one of the countless \nfamilies who have found out about this law the hard way. Thomas Guzzo \nfirst brought this matter to my attention several years ago. His late \nfather, Agostino Guzzo, served in the Phillippines and was honorably \ndischarged from the Army in 1947. Today, Agostino Guzzo is interred in \na mausoleum at the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, CT, but the \nmausoleum bears no reference to his service because of the current law. \nLike so many families, the Guzzo family provided its own marker and \nsubsequently found that it was not eligible for an official VA marker.\n  When I was first contacted by the Guzzo family, I attempted to \nstraighten out what I thought to be a bureaucratic mixup. I was \nsurprised to realize that Thomas Guzzo's difficulties resulted not from \nsome glitch in the system, but rather from the law itself. In the end, \nI wrote to the former Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding Thomas \nGuzzo's very reasonable request. The Secretary responded that his hands \nwere tied as a result of the obscure law. Furthermore, the Secretary's \nresponse indicated that, even if a grave marker could be provided for \nAgostino Guzzo, that marker could not be placed on a cemetery bench or \ntree dedicated in his name. The law prevented the Department from \nproviding a marker for placement anywhere but the grave site and thus \nprevents families from recognizing their veteran's service as they \nwish.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill that will appropriately address \nthese issues and ensure our deceased veterans are treated equitably. \nThe bill will allow the families of deceased veterans to receive an \nofficial headstone or grave marker in recognition of their veteran's \ncontribution to our nation, regardless of whether their grave is \nprivately marked.\n  What I propose today is a modest means of solving a massive problem. \nThe VA has described this issue as one of its greatest public affairs \nchallenges, but the cost of fixing it is relatively small. Last \nCongress, the idea was scored by the Congressional Budget Office at \nless than $3 million dollars per year, over the first 5 years. This \nbill will put at ease countless families who are disillusioned by the \ncurrent system. Moreover, it gives those families the appropriate \nflexibility, with respect to common cemetery restrictions, to \ncommemorate deceased veterans by dedicating a tree or bench or other \nsuitable site in the veteran's honor.\n  America is different today than it was when we changed the burial \nbenefits in 1990. Our fiscal house is in order; disciplined spending \nhas produced budget surpluses for the first time in many years. We know \nthat the VA is forced to reject as many as 20,000 headstone and grave \nmarker requests each year under the current law. These are meritorious \nrequests by deserving applicants whose families unknowingly forfeit \ntheir right to this modest memorial in a time of stress and loss. The \ncost of fixing this inequity is minor. It\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\nis appropriate, I feel, to make sure that all our veterans receive the \nrecognition they have earned.\n  The policy is simple. We should provide these markers or headstones \nto the families when they request them, and we should allow these \nfamilies to recognize their deceased veterans in a manner deemed \nfitting by each family.\n  Time is of the essence. One thousand five hundred veterans pass away \neach day, and each day there are 1,500 new families who may be denied a \nmodest recognition of the service their loved one gave to our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the President to present a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to Eugene McCarthy in recognition of his service to \nthe Nation; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in recognition of his distinguished \nrecord of service to the United States, I am introducing a bill today \nto award a Congressional Gold Medal to Eugene McCarthy.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is considered to the most distinguished \nrecognition that Congress bestows. I believe, and I hope my colleagues \nwill agree, that the Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting tribute to \nthe dedicated service Eugene McCarthy has given to our Nation.\n  Eugene McCarthy graduated from St. Johns University in Minnesota in \n1935, and from the University of Minnesota in 1939. He taught economics \nand sociology at public and Catholic high schools and colleges in \nMinnesota and North Dakota, including at St. Thomas College in St. \nPaul, and at his own alma mater, St. Johns University. McCarthy served \nin the military intelligence division of the U.S. War Department in \n1944. In 1948, he was elected to Congress to represent the State of \nMinnesota. For Eugene McCarthy, this was merely a first step, revealing \nthat his long-time interest in politics would be even more a calling \nthan it would be a career. He has pursued his political vocation and \nmission for more than 40 years. This span covers Eugene McCarthy's \nservice in the House of Representatives and in the Senate during the \nyears 1948 to 1971, his anti-war presidential campaign of 1968, his \nIndependent candidacy of 1976, and the many books, essays and speeches \nthat always spoke out for reform of the political process and the \nlimitation of executive power.\n  Eugene McCarthy exemplified the highest standards of public service \nand dedication to Constitutional principles as a member of the House of \nRepresentatives for five terms, from 1948 to 1958, and as a Member of \nthis body, the Senate, for two terms, from 1959 to 1971. Through his \nshaping of legislation on civil rights, tax policy, Social Security and \nMedicare, the minimum wage, unemployment compensation, government \nreform, foreign policy and Congressional oversight of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, McCarthy upheld the finest principles of politics \nand policy. As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Unemployment \nProblems in 1959-60, McCarthy held hearings which led to the \nCommittee's outlining of many of the economic development and social \nwelfare programs later enacted during the Kennedy and Johnson \nadministration. On the Ways and Means and Finance Committees of the \nHouse and Senate, respectively, McCarthy pushed for additional benefits \nand minimum wage coverage for migrant workers. In the early 1960s, he \nled the fight to give Medicare coverage to the mentally ill. He was a \nleader throughout the 1960s in efforts to extend unemployment \ncompensation. Beginning in 1954, and subsequently for more than 15 \nyears in both the House and the Senate, McCarthy called for \nCongressional oversight of the CIA.\n\n  Eugene McCarthy's principled campaign for the Democratic Presidential \nnomination in 1968 and his courageous stand regarding U.S. withdrawal \nfrom the Vietnam War inspired countless young people to believe they \ncould make a difference in public life. He always emphasized the role \nof Congress in foreign policy, and his actions helped hasten the end of \nthe most controversial war in American history. Eugene McCarthy \ndeplored cynicism and any tendency to look upon all politicians as \ncorrupt. He said:\n\n       Truth will prove the best antidote to cynicism which is an \n     especially dangerous attitude when it prevails among young \n     people . . . Not only does it destroy confidence and hope, \n     some of the most precious assets of youth, but it also eats \n     away the will to attack difficult political problems, as it \n     does problems in other fields.\n\n  As a distinguished author, poet and lecturer, Eugene McCarthy has \nelevated the language of public dialogue in a way that epitomizes the \ndeepest and most cherished values of American political life. ``What \nthe country needs,'' McCarthy said in 1968, ``is a freeing of our moral \nenergy, a freeing of our resolution, a freeing of our strength.'' He \nadded that, ``in a free country the potential for leadership must exist \nin every man and ever woman.'' McCarthy has authored numerous books on \nAmerican politics and institutions, including ``A Liberal Answer to the \nConservative Challenge,'' 1964; ``America Revisited: 150 Years After \nTocqueville,'' 1976; ``the Ultimate Tyranny: The Majority over the \nMajority,'' 1980; and ``Up Till Now: A Memoir,'' 1988.\n  Eugene McCarthy has dedicated much of his life to our Nation. His \nleadership and service have extended far beyond his tenure in the \nUnited States Congress. It is an honor for me to ask that we award the \ncongressional Gold Medal to this deserving scholar and gentleman. This \nbill offers us here in the Senate finally to recognize Eugene \nMcCarthy's extraordinary contributions to the United States and to say: \nEugene McCarthy, we thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 664. A bill to provide jurisdictional standards for the imposition \nof State and local tax obligations on interstate commerce, and for \nother puroses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I introduce with Senator Kohl the New \nEconomy Tax Fairness Act, or NET FAIR. As we all know, the Internet and \nelectronic commerce have reshaped our society over the last decade. \nMuch of the success that our Nation's economy has enjoyed has been a \nresult of innovative companies making use of Internet technology to \nconduct commerce online. E-commerce has created new jobs, increased \nproductivity, lowered business costs, generated a higher level of \nconvenience for consumers, and sparked overall growth in the U.S. \neconomy.\n  With this in mind, there remain those that would like to tax \ninterstate commerce over the Internet even while this budding \ntechnology has yet to meet its full potential. The NET FAIR Act \naddresses the issue of taxing remote sellers that conduct interstate \ncommerce electronically.\n  In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota that \nStates cannot force out-of-State retail firms to collect sales taxes. \nThe Court held that Congress alone has the authority to impose such \nrequirements under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution. \nNET FAIR builds upon the Quill decision by extending the same approach \nthat currently governs catalogue sales to the Internet. This \nlegislation would allow States to require a company to collect sales \nand use tax, or to pay business activity taxes, only if their goods or \nservices\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\nare sold to individuals living in states where the company has a \nsubstantial physical presence, or ``nexus.''\n  Today, there are over 7,600 taxing jurisdictions nationwide. NET FAIR \nprovides clear rules of the road for all parties involved, establishing \nsound nexus standards for the 21st Century. This legislation allows the \nInternet to continue as an engine of economic growth while respecting \nthe sovereign right of States to determine their own tax policy for \ncommerce conducted within their borders. A failure to address this \nissue will subject small and large businesses alike to thousands of \ndifferent tax standards and rules, making it difficult to ensure \ncompliance. In fact, it will be the small and medium sized businesses--\nusing the Internet to remain competitive in the new economy--that will \nbe hit the hardest, as they lack the resources to comply with the \nthousands of jurisdictional tax standards that exist across the \ncountry.\n  At my urging, the bipartisan Advisory Commission on Electronic \nCommerce was established in 1998. The Commission was established to \nexamine all aspects of the Internet taxation issue. In April 2000, the \nCommission issued its report to Congress. With majority support, the \nACEC recommended that the Internet tax moratorium be extended, which I \nsupport, and that Congress clarify nexus rules for e-commerce and \nestablish clear guidelines for when state and local governments could \nlevy taxes on vendors of interstate commerce. Our legislation goes to \nthe very heart of this issue, and establishes clear nexus rules for e-\ncommerce. Since the ACEC issued its report, it has become apparent that \nreform in this area is necessary; however, Congress should not allow a \n``tax first, reform later'' approach to prevail. Rather, Congress \nshould address the nexus issued head on.\n  NET FAIR provides legal certainty for companies and consumers that \nengage in interstate commerce via the Internet, telephone, or mail \norder. This bill adheres to our Founding Fathers' tenet of ``no \ntaxation without representation'' by codifying fair taxation \nprinciples. We cannot stand idly by and allow this new economic avenue \nto be hampered with new taxes. This legislation does not preempt a \nState's right to tax commerce; however, it does protect businesses and \nconsumers from unfair taxation on interstate commerce and from what \ncould be a crippling effect on the growth of the new 21st Century \neconomy.\n  Senator Kohl and I firmly believe that the New Economy Tax Fairness \nAct accomplishes this task. It is vital that Congress address Internet \ntaxation and clarify nexus standards so that interstate commerce, \nespecially online, electronic commerce, can continue to thrive and \npositively impact our Nation's overall economic success. I would ask \nthat our Senate colleagues join us in this effort.\n  I ask that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 664\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce with my good friend from \nNew Hampshire NET FAIR, the New Economy Fairness Act. This bill is \nidentical to a bill we introduced last Congress. It would clarify the \ntax situation of companies that sell and ship products out of the state \nin which they are located.\n  NET FAIR codifies current legal decisions defining when a business \ncan be subject to state and local business taxes and be required to \ncollect State and local sales taxes. Currently, a business falls into a \nstate or local taxing jurisdiction when it has a ``substantial physical \npresence'' or ``nexus'' there.\n  And that makes sense. If a business is located in a State--uses the \nroads there, impacts the environment there, employs local workers there \nit should pay taxes and business fees there, and it should collect \nsales taxes on products sold there.\n  But if a business is located out of State, and simply ships products \nto consumers there, it is not part of the local economy. It does not \nuse local services or infrastructure. And it should not be subject to \nthe taxes and tax collection burdens that support a community not its \nown.\n  That seems simple. But as with anything that happens in tax law, it \nis not. Cases have been brought in courts across the country trying to \nclarify exactly what is a ``substantial physical presence.'' Is it \nmaintaining a Web site? Sending employees to training conferences? \nTaking orders over the Internet? Our bill codifies the decisions \nalready established by the courts and restates the principle on which \nthey are all based: State and local taxing authorities do not have \njurisdiction over businesses that are not physically located in their \nborders.\n  Because this area of the law is as arcane as it is important, it is \nimportant to describe what our bill does not do.\n  It does not exempt e-businesses or any other mail order businesses \nfrom taxation. The businesses our bill cover pay plenty of taxes--\nFederal taxes and State and local taxes and fees in every state in \nwhich they maintain a physical presence.\n  Our bill does not offer special breaks for e-businesses. Though the \nstruggling e-economy will certainly benefit from having its tax \nsituation clarified, nothing we state in this bill goes beyond current \nestablished case law.\n  Our bill does not take away any revenue States and localities are \ncurrently collecting. Only Congress has the right to regulate the flow \nof commerce between the States. State and local tax collectors have \nnever been able to reach into other States and collect revenues from \nbusinesses outside their borders.\n  Our bill does not threaten ``main street businesses.'' In fact, it is \njust the opposite. The small stores of Main Street are threatened by \nmalls and mega-stores--not by the Internet or catalogue companies. In \nfact, many Main Street speciality stores are staying alive by offering \ntheir products over the Internet.\n  In Wisconsin, for example, we have many cheese makers who have run \nsmall family businesses for years. A quick search on the World Wide Web \nyields 20 Wisconsin cheese makers selling over the Internet. They are \nfrom Wisconsin towns like Plain, Durand, Fennimore, Tribe Lake, Thorp, \nand Prairie Ridge. Could these small towns support speciality cheese \nmakers with walk-in traffic only? Would these small businesses continue \nto sell over the Internet if they had to figure and remit sales taxes \nand business fees to the over 7000 taxing jurisdictions into which they \nmight ship? Of course not.\n  What our bill does do is protect businesses, big and small, and \nconsumers from facing a plethora of new taxes and tax compliance \nburdens. What it does do is keep the life-line of Internet sales \navailable for countless small businesses and entrepreneurs.
