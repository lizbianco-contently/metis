Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity--because we \nhave been so busy in the last couple of days--to talk about one of the \ngreat honors I have had in my career. That took place right down here \nwhen I had the opportunity to administer the oath of office to Robert \nC. Byrd as President pro tempore of the Senate of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I am a historian. I have written a history book, and I \nlove to read history. I just finished reading a book about Seabiscuit, \nthe great racehorse. I love history. I have no doubt I was part of \nhistory in administering the oath to the President pro tempore of the \nSenate today.\n  We have a lot of athletic contests where people keep minute records \nof home runs--when they were hit, how many were hit in a month, and all \nsuch things. I have followed baseball, but I certainly don't go to \ngames anymore. They take up too much time. But I have played in a few \nand I have watched a few in my day. I know a lot about baseball \nrecords. I know of those who have left a permanent mark upon baseball.\n  I also understand the Senate and the history of it. I understand that \nthose people who come to visit like to meet Senators. I can remember \ncoming here in 1974, and out in the waiting room I was able to visit \nwith Hubert Humphrey. He was very ill at the time. He could not stand \nfor a long period of time. He sat down in the reception area, and I had \nthe pleasure of visiting with him. He was a friend of my wife's uncle, \na pharmacist in Minneapolis. It was a great honor to meet him. He is a \nlegislative legend, and I will never forget the experience of meeting \nhim.\n  I serve in the Senate with who I believe is the Babe Ruth of the \nSenate. If there is a Babe Ruth in baseball, there is one in the \nSenate. The No. 1 player in the history of baseball is Babe Ruth. That \nis to whom everybody looks. I really believe, without any exaggeration, \nwithout any hesitation, the Babe Ruth of the Senate is the President \npro tempore Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  I have had the opportunity to serve with Senator Byrd, which to me is \nsomething I will always treasure. If you research the life of Senator \nByrd, you will find he has a remarkable history. Senator Byrd's mother \ndied in the influenza epidemic in 1918. I have heard Senator Byrd tell \nvarious bits and pieces and parts of his history, some of which I \nremember as if he had said it a minute ago--about waiting on the tracks \nfor his father--he was orphaned, so it was his adoptive father--to \nbring home a lunch bucket with things in it for his son.\n  Senator Byrd, like me, knows what it is to have a father coming home \nout of the mines. My dad used to say, ``I had a rough day at the \noffice,'' and he was covered with mud and grime. His office was down in \nthe bowels of the Earth. So I have some comprehension of how Senator \nByrd was raised. I understand how Senator Byrd didn't have money to go \nto college. Yet he graduated from college here in Washington, DC. He \ngraduated law school while he was a Member of Congress. It is hard to \ncomprehend.\n  The history books will have to be filled with Senator Byrd, whose \nachievements are unparalleled. He became a member, as I understand it, \nof the Democratic Senate leadership in 1967 when he was selected to be \nsecretary of the conference. In 1971 he became the whip, the assistant \nleader. In\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\n1977 he was elected Democratic leader, a position he held for six \nconsecutive terms. For these 12 years as Democratic leader, he served \nas both majority and minority leaders.\n  To me, Senator Robert C. Byrd will always be Mr. Chairman. As a \nfreshman Senator, I had the opportunity to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee. To be elected to the Senate and to be able to serve on the \nAppropriations Committee and then to serve under Robert C. Byrd is a \nfulfillment of the legislative dream.\n  We in this Senate are very fortunate to have the wisdom and \nexperience of this man. The people of the State of Nevada benefit every \nday from what the Senator from West Virginia does. It is not only the \nState of West Virginia that benefits from what he does but every State \nin the Union benefits from what the Senator from West Virginia does.\n  He is serving in his eighth consecutive term as a Senator, making him \nthe only person in the history of the Republic to achieve this \nmilestone.\n  His great rise from the bituminous coal fields of his hardscrabble \nyouth is a tribute to America. It is a tribute to Senator Byrd, but it \nis also a tribute to America. In America, one does not have to be born \ninto money, prestige; one does not have to have educated parents to \nbecome an educated man; one does not have to have parents who have \nfancy homes and houses to come to Washington and serve in the greatest \nlegislative body in the history of the world.\n  I believe Senator Byrd is an American patriot, underscored and \nunderlined, a dedicated servant to the people of West Virginia, and a \nSenate legend. I believe I speak for everyone in the Senate when I say \nhow proud I am to serve with the Babe Ruth of the Senate, Robert C. \nByrd.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will withhold momentarily.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S5998-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am on my way to a meeting with Senator \nLott on the reorganization of the Senate, but I passed through the \nSenate Chamber en route. It is always a great thrill to come to the \nChamber of the Senate, and a great privilege to be a Senator. Seeing \nthe distinguished President pro tempore, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, presiding, I decided to exchange a few \nmoments of pleasantries and ask how a man of his prominence and \nimportance could be presiding over the empty Senate.\n  Senator Byrd exchanged philosophical comments and referred to the \npeople here as ``auditors'' of the Government of the United States. I \nhope that is not inappropriate, in terms of referring to people in the \ngallery. I know we cannot acknowledge people. I breached the rule once \nwhen Penn State won the national championship and acknowledged the \npresence of the Penn State football team in the gallery. Senator Byrd, \nin a very gentle, kindly way reminded me of the Senate rule.\n  However, I think we are being audited, and the Senate of the United \nStates has important oversight responsibilities on the Federal \nGovernment. The people of the United States are our overseers, our \noversight committee of 270 million, and they are auditing here today in \nthe Senate.\n  When Senator Byrd made the comments about auditors, I reflected for a \nmoment about the profound nature of that comment because we are the \nservants of the people of America. Senator Byrd has delivered many, \nmany erudite presentations, we might call them lectures, perorations on \nthis floor, and they have been put into volumes on the history of the \nSenate.\n  I made a comment to Senator Byrd, as pleased as we are to have his \ntalents in the Senate in the year 2001, he may have been born 2,000 \nyears too late; that had he been a Roman senator, the heroes whom he \nspeaks about and lionizes would have even been a greater Roman senate. \nThe Senate is a greater Senate because of the presence of Senator Byrd \nwho is our historian and mentor.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S5998-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5998-S5999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL KIDNAPPING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an \nissue that I have raised many times before, and that is the tragic \nproblem of American children being abducted from this country and taken \nabroad. This international parental kidnapping is a tragic problem in \nour country today. One country in particular has had a really poor \nrecord of returning abducted children, and that country, amazingly, is \nthe country of Germany. So I am raising this issue again today on the \nfloor because our President, President Bush, will be in Europe next \nweek to meet with German Chancellor Schroeder.\n  Today's Washington Post has an editorial that discusses how vitally \nimportant it is that we make international parental kidnapping a top \npriority. I could not agree more. Today I have written to President \nBush, asking him to raise this issue of international parental \nkidnapping when he meets with the Chancellor. I am hopeful he will do \njust that.\n  Let me take a few minutes to update my colleagues about what is \nhappening in our relations with Germany on this issue. As you know, the \nHague Convention on the international aspects of child abduction, which \nthe United States and Germany have both signed, is in place to \nfacilitate the return of internationally abducted children to their \ncountries of ``habitual residence'' for custody determination. That is \nwhere the issue is supposed to be adjudicated. Unfortunately, it has \nbecome clear that all countries that have signed the convention do not \ntake their obligations seriously. Germany has performed especially \npoorly in returning children and allowing family visitation options.\n\n  According to the General Accounting Office, 215 Hague Convention \ncases seeking the return of children have been opened with Germany, \njust since 1995. Of those cases opened, 172 of them have been closed \nwith the children being returned only 67 times, or 39 percent of the \ntime, and not returned 105 times, or 61 percent of the time.\n  Because of this disturbing return rate, during the past year both \nformer President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright raised with German officials the problems with their country's \npoor compliance rate.\n  Additionally, this Senate and the House of Representatives passed a \nresolution I sponsored which urged the signatories--namely Germany, \nAustria,\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\nand Sweden--to comply with their Hague Convention obligations.\n  In response to these efforts, an American-German working group on \nchild custody issues has been established. While this group has made \nsome progress in handling future cases of child abduction, momentum \nseems to have slowed, and essentially no progress has been made \nregarding the open cases, either in the return of children to the \nUnited States or in allowing left-behind parents adequate visits with \ntheir children.\n  To that end, I believe we simply must not allow Germany or any \nsignatory nation to ignore their convention obligations and turn \nblindly against the parents who have suffered unbelievable heartache \nbecause of the loss of their children.\n  Ultimately, we cannot understate nor can we ignore the importance of \ngetting these children returned to their homes in the United States. We \nmust make the return of all internationally abducted children a top \nforeign policy priority.\n  This is obviously not a partisan issue. Rather, this is a \nhumanitarian issue, an ethical issue, an issue about children and how \nwe can reunite families. I urge my colleagues to support efforts to \nbring these children home. Ultimately, the great tragedy is not the \nloss that these parents feel. The great tragedy is that there are \nchildren growing up without a parent who wants to be a loving parent \nbut who, because of illegal action of the other parent, no longer can \nsee that child. That is a tragic loss for the child.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The Senator may \nproceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S5999-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5999-S6000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HISTORICAL CHANGES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this has been a historic week in \nWashington, DC. For the first time in the history of the Senate there \nhas been a change in the leadership of the Senate because of the \ndecision of one Senator to become an Independent and to join the other \nside of the aisle in forming a new majority. As a result of the \ndecision of Senator Jeffords of Vermont, Senator Tom Daschle of South \nDakota is now the majority leader. The President pro tempore of the \nSenate is one of the most venerable Members in the history of the \nSenate, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. We have also created a \nposition of President pro tempore emeritus for Senator Strom Thurmond \nof South Carolina.\n  Most are aware of the fact that Senator Strom Thurmond breaks a \nSenate record every day of service. He is 98 years old. This week he \nwent to Bedford, VA, where they noted the anniversary of the D-day \ninvasion on June 6, 1944. Senator Strom Thurmond, at the age of 41, \nvolunteered to fly a glider behind enemy lines in the D-day invasion. \nIt is a great tribute to him that the President asked him to join in \nthe opening of the new memorial to D-day in Bedford, VA. We are very \nproud of Senator Thurmond and his service to our country. It is an \nextraordinary story. A man who was 41 years of age on that day still \nserves his Nation in the State of South Carolina in the Senate.\n  If this were just a matter of changing titles and the nameplates on \noffices, one might say what happened this week in the Senate has little \nbearing on the families across America and their immediate concerns. \nHowever, I believe on this side of the aisle there will be changes of \ngreat significance to families across the United States.\n  We are in the midst of debating an education bill. This could easily \nbe one of the most significant pieces of legislation this year. It is a \nbipartisan bill, supported by President Bush, as well as the Democratic \nand Republican congressional leaders.\n  The object of this bill is to modernize the schools of America to \nprepare them for the 21st century, to make certain that kids going to \nschool in my home State of Illinois or New Jersey or any State across \nthe Nation have a chance for the very best education.\n  I was really encouraged this week when the Senate agreed to an \namendment I offered to increase the money for math and science \neducation. Sadly, in comparison to many countries around the world, the \nUnited States does not do its best when it comes to teaching our kids \nmath and science. When you look at the fields of endeavor where the \nUnited States is succeeding, particularly in the areas of science and \nmedical research and high technology, math and science are absolutely \nessential. So this bill will focus not just on reading skills, which \nare the bedrock of any good education, but also on improving math and \nscience skills for our kids, making certain the teachers standing in \nthe front of the classroom are really qualified to teach the subject so \nthey can energize and excite young students in the fields of math and \nscience.\n  This bill also calls for accountability, testing of students to make \nsure they are making progress, investing back in the schools so they \ncan improve their performance.\n  This week, in Chicago, IL, Mayor Daley announced that Paul Vallas, \nwho has been the leader of the Chicago public school system and its CEO \nfor more than 5 years, is going to move on. Paul Vallas leaves an \nextraordinary record in the city of Chicago. He took what was dubbed \nthe Nation's worst school system and has turned it into arguably one of \nthe best of any major city. They stopped social promotion. They started \ninvesting in schools--smaller class sizes, better teachers, a new sense \nof excitement, testing--and if the kids cannot pass the test, they are \noffered 6 weeks in summer school to catch up. If they still can't pass \nit, they repeat the grade so they are not pushed along to the next \ngrade, really creating a fiction, when they are handed the diploma, \nwhere many of them in years gone by could not even read.\n  We want every school district to move forward, not just for the \nwealthiest but for all of our Nation. That is really the hallmark of \nAmerican democracy, the commitment to public education, the notion that \nwhether you are rich or poor, black, white, brown, a young boy, a young \ngirl, whether you are native born or immigrant, that you have a chance \nto get an education and a chance to succeed. It says more about America \nthan anything. That is in the pending bill.\n  When this bill is finished, we are going to move to the Patients' \nBill of Rights. What is that all about? The question of who will make \nmedical decisions, your doctor or your insurance company. If the doctor \nsays the best thing for you or someone in your family is a certain \nmedical procedure, we want that doctor's decision to be the last word, \nnot that of a clerk in an insurance company somewhere who is reading \nfrom a manual and looking at the bottom line of the quarterly report \nfor the insurance company. We want somebody who is making that decision \nin your best interest and your family's best interest.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights has been an issue that should have been \nresolved years ago in the Senate, but it was not. With the new \nDemocratic leadership of Senator Tom Daschle and a bipartisan effort \ninvolving Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, Senator John \nEdwards, a Democrat of North Carolina, and, of course, Senator Ted \nKennedy of Massachusetts, we have a chance to pass this bill. I think \nthat is a step forward.\n  We also want to increase the minimum wage. This used to be an item \nthat was not even debated on Capitol Hill. Regularly we would take a \nlook at the minimum wage and recognize we have to say to the people who \nare working at the lowest end of the economic spectrum that they have a \nchance to keep up with inflation. But our minimum wage has been stuck \nat $5.15 for years.\n  In my home State of Illinois, 400,000 people got up this morning and \nwent to work for $5.15 an hour, many of them working two and three jobs \njust to keep their families together. We can improve and increase the \nminimum wage, and we should.\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\n  These issues, whether it is prescription drug benefits under \nMedicare, Patients' Bill of Rights so doctors make decisions for our \nhealth care, an increase in the minimum wage, improvement in \neducation--that will be part of our agenda as we return here next week \nwith the new majority leader, Tom Daschle. It is an exciting \nopportunity.\n  Having said that, we are still a body of 100 Members where, on a good \nday, the Democrats can muster a majority of 51 votes. So it is obvious \nwe need bipartisanship; we need cooperation. But I hope this change in \nthe leadership in the Senate will open up our eyes to an array of \nopportunities that have been missed over the last several years, \nopportunities to provide better schools, more health care, to give a \nvoice to consumers and families in securing appropriate medical \ntreatment, to give those who are struggling to go to work every day and \nmake a living a chance to succeed in America.\n  It is a pretty heady agenda; it is pretty challenging; but I think we \ncan rise to that occasion. I look forward to being part of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD.

At that time, \nrepresenting the great State of Illinois was the inimitable Everett \nDirksen, with his unruly, one might say unkempt--at least in \nappearance--hair, his florid and flowery oratory, his mellifluous \nvoice, a master at painting word pictures: Everett Dirksen. I can see \nhim standing there. He was the minority leader. And then on this side \nof the aisle, in the next row behind me and across the aisle, sat the \nother Senator from the State of Illinois, Paul Douglas: Learned, also a \ngreat orator, very impressive--the two Senators from Illinois.\n  Illinois is continuing in that tradition of Dirksen and Douglas. It \nsends to the Senate the Senator who presently presides, Richard Durbin, \nformerly a Member of the House of Representatives, who served there \nwith distinction on the Appropriations Committee, who comes to the \nSenate Chamber very well equipped, indeed, well equipped by experience, \nwell equipped by heredity, a factor never to be overlooked, a factor \nwhich in some ways lays out the destiny of each of us ahead of our \nyears, who also is a very fine speaker, one who does his homework, who \nlikes service to the people.\n  Then there is Senator Fitzgerald. I believe he is the youngest \nSenator in today's Chamber, who came to the U.S. Senate, I believe, as \na former member of the Senate of the State of Illinois. I hope I am \ncorrect. If I am not, I hope the Presiding Officer will indicate by nod \nthat I am in error.\n  In any event, I express appreciation to the Senator who presently \npresides for his patience in awaiting my tardy arrival.\n  I sat in the chair earlier today as the President pro tempore of the \nSenate, having been elected to that honor by my colleagues, first of \nall, on this side of the aisle, and then all of my colleagues through a \nSenate resolution.\n  Senators are not to speak from the chair. If compliments are to be \ndirected to the Chair or criticism is to be directed to the Chair, the \nChair is not supposed to respond. The Chair is only to respond when \ncalled upon by way of a parliamentary inquiry or, if necessary, to make \na ruling on a point of order. And, of course, it is his or her \nresponsibility to maintain order in the chair. The Chair has the \nresponsibility to maintain, or to restore if necessary, order in the \ngalleries, or in the Senate Chamber, without being called upon by a \nSenator from the floor. It is the Chair's responsibility to maintain \norder in the Senate, and the Chair should not await a call by a Senator \nfrom the floor for order and decorum; the Chair has that \nresponsibility.\n  As I sat there earlier today--we, of course, can't call attention to \nvisitors in the galleries. But there are visitors in the galleries. And \nas I sat in the chair earlier today watching the visitors in the \ngalleries, I reflected. It is a good time to reflect when one is in the \nchair and nothing is going on on the floor at a given moment and when \nno Senator is speaking. It is an excellent time for reflection. As I \nreflected on the silent audience that sits every day in these \ngalleries--I reflected upon the fact that there in those galleries sit \nthe people--our auditors--the people who send us here, the people who \npay us our salaries. Silently they sit viewing the Senate, pondering \nwhat is said by Senators, watching over our shoulders. They are always \nthere.\n  Sometimes we may be prone to forget that the people are watching, but \nthey are watching. There in the galleries rests the sovereignty of all \nthat is the Government of this Republic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6000-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this past weekend I noted an article in the \nWashington Post that led with these lines:\n\n       Administration officials preparing an alternative to the \n     1997 global warming agreement that President Bush disavowed \n     in March are focusing on voluntary measures for reducing \n     greenhouse gas emissions--an approach unacceptable to most \n     U.S. allies in Europe and Japan.\n\n  Mr. President, last month, I came to this floor to urge the Bush \nadministration not to abandon the progress of the multiyear \ninternational negotiations on global climate change. In particular, I \nurged this administration not to endanger many of the gains that the \nUnited States has made in recent years as it has tried to forge a \nworkable, responsible international climate change agreement. So I \nwelcome the subsequent announcement by administration officials that \nthey intend to participate in talks on the Kyoto Protocol scheduled to \ntake place in Bonn, Germany, in July. But an insistence on the part of \nthe United States strictly on voluntary measures would certainly place \nin jeopardy such gains and would, I believe, undermine the credibility \nof our Nation at the bargaining table in the future. I cannot agree \nwith a strategy that abandons consideration of binding commitments in \nfavor of voluntary efforts alone.\n  I stand here as the chief author of Senate Resolution 98 in 1997, the \nmeasure that many on both sides of the debate paint as a fatal blow to \nratification of the Kyoto Protocol. I beg to differ with that \ndepiction. S. Res. 98, in 1997, was the voice of the Senate, the vox \npopuli, the voice of the people through their elected Representatives, \nproviding guidance to the previous administration--the administration \nat that time--as its negotiators labored to hammer out a climate change \nproposal among various international players. That resolution, which \npassed by a vote of 95-0, simply stated that any international treaty \non climate change must include binding commitments by the developing \nnations, especially the largest emitters, and also that it must not \nresult in serious harm to the U.S. economy.\n\n  It also called upon the administration to inform the legislative \nbranch, which under the Constitution of the United States is required \nto approve the ratification of treaties, as to the estimated costs of \ncommitments by the United States. We want to know what these will cost. \nAnd to date, that information has not been forthcoming. That is what we \nwere saying. Tell us what it will cost. Don't sign it; don't sign that \nprotocol until the major emitters among the developing nations of the \nworld have also signed on and have come into the boat with us. They \nneed to sign on with respect to restricting the emissions of greenhouse \ngases. It must not be the United States alone; it must not be the \nUnited States and the developed nations, the industrial nations, alone. \nWe all have a responsibility.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  So we said we want the developing nations to get into the same boat \nwith us because they are going to be impacted by the pollution that is \nemitted into the air, into the atmosphere, because it circles the \nglobe. We are not saying they have to sign up for precisely the same \nlimits we place on ourselves, or to that same degree, but they do need \nto sign on and get into this boat. Also, we want to know what it is \ngoing to cost and what kind of an impact it is going to have on U.S. \nindustries. We don't want our industries to go overseas as a result of \nan unwise signing of the protocol that would require us to continue to \nstrongly limit ourselves in ways that would encourage manufacturers in \nthis country to go abroad and to establish themselves in the developing \ncountries. Let's all get into the same boat together. There must be a \nlevel field insofar as our industries are concerned. Let's don't drive \nAmerican industries overseas.\n  It is a little like smoking a cigar in a room. I used to smoke \ncigars. I smoked for 35 years. I gave up the habit. I said, ``I am \nquitting.'' The point is that, even though I might have been the only \nperson in the room holding a lighted cigar in my hand, everybody else \nin the room was inhaling the fragrance of that cigar. And it is the \nsame way with greenhouse gases. They do circle the globe. Everybody \nbreathes the same air, not only the emitters, but also those who are \nnot the emitters.\n\n  Had the Senate merely sat on its hands in that instance and allowed \nan untenable treaty to be submitted for approval, it would have been \nrejected. That would have been the fatal blow.\n  The effect of that Senate resolution was not to kill the \nnegotiations--that was not my desire to kill the negotiations--but to \nhelp shape them, to strengthen the hand of our negotiators as they \ntried to reach an agreement that would be acceptable to the American \npeople. No treaty of such magnitude stands any real chance of success \nin this Nation without the backing of the American people. Our friends \nin foreign nations surely understand that.\n  There are also some who do not believe the proliferation of \nscientific reports that have been produced in recent years concerning \nclimate change. But the body of evidence tells us that something is \noccurring in our atmosphere at a proportion that is changing our \nclimate and that the human hand has played a role in affecting that \nchange.\n  ``I have lived a long time'', as Benjamin Franklin said when he stood \nbefore the Constitutional Convention, ``and the longer I live, the more \nconvincing proof I see that God still governs in the affairs of men.'' \nAnd so the longer I live, I see that also.\n  One of the ``affairs of men'' that I see changing is the atmosphere, \nthe circumstances in which we live every day and every night. As one \nwho has lived more than 83\\1/2\\ years, I have seen some changes taking \nplace out there in the cosmos and around the globe.\n  I cannot explain those changes. I am not a scientist. But I know that \nthe changes are taking place. The storms are more violent. The storms \nare more frequent today than they were when I was a lad walking the \nhills of Wolf Creek in Mercer County, West Virginia. The floods are \nmore frequent. The droughts are more severe, with far more costly \nresults and more often. The forest fires are more frequent, more \ncostly.\n  The winters have changed. No longer do I experience the snows that I \nexperienced as a boy in southern West Virginia in the mountains and \nhills. There is still a great deal of snow there, but not like it was \n50 years ago, 60 years ago, 70 years ago.\n  The rains are not as they were. There is something going on out \nthere. The ice masses at the two poles to the north and to the south \nare diminishing. They are melting. As they melt, conditions change \naround the globe. The waters of the seas grow higher. There is \nsomething going on out there--I know, and I am concerned about it.\n  We can waste valuable time debating and quibbling over measurements, \nmethodology, findings, and conclusions, or we can accept the simple \nreality that is right before our eyes--we feel it, we see it, we hear \nit, we read about it, we appropriate more moneys because of it--the \nreality that global warming is occurring.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am introducing the Climate Change Strategy \nand Technology Innovation Act of 2001. Senator Ted Stevens, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, a State that is almost halfway across the globe \nfrom where we stand today, has agreed to join me in this effort. This \nlegislation calls for a comprehensive strategy underpinned by credible \nscience and economics that will guide U.S. efforts to address the \nmultifaceted problem of global climate change. This legislation also \nestablishes a major research and development effort intended to develop \nthe bold breakthrough technologies that our country will need to \naddress the challenge of climate change.\n  This legislation is intended to supplement, rather than replace, \nother complementary proposals to deal with climate change in the near \nterm on both a national and international level. I also note that this \nbill is technology neutral. This is not a bill to carve out special \nbenefits for coal or oil or gas or, for that matter, for nuclear, \nrenewables, or any other energy resource or technology. This \nlegislation provides the framework for addressing the climate \nchallenge, reaffirms the ultimate goal of stabilizing atmospheric \ngreenhouse gas concentrations, and leaves the technology decisions to \nenergy experts and the marketplace.\n  An understanding as to why this legislation is necessary must begin \nwith an understanding of the fundamental causes of global climate \nchange. It is virtually indisputable that atmospheric concentrations of \ncarbon dioxide, CO2, are rising and that mankind is \ncontributing to this rise.\n  CO2 has never changed. Like H2O, it never \nchanges. H2O, two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen \nconstitute water. Water was the same in the beginning when Adam and Eve \nstrolled the paths of that Earthly paradise. Water was H2O, \nand carbon dioxide was the same, CO2. Neither has changed. \nThere are some things that do not change. That is the reason why I say \nhistory repeats itself. Human nature does not change. Cain slew Abel in \nthe heat of a sudden rage, and men are still slaying one another.\n  These rising concentrations drive global climate change, and they are \ngrowing as a result of increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. I \ndon't believe I need a scientist to tell me something is going on \nthere. Disturbingly, most greenhouse gases have a very long life span \nin the atmosphere, ranging from decades to hundreds of years. This \nmeans that what is emitted today is added to what was emitted in the \n20th century. For example, much of the CO2, much of the \ncarbon dioxide, emitted during the Second World War is still with us \ntoday, and, with each passing year, the concentration is projected to \ngrow to ever-higher levels. So, even if it were possible to stop \nemitting greenhouse gases today, that would amount to a very small chip \nin an iceberg of a problem.\n  It is also important to note that as the concentrations of \nCO2 grow, the economic impact of the problem significantly \nincreases. This is an extremely important point, because if we wait \nuntil every last bit of uncertainty is resolved, it may well be too \nlate to prevent adverse consequences to the climate system, and it will \nbe very difficult, if not impossible, to take cost-effective action.\n  Conversely, taking action can be costly. Fossil fuels, such as coal, \nwhich emit carbon dioxide are the heart of our economic engine. Thus, \nas our economy grows, we use more fossil fuels. The President came into \nWest Virginia in the election and advocated spending $2 billion, I \nbelieve, on clean coal technology. You are looking at the daddy of \nclean coal technology. I started that in 1985 with the authorization of \n$750 million. So I welcome the President's support of clean coal \ntechnology.\n  But there is another side to that coin. I said to the President, I \nhear they may provide for the costs of additional clean coal technology \nresearch by taking it out of fossil fuel research. Please don't do \nthat. That would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Yet, that is exactly what happened. The President's budget provides \nthat some of the moneys in fossil fuels research--which means coal, \noil, and gas--will be redirected. ``Redirected'' is the word--that is \nthe key word--redirected to clean coal technology. We are\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\ngoing to change that, however, and put those moneys back into fossil \nfuel research. As our economy grows, we use more fossil fuel. Stopping \nthose emissions, even just limiting those emissions, can have the \neffect of putting the breaks on a purring economy. And that is not just \ntrue of the United States, but of other nations as well, particularly \nin developing nations where economic growth is steep.\n\n  In order to solve the problem, we must develop new and cleaner \ntechnologies to burn fossil fuels as well as new methods to capture and \nsequester greenhouse gases, and we must develop renewable technology \nthat is practical and cost-effective. Such an effort will require \nvisionary leadership. Where there is no vision, the people perish. We \nneed, therefore, to muster the strength and the political courage to \ntackle the climate change challenge in innovative ways.\n  So the legislation I offer today, cosponsored by my friend, the \nerstwhile chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, calls for the \ncreation of a national strategy to define how we can meet these \nobjectives, and it organizes national research efforts and authorizes \nfunding to accomplish these goals.\n  Moreover, the legislation would establish a regime of responsibility \nand accountability in the Federal sector for the development of a \nnational climate change response strategy. The strategy includes four \nkey elements that collectively represent a new paradigm to deal with \nclimate change.\n\n  The first element defines a range of emission mitigation targets and \nimplementation dates to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas \nconcentrations in the atmosphere at a level and at a rate that would \nprevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The strategy \nwould also evaluate how each of the range of targets could achieve \nreductions in an economically and environmentally sound manner.\n  The second element calls for substantially increased private- and \npublic-sector investment in bold, innovative energy technologies.\n  The third element calls for greater research to understand how we may \nhave already altered the climate and how we can adapt to these changes \nin the future. It would help us understand, for example, how the \nchanging climate may be affecting farming, in Illinois, farming in \nFlorida, farming on the verdant hills of West Virginia--where there \nmight be flooding or drought and how we could best address it.\n  The fourth element in the paradigm calls for continuing research on \nthe science of climate change to resolve the remaining uncertainties.\n  To carry out this strategy, this legislation provides for the \ncreation of an administrative structure within the Federal government \nto accomplish these elements. It creates an office in the White House \nto coordinate and implement the strategy, and a new office in the \nDepartment of Energy that will work on long-term research and \ndevelopment of a type that is not pursued in more conventional research \nand development programs. The DOE office will focus on breakthrough \ntechnological solutions and work in cooperation with existing basic \nscience and applied technology programs to bring an increased focus to \nthe climate change problem. To ensure that these goals are achieved, \nthis bill creates an independent review board that will report to the \nCongress. Finally, the bill authorizes appropriations for these goals.\n  This is the greatest nation in the world, the greatest nation the \nworld has ever seen. It is the greatest nation when it comes to putting \nour talents to the task of advancing revolutionary change. I am \nconfident that the United States possesses the talent, the wisdom, the \ndrive, and the courage to lead a global solution to the climate change \nchallenge that we in Congress and those in the executive branch can \nrise to meet this challenge. It will task our courage, it will task our \nenergy, it will task our determination, our foresight, and certainly \nour vision. We not only have the opportunity here, but we also have the \nresponsibility to act now on behalf of those who live today, but even \nmore important, on behalf of those of the unborn who are not even yet \nknocking at the gates. We hold their future in our hands, and we should \nunderstand that. We cannot wait until my children or my grandchildren \nare standing in these Chambers, standing in the offices of power in \nWashington or elsewhere. The responsibility is right in our hands now \nand the future is right in our faces.\n\n  I am sure these are matters that will be of some controversy, but we \nmust pause to think of those of our forefathers who responded to the \nneeds of the hour when it was their time to act on behalf of their \ngeneration and their children. The responsibility is heavy, but it must \nbe met.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Stevens for his support, for \nhis cosponsorship, and for the very great strength which he will add to \nthe effort. It will be a continuing effort. It is going to take a long \ntime. It is a big, big problem, but we can't avoid it because of its \nbigness. We have to meet it.\n  Mr. President, I will welcome, as well as Mr. Stevens, any cosponsors \nwho wish to add their names to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Florida, Mr. Bill \nNelson, is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been spellbound by the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, addressing a \nproblem facing planet Earth that all too often we have ignored. Yet as \nhe so cogently has expressed, indeed, it is a problem. There is \nsomething happening out there.\n  It has been my concern that the present administration, for whatever \nreason, has chosen not to approach addressing the issue of global \nclimate change through the Kyoto accords. And because the \nadministration has so decided, it is all the more important for leaders \nsuch as Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens to speak out on a phenomenon \nthat, in fact, is occurring.\n  The scientific community is fairly unanimous. It is not totally \nunanimous. Because of that, that is used as an excuse for others to say \nthat global warming is not upon us. That counters all of the scientific \nevidence and the testimony of a vast majority of the scientific \ncommunity that it has happened.\n  We also know that there is, in fact, a correlation, as the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has stated, between the \nproduction of CO2 into the atmosphere and global warming. I \ncommend the Senator from West Virginia for offering this legislation to \ntry to get the Nation's mind focused on the problem and a comprehensive \neffort of trying to determine what we are going to do about it before \nit is too late.\n  In my previous governmental capacity, in the position of Insurance \nCommissioner of the State of Florida, I tried to sound the alarm bell, \nand it was very difficult to get people to pay attention, especially \ninsurance companies that would have a great deal to lose because global \nwarming will cause the rise of the seas. When you come from a State \nsuch as mine, that has enormous implications since most of our 16 \nmillion population is along the coast of Florida. The increase of \nglobal temperature will also cause the intensity of storms to increase, \nas well as their frequency.\n\n  Florida is a land that we call paradise, but it happens to be a \npeninsula sticking down into the middle of something known as Hurricane \nHighway. Hurricanes are a part of our life, and global warming \nforetells, for us, an increased intensity of hurricanes and an \nincreased frequency of hurricanes. That has enormous implications on \nnot only our lifestyles but our economic activity--particularly in a \nState such as Florida that has so many miles exposed to water.\n  Increased global warming also portends, for the entire globe, the \nincreased likelihood of pestilence and disease, all of which have \ntremendous impacts on us as a nation if this phenomenon occurs.\n  The Senator is so kind to stay and listen to my remarks which in \nlarge part are directed to him in my affection and appreciation for him \nand his comments and his legislation. But allow me to divert to the \nrecesses of my memory and to my mind's eye.\n  In 1986, as I looked out the window of the spacecraft Columbia, high \nabove the Earth, in Earth orbit, looking back at home that suddenly, \nover the course\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nof days in space, is not Florida or America but home becomes the \nplanet, this beautiful blue and white ball suspended in the middle of \nnothing--and space is nothing. Space goes on and on. It is an airless \nvacuum that goes on and on for billions of light-years. There in its \nmidst, suspended, is this wonderful creation called planet Earth, our \nhome. As I would look at the rim of the Earth, I could see what \nsustains all of our life. I could see the atmosphere. As I would look \nfurther, I would start to see how we are messing it up.\n  For example, in a ground track coming across South America, I could \nlook out the window of the spacecraft to the west and, because of the \ncolor contrast, even from that altitude I could see the destruction of \nthe rain forest in the upper Amazon region.\n  Then, in the same window of the spacecraft, I could look to the east \nat the mouth of the Amazon River and could see the result of the \ndestruction of the trees for the waters of the Atlantic which were \ndiscolored from the silt for hundreds of miles from the mouth of the \nAmazon. That was a result of the destruction of the trees hundreds of \nmiles upriver.\n  I came away from that experience becoming more of an \nenvironmentalist. I came away from that experience with a profound \nsense of obligation to become a better steward for our planet Earth.\n  The legislation that the Senator has offered is another step in \nattempting to get this Nation and this planet to recognize that \nsomething is changing; that we best use the best minds, the best \nscience, and the best technology to address how we can stop what seems \nto be the inevitable march of warming the temperature of this planet to \nthe point at which it could cause great destruction.\n  I thank the President for his recognition. I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his statement today and for offering this \nlegislation. I thank him for his very kind indulgence to listen to my \nremarks, which are complimentary to him for what he was offered here \ntoday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I seek recognition for only a brief \nstatement.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his observations \ntoday. He comes to the Senate as one who is different from the rest of \nus--different in that his experiences include that of being a former \nastronaut. My name is Byrd, B-Y-R-D. I don't have the wings of a bird. \nBut I have the imagination that can fly uninhibited through the \nunlimited bounds of space.\n  As the Senator from Florida spoke, I found myself traveling with him \nand looking out of the windows of his spacecraft in wonder at what has \nhappened to planet Earth, the planet that we call home.\n  I thank him for taking the floor today to tell us about his thoughts \nand about his experiences in that regard. I think he has opened up a \nnew window of understanding--certainly, to me. I thank him.\n  I look forward to hearing from Senator Nelson on future occasions and \nto working with him as we attempt to attack this growing problem. It is \none which is going to be costly. It is going to take money. We are \nseverely limited at this time. But I welcome his remarks and always in \nassociation with my own.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the bill and ask for its referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Climate Change Strategy and \nTechnology Innovation Act of 2001 asks for a commitment of the 107th \nCongress to Develop bold, innovative technologies to better understand \nglobal climate change. I thank my friend Senator Byrd for introducing \nthis Bill and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor.\n  On May 29, I chaired an Appropriations Committee field hearing in \nFairbanks, AK on the impact of global climate change on the arctic \nenvironment. Witnesses included Dan Goldin, the Head of the National \nAeronautic and Space Administration; Scott Gudes, the acting head of \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Dr. Rita Colwell, \nthe Director of the National Science Foundation, Charles Groat, the \nDirector of the U.S. Geological Survey; and experts from the \nInternational Arctic Research Center and the University of Alaska's \nGeophysical Institute. Many of the Witnesses noted that recent climate \nchange activity likely stems from a number of factors, including \nnatural variances and human activity.\n  The degree to which any particular phenomenon or activity is \ncontributing to climate change is not well understood. However, \nregardless of cause, there has been a dramatic warming trend in the \narctic areas of Alaska. Pack ice that usually insulates our coastal \nvillages from winter storms has shrunk by 3 percent a year since the \n1970's. Increased storm activity has caused significant beach erosion \nthat may displace entire communities. Sea ice is also thinner than it \nwas 30 years ago. The northwest passage has been ice free for the last \nthree years. Forests appear to moving farther north and west as the \npermafrost melts. We need better research capabilities to understand \nglobal climate change, better planning capabilities to react to climate \nchange impact, and better energy technology infrastructure to keep pace \nwith America's growing energy needs.\n  Senator Byrd's bill will create a process for the United States to \nseriously and responsibly address the climate change issue. I look \nforward to working closely with him to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the leadership \nshown by Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens with their introduction of \nthe Climate Change Strategy and Technology Innovation Act of 2001. \nSenator Byrd has shown great courage by taking action to address global \nwarming in such a forthright and courageous manner. As Livy once wrote \nof the great general Hannibal, Senator Byrd is preferred ``in any \naction which called for vigor and courage, and under his leadership the \nmen''--or in this case his colleagues in the Senate--``invariably \nshowed the best advantage of both dash and confidence.'' Senator Byrd's \nvigor and wisdom in introducing this bill are on historic parallel with \nthe acts of Hannibal.\n  I have been informed that the bill will likely be referred to the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, and as chairman of that committee, I look \nforward to reviewing it in detail. As I understand it, this legislation \nwill create an aggressive comprehensive effort within the executive \nbranch that will provide the scrutiny and creative thought that global \nwarming requires. I hope that it will be the tree off of which other \nclimate change measures will branch. As Senator Byrd has said, it is \nmeant to complement, not replace, other mitigation measures--measures \nthat must include binding targets for emissions reductions.\n  The timing for the introduction of this bill could not be better. On \nWednesday, the National Academy of Sciences released their latest \nreport on climate change at the request of the White House. The White \nHouse asked the questions, and the answer was clear: global warming is \n``real,'' is caused by human activity, and has potentially disastrous \nconsequences. Now, as President Bush prepares to go to Europe next \nweek, he must heed these disturbing findings and propose meaningful, \nbinding measures to address climate change.\n  The mandate is clear, we must take action and take action now to stop \nthe overheating of our planet. We must be aggressive and we must be \ncreative. We must harness one of our great American traditions, which \nis an unparalleled capacity for innovation, and lead the world in doing \nso. We must use flexible market structures in order to allow that \ninnovation to flourish, we must set the strict caps on emissions that \nare necessary to drive that innovation.\n  As I understand their bill, Senators Stevens and Byrd have laid out a \nprogram that will provide the framework for the United States to \naddress the dire problem of climate change. We must accept this \nchallenge and begin to take serious measures to reverse this troubling \ntrend, or future generations will suffer the consequences and remember \nus with disappointment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6000-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this past weekend I noted an article in the \nWashington Post that led with these lines:\n\n       Administration officials preparing an alternative to the \n     1997 global warming agreement that President Bush disavowed \n     in March are focusing on voluntary measures for reducing \n     greenhouse gas emissions--an approach unacceptable to most \n     U.S. allies in Europe and Japan.\n\n  Mr. President, last month, I came to this floor to urge the Bush \nadministration not to abandon the progress of the multiyear \ninternational negotiations on global climate change. In particular, I \nurged this administration not to endanger many of the gains that the \nUnited States has made in recent years as it has tried to forge a \nworkable, responsible international climate change agreement. So I \nwelcome the subsequent announcement by administration officials that \nthey intend to participate in talks on the Kyoto Protocol scheduled to \ntake place in Bonn, Germany, in July. But an insistence on the part of \nthe United States strictly on voluntary measures would certainly place \nin jeopardy such gains and would, I believe, undermine the credibility \nof our Nation at the bargaining table in the future. I cannot agree \nwith a strategy that abandons consideration of binding commitments in \nfavor of voluntary efforts alone.\n  I stand here as the chief author of Senate Resolution 98 in 1997, the \nmeasure that many on both sides of the debate paint as a fatal blow to \nratification of the Kyoto Protocol. I beg to differ with that \ndepiction. S. Res. 98, in 1997, was the voice of the Senate, the vox \npopuli, the voice of the people through their elected Representatives, \nproviding guidance to the previous administration--the administration \nat that time--as its negotiators labored to hammer out a climate change \nproposal among various international players. That resolution, which \npassed by a vote of 95-0, simply stated that any international treaty \non climate change must include binding commitments by the developing \nnations, especially the largest emitters, and also that it must not \nresult in serious harm to the U.S. economy.\n\n  It also called upon the administration to inform the legislative \nbranch, which under the Constitution of the United States is required \nto approve the ratification of treaties, as to the estimated costs of \ncommitments by the United States. We want to know what these will cost. \nAnd to date, that information has not been forthcoming. That is what we \nwere saying. Tell us what it will cost. Don't sign it; don't sign that \nprotocol until the major emitters among the developing nations of the \nworld have also signed on and have come into the boat with us. They \nneed to sign on with respect to restricting the emissions of greenhouse \ngases. It must not be the United States alone; it must not be the \nUnited States and the developed nations, the industrial nations, alone. \nWe all have a responsibility.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  So we said we want the developing nations to get into the same boat \nwith us because they are going to be impacted by the pollution that is \nemitted into the air, into the atmosphere, because it circles the \nglobe. We are not saying they have to sign up for precisely the same \nlimits we place on ourselves, or to that same degree, but they do need \nto sign on and get into this boat. Also, we want to know what it is \ngoing to cost and what kind of an impact it is going to have on U.S. \nindustries. We don't want our industries to go overseas as a result of \nan unwise signing of the protocol that would require us to continue to \nstrongly limit ourselves in ways that would encourage manufacturers in \nthis country to go abroad and to establish themselves in the developing \ncountries. Let's all get into the same boat together. There must be a \nlevel field insofar as our industries are concerned. Let's don't drive \nAmerican industries overseas.\n  It is a little like smoking a cigar in a room. I used to smoke \ncigars. I smoked for 35 years. I gave up the habit. I said, ``I am \nquitting.'' The point is that, even though I might have been the only \nperson in the room holding a lighted cigar in my hand, everybody else \nin the room was inhaling the fragrance of that cigar. And it is the \nsame way with greenhouse gases. They do circle the globe. Everybody \nbreathes the same air, not only the emitters, but also those who are \nnot the emitters.\n\n  Had the Senate merely sat on its hands in that instance and allowed \nan untenable treaty to be submitted for approval, it would have been \nrejected. That would have been the fatal blow.\n  The effect of that Senate resolution was not to kill the \nnegotiations--that was not my desire to kill the negotiations--but to \nhelp shape them, to strengthen the hand of our negotiators as they \ntried to reach an agreement that would be acceptable to the American \npeople. No treaty of such magnitude stands any real chance of success \nin this Nation without the backing of the American people. Our friends \nin foreign nations surely understand that.\n  There are also some who do not believe the proliferation of \nscientific reports that have been produced in recent years concerning \nclimate change. But the body of evidence tells us that something is \noccurring in our atmosphere at a proportion that is changing our \nclimate and that the human hand has played a role in affecting that \nchange.\n  ``I have lived a long time'', as Benjamin Franklin said when he stood \nbefore the Constitutional Convention, ``and the longer I live, the more \nconvincing proof I see that God still governs in the affairs of men.'' \nAnd so the longer I live, I see that also.\n  One of the ``affairs of men'' that I see changing is the atmosphere, \nthe circumstances in which we live every day and every night. As one \nwho has lived more than 83\\1/2\\ years, I have seen some changes taking \nplace out there in the cosmos and around the globe.\n  I cannot explain those changes. I am not a scientist. But I know that \nthe changes are taking place. The storms are more violent. The storms \nare more frequent today than they were when I was a lad walking the \nhills of Wolf Creek in Mercer County, West Virginia. The floods are \nmore frequent. The droughts are more severe, with far more costly \nresults and more often. The forest fires are more frequent, more \ncostly.\n  The winters have changed. No longer do I experience the snows that I \nexperienced as a boy in southern West Virginia in the mountains and \nhills. There is still a great deal of snow there, but not like it was \n50 years ago, 60 years ago, 70 years ago.\n  The rains are not as they were. There is something going on out \nthere. The ice masses at the two poles to the north and to the south \nare diminishing. They are melting. As they melt, conditions change \naround the globe. The waters of the seas grow higher. There is \nsomething going on out there--I know, and I am concerned about it.\n  We can waste valuable time debating and quibbling over measurements, \nmethodology, findings, and conclusions, or we can accept the simple \nreality that is right before our eyes--we feel it, we see it, we hear \nit, we read about it, we appropriate more moneys because of it--the \nreality that global warming is occurring.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am introducing the Climate Change Strategy \nand Technology Innovation Act of 2001. Senator Ted Stevens, the senior \nSenator from Alaska, a State that is almost halfway across the globe \nfrom where we stand today, has agreed to join me in this effort. This \nlegislation calls for a comprehensive strategy underpinned by credible \nscience and economics that will guide U.S. efforts to address the \nmultifaceted problem of global climate change. This legislation also \nestablishes a major research and development effort intended to develop \nthe bold breakthrough technologies that our country will need to \naddress the challenge of climate change.\n  This legislation is intended to supplement, rather than replace, \nother complementary proposals to deal with climate change in the near \nterm on both a national and international level. I also note that this \nbill is technology neutral. This is not a bill to carve out special \nbenefits for coal or oil or gas or, for that matter, for nuclear, \nrenewables, or any other energy resource or technology. This \nlegislation provides the framework for addressing the climate \nchallenge, reaffirms the ultimate goal of stabilizing atmospheric \ngreenhouse gas concentrations, and leaves the technology decisions to \nenergy experts and the marketplace.\n  An understanding as to why this legislation is necessary must begin \nwith an understanding of the fundamental causes of global climate \nchange. It is virtually indisputable that atmospheric concentrations of \ncarbon dioxide, CO2, are rising and that mankind is \ncontributing to this rise.\n  CO2 has never changed. Like H2O, it never \nchanges. H2O, two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen \nconstitute water. Water was the same in the beginning when Adam and Eve \nstrolled the paths of that Earthly paradise. Water was H2O, \nand carbon dioxide was the same, CO2. Neither has changed. \nThere are some things that do not change. That is the reason why I say \nhistory repeats itself. Human nature does not change. Cain slew Abel in \nthe heat of a sudden rage, and men are still slaying one another.\n  These rising concentrations drive global climate change, and they are \ngrowing as a result of increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. I \ndon't believe I need a scientist to tell me something is going on \nthere. Disturbingly, most greenhouse gases have a very long life span \nin the atmosphere, ranging from decades to hundreds of years. This \nmeans that what is emitted today is added to what was emitted in the \n20th century. For example, much of the CO2, much of the \ncarbon dioxide, emitted during the Second World War is still with us \ntoday, and, with each passing year, the concentration is projected to \ngrow to ever-higher levels. So, even if it were possible to stop \nemitting greenhouse gases today, that would amount to a very small chip \nin an iceberg of a problem.\n  It is also important to note that as the concentrations of \nCO2 grow, the economic impact of the problem significantly \nincreases. This is an extremely important point, because if we wait \nuntil every last bit of uncertainty is resolved, it may well be too \nlate to prevent adverse consequences to the climate system, and it will \nbe very difficult, if not impossible, to take cost-effective action.\n  Conversely, taking action can be costly. Fossil fuels, such as coal, \nwhich emit carbon dioxide are the heart of our economic engine. Thus, \nas our economy grows, we use more fossil fuels. The President came into \nWest Virginia in the election and advocated spending $2 billion, I \nbelieve, on clean coal technology. You are looking at the daddy of \nclean coal technology. I started that in 1985 with the authorization of \n$750 million. So I welcome the President's support of clean coal \ntechnology.\n  But there is another side to that coin. I said to the President, I \nhear they may provide for the costs of additional clean coal technology \nresearch by taking it out of fossil fuel research. Please don't do \nthat. That would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Yet, that is exactly what happened. The President's budget provides \nthat some of the moneys in fossil fuels research--which means coal, \noil, and gas--will be redirected. ``Redirected'' is the word--that is \nthe key word--redirected to clean coal technology. We are\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\ngoing to change that, however, and put those moneys back into fossil \nfuel research. As our economy grows, we use more fossil fuel. Stopping \nthose emissions, even just limiting those emissions, can have the \neffect of putting the breaks on a purring economy. And that is not just \ntrue of the United States, but of other nations as well, particularly \nin developing nations where economic growth is steep.\n\n  In order to solve the problem, we must develop new and cleaner \ntechnologies to burn fossil fuels as well as new methods to capture and \nsequester greenhouse gases, and we must develop renewable technology \nthat is practical and cost-effective. Such an effort will require \nvisionary leadership. Where there is no vision, the people perish. We \nneed, therefore, to muster the strength and the political courage to \ntackle the climate change challenge in innovative ways.\n  So the legislation I offer today, cosponsored by my friend, the \nerstwhile chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, calls for the \ncreation of a national strategy to define how we can meet these \nobjectives, and it organizes national research efforts and authorizes \nfunding to accomplish these goals.\n  Moreover, the legislation would establish a regime of responsibility \nand accountability in the Federal sector for the development of a \nnational climate change response strategy. The strategy includes four \nkey elements that collectively represent a new paradigm to deal with \nclimate change.\n\n  The first element defines a range of emission mitigation targets and \nimplementation dates to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas \nconcentrations in the atmosphere at a level and at a rate that would \nprevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The strategy \nwould also evaluate how each of the range of targets could achieve \nreductions in an economically and environmentally sound manner.\n  The second element calls for substantially increased private- and \npublic-sector investment in bold, innovative energy technologies.\n  The third element calls for greater research to understand how we may \nhave already altered the climate and how we can adapt to these changes \nin the future. It would help us understand, for example, how the \nchanging climate may be affecting farming, in Illinois, farming in \nFlorida, farming on the verdant hills of West Virginia--where there \nmight be flooding or drought and how we could best address it.\n  The fourth element in the paradigm calls for continuing research on \nthe science of climate change to resolve the remaining uncertainties.\n  To carry out this strategy, this legislation provides for the \ncreation of an administrative structure within the Federal government \nto accomplish these elements. It creates an office in the White House \nto coordinate and implement the strategy, and a new office in the \nDepartment of Energy that will work on long-term research and \ndevelopment of a type that is not pursued in more conventional research \nand development programs. The DOE office will focus on breakthrough \ntechnological solutions and work in cooperation with existing basic \nscience and applied technology programs to bring an increased focus to \nthe climate change problem. To ensure that these goals are achieved, \nthis bill creates an independent review board that will report to the \nCongress. Finally, the bill authorizes appropriations for these goals.\n  This is the greatest nation in the world, the greatest nation the \nworld has ever seen. It is the greatest nation when it comes to putting \nour talents to the task of advancing revolutionary change. I am \nconfident that the United States possesses the talent, the wisdom, the \ndrive, and the courage to lead a global solution to the climate change \nchallenge that we in Congress and those in the executive branch can \nrise to meet this challenge. It will task our courage, it will task our \nenergy, it will task our determination, our foresight, and certainly \nour vision. We not only have the opportunity here, but we also have the \nresponsibility to act now on behalf of those who live today, but even \nmore important, on behalf of those of the unborn who are not even yet \nknocking at the gates. We hold their future in our hands, and we should \nunderstand that. We cannot wait until my children or my grandchildren \nare standing in these Chambers, standing in the offices of power in \nWashington or elsewhere. The responsibility is right in our hands now \nand the future is right in our faces.\n\n  I am sure these are matters that will be of some controversy, but we \nmust pause to think of those of our forefathers who responded to the \nneeds of the hour when it was their time to act on behalf of their \ngeneration and their children. The responsibility is heavy, but it must \nbe met.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Stevens for his support, for \nhis cosponsorship, and for the very great strength which he will add to \nthe effort. It will be a continuing effort. It is going to take a long \ntime. It is a big, big problem, but we can't avoid it because of its \nbigness. We have to meet it.\n  Mr. President, I will welcome, as well as Mr. Stevens, any cosponsors \nwho wish to add their names to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Florida, Mr. Bill \nNelson, is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been spellbound by the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, addressing a \nproblem facing planet Earth that all too often we have ignored. Yet as \nhe so cogently has expressed, indeed, it is a problem. There is \nsomething happening out there.\n  It has been my concern that the present administration, for whatever \nreason, has chosen not to approach addressing the issue of global \nclimate change through the Kyoto accords. And because the \nadministration has so decided, it is all the more important for leaders \nsuch as Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens to speak out on a phenomenon \nthat, in fact, is occurring.\n  The scientific community is fairly unanimous. It is not totally \nunanimous. Because of that, that is used as an excuse for others to say \nthat global warming is not upon us. That counters all of the scientific \nevidence and the testimony of a vast majority of the scientific \ncommunity that it has happened.\n  We also know that there is, in fact, a correlation, as the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia has stated, between the \nproduction of CO2 into the atmosphere and global warming. I \ncommend the Senator from West Virginia for offering this legislation to \ntry to get the Nation's mind focused on the problem and a comprehensive \neffort of trying to determine what we are going to do about it before \nit is too late.\n  In my previous governmental capacity, in the position of Insurance \nCommissioner of the State of Florida, I tried to sound the alarm bell, \nand it was very difficult to get people to pay attention, especially \ninsurance companies that would have a great deal to lose because global \nwarming will cause the rise of the seas. When you come from a State \nsuch as mine, that has enormous implications since most of our 16 \nmillion population is along the coast of Florida. The increase of \nglobal temperature will also cause the intensity of storms to increase, \nas well as their frequency.\n\n  Florida is a land that we call paradise, but it happens to be a \npeninsula sticking down into the middle of something known as Hurricane \nHighway. Hurricanes are a part of our life, and global warming \nforetells, for us, an increased intensity of hurricanes and an \nincreased frequency of hurricanes. That has enormous implications on \nnot only our lifestyles but our economic activity--particularly in a \nState such as Florida that has so many miles exposed to water.\n  Increased global warming also portends, for the entire globe, the \nincreased likelihood of pestilence and disease, all of which have \ntremendous impacts on us as a nation if this phenomenon occurs.\n  The Senator is so kind to stay and listen to my remarks which in \nlarge part are directed to him in my affection and appreciation for him \nand his comments and his legislation. But allow me to divert to the \nrecesses of my memory and to my mind's eye.\n  In 1986, as I looked out the window of the spacecraft Columbia, high \nabove the Earth, in Earth orbit, looking back at home that suddenly, \nover the course\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nof days in space, is not Florida or America but home becomes the \nplanet, this beautiful blue and white ball suspended in the middle of \nnothing--and space is nothing. Space goes on and on. It is an airless \nvacuum that goes on and on for billions of light-years. There in its \nmidst, suspended, is this wonderful creation called planet Earth, our \nhome. As I would look at the rim of the Earth, I could see what \nsustains all of our life. I could see the atmosphere. As I would look \nfurther, I would start to see how we are messing it up.\n  For example, in a ground track coming across South America, I could \nlook out the window of the spacecraft to the west and, because of the \ncolor contrast, even from that altitude I could see the destruction of \nthe rain forest in the upper Amazon region.\n  Then, in the same window of the spacecraft, I could look to the east \nat the mouth of the Amazon River and could see the result of the \ndestruction of the trees for the waters of the Atlantic which were \ndiscolored from the silt for hundreds of miles from the mouth of the \nAmazon. That was a result of the destruction of the trees hundreds of \nmiles upriver.\n  I came away from that experience becoming more of an \nenvironmentalist. I came away from that experience with a profound \nsense of obligation to become a better steward for our planet Earth.\n  The legislation that the Senator has offered is another step in \nattempting to get this Nation and this planet to recognize that \nsomething is changing; that we best use the best minds, the best \nscience, and the best technology to address how we can stop what seems \nto be the inevitable march of warming the temperature of this planet to \nthe point at which it could cause great destruction.\n  I thank the President for his recognition. I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia for his statement today and for offering this \nlegislation. I thank him for his very kind indulgence to listen to my \nremarks, which are complimentary to him for what he was offered here \ntoday.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I seek recognition for only a brief \nstatement.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his observations \ntoday. He comes to the Senate as one who is different from the rest of \nus--different in that his experiences include that of being a former \nastronaut. My name is Byrd, B-Y-R-D. I don't have the wings of a bird. \nBut I have the imagination that can fly uninhibited through the \nunlimited bounds of space.\n  As the Senator from Florida spoke, I found myself traveling with him \nand looking out of the windows of his spacecraft in wonder at what has \nhappened to planet Earth, the planet that we call home.\n  I thank him for taking the floor today to tell us about his thoughts \nand about his experiences in that regard. I think he has opened up a \nnew window of understanding--certainly, to me. I thank him.\n  I look forward to hearing from Senator Nelson on future occasions and \nto working with him as we attempt to attack this growing problem. It is \none which is going to be costly. It is going to take money. We are \nseverely limited at this time. But I welcome his remarks and always in \nassociation with my own.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the bill and ask for its referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be appropriately referred.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Climate Change Strategy and \nTechnology Innovation Act of 2001 asks for a commitment of the 107th \nCongress to Develop bold, innovative technologies to better understand \nglobal climate change. I thank my friend Senator Byrd for introducing \nthis Bill and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor.\n  On May 29, I chaired an Appropriations Committee field hearing in \nFairbanks, AK on the impact of global climate change on the arctic \nenvironment. Witnesses included Dan Goldin, the Head of the National \nAeronautic and Space Administration; Scott Gudes, the acting head of \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Dr. Rita Colwell, \nthe Director of the National Science Foundation, Charles Groat, the \nDirector of the U.S. Geological Survey; and experts from the \nInternational Arctic Research Center and the University of Alaska's \nGeophysical Institute. Many of the Witnesses noted that recent climate \nchange activity likely stems from a number of factors, including \nnatural variances and human activity.\n  The degree to which any particular phenomenon or activity is \ncontributing to climate change is not well understood. However, \nregardless of cause, there has been a dramatic warming trend in the \narctic areas of Alaska. Pack ice that usually insulates our coastal \nvillages from winter storms has shrunk by 3 percent a year since the \n1970's. Increased storm activity has caused significant beach erosion \nthat may displace entire communities. Sea ice is also thinner than it \nwas 30 years ago. The northwest passage has been ice free for the last \nthree years. Forests appear to moving farther north and west as the \npermafrost melts. We need better research capabilities to understand \nglobal climate change, better planning capabilities to react to climate \nchange impact, and better energy technology infrastructure to keep pace \nwith America's growing energy needs.\n  Senator Byrd's bill will create a process for the United States to \nseriously and responsibly address the climate change issue. I look \nforward to working closely with him to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the leadership \nshown by Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens with their introduction of \nthe Climate Change Strategy and Technology Innovation Act of 2001. \nSenator Byrd has shown great courage by taking action to address global \nwarming in such a forthright and courageous manner. As Livy once wrote \nof the great general Hannibal, Senator Byrd is preferred ``in any \naction which called for vigor and courage, and under his leadership the \nmen''--or in this case his colleagues in the Senate--``invariably \nshowed the best advantage of both dash and confidence.'' Senator Byrd's \nvigor and wisdom in introducing this bill are on historic parallel with \nthe acts of Hannibal.\n  I have been informed that the bill will likely be referred to the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, and as chairman of that committee, I look \nforward to reviewing it in detail. As I understand it, this legislation \nwill create an aggressive comprehensive effort within the executive \nbranch that will provide the scrutiny and creative thought that global \nwarming requires. I hope that it will be the tree off of which other \nclimate change measures will branch. As Senator Byrd has said, it is \nmeant to complement, not replace, other mitigation measures--measures \nthat must include binding targets for emissions reductions.\n  The timing for the introduction of this bill could not be better. On \nWednesday, the National Academy of Sciences released their latest \nreport on climate change at the request of the White House. The White \nHouse asked the questions, and the answer was clear: global warming is \n``real,'' is caused by human activity, and has potentially disastrous \nconsequences. Now, as President Bush prepares to go to Europe next \nweek, he must heed these disturbing findings and propose meaningful, \nbinding measures to address climate change.\n  The mandate is clear, we must take action and take action now to stop \nthe overheating of our planet. We must be aggressive and we must be \ncreative. We must harness one of our great American traditions, which \nis an unparalleled capacity for innovation, and lead the world in doing \nso. We must use flexible market structures in order to allow that \ninnovation to flourish, we must set the strict caps on emissions that \nare necessary to drive that innovation.\n  As I understand their bill, Senators Stevens and Byrd have laid out a \nprogram that will provide the framework for the United States to \naddress the dire problem of climate change. We must accept this \nchallenge and begin to take serious measures to reverse this troubling \ntrend, or future generations will suffer the consequences and remember \nus with disappointment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE RETIRED PAY RESTORATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to proceed in morning business \nto talk about some legislation that I sponsored. It is called the \nRetired Pay Restoration Act or 2001.\n  I introduced this bill last Congress. Out of the 100 percent of the \nthings we needed to do on behalf of veterans, we maybe did 1 or 2 \npercent. There is still 98 percent to do.\n  This legislation addresses a 110-year injustice against over 560,000 \nof our Nation's veterans. We now have 64 cosponsors to S. 170. It \nclearly illustrates bipartisan support for this legislation.\n  My disappointment, though, is that this legislation passed was part \nof the budget. It was stripped out of the so-called ``conference'' that \ntook place on this bill. That is unfair.\n  Every day in America--today, tomorrow, and the next day--1,000 World \nWar II veterans die. This legislation is meant to help them.\n  What does this legislation do? We in Congress have repeatedly forced \nthe bravest men and women in our Nation--retired career veterans--to \nforego receipt of a portion of their retired pay if they happen to also \nreceive disability pay from an injury that occurred in the line of \nduty.\n  If you are an old veteran and you have a service-connected disability \nand you retired from the military, you cannot draw your disability \npension. Is that fair? No, it is not fair. S. 170 will permit retired \nmembers of the Armed Services who also have a service-connected \ndisability to receive military retirement pay and also the disability \ncompensation. That seems fair to me.\n  Also, if a veteran who had a service-connected disability retired \nfrom some other aspect of the Federal Government--from the Congress, \nfrom the Department of Energy, or from the Interior Department--they \ncould draw both pensions. But if you retire from the military, you \ncan't. That doesn't seem fair to me.\n  We are currently losing, as I have indicated, over 1,000 World War II \nveterans every day. Every day we delay acting on this legislation means \nthat we have denied fundamental fairness to thousands and thousands of \nour gallant armed service men and women. They will never have the \nability to enjoy their well-deserved pensions. They earned them. If \nthey spent 20 or more years in the military and were shot, or in some \nway hurt as a result of the service-connected disability, they earned \nthat. That is an understatement.\n  As to the budget which we have heard so much about, the \n``budgeteers'' should be ashamed of themselves. They took this out of \nthe budget. It was passed on the floor, and they stripped it from the \nbudget.\n  I want everyone to know that we have 64 cosponsors. It is bipartisan. \nI am going to look for ways of having this legislation adopted by the \nCongress and sent to the President.\n  Everyone should be alerted--Senator Levin, Senator Warner--that I am \ngoing to do everything I can to make sure it is on the Defense \nauthorization bill. I am going to do everything I can--I say to Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens--to make sure it is on the military \nappropriations bill. It is just unfair.\n  This legislation should be passed. Every day 1,000 people are denied \nbasic fairness in this country.\n  Today we have about 1.5 million of our finest serving in the defense \nof this Nation. The United States military is unmatched in power, \ntraining, and ability. This great Nation is recognized as the world's \nonly superpower--a status which is largely due to the sacrifices that \nveterans made during the last century. But rather than honoring their \ncommitment and bravery, the Federal Government has instead chosen to \nperpetuate a 110-year-old injustice.\n  Quite simply, that is disgraceful. It is an injustice. It has existed \nfor far too long. We must correct it. I am going to do everything I can \nto make sure that this passes in some form and is sent to the President \nto be signed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6004-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate, I rise to bid \nfarewell to our current class of Senate pages, who have served the \nSenate with distinction over the last five months. On behalf of the \nentire Senate, I would like to thank them for their fine work and \ntireless efforts to help the Senate run smoothly.\n  This class of pages has served during an historic time in the United \nStates Senate. When they arrived, we were still in the midst of a close \npresidential election, one that held the fate of the Senate in balance. \nWhen the election was decided, they served in an unprecedented evenly \ndivided Senate. And as they leave, they have been witness to a change \nin who is the majority. They've even served during a rare weekend \nsession. And through all of these challenges, they have maintained \nexcellent academic records.\n  Most people do not know of the rigorous nature of a Senate page's \nlife. On a typical day, the pages rise early and are in school by 6:00 \na.m. After several hours of classes, they come to the Capitol to \nprepare the Senate Chamber for the day's session by providing each \nSenator with a copy of the Senate Legislative and Executive Calendars, \nthe legislation under consideration, and the Congressional Record, as \nwell as any other document a Senator might request.\n  During the remainder of the day, they run numerous errands and \nperform a myriad of tasks, including providing Senators with the \nappropriate bills and resolution under consideration, obtaining \ndocuments one of us may want to refer to during a debate, running \nerrands between the Capitol and the Senate Office Buildings, and \nhelping out at our weekly caucus lunches.\n  The pages stay here as long as we're here, no matter how late. Once \nthe Senate has concluded business for the day, the pages return to \ntheir dorm to prepare for the next day's classes, and, we hope, to get \nsome much-needed sleep. Despite the hectic schedule, they perform their \nduties cheerfully and efficiently.\n  The presence of the pages on the Senate floor serves as a constant \nreminder to all of us here that the legislative work we perform is not \njust for our generation, but for the children and young people of our \nNation as well.\n  It is my hope that we have given the pages some insight into the need \nfor individuals to become involved in community and civic activities. \nThe future of our nation strongly depends on the generation who will \nfollow up in this august body. Perhaps a number of the current group of \npages will one day return here to serve as members of the United States \nSenate.\n  These young men and women have been an integral part of our daily \nlife here in the Senate and they have faced quite a few challenges in \nthis historic year.\n  Again, we wish the pages a fond farewell. I hope that they will take \ntheir experiences here and return to their hometowns as better citizens \nwith a greater appreciation for public service. Speaking on behalf of \nthe Senate, we wish them well in whatever endeavors they choose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the current class of pages be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n                              Senate Pages\n\n       Libby Benton, Michigan; Steve Hoffman, Vermont; Alexis \n     Gassenhuber, Wisconsin; Kelsey Walter, South Dakota; Michael \n     Henderson, South Dakota; Kathryn Bangs, South Dakota; Tristan \n     Butterfield, Montana; Lyndsey Williams, Illinois; Joshua \n     Baca, New Mexico; Andrew Smith, Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6004-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6004-S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHILDREN NEED CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals and Related Institutions recently released a new report \ntitled ``All Children Need Children's Hospitals'' that explores how \nessential children's hospitals are to the health of all children. The \nreport highlights the fact that--whether they ever enter a children's \nhospital or not--all children benefit from the far-reaching work of \nchildren's hospitals.\n  In the clinical care area, freestanding children's hospitals--which \nmake up less than 1 percent of all hospitals--treat a \ndisproportionately large share of children with highly specialized or \ncomplex conditions. For example, 46 percent of children with cancer, 45 \npercent of the children with cystic fibrosis, and 52 percent of \nchildren needing\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nheart or lung transplants are cared for by these hospitals. In their \nown communities, these percentages jump even higher.\n  In addition to providing the most specialized and medically advanced \ncare available, children's hospitals deliver preventive and primary \ncare as well. They are the safety net hospital and community provider \nfor low-income children. For example, across the Nation, more than 8 \nmillion outpatient visits and 1.6 million emergency room visits are \nmade to children's hospitals and their community clinics annually. At \nChildren's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, over 200,000 outpatient \nvisits and more than 70,000 emergency/urgent care visits occurred in \n2000. Medicaid accounts for more than 45 percent of the inpatient days \nat children's hospitals, which devote nearly half of their care to low-\nincome children. In fact, a children's hospital, on average, provides \n10 times as much inpatient care to low-income children as any other \nurban hospital.\n  For all these children, the doctors, nurses and health professionals \nat children's hospitals take a family-centered approach to health care. \nParents are considered partners in the care and treatment of their \nchildren. Children are made to feel comfortable and safe--feelings \nreinforced by in-room accommodations for families and age-appropriate \npatient rooms and playrooms. Doctors, pediatric nurses, occupational \ntherapists, social workers, dentists, and child life specialists are \namong the health professionals taught by children's hospitals to put \nfamilies first.\n  Children's hospitals train a substantial number of our children's \ndoctors. The freestanding children's hospitals--again, which comprise \nless than 1 percent of all hospitals--train 30 percent of all \npediatricians, half of all pediatric specialists, and a substantial \nmajority of pediatric researchers. Their teaching programs are \nessential to the future of the pediatric workforce and to the future of \nchildren's health care. The promise of biomedical research cannot be \nrealized for children without researchers at the bench.\n  The medical research and breakthrough discoveries conducted at \nchildren's hospitals benefit all children, preventing illnesses as well \nas advancing treatment. Children's hospitals have been the sites of \nmany historic firsts, such as the discovery of polio vaccine. \nChildren's hospitals have led the way in fetal surgery, transplants, \nadvancements in cardiac treatment, and in the care of more common \nconditions such as asthma. Their contributions to cancer research have \nled to great progress in curing childhood cancers that were untreatable \njust a few decades ago.\n  Together with pediatric departments of university medical centers, \nchildren's hospitals account for 30 percent of all NIH-funded pediatric \nresearch; and they train the great majority of future pediatric \nresearchers. Virtually all children's hospitals participate in clinical \ntrials or health services research. Research moves from bench to \nbedside rapidly at children's hospitals, allowing new discoveries to \ntransform more children's lives for the better. And these discoveries \nnot only benefit children, but adults as well. The answers to many \ncostly and painful health problems that affect adults like diabetes and \nobesity, can often be found in childhood. And many of the principles \ndiscovered in the study and treatment of children diseases, such as \ncancer, have also been applicable to adults.\n  Finally, children's hospitals' mission to improve the health of \nchildren throughout the nation doesn't stop at the hospital door. By \ndeveloping innovative programs like ``SAFE KIDS,'' children's hospitals \nfocus community attention on children's health issues, improving child \nhealth through prevention as well as cutting-edge care. They work with \nschools and communities to provide valuable services to children with \nspecial health care needs and children facing abuse.\n  I understand that children's hospitals are for all children, perhaps \nbetter than most, because I have learned that from my children's \nhospitals at home. Missouri is blessed with top-notch children's \nhospitals. Their doors are open to any child in need of care. Their \nefforts in advocacy and community work are directed to the health care \nneeds of all children. Their missions in education and research reach \nall children as well.\n  Children are different. They are not small adults. And no institution \nknows this better than a children's hospital. They provide the highest \nquality medical care, day after day, to children from all parts of the \ncountry, from the most distant rural areas to the closest inner city \nneighborhoods. They are essential to the health and health care of \nchildren today and tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6005-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred on August 8, \n1990 in San Francisco, California. Chris Minor and Jonathan Ebert were \nattacked by four Skinheads who called them ``faggots.'' Arrested and \ncharged with assault were Skinheads Brandon Rosenberg, 19, and Thomas \nE. Miles, 21. Two juvenile females were also taken into custody. \nRosenberg was arrested earlier in connection with an August 14 gay \nbashing in which he allegedly slapped David Robinson and threatened to \nbeat him up.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6005-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6005-S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           131ST FIGHTER WING\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the \ngreatest air-superiority Wings in the Nation and its great leaders. On \nJune 9th, 2001 Colonel Michael G. Brandt assumes command of the 131st \nFighter Wing, Lambert Field, Missouri from Colonel Bob Edmonds. This \nWing has tremendous aviation history and has 1,300 citizen-airmen who \nare dedicated and committed to service of their Nation.\n  The 131st Fighter Wing's mission is to achieve and maintain air \nsuperiority with the F-15 Eagle--the finest air superiority plane in \nthe world today. The Wing has been called into service to battle the \n``Great Flood'' of 1993 and has deployed to Incirlik, Turkey in support \nof Operation Northern Watch. The Wing has also supported Aerospace \nExpeditionary Force Operations, deploying to Southeast Asia and Europe \nto support Operation Southern Watch. The accomplishments of the \nleadership and the men and women of this Wing have maintained the great \nheritage of Lambert Field, and kept it one of the finest Wings in the \nNation.\n  Colonel Edmonds will relinquish command of the 131st to Colonel \nBrandt. Colonel Edmonds graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1979 as \na distinguished graduate and the top cadet in the Civil Engineering \nmajor. He was selected for a Guggenheim Fellowship at Columbia \nUniversity and graduated in 1980 with a Master of Science Degree in \nCivil Engineering. Colonel Edmonds completed Undergraduate Pilot \nTraining at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, as a distinguished graduate, and \nwas selected to fly the F-15 Eagle. He has served in numerous flying \npositions, both as an instructor pilot and a commander, and led 45 \ncombat missions with the 53rd Tactical Fighter Squadron during \nOperation Desert Storm.\n  Colonel Edmonds deserves our utmost thanks too for his tremendous \nleadership of the 131st. The men and women of the unit and the \ncommunity will be forever grateful for his contributions and \npatriotism. We will soon be seeing Colonel Edmonds on a much more \nregular basis, as he will be walking the halls of Congress as the Chief \nof Senate Legislative Affairs. His tremendous success will certainly \nfollow him there and I know we all look forward to working with him in \nthat capacity.\n  Assuming command of the 131st is certainly a highlight in Colonel \nBrandt's career. He graduated from Officer Candidate School at Lackland \nAir\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nForce Base in Texas over 30 years ago. Since then, his career \nflourished as he piloted the F-4, becoming a Veteran of conflicts from \nVietnam to Operation Northern Watch. He is also a graduate of the \nlegendary U.S. Air Force Fighter Weapons School.\n  Colonel Brandt joined the Missouri National Guard over 20 years ago. \nDuring that time he served in every capacity of Operations. He was the \nSquadron Commander of the 101st Fighter Squadron and the Operations \nGroup Commander and Vice Wing Commander of the 131st Fighter Wing. His \ndedication and talents were recognized along the way and as a reward he \nwas given ever increasing responsibility. He will now receive the \nultimate reward, command of the 131st. There is no doubt he is the best \nchoice to command the 131st. His exemplary record and knowledge of the \nMissouri National Guard, the Wing, and the community make him the right \nleader, ready to provide ``Air Superiority--Anywhere, Anytime.''\n  I am sure my colleagues will join me in thanking both Colonel Edmonds \nand Colonel Brandt for their service to this great Nation and extend \nour best wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT W. KNECHT\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nrise today to commemorate the life of Robert W. Knecht, who passed away \non Sunday at Georgetown University Hospital from colon cancer. Mr. \nKnecht's passing is a great loss to the coastal and marine policy \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Knecht began his public service career not in the coastal \nmanagement field, but working as an Upper Atmosphere Physicist for the \nNational Bureau of Standards. He then went on to serve as Laboratory \nDirector of the Environmental Services Administration. It was after \nholding those two posts, that he joined NOAA in 1967 as the Deputy \nDirector of the Environmental Research Laboratories in Boulder, CO.\n  Working with him in the early 1970s, I recall Mr. Knecht's valuable \ncontributions in crafting the Coastal Zone Management Act. It was with \nthe passage of this landmark legislation in 1972, that Mr. Knecht was \nappointed as the first Director of the National Coastal Zone Management \nProgram at NOAA. Working in this capacity for 7 years, he served to \nshape the first generation of State coastal zone management programs \nwhich continue today to protect our Nation's valuable coastal \nresources. Mr. Knecht was instrumental in the design and implementation \nof the National Coastal Management Program, particularly in enlisting \ncoastal States to participate in this federal-state partnership. He \nalso played a key role in the development of the coastal energy impact \nprogram amendments to the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1976 that \ndealt with oil and gas development.\n  In 1979, he became a Special Representative to the Secretary of \nCommerce on the United Nations Law of the Sea Negotiations. It was in \nthis position that he developed and negotiated positions on the \ninternational management of seabed mineral resources. In 1980 and 1981, \nhe was Director of the Office of Ocean Minerals and Energy at NOAA, \nworking on the implementation of new legislation for ocean thermal \nenergy conversion and deep seabed mining.\n  In 1981, Mr. Knecht left government service for academia, where he \nheld positions at the University of Virginia, University of Rhode \nIsland, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the University of \nCalifornia at Santa Barbara. In 1989, he joined the University of \nDelaware Graduate College of Marine Studies where he was the Co-\ndirector of the Center for the Study of Marine Policy for 12 years.\n  During his tenure at the University of Delaware, Mr. Knecht was a \nleader in promoting integrated coastal zone management, particularly on \nthe international level where he also served as a consultant to the \nWorld Bank. He served as the Vice President of the International \nCoastal and Ocean Organization and was a member of the Marine Area \nGovernance Committee of the Marine Board of the National Research \nCouncil. He also served as the Co-Editor-in-Chief for the international \njournal, Ocean and Coastal Management.\n  Mr. Knecht co-authored two books on ocean policy and integrated \ncoastal zone management. In his most recent book on ocean policy, he \nidentified the need for government integration of currently fragmented \nocean policies, calling for a National Ocean Council that could set \nintegrated national goals and ocean policies. I am pleased to say that \nthis idea became a reality with the Oceans Act of 2000.\n  One of Mr. Knecht's most recent accomplishments was receiving the \n1999 Julius A. Stratton Award for Leadership. This national award is \nbestowed biennially to the person or group that has made the greatest \ndifference in leading the cause for the coast. Mr. Knecht was a true \nchampion for the coast, fostering the development of the fledgling \nCoastal Zone Management Program in the early part of his career, to the \nlatter part of his career that focused on developing integrated coastal \nzone management approaches at both national and international levels.\n  With Mr. Knecht's passing we have lost a great leader in marine and \ncoastal protection. I would like to offer my deepest appreciation for \nMr. Knecht's contributions to the Nation and send my sincerest \ncondolences to his wife, Biliana Cicin-Sain, and to his family, \nfriends, and colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6006-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6006-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6006-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE \n  SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM ON TRADE RELATIONS--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 26\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 407 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended \n(19 U.S.C. 2434) (the ``Trade Act''), I am transmitting a copy of a \nproclamation that extends nondiscriminatory tariff treatment to the \nproducts of Vietnam. As an annex to the proclamation, I also enclose \nthe text of the ``Agreement Between the United States of America and \nthe Socialist Republic of Vietnam on Trade Relations,'' which was \nsigned on July 13, 2000, including related annexes and exchanges of \nletters.\n  Implementation of this Agreement will strengthen political relations \nbetween the United States and Vietnam and produce economic benefits for \nboth countries. It will also help to reinforce political and economic \nreform in Vietnam.\n  I believe that the Agreement is consistent with both the letter and \nspirit of the Trade Act. The Agreement provides for mutual extension of \nnondiscriminatory tariff treatment, while seeking to ensure overall \nreciprocity of economic benefits. The Agreement includes safeguard \narrangements designed to ensure that imports from Vietnam will not \ndisrupt the U.S. market.\n  The Agreement also facilitates and expands the rights that U.S. \nbusinesses will have in conducting commercial transactions both within \nVietnam and with Vietnamese nationals and business entities, and \nincludes provisions dealing with settlement of commercial disputes, \ninvestment, financial transactions, and the establishment of government \ncommercial offices. Vietnam also agrees to adopt standards for \nintellectual property protection that match the standards set forth in \nthe WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \nRights.\n  On June 1, 2001, I waived application of subsections 402(a) and (b) \nof the Trade Act with respect to Vietnam. I urge that Congress act as \nsoon as possible to approve, by a joint resolution referred to in \nsection 151(b)(3) of the\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nTrade Act, the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products \nof Vietnam as provided for in the Agreement.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota relative to special education costs; to \n     the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                            Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, in 1975 the Congress passed Public Law Number 94-\n     142, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and \n     provided a national framework for providing free, appropriate \n     public education to all students regardless of the level or \n     severity of disability; and\n       Whereas, Congress in its initial passage of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act declared its intent to fund \n     40 percent of special education costs; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's share of funding for \n     special education costs in Minnesota has never exceeded 15 \n     percent of total special education costs; and\n       Whereas, since the passage of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act, the states have been primarily \n     responsible for providing funding for special education \n     services; and\n       Whereas, special education services are being provided to \n     all eligible children in the state of Minnesota; and\n       Whereas, many states, including Minnesota, must provide \n     substantial state funding to fill the gaps left by Congress's \n     unfunded promise; and\n       Whereas, the recent increases in federal funds for schools, \n     including the increases in special education funding, have \n     come with substantial mandates and limitations on the use of \n     funds; and\n       Whereas, Congress is now currently debating the most \n     effective ways to improve education among the states; and\n       Whereas, the federal government is now estimating a surplus \n     of $5,600,000,000,000 over the next ten years: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota, That \n     Congress should speedily adhere to the goal set forth in the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and appropriate \n     to the states significant, genuine assistance to meet the \n     needs of students with disabilities and to relieve schools \n     from the necessity of cross-subsidizing special education \n     revenue with general education revenue. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President of the United States, the \n     President and Secretary of the Senate, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the House of Representatives, and Minnesota's Senators and \n     Representatives in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-92. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota relative to the improvement and \n     rehabilitation of waterways; to the Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works.\n\n                            Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, waterway transportation is the most efficient \n     means of transporting bulk commodities, transports more tons \n     per gallon of fuel than either rail or truck while causing \n     fewer accidents, less noise pollution, and fewer fatalities \n     and traffic delays, provides a positive quality of life to \n     the citizens of Minnesota, and is the most environmentally \n     sound mode of transportation available; and\n       Whereas, because of its geographic location, Minnesota is \n     disadvantaged by the distance commodities must travel when \n     transported between Minnesota and domestic and international \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, farm products, petroleum, coal, aggregates, \n     fertilizer, salt, iron ore, metal products, and other bulk \n     commodities needed by agriculture, industry, and the public \n     sector are essential components of commerce and vital to the \n     continued health of our national, local, and state economies; \n     and\n       Whereas, the inland waterway lock and dam system provides \n     recreational and eco-tourism opportunities to Minnesota, a \n     reliable water source of 25 billion gallons per year for \n     residential and industrial use in the Twin Cities area, and a \n     cooling source for power plants which provide over 4,800 \n     Minnesota jobs; and\n       Whereas, our transportation infrastructure enables \n     agricultural products and other exported commodities to \n     compete successfully in international markets and leads \n     toward a favorable balance of trade for our national economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, our waterway transportation infrastructure shares \n     the public waters with the natural environment; and\n       Whereas, the natural environment provides public benefits \n     such as recreation, tourism, domestic and industrial water \n     supply, and scientific and educational opportunities which \n     are also important elements to Minnesota's economy; and\n       Whereas, the Upper Mississippi River is a natural resource \n     of statewide, regional, national, and international \n     importance due to its status as one of the largest floodplain \n     areas in the world, its importance as a migratory corridor \n     for 40 percent of all North American Waterfowl and the \n     sanctuary it provides to more than 200 species of threatened, \n     endangered, or rare plants and animals; and\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes Seaway serves Minnesota by moving \n     its bulk products to domestic and foreign destinations, \n     amounting to over 65 million tons annually, including 43 \n     million tons of Minnesota iron ore to steel mills in \n     Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, although dredging and maintenance of the seaway \n     system is financed by the users, financing of the new Sault \n     Ste. Marie Lock (owned and operated by United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers) will be shared by the federal government \n     and the eight seaway states on a prorated tonnage basis, \n     requiring an estimated $18 million from the state to be paid \n     over a 50-year period; and\n       Whereas, the inland waterway system moves 17 million tons \n     of bulk commodities annually between Minnesota and the \n     eastern seaboard and Gulf states, including approximately 10 \n     million tons of agricultural products exported through gulf \n     ports; and\n       Whereas, dredging and maintenance costs of the inland \n     waterway are paid out of federal funds, and financing of \n     capital improvements to the inland waterway system is 50 \n     percent from federal funds and 50 percent from the Inland \n     Waterways Trust Fund, funded by a 20 cent per gallon fuel tax \n     paid by waterway shippers; and\n       Whereas, the river industry has been taxed on fuel since \n     1980, and since the Inland Waterways Trust Fund was \n     instituted in 1986, the Upper Mississippi River basin has \n     contributed 40 percent of the funds and received only 15 \n     percent return for capital improvements, making the Upper \n     Midwest a tax donor region to the Ohio River valley and \n     others; and\n       Whereas, the Port Development Assistance Program is the \n     vehicle to rehabilitate Minnesota's public ports on the \n     Mississippi River and Lake Superior; and\n       Whereas, this program updates and improves the operation \n     and efficiency of the ports to keep them viable and \n     competitive; and\n       Whereas, the 1996, 1998, and 2000 Minnesota legislatures \n     appropriated funds for this program, and the 2001 legislature \n     will be requested to appropriate an additional $3 million to \n     this program: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Minnesota Legislature supports \n     Minnesota's pro rata participation in financing new \n     construction at the Sault Ste. Marie Lock. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature formally recognizes the \n     Upper Mississippi River as a river of statewide significance \n     for natural, navigational, and recreational benefits. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes the critical \n     habitat restoration and rehabilitation needs on the Upper \n     Mississippi River. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes the importance of \n     inland waterway transportation to Minnesota agriculture and \n     to the economy of the state, the region, and the nation and \n     urges Congress to authorize funding to improve transportation \n     efficiency and restore the ecological values of the Upper \n     Mississippi River System. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports the continued \n     funding of the Port Development Assistance Program in \n     recognition of the essential and fundamental contribution the \n     Great Lakes and inland waterway transportation systems make \n     to Minnesota's economy and to sustainable environmental \n     programs. Be it further\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President and the Secretary of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the chair of the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     Infrastructure, and Minnesota's Senators and Representatives \n     in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-93. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota relative to amending the Railroad \n     Unemployment Insurance Act; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, numerous railroad employees have served their \n     country honorably and well in various branches of the armed \n     forces for periods in excess of 20 years; and\n       Whereas, these military veterans receive military \n     retirement pay as partial compensation for their long \n     military service; and\n       Whereas, if these veterans work for nonmilitary employers \n     they can become eligible for state unemployment benefits in \n     case of layoff and for workers' compensation in case of \n     injury; and\n       Whereas, the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (United \n     States Code, title 45, section 354(a-1)(ii)) prohibits \n     payment of railroad unemployment benefits or railroad \n     sickness benefits to otherwise eligible railroad employees \n     who are receiving military retirement pay for 20 years or \n     more of military service: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Minnesota, That \n     it petitions the United States Congress to promptly amend the \n     Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act to allow railroad \n     employees collecting military retirement pay to also be \n     eligible for railroad unemployment and sickness benefits if \n     they otherwise meet the qualifications of these benefit \n     programs. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President of the United States, the \n     President and the Secretary of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and Minnesota's Senators and Representatives \n     in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. HAGEL (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n       S. 1006.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fair Treatment \nfor Precious Metals Investors Act.\n  Investors may be surprised to discover that investments in precious \nmetals are taxed as ``collectibles'' similar to vintage wines and rate \ncoins, subjecting them to higher capital gains tax rates than other \ncommodities.\n  Historically, precious metals bullion has been a rarity, and was \nvalued more for its uniqueness than for its metal content, but today, \nprecious metals bullion coins are specifically designed and produced by \ngovernments to be used as an investment vehicle similar to stocks and \nbonds.\n  Precious metals bullion can be a valuable and stable asset for \ninvestors, but as long the Tax Code penalizes investment in precious \nmetals, this commodity will remain largely unattractive.\n  The Fair Treatment for Precious Metals Investors Act will update the \ntax classification of precious metals bullion (that is, gold, silver, \nand platinum), and give precious metals holdings the same capital gains \ntax preference that stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other capital \nassets are currently afforded.\n  Precious metals are vital to Nevada's and our nations economy.\n  Nevada is the third largest producer of gold in the world, behind \nAustralia and South Africa, giving the United States a trade surplus of \ngold exceeding $1 billion.\n  Undoubtedly, much of the gold that the United States Government uses \nto produce its gold bullion coins comes from Nevada.\n  Gold has been valued for centuries, and it continues to be an \nimportant commodity to investors today.\n  Although the value of stocks and other investment commodities may \nfluctuate drastically, gold's value has remained relatively stable over \ntime.\n  In today's volatile market environment, gold's stability promises to \nmake it an even more attractive investment.\n  Only in the last 30 years have governments such as the United States, \nCanada, Mexico, Australia, Austria, and South Africa minted precious \nmetals bullion coins to serve as a way for investors to diversify their \nholdings with tangible assets. Prior to that time, precious metals \nbullion was a rarity, and was valued more for its uniqueness than for \nits metal content. Today, bullion is used as a safe, convenient, and \naffordable way to invest in precious metals.\n  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act corrected the Tax Code to allow \nprecious metals bullion coins held in IRA accounts to be taxed at the \nsame rate as stocks and other capital assets. The Tax Code simply needs \nto be updated to further accommodate the changes in investor \nopportunities and preferences.\n  I am pleased that Senators Allard and Ensign have agreed to cosponsor \nthis bill. I look forward to receiving the support of other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle to correct this tax inequity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to develop the \nUnited States Climate Change Response Strategy with the goal of \nstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a \nlevel that would prevent dangerous anthrogenic interference with the \nclimate system, while minimizing adverse short-term and long-term \neconomic and social impacts, aligning the Strategy with United States \nenergy policy, and promoting a sound national environmental policy, to \nestablish a research and development program that focuses on bold \ntechnological breakthroughs that make significant progress toward the \ngoal of stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, to establish \nthe National Office of Climate Change Rsponse within the Executive \nOffice of the President, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1008\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Change Strategy and \n     Technology Innovation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change;\n       (2) in 1992, the Senate ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'';\n       (3) although science currently cannot determine precisely \n     what atmospheric concentrations are ``dangerous'', the \n     current\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\n     trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a \n     continued rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere, not stabilization;\n       (4) the remaining scientific uncertainties call for \n     temperance of human actions, but not inaction;\n       (5) greenhouse gases are associated with a wide range of \n     human activities, including energy production, \n     transportation, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, \n     buildings, and other activities;\n       (6) the economic consequences of poorly designed climate \n     change response strategies, or of inaction, may cost the \n     global economy trillions of dollars;\n       (7) a large share of this economic burden would be borne by \n     the United States;\n       (8) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere will require transformational change in the global \n     energy system and other emitting sectors at an almost \n     unimaginable level--a veritable industrial revolution is \n     required;\n       (9) such a revolution can occur only if the revolution is \n     preceded by research and development that leads to bold \n     technological breakthroughs;\n       (10) over the decade preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act--\n       (A) energy research and development budgets in the public \n     and private sectors have declined precipitously and have not \n     been focused on the climate change response challenge; and\n       (B) the investments that have been made have not been \n     guided by a comprehensive strategy;\n       (11) the negative trends in research and development \n     funding described in paragraph (10) must be reversed with a \n     focus on not only traditional energy research and \n     development, but also bolder, breakthrough research;\n       (12) much more progress could be made on the issue of \n     climate change if the United States were to adopt a new \n     approach for addressing climate change that included, as an \n     ultimate long-term goal--\n       (A) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system; and\n       (B) a response strategy with 4 key elements consisting of--\n       (i) definition of interim emission mitigation targets \n     coupled with specific mitigation approaches that cumulatively \n     yield stabilized atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       (ii) a national commitment--\n\n       (I) to double energy research and development by the United \n     States public and private sectors; and\n       (II) in carrying out such research and development, to \n     provide a high degree of emphasis on bold, breakthrough \n     technologies that will make possible a profound \n     transformation of the energy, transportation, industrial, \n     agricultural, and building sectors of the United States;\n\n       (iii) climate adaptation research that focuses on response \n     actions necessary to adapt to climate change that may have \n     occurred or may occur under any future climate change \n     scenario; and\n       (iv) continued research, building on the substantial \n     scientific understanding of climate change that exists as of \n     the date of enactment of this Act, that focuses on resolving \n     the remaining scientific, technical, and economic \n     uncertainties, to aid in the development of sound response \n     strategies; and\n       (13) inherent in each of the 4 key elements of the response \n     strategy is consideration of the international nature of the \n     challenge, which will require--\n       (A) establishment of joint climate response strategies and \n     joint research programs;\n       (B) assistance to developing countries and countries in \n     transition for building technical and institutional \n     capacities and incentives for addressing the challenge; and\n       (C) promotion of public awareness of the issue.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to implement the new approach \n     described in section 2(12) by developing a national focal \n     point for climate change response through--\n       (1) the establishment of the National Office of Climate \n     Change Response within the Executive Office of the President \n     (referred to in this section as the ``White House Office'') \n     to develop the United States Climate Change Response Strategy \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Strategy'') that--\n       (A) incorporates the 4 key elements of that new approach;\n       (B) is supportive of and integrated in the overall energy, \n     transportation, industrial, agricultural, forestry, and \n     environmental policies of the United States;\n       (C) takes into account--\n       (i) the diversity of energy sources and technologies;\n       (ii) supply-side and demand-side solutions; and\n       (iii) national infrastructure, energy distribution, and \n     transportation systems;\n       (D) provides for the inclusion and equitable participation \n     of Federal, State, tribal, and local government agencies, \n     nongovernmental organizations, academia, scientific bodies, \n     industry, the public, and other interested parties;\n       (E) incorporates new models of Federal-State cooperation;\n       (F) defines a comprehensive energy technology research and \n     development program that--\n       (i) recognizes the important contributions that research \n     and development programs in existence on the date of \n     enactment of this Act make toward addressing the climate \n     change response challenge; and\n       (ii) includes an additional research and development agenda \n     that focuses on the bold, breakthrough technologies that are \n     critical to the long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere;\n       (G) includes consideration of other efforts to address \n     critical environmental and health concerns, including clean \n     air, clean water, and responsible land use policies; and\n       (H) incorporates initiatives to promote the deployment of \n     clean energy technologies developed in the United States and \n     abroad;\n       (2) the establishment of the Interagency Task Force, \n     chaired by the Director of the White House Office, to serve \n     as the primary mechanism through which the heads of Federal \n     agencies work together to develop and implement the Strategy;\n       (3) the establishment of the Office of Carbon Management \n     and the Center for Strategic Climate Change Response within \n     the Department of Energy--\n       (A) to manage, as their primary responsibility, an \n     innovative research and development program that focuses on \n     the bold, breakthrough technologies that are critical to the \n     long-term stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in \n     the atmosphere; and\n       (B) to provide analytical support and data to the White \n     House Office, other agencies, and the public;\n       (4) the establishment of an independent review board--\n       (A) to review the Strategy and annually assess United \n     States and international progress toward the goal of \n     stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system; and\n       (B) to assess--\n       (i) the performance of each Federal agency that has \n     responsibilities under the Strategy; and\n       (ii) the adequacy of the budget of each such Federal agency \n     to fulfill the responsibilities of the Federal agency under \n     the Strategy; and\n       (5) the establishment of offices in, or the carrying out of \n     activities by, the Department of Agriculture, the Department \n     of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     other Federal agencies as necessary to carry out the \n     amendment made by section 4.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1914 just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1914) to extend for 4 additional months the \n     period for which chapter 12 of title 11 of the United States \n     Code is reenacted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is once again passing \nlegislation to retroactively renew Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, \nwhich protects family farmers and helps them prevent foreclosures and \nforced auctions of their farms.\n  While I strongly support providing our family farmers with bankruptcy \nprotection so they can continue farming the land, it is time for \nCongress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code. \nToo many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in bankruptcy \ncourts across the country when temporary extensions of the chapter \nexpire. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact Chapter \n12 on a permanent basis.\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\n  Less than two months ago, Congress passed H.R. 254 to retroactively \nrenew Chapter 12 since it expired on July 1, 2000. H.R. 254, however, \nrenewed the family farmer bankruptcy protections until only June 1, \n2001. Now Congress must once again pass narrow legislation to \nretroactively renew Chapter 12. This time H.R. 1914 renews Chapter 12 \nfor four additional months--until October 1, 2001.\n  As I did on final passage of H.R. 254, I again commend Representative \nNick Smith and Representative Tammy Baldwin for their leadership in \nworking together to secure House passage of legislation to \nretroactively renew Chapter 12. Thanks to their bipartisan efforts the \nHouse of Representatives passed H.R. 1914 on June 6 by a vote of 411-1.\n  Senator Carnahan and Senator Bond introduced similar legislation to \nhelp our family farmers forced into the bankruptcy process. On behalf \nof family farmers in Missouri and across the country, I commend them \nfor their bipartisan efforts as well.\n  During the debate earlier this year on comprehensive changes to the \nbankruptcy system, some proponents of the controversial reform bill \nclaimed that it must be passed to restore Chapter 12 to the Bankruptcy \nCode. I hope today's action to pass a stand alone Chapter 12 bill will \nmake it clear to all that the Senate does not have to pass a mammoth \nbankruptcy reform bill to provide family farmers with bankruptcy \nprotection. I also hope today's action will put an end to any efforts \nto use Chapter 12 as leverage to enact controversial bankruptcy reform \nlegislation. Our family farmers deserve better.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 1914 to retroactively give our \nfamily farmers bankruptcy protection if they fall on hard times. It is \nnow time for Congress to permanently establish Chapter 12 as part of \nthe Bankruptcy Code to provide a secure safety net for our nation's \nfamily farmers.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1914) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/08/senate-section/article/S6017-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
