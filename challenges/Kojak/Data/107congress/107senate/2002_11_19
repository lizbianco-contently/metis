The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thompson (for Gramm) Amendment No. 4901, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Daschle (for Lieberman) Amendment No. 4911 (to Amendment \n     No. 4901), to provide that certain provisions of the Act \n     shall not take effect.\n       Daschle (for Lieberman) Amendment No. 4953 (to Amendment \n     No. 4911), of a perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 10:30 a.m. shall be divided, with 30 minutes under the control of \nthe two leaders or their designees, and 30 minutes under the control of \nthe Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have under the order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought I had 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada asked that \nthe time in the beginning be charged to both sides.\n  Mr. BYRD. OK. That is fair enough.\n  Mr. President, many Senators feel that they are under great pressure \nfrom the administration to pass this bill that is before us--a bill \nthat contains 484 pages. Here it is. This is the 484-page bill that was \npassed by the House of Representatives--a new bill, passed by the House \nquickly, without adequate debate, dumped into the laps of Senators, and \nwe contributed to our own problem by invoking cloture on the amendment \nlast Friday. We are coming around the final lap of our 30-hour journey \nnow. We have been unable to call up any amendments, other than the \npending amendment by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lieberman.\n  As I say, many of our colleagues feel they are under great pressure \nfrom the administration to support this bill, and the White House is \nattempting to say that by adopting the amendment offered by Mr. Daschle \non behalf of Mr. Lieberman--the White House would have us believe and \nthe Republican-controlled House would have Members believe that if this \namendment by Mr. Daschle is adopted, this would mean the death of the \nbill. Well, I would hope that were true because I think this is a \nterrible bill. It has some good provisions in it, but it is a bad bill. \nSo personally, I would hope that were true. But it is not true.\n  The House has a duty to return. The House has dumped this bill into \nthe laps of the Senate and then walked away, gone home for \nThanksgiving, gone home for Christmas, gone home for the year--if it \ncan get by with it. But the House has a duty to come back and finish \nits work. So I hope Senators will not be moved, will not be pressured \ninto believing that the adoption of this amendment will kill the bill. \nThat is untrue.\n  Congress has not adjourned sine die yet. So we all have a duty to \nstay here and do our work.\n  I think we are going to get a pay raise very soon--perhaps early next \nyear--and so we can stay around and do our work. It is our duty to the \npeople. We ought to try to improve this bill, and the amendment by Mr. \nDaschle will do that.\n  Do those who believe that the President--whatever party he is, \nDemocrat or Republican--do those who believe that he is king under our \nConstitution--apparently some Senators here vote as though they think \nthe President is king, although they know better than that. But still \nthey believe they have to follow the President's direction.\n  The President did not bring any of us here. The President did not \nelect any of the Members of this body. This is an independent body. \nThis is an independent branch of Government. This is a separate branch \nof Government. No President elects any Member of this body. The \nPresident is just the Chief Executive of the land. I say ``just.'' It \nis a tremendous office, of course, with great power, but he is no king. \nAnd we are not sent here by our people to let the President or the \nWhite House or any party control us or dictate to us.\n  As a reminder of what a true Senator should be, I call attention to \nthat ancient Roman Emperor whose name was Vespasia. He was Emperor of \nthe Roman Empire from the years 69 to 79 A.D. A great Senator, one of \nthe truly great Senators, was Helvidius Priscus.\n  For some reason, this Senator and the Emperor Vespasia got at cross-\npurposes, and the Emperor stopped Helvidius Priscus one day outside the \nRoman Senate and told him not to come in. ``You can forbid me to be a \nSenator,'' said Helvidius Priscus, ``but as long as I am a Senator, I \nmust come in.''\n  ``Come in then and be silent,'' said the Emperor Vespasia.\n  ``Question me not, and I will be silent,'' responded the Senator.\n  ``But I am bound to question you,'' said the Emperor Vespasia.\n  ``And I am bound to say what seems right to me,'' responded the \nSenator.\n  ``But if you say it, I will kill you,'' the Emperor warned.\n  ``When did I tell you that I was immortal? You will do your part, and \nI will do mine,'' responded the Senator. ``It is yours to kill and mine \nto die without quailing.''\n  So both did their parts. Helvidius Priscus spoke his mind. The \nEmperor Vespasia killed him.\n  In this effeminate age, it is instructive to read of courage. There \nare Members of the Senate and House who are terrified, apparently, if \nthe President of the United States tells them, urges them to vote a \ncertain way, which may be against their belief.\n  So in this day of few men with great courage--relatively few--let us \ntake a leaf out of Roman history and remember Helvidius Priscus.\n  The Senate has rolled over with regard to the homeland security bill. \nThe administration has sold a bill of goods to the American people that \nthere is an\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\nurgency for the Senate to pass this bill before another terrorist \nattack. There is no such urgency. The real danger is not when the \nreorganization will take effect but whether the reorganization will \ndistract our homeland security agencies from their primary mission of \nprotecting the homeland.\n  The Senate shares in the complicity in pushing this sense of urgency \non the American people. The people who will be protecting the public, \nthose who will be protecting us, Members of the House and Senate, once \nthis reorganization is completed a year from now--a year from the date \nof passage of this legislation--are the same people who are out there \non the northern border right now, right today. They were there last \nnight. The same people are already on the southern border. They are \nalready at the ports of entry. They are guarding the Atlantic coast. \nThey are guarding the Pacific coast. They are guarding the gulf coast. \nThey are the same people then who are out on those posts of duty now. \nSo whether or not we pass this bill does not mean a great deal insofar \nas the safety of the American people is concerned.\n  The Appropriations Committee of the Senate and the Senate itself have \nprovided funds for the protection of this country, billions of dollars, \nwhich have been turned down by the President of the United States. He \nhas rejected these funds. He did so earlier this year when Congress \npassed an appropriations bill, making $5.1 billion available for use, \nwith only the flourish of a pen necessary on the part of the President.\n  These were designated as emergency funds by the Congress, but the \nPresident refused to likewise designate these items as emergency funds. \nSo those funds have gone begging. Do not let anybody tell you we have \nto pass this bill in order to have the security of this country \ntomorrow or next week or the next month. The moneys have been there to \nprovide homeland security for the American people. Those funds have \nbeen passed by this Congress months ago. This President--this President \nwho is urging the Congress to act quickly on this bill--has not acted \nquickly on those funds. As a matter of fact, he has turned the back of \nhis hand to those funds.\n  The Senate shares complicity in pushing this sense of urgency on the \nAmerican people. Senators have pushed it so often and so hard that they \nnow believe it. Last Friday, the Senate invoked cloture on the bill \nthat is before the Senate, a bill that it had hardly read.\n  Most Senators, I believe, had not read that bill at that time. I had \nnot been able to read the whole bill at that time.\n\n  This cloture limits the ability of the Senate to debate and offer \namendments. We had 30 hours. What happened? One amendment is offered. \nMr. Daschle offered one amendment on behalf of Mr. Lieberman. That was \nit. The whole 30 hours have been spent on that one amendment. Our \nRepublican friends deemed it so, to have one amendment. You are going \nto spend the whole 30 hours on it. That is the only amendment you are \ngoing to have.\n  So Senators can now read it and weep. They voted to invoke cloture on \nthemselves and they denied themselves the possible opportunity to offer \nother amendments. Senators no longer cared what bill passed as long as \nthey voted for something that would create a new Homeland Security \nDepartment. In the process of trying to build a Homeland Security \nDepartment, this Senate has come dangerously close to building a \nmassive chamber of secrets. This past weekend, Homeland Security \nDirector Tom Ridge appeared on several of the Sunday morning talk shows \nto assuage concerns that the administration is planning to create a new \ndomestic spy agency in the United States. When asked about his trip to \nLondon to study the British model domestic spy agency, Governor Ridge \nsaid his trip was very revealing, but that the administration was not \nlikely to create such a domestic spy agency in the United States.\n  I must give Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge an A+ for invoking \nthe Constitution. He mentioned the Constitution more than once. I \ncompliment him on that. That is the first administration official that \nI have heard say anything about the Constitution in all of these \ndebates with respect to the war on Iraq, the Iraq resolution, and with \nrespect to homeland security. I am sure something could have been said \nthat escaped my attention. I cannot hear every administration official. \nBut for once the U.S. Constitution was mentioned--more than once--by \nMr. Ridge. I almost stood in my family room and applauded him for doing \nso.\n  A number of Senators appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows and \nassured the show's viewers that, if such a domestic agency were \ncreated, the Congress would exercise appropriate oversight to ensure \nthat abuses of power did not occur within it.\n  I remember hearing these same kinds of comments with regard to the \ncreation of a new Homeland Security Department. ``A new Department \nwon't solve anything,'' said the White House spokesman. That was not \ntoo long ago. The White House spokesman said a new Department would not \nsolve anything. Then to everyone's surprise, the President suddenly \nmade the creation of a new Homeland Security Department his top \npriority.\n  The President sought broad authority in the plan he presented to the \nCongress. He wanted the authority to reorganize and run this new \nDepartment with limited congressional interference. He wanted to hide \ndecisionmaking within the new Department from the American public and \nthe press. He wanted what he called ``managerial flexibility'' to waive \nstatutory protections, for example, for Federal employees within the \nnew Department. He wanted to free himself from as much congressional \noversight as possible.\n  Members of Congress said they would exercise appropriate oversight to \nensure this new bureaucracy could be reigned in, but what has the \nSenate actually done? What can it point out in all of these months and \nweeks of consideration? This homeland security bill authorizes this new \nDepartment to cloak its actions in secrecy. The President's plan, for \nexample, for reorganization of this Department, has not been sent to \nthe Congress. The President probably doesn't even know himself yet what \nhe plans. He has several months in which to do that. Even then, the \nplan will not require congressional approval. The Congress will be \ninformed by the President what the plan is under this bill. That is it. \nJust inform us, Mr. President. Let us know what you will do. No \napproval is required of Congress. So we are going to be a pig in a poke \nhere. We are going to approve the President's plan in advance. Even \nbefore he knows what is in his plan, before he sends it to the \nCongress, we are going to approve it when this bill before the Senate \nis passed.\n\n  It provides broad new authorities to the President without any real \nmechanism to ensure that those powers are not abused. I sought to offer \nan amendment earlier when Mr. Lieberman brought his bill from his \ncommittee when he and Mr. Thompson had worked in the committee to bring \nout a bill and did bring out a bill. I sought to amend it so as to keep \nCongress in the loop with respect to the President's organizational \nplan. I sought to have Congress continue to stay in the mix. But that \namendment was rejected. It would have been well to have had such an \namendment because it would have provided for an orderly process in the \nfilling in of the Department by the various agencies. I understand \nthere are about 28 agencies and offices that will go into the \nDepartment. Even Mr. Lieberman, the author of that, one of the authors \nof the bill, and he is here in the Chamber, even he voted against my \namendment.\n  Today I think that amendment would help. If that amendment had been \nadopted, I think it would have assured the American people that their \nelected Representatives in Congress were going to stay in the mix, and \nit was not going to relegate itself to the sideline. But that is water \nover the dam.\n  This legislation allows the President to rewrite the civil service \ncode for Federal workers within the new Departments so that most new \nrules go into effect without any congressional approval. Congress has \nrolled over on almost every issue that would have provided the Congress \nwith some oversight mechanism and the public with some transparency.\n  So here we are, on this day, we are going to vote in all likelihood \non final passage, and the Congress has done precious little to make \nsure that appropriate safeguards are included in the\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nlegislation to protect the privacy rights and civil liberties of the \nAmerican public. What is more, we have endangered the constitutional \ndoctrines of the separation of powers and checks and balances between \nthe President and the Congress.\n  What do we hear from supporters of the bill? The American people \nshould trust the President, they should trust their elected leaders to \nensure the mass of new bureaucracy will not intrude upon their private \nlives. How can Senators make such arguments? The administration has \ntold us it is not planning to create a new domestic spy agency in the \nUnited States. Yet within this bill, this language would fund the total \ninformation or authorize funding of this total information awareness \nprogram that is being developed by the Pentagon, apparently for one \npurpose: to peer into the daily transactions and private lives of every \nAmerican.\n  I urge Senators to vote for this amendment. I hope they will vote for \nit, and I hope they will not be cajoled by disingenuous arguments that \na vote for the amendment is a vote against the homeland security bill. \nI don't buy that argument. If we amend this bill, it is beyond our \ncontrol in the Senate, but it is the Senate's last chance to show the \nAmerican people that we are serious about placing some controls over \nthis massive new bureaucracy.\n\n  I hope the Senate will support the amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I reserve my 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. May I inquire how much time the majority leader or his \ndesignee has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask the Chair notify me when I have consumed 15 \nminutes so I can preserve the rest for the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the \nmotion to strike which Senator Daschle and I and others have \nintroduced.\n  I do so, as my colleagues know, believing deeply in the urgent need \nfor a Department of Homeland Security and believing deeply that the \nvast majority of the underlying bill rises to the difficult and \ncritical challenge of organizing and equipping our Government to \nprotect the American people from terrorism. Of course, there are parts \nof the bill that I wish had been somewhat different, but in the nature \nof the legislative process one never achieves everything one wants, and \nthat goes particularly to the long-debated sections on the rights of \nFederal workers whom we will now ask to carry out the work of the \nHomeland Security Department.\n  But on balance, the core of this bill is not only urgently necessary, \nit is good. The core of the bill is smart, and the core of the bill is \nvital. But I must register my strong opposition to a number of \nprovisions in the bill that now appears before us that have been \ninserted at the last moment and that threaten to do serious damage to \nthis otherwise urgently necessary piece of legislation. I fear that \nsome of our colleagues have seized upon the likely passage of this bill \nas an opportunity to load it up with unwise, inappropriate, and hastily \nconsidered provisions, many of which protect special interests. That is \na shame, and it is an embarrassment.\n  A common cause as urgent and weighty as homeland security post \nSeptember 11, 2001, should not be tainted by a bevy of last-minute \nfavors, surprises, and slapdash attempts to address controversial \nproblems, some of which are totally unrelated to homeland security. \nThat should not be the way business is done in the Congress of the \nUnited States, especially not with so profound an underlying \nresponsibility as protecting the American people from terrorism.\n  Let me dispense with two myths that have reared their heads on the \nfloor of the Senate during this debate on the motion to strike. First, \nsome opponents of the amendment have suggested that to alter the \nunderlying bill in any way would be to kill homeland security \nlegislation in this 107th session of Congress. That is just not right. \nThe House passed a new homeland security bill, numbered H.R. 5710, \nwhich means they will have to return to act on the version of the bill \nsent to them by the Senate whether or not we make any changes. So we \nare certainly not killing this bill for this session. We are simply \ntrying to clean it up.\n  Second, some of my colleagues are saying that a vote for this motion \nto strike is a vote against the President. That, unfortunately, reminds \nme of what became a familiar refrain in some States during the recently \nconcluded elections, in which some seemed to suggest that any \nopposition to anything the President wanted was unpatriotic. Here is \nwhere I borrow from Senator Byrd in saying that the President is the \nPresident, not the king. And to question the President's judgment on \none or another matter should not be described as a lack of patriotism. \nIt is through free discussion and exchange of ideas that our Nation \ngrows and that we have always believed we would achieve the truth. Was \nit Voltaire who said: I disagree with everything you said but will \nfight to the death to protect your right to say it? So, too, here.\n  I believe deeply that the seven extraneous provisions our amendment \ntargets have hurt this bill, and that is why we are striking them. Six \nwould be struck, and a seventh would be amended. None of these \nprovisions goes to the heart of the Department that I believe so \nurgently should be created. I certainly would not want to do that, \nsince Senator Specter and I and so many others of both parties have \nspent, now, more than a year in trying to achieve the creation of such \na Department.\n\n  Let me speak about a few of the seven serious shortcomings in this \ncurrent version of the homeland security legislation that our amendment \nwould strike. First, the one that has received the most attention, is \nthe one that attacks the childhood vaccine liability. This bill \nincludes a surprise provision, one that was not in any version of \nhomeland security legislation, and we have gone through, by my count, \nat least six versions: The original bill I cosponsored with Senator \nSpecter in October 2001; the Governmental Affairs Committee reported-\nout bill in May; the President's proposal in June; the revised \nGovernmental Affairs bill in July; the original House bill; and the \noriginal Gramm-Miller substitute. None of these contains this \nlegislation which would dramatically alter the way certain vaccine \npreservatives are treated for liability purposes under the law.\n  As my colleagues have said, the bill would take complaints about \nvaccine additives out of the courts and require them to be made through \nwhat is called the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which \nhandles other vaccine-related claims. Incidentally, these provisions of \nthe bill are retroactive, which would mean that a host of existing \nlawsuits would be interrupted, probably terminated, including claims \ninvolving the mercury-based preservative Thimerosal, which some have \ncharged is related to autism in children.\n  This is just plain unfair. In the past, I have supported various tort \nreform or liability protections for companies--certainly the ones that \ndesign and manufacture lifesaving products. In 1998, for instance, \nSenator McCain and I sponsored, and the Senate passed, the Biomaterials \nAccess Assurance Act. In this Congress, I introduced a bill that would \noffer a comprehensive package of incentives to biotech and \npharmaceutical companies that develop vaccines, antidotes, and other \ncountermeasures for biological and chemical weapons, a package that \nincluded liability protections. But this amendment would strike a \nprovision in this bill that goes well beyond that and ought to be \npulled out of the underlying bill.\n  The fact is that committees of the House and Senate have been \nstruggling to reach a consensus on this question of the childhood \nvaccines and liability for some period of time now. They have been \ntrying to craft a broad and balanced bill on childhood vaccines. This \nprovision in this bill, which we would strike, would pull the rug right \nout from under the committee deliberations, offering a quick but unfair \nanswer that is sure to do more harm than good.\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\n  I received late last night--and we are going to try to distribute it \nto our colleagues this morning--a Dear Colleague letter from our friend \nand colleague in the other body, Dan Burton, chairman of the House \nCommittee on Government Reform, really crying out to us to strike from \nthe underlying bill this provision on childhood vaccines. Congressman \nBurton, to whom I have spoken, believes passionately that this is a \nterrible mistake and very unfair. I am far from expert on this question \nand cannot vouch for all that Congressman Burton asserts, but his \npassion cries out from this letter and I wish to cite several excerpts \nto illustrate the depth and complexity of this debate. For instance, \nCongressman Burton says:\n\n       During the past 24 hours, a number of incorrect statements \n     have been made about the vaccine provisions in the Homeland \n     Security Act. The facts are simple. These provisions severely \n     restrict the legal rights of parents who believe their \n     children have suffered neurological damage due to vaccines. \n     The scientific debate remains unresolved. These provisions do \n     not belong in the Homeland Security Act. I hope the following \n     points will help separate fact from fiction.\n\n  Again, from Dan Burton:\n\n       In 2001, the respected Institute of Medicine concluded that \n     a connection between thimerosal and autism, while unproven, \n     is ``biologically plausible.'' The IOM called for further \n     research, stating, ``the evidence is inadequate to accept or \n     reject a causal relationship between exposure to thimerosal \n     from vaccines and neurological developmental disorders of \n     autism, ADHD, and speech and language delays.''\n\n  Another fiction, according to Congressman Burton, is that the \nsections that we intend to strike with our motion from this underlying \nbill do not eliminate the rights of vaccine-injured individuals to sue \nmanufacturers of vaccines and their components. Congressman Burton says \nproponents of these provisions have stated that once individuals have \ngone through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, they can still \nchoose to file a civil lawsuit. And Congressman Burton feels very \nstrongly that is wrong. As he says as a fact, ``for many families who \nbelieve their children were injured by mercury-based Thimerosal, these \nprovisions do eliminate their right to file suits. The Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program has a narrow 3-year statute of limitations. \nBecause many families were unaware of the program, they were unable to \nfile a petition on time. Sections 1714-1717, which we would strike, \ntake away their only remaining legal recourse.''\n  I would add that I have received today a statement of opinion from \nthe staff of the Senate Finance Committee which points out another \nproblem. It states, ``the Joint Committee on Taxation has advised the \nCommittee on Finance that absent changes to the Internal Revenue Code, \nthese changes would not be effective to change the approved \ndisbursement purposes from the Fund.''\n  In other words, by keeping this childhood vaccine provision in this \nhomeland security legislation, we would not only remove the families' \nrights to sue, we would force them to go to the compensation fund. But \nbarring additional changes in the law, they couldn't receive any funds \nfrom that fund.\n  This is not only wrong but shows how quickly and hastily and \nincompletely this provision was put together.\n  Congressman Burton's words speak loudly to us of how critical it is \nto strike this provision from the law.\n  Some of our colleagues have tried to make the case that the \nprovisions are necessary to maintain a plentiful vaccine supply in case \nof a bioterror attack, including a smallpox attack. Wrong. This has \nnothing to do with those bioterrorism provisions of the law, including \none that provides liability protections for the makers of smallpox \nvaccines.\n  Our motion to strike doesn't touch those provisions. It only goes to \nthe childhood vaccine rights of families of children who are suffering \nfrom autism.\n  I also want to strongly refute the suggestion about this part of our \nmotion to strike by the senior Senator from Texas that we will suddenly \nhave to throw away all of our smallpox vaccine doses if we strike this \nnarrow provision. With all respect, that bears no relationship to the \namendment. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program doesn't cover claims \nagainst smallpox vaccine or any other vaccine used in the fight against \nterrorism--bioterrorism in this case. Moreover, Thimerosal has not been \nused at all since 1999, and the NIH confirms that none of the stores of \nsmallpox vaccine nationwide contain it.\n  Excuse the pun on a serious matter, but this provision is an \nadditive, and it is a harmful additive that ought to be removed from \nthe bill by this motion to strike.\n  We in the Senate owe the parents, the children, and frankly, the \ncompanies on all sides of this issue a serious solution--not some last-\nminute patchwork change in the law which deprives people of their \nrights.\n  Second, another extremely problematic provision our amendment and \nmotion to strike would remove is the one involving companies that shift \ntheir headquarters offshore to avoid paying American taxes and then \nturn around and seek to do business with the Federal Government.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask you to let me know when I have \nconsumed an additional 3 minutes, and then I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, this is the amendment to our committee bill that was \noffered by our esteemed colleague, our dear friend, the late Senator \nPaul Wellstone, and accepted by the Senate, which would have barred \ncompanies that set up offshore tax havens from getting Federal homeland \nsecurity contracts with the Secretary of the Department retaining the \nsingular important right to waive the prohibition for national security \nreasons. Now the underlying bill, at the last minute, would essentially \nnullify Senator Wellstone's provision by expanding the list of criteria \nthe Secretary can use in granting a waiver beyond national security \nreasons to include a host of other provisions that gut the Wellstone \nproposal.\n  It is just wrong that companies that are going out of the way to \ncircumvent the tax laws of the United States should be allowed to do \nbusiness and basically to get the money that the taxpayers who pay \ntheir taxes have put into the Treasury of the United States, unless \nthere is a national security reason that would be so. Our amendment \nwould strike that provision as well.\n  Our amendment would also move to strike from the bill a measure that \nwould require the Transportation Security Oversight Board to ratify \nwithin 90 days emergency security regulations issued by the \nTransportation Security Agency. If the oversight board does not ratify \nthe regulations, under this bill, they would automatically lapse. \nDespite the TSA having decided that they are necessary, 90 days later, \nlacking the Board's approval, they'd disappear.\n  This doesn't make any sense. In the current climate, shouldn't we be \ntrying to find new ways to expedite and implement TSA rules, not ways \nto disrupt and derail them? This bill is contrary to new procedures \nthat the Senate passed just a year ago in the aviation security bill. \nUnder that law, regulations go into effect and remain in effect unless \nthey are affirmatively disapproved by the Board. I think that's a \nbetter system.\n  My esteemed colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, has claimed that our \namendment would strike from the underlying bill the one-year extension \nof the deadline by which all airlines must install new security \nscanning equipment. I don't know whether he got that idea based on this \nprovision or not; regardless, he is mistaken. We keep that extension in \ntact, and striking the new cumbersome approval process, as our \namendment seeks to do, would have no effect whatsoever on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to strike this provision.\n  Another provision would extend liability protection to companies that \nprovided passenger and baggage screening in airports on September 11.\n  But we in the Senate already decided against extending such liability \nprotection--in at least three different contexts. First, the airline \nbailout bill limited the liability of the airlines--but not of the \nsecurity screeners, due to ongoing concerns about their role leading up \nto September 11. Then, the conference report on the Transportation \nSecurity bill extended the liability limitations to others who might \nhave been the target of lawsuits, such as aircraft manufacturers and \nairport operators, but again not to the baggage and passenger \nscreeners.\n\n[[Page S11362]]\n\n  The earlier Gramm-Miller substitute and the bipartisan Governmental \nAffairs Committee-approved legislation also left this provision out for \nthe very same reasons.\n  Now, somehow, this provision is back again. Like that little mole you \nhit with the mallet in a whack-a-mole game, somehow this provision has \nreappeared. At this late hour, in this context, it is just \ninappropriate to reverse the Senate's carefully considered judgment \nwithout clear justification.\n  We must strike this provision.\n  Another unnecessary and overreaching provision our amendment seeks to \nstrike would give the Secretary of the new Department broad authority \nto designate certain technologies as so-called ``qualified anti-\nterrorism technologies.'' His granting of this designation--which \nappears to be unilateral, and probably not subject to review by \nanyone--would entitle companies selling that technology to broad \nliability protection from any claim arising out of, relating to, or \nresulting from an act of terrorism, no matter how negligently--or even \nwantonly and willfully--the company acted.\n  The bill goes well beyond what Republicans were advocating just last \nmonth in the Gramm-Miller substitute, which would have provided sellers \nwith indemnification, but wouldn't have left many victims without any \ncompensation at all, as this bill does. This bill seems to say that in \nmany cases, the plaintiff can't recover anything from the seller unless \nan injured plaintiff can prove that the seller of the product that \ninjured him or her acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in \nsubmitting information to the Secretary when the Secretary was deciding \nwhether to certify the product.\n  Even in cases where a seller isn't entitled to the benefit of that \nprotection, the company still isn't fully--or in many cases even \npartially--responsible for its actions, even if it knew there was \nsomething terribly wrong with its product . Let me say that again. This \nbill gives protection even to those sellers who knowingly put anti-\nterrorism products on the market that they know won't work to keep \npeople safe against an attack. Perhaps worst of all, this measure would \ncap the seller's liability at the limits of its insurance policy. In \nother words, if injured people were lucky enough to get through the \nfirst hurdle and even hold a faulty seller liable, they still could go \ncompletely uncompensated even if a liable seller has more than enough \nmoney to compensate them.\n\n  Again, I ask, is this really the kind of provision we want to fold up \nand cram into this vital legislation? I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to stop, carefully consider the consequences, and \nthen vote for our amendment, which would strike this provision.\n  The substitute bill also unwisely and unnecessarily allows the \nSecretary to exempt the new Department's advisory committees from the \nopen meetings requirements and other requirements of the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act (FACA). I am well aware that this isn't a \nprovision that will get big headlines but it ought to raise some \neyebrows.\n  Agencies throughout government make use of advisory committees that \nfunction under these open meetings requirements. Existing law is \ncareful to protect discussions and documents that involve sensitive \ninformation in fact, the FACA law currently applies successfully to the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Justice, the State Department \neven the secretive National Security Agency.\n  So why should the Department of Homeland Security alone be allowed to \nexempt its advisory committees from its requirements? Why should its \nadvisory committees be allowed to meet in total secret with no public \nknowledge?\n  Again, if those rules work for the Department of Defense and the \nNational Security Agency, I think they can work for the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  What is the harm? Conceivably, this could allow the Secretary to \ncreate forums that operate in secret in which lobbyists for various \nspecial interests could advance their agendas and get back channel \naccess with this and future Administrations, without concern that the \npublic would ever find out--and that's regardless of whether their \ndiscussions were about security, business, or anything else. I am not \nsuggesting that this is what the Administration intends, or what the \nauthors of the bill intend, but the danger is real and must be \nrecognized.\n  We all say, and say often, that we're for ``good government''--for \nopenness, integrity, and accountability. But if we pass this bill \nunamended, few of us will be able to say with confidence that the new \nDepartment's advisory committees are designed to be as independent, \nbalanced, and transparent as possible. I know full well that the \nHomeland Security Department will deal with sensitive information \ninvolving life and death, but so does the National Security Agency. So \ndoes the FBI. So does the Department of Defense. Their advisory \ncommittees aren't allowed to hide themselves away from the public.\n  I hope my colleagues join with me to reject this unfortunate and \nshort-sighted provision.\n  Finally, our amendment would alter a provision in the substitute bill \ncreating a university-based homeland security research center. Now, I \nhave nothing against creating a university research center focused on \nhomeland security.\n  There are currently many effective university center programs--\ncenters for expertise and excellence--established through competitive \nprocesses by the National Science Foundation and other science \nagencies. And the science and technology division in this homeland \nsecurity bill closely tracks what we proposed in the legislation that \ncame out of the Governmental Affairs Committee--which would give the \nDepartment many exciting new tools to harness talent in our \nuniversities and companies and focus it on meeting the unprecedented \nchallenge we face to out-think and out-innovate our enemies.\n  But there is a problem with this particular proposal as it is \nwritten. Based on the fifteen criteria outlined in the bill, the \nresearch center that it would create is described so narrowly, through \nfifteen specific criteria, that it appears Texas A University has the \ninside track, to say the least, to get the funding and house the \ncenter. House aides have admitted as much to The Washington Post.\n\n  Texas A is a fine school that may be perfectly suited to run such a \nfederal research center--but there are many other fine schools that may \nalso be well suited to run a homeland security research center, and \nCongress should not predetermine the best site.\n  Science in this country has thrived over the years because, by and \nlarge, Congress has refused to intervene in science decisions. Science \nhas thrived through peer review and competition over the best \nproposals--which are fundamentals of federal science policy. We are \nviolating them here. This is nothing short of ``science pork.''\n  This provision was strongly opposed by the Chairman of the House \nScience Committee. And it has been roundly criticized by the university \ncommunity as an inappropriate Congressional intervention in science \nprogram selection.\n  My friend, the Senator from Texas, has suggested that a few other \ninstitutions conceivably could assemble the qualifications to meet the \n15 criteria that Texas A has specified. But I urge him to look at the \nlist, which is breathtaking in the particularity of its detail. And \neven if a handful of schools might meet in theory these requirements, \nthat does not solve our problem. We face grave dangers here, lives are \nat risk. We should all agree that we need to apply the most competitive \npossible process, the one that brings our best scientific brainpower \nbrought to bear on this problem.\n  Suppose for the sake of argument that a few other schools technically \ndo qualify. Then think about the agency employee, sitting at his desk \nat the new department, who receives the application from Texas A A \nmeets all the criteria specified in the statue, and meets them to a \ntee. The employee knows that Representative DeLay wants this done. \nRealistically, how do we think this decision will turn out? We know how \nit will turn out.\n  When it comes to making these research funding decisions, we need a \nplaying field that is truly level--not one that only looks level when \nyou tilt your head.\n  Perhaps that is why previous versions of this bill were wise enough\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\nnot to include this provision. The bipartisan Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill did not make this mistake. Nor did Senator Gramm \ninclude them in his earlier Gramm-Miller substitute. I have worked over \nthe years on science policy issues and legislation with Senator Gramm, \nand I hasten to point out that this provision certainly did not \noriginate with him. He has a strong understanding of the importance of \nstrong science to our nation's economic and social well-being, of \nstrong federal support for science, and of the need for competitive \nfunding decisions that are based on sound peer review. These provisions \ndid not originate with him.\n  Our amendment keeps the university-based science center program. \nHowever, it removes the list of highly-specific criteria that appear to \ndirect it to a particular university. That is the way we will get the \nbest science, not by making Congressional allocations to particular \ninstitutions.\n  I was under the impression that this homeland security bill would be \nclean. What does that mean? That it wouldn't be, for lack of a better \nword, mucked up with lots of extraneous provisions that are marginally \nrelevant or irrelevant to the central mission of this department, which \nof course is protecting the American people from Twenty- first Century \nterrorism with every ounce of talent, every tool, every technology at \nour disposal.\n  I understand the legislative process. I know that, as a wise person \nonce said, compromise is what makes nations great and marriages happy. \nI did not expect this substitute bill to look exactly like the \nbipartisan bill approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee I am \nprivileged to chair.\n  But I did expect that this bill would be clean--and clean it is not. \nI believe passionately in the need to create a Homeland Security \nDepartment. And I recognize and appreciate the many good things in this \nbill. It has moved much closer to our vision of how to combine our \nstrengths and minimize our weaknesses on intelligence to protect the \nAmerican people from terrorism. So too has it embraced our creative and \ncomprehensive vision of the new Department's science and technology \ndivision. And when we step back and look at the big picture, it looks \npretty good. And more important than looking good, it looks and is \nnecessary to protect the American people.\n  But these flaws are real. They are serious. And they are utterly \nunnecessary.\n  Luckily, they are easy for us to fix. One amendment, one vote. I once \nagain urge my fellow Senators to pass this amendment.\n  There are other colleagues who wish to speak. I would, therefore, ask \nfor the support of my colleagues for the motion to strike.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 10 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining to the majority leader or his designee.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to indicate my support for two \nthings: No. 1, for the homeland security legislation which I think is \nvery important. We fought for weeks about what it was going to look \nlike. We made some suggestions about what should be in the bill with \nregard to worker protections in the area of collective bargaining. The \nWhite House was not willing to accept our recommendation. And I \nunderstand that is not going to be possible. I thought that the \nbipartisan recommendation we had on collective bargaining was the right \nway to go. That did not work out. What we have in the bill is what the \nPresident wanted from the very beginning. I accept that. The concept of \nhomeland security bringing these agencies together is very important.\n  It is clear that after 9/11 we found out that the Federal Government \nwas not working very well together, that agencies were not sharing \ninformation that they should have been sharing with each other, and we \ncould have been doing a much better job.\n  Under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nMr. Lieberman, a proposal came about for a homeland security agency. \nQuite frankly, at the very beginning the White House didn't think the \nidea was a good one. They were worried about it creating too large a \nbureaucracy, but they came to the realization that I think all of us \nhave come to that, yes, this is in fact the right thing to do. That is \nwhere we are right now.\n  What has happened in the course of this process is interesting but \nnot unusual. The House loaded up the homeland security bill with a \nwhole bunch of things that were concocted in the middle of the night \nand not the subject of any hearings or not brought through the normal \ncommittee process and not voted on by the House and not voted on by any \ncommittee in the Senate and not passed by the Senate.\n  But, lo and behold, all of these provisions are now attached to the \nbill, and the House announced that they are going out of town, and take \nit or leave it.\n  I understand that some of them may be in Paris or London or Japan or \ndoing things that are important. But we are not finished yet. This \nbill--no matter what happens--is going to have to go back to the House \nof Representatives for consideration. It is going to have to go back to \nthe House for consideration even if this amendment to strike out these \nadd-ons is not adopted because the bill still has to be--after we adopt \nthe Thompson substitute--approved by the House. What is wrong with the \nHouse at that time saying we understand that the Senate is not going to \naccept these provisions and, therefore, we will pass homeland security \nsuch as the President requested it? The President, himself, in the \nWhite House said don't load this thing up with unnecessary items.\n  I would suggest that having a homeland security research center at \nTexas A University is a good idea, if you are from Texas. But how \nabout the other 49 States that would like to also participate in the \nprocess? LSU would make a great center for homeland security research. \nThey have already been working on it. But this legislation just cuts \nthem out, sticks one university in the process, and says: This is it. \nTake it or leave it. We're gone. We're out of town.\n\n  That is not the way things are supposed to work. It is not the way \nthey should work. I hope it will not work that way after we vote this \nmorning.\n  There is nothing wrong with taking these items out of the legislation \nand having the House take the bill up without it and have them pass it. \nThey can do it by voice vote. We could finish it this afternoon. The \nPresident can get the homeland security bill as he has requested. I \nwill support that effort.\n  I think it is very important to do homeland security, but don't let \nit become a vehicle for special interest provisions which the Congress \nhas never considered. I think it is wrong.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator from Louisiana, is one of the \nprovisions you are describing a provision that makes it easier for a \ncorporation that has renounced its citizenship, and moved to the \nBahamas in order to save on its tax bill in the United States, to get \ncontracts with the U.S. Government? Is that one of the provisions they \nstuck in at the hour of midnight?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator makes a good point. In addition to spelling \nout one university that all of a sudden will get all the work in the \nentire country, the other earmark is it takes away the Wellstone \namendment, which prohibits contracting with corporate expatriates.\n  What does that mean, expatriates? People who have left the country. \nPeople who said: I don't want to be a citizen of the United States any \nlonger. I am taking my business overseas. But, oh, by the way, I would \nstill like to do business with the Federal Government while I am in \nanother country not paying taxes to the United States.\n  That really strikes me as being something we should not allow. I \nthink the Senator is correct in pointing it out. That is not the way we \nshould do business. If you want to provide homeland security, I would \nsuggest giving business to companies that have left the United States \nis not in the interest of homeland security. It may be in the interest \nof the Bahamas, but it is certainly not in the interest of the United \nStates of America.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, \nisn't it a fact that the provision that would prevent corporations that \nrenounce\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\ntheir U.S. citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment--the Senate actually passed a provision that said: Well, if \nyou don't want to be an American citizen, then maybe you ought not be \ncontracting with the Federal Government. We set a date by which that \nwould be the case. That was in the legislation that moved out of the \nSenate. My understanding is it is the case that the House of \nRepresentatives put one of these special provisions in and said: Oh, we \ndon't agree with that. We want to weaken that to make it easier for \nthese companies that renounced their citizenship to get U.S. Government \ncontracts once again. Isn't that the case?\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Senator is exactly right. In order to have homeland \nsecurity, we need to protect the citizens of this country. Giving \nfinancial assistance to companies oversees that have left this country \nbecause they don't like to be citizens of the United States is the \nwrong way to do this.\n\n  Let's pass this bill clean. The President will get the homeland \nsecurity bill he desires. He will sign it. I will support it. That is \nthe right way to do business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to save time for Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For just 30 seconds?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point was made last week that within this bill is a \nprovision that benefits the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company that says \npending lawsuits brought on behalf of parents who believe their \nchildren are suffering ill effects from a preservative which the \ncompany made and put in vaccines, causing harm to these children--\nphysical and mental harm to these children--that pending lawsuits \nagainst this pharmaceutical company would be wiped away by the language \nof this homeland security bill.\n  Does this amendment we are about to vote on eliminate that provision \nand say that these parents and families and children will still have \ntheir day in court against this major pharmaceutical company?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Just briefly, the Senator is correct in his observation. \nIt does exactly that. There may be an argument whereby companies that \nmake a vaccine should not be subject to liability suits. There is a \nprovision for a fund for people who make vaccinations, that if they are \nbeing sued, they will recover against a fund. That is current law. But \nthat should be prospective, not retroactive. It should not wipe out \nlegitimate litigation that has already been filed. It is like saying \nhere is a legitimate lawsuit, but all of a sudden, by this action, we \nwipe out all court proceedings against that particular company. That is \nnot the right way to proceed.\n  The company, as I understand it, did not ask for it, did not lobby to \nput it in this bill, but all of a sudden, here it is, in the middle of \nthe night. It should not be in the bill, and this amendment would take \nit out.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time is left for Senator Daschle \nunder the order previously entered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes twenty seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from South Dakota, the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use leader time to augment the \ntime allotted for me to make some remarks with regard to the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is an order for the \nRepublican leader to be recognized at 10 o'clock.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak and to complete my speech prior to the time the Republican \nleader addresses the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not hear my colleagues speak to one \nof the greatest myths that I have heard in the debate about this \namendment. That myth is, if we pass this amendment, somehow it makes it \nimpossible for us to reconcile this amendment with the House of \nRepresentatives; that somehow it would put some chink in the process.\n  But I think, as my colleagues have noted already this morning, \nregardless or whether this amendment is adopted, this bill must go back \nto the House. There will be another vote in the House. So do not let \nanyone persuade any colleague, any Senator, that somehow there a \nprocedural impediment is created if we pass this amendment.\n  This legislation will go back to the other body. And when it does, if \nthe House does the right thing, they will accept this language, and we \nwill send the bill to the President as we should.\n  I must say, Mr. President, this has been a difficult debate for many \nof us, a very difficult debate. All of us, of course, want to do the \nright thing. Many of us think perhaps supporting some new \ninfrastructure with regard to homeland security is right. We have \nworked and worked and worked to reach a consensus.\n  Much of what is in this bill reflects a consensus. But I must say, \nthis language, these additions to the bill, added at the eleventh hour, \nis arrogance, is an atrocious demeaning the legislative process. They \nought to be ashamed of themselves. At the eleventh hour, when nobody \nwas watching, when most people had gone home, those people with deep \npolitical pockets, those people with the resources to make a \ndifference, had inserted in this bill items that the House itself had \nalready voted against.\n  In July of this year, the House voted 318 to 110 to cut off those \ncorporations that move offshore to avoid paying taxes--318 to 110, 3 \nmonths ago. They said: If you are going to do that, you will not be \nable to contract with the new Department. You ought to be ashamed of \nyourself. How can you be so unpatriotic?\n  They did the right thing in July. But what did they do at the \neleventh hour? Well, at the eleventh hour, when nobody was watching--\nwhen they thought nobody was watching--they quietly said: We didn't \nmean it. Now the elections are over. Now we will make a mockery of the \ntax law. We will make a mockery of the homeland defense bill. We will \nreopen the treasury to corporate expatriates, thinking nobody could \npossibly call attention to it.\n  Mr. President, that is just the beginning. Why would we possibly want \nto give liability protection to a company that made a pharmaceutical \nproduct that may cause autism in children? Why would we do that?\n  Why would we possibly slow down the process by which the new \nTransportation Security Agency issues new emergency rules to protect \ntravelers? We do it to help out airlines and other transportation \ncompanies. That is why we are doing it.\n  The House inserted the liability protection for vaccine additives to \nhelp out a company. The House inserted the expatriate corporate \nexemption to help out a lot of companies with deep pockets. Why would \nthe House put a university earmark in the homeland defense bill, \nearmarking Texas A for special treatment? Why, because some lobbyist \ngot the job done at the eleventh hour. That is why it happened.\n  These items make a mockery of the legislative process. Everybody who \nhas their fingerprints on these issues ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves. We have one opportunity to make it right, and that is in \nabout a half hour. We will have an opportunity to strike these, to send \na bill to the President that better reflects the consensus we have \nworked so hard to achieve. We want to do that; some of us want to do \nthat. But I must say, it is a sad day for the legislative process. It \nis a sad day for homeland security. It is a sad day for the \ninstitutions of the House and the Senate when we can insert language \nsuch as this unabashed.\n  I hope each Senator will think very carefully about the consequences \nof this vote. We ought to feel good about passing this bill. We ought \nto feel good about making some new contribution to reorganizing the \nGovernment, if indeed that will move us to a better sense of confidence \nabout our own security.\n  But how do you feel good, how do you feel positive, how do you feel \nthat you could in any way explain what the House has done?\n  I say to my colleagues in a bipartisan way, let's reject these \nprovisions. Let's ensure we send the clearest message\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\npossible that this kind of legislating will not be tolerated. Let's do \nit now before it is too late. Let's not have to explain this weeks or \nmonths later. We have the opportunity to rectify bad decisions made at \nthe last hour, made without any scrutiny, made without any real public \nattention, made for all the wrong reasons. We can do it today. We can \ndo it in a half hour. I urge my colleagues to join us in getting this \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from West \nVirginia still has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes, and the Republican \nleader has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. And does the time come out of both Senators, if no \nunanimous consent request is made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call will be charged to the party who \nsuggests the absence of a quorum. If no quorum call is in place, both \nsides are charged.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the distinguished majority leader want more time? I \nwould like to give him my remaining time. I don't want to see that time \nwhittled away simply because somebody is not taking the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield my remaining time to the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for that time just prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President and thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, might I have just 30 seconds of my time \nback?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nWest Virginia may require.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I thank my leader.\n  I have just heard from the Budget Committee, CBO has scored the \nvaccine amendment as increasing direct spending by $100 million in the \nfirst year, $2 billion over 10 years. In other words, it is a gift to \ndrug companies by this amount that would increase the deficit by this \namount.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, reserving \nthe final time, as has been indicated in the previous order, to Senator \nDaschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are reaching the moment where we are \ngoing to vote on homeland security. I rejoice that we have found our \nway here. It has been a long and difficult debate. I commend to my \ncolleagues that they vote for the homeland security bill. There will be \nan amendment that will be offered prior to that bill.\n  I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to take my 10 minutes to talk about the amendment \nthat we will have prior to the final vote. I remind my colleagues that \nover the last weekend, as we tried to bring this 7-week debate toward \ncloture, the President reached a compromise with several of our \nDemocrat Members to give additional power and input to government \nemployees and their representatives, not the power to veto the \nPresident's decision but the power to have input, the power to have \nreview. Also, to get a bill we could vote on and hopefully conclude \nthis debate, we had to meet with Members of the House who had a \nseparate bill.\n  What we have before us is the old Gramm-Miller amendment with the \namendments that we adopted; 95 percent of the Lieberman bill is in this \nstack of paper. And then we had to reach an agreement with the House.\n  A great harangue has come forth against that final agreement. There \nis an amendment pending that would strike seven provisions. In striking \nthose seven provisions, we would endanger the bill and, if we were \nfortunate, we would have a conference in December.\n  That is a risk that is not worth taking and, further, I believe the \nbill is a better bill with the seven provisions in it. Let me just \naddress them.\n  The one that has gotten the most discussion is the provision with \nregard to liability on vaccines.\n  Let me state it in the simplest possible form. We have always had \nseparate treatment for vaccines because some people react differently \nto vaccines.\n  In 1986, we set up a comprehensive program to compensate people who \nare harmed by vaccines that are used for general purposes. We have paid \n$1.6 billion out of that fund. Under that fund, you go through a \nprocess of arbitration and, if you settle, you settle; if you don't, \nthen you can go on to court. The vast majority of people settle.\n  A loophole has been found in that process. Plaintiff attorneys are \nnow arguing that damage is being done by a mercury derivative, which is \na preservative in these vaccines. The plaintiff attorneys are arguing \nthis preservative is not covered under the compensation program. Nobody \nhas proved scientifically one way or another where the harm comes from. \nBut plaintiff attorneys have now reached around the arbitration process \nand have filed suits that total 10 times the aggregate value of all the \nvaccine sales in the world combined.\n  This bill, recognizing that the stockpiling of new and powerful \nvaccines will be important to the war on terrorism, seeks to close that \nloophole by making it clear in law these preservatives that have always \nbeen part of vaccines are covered by the current arbitration process.\n  Now, many people have tried to label this into everything from a \npolitical payoff to you name it. We have a process that is working. \nPeople are satisfied with it. Plaintiff attorneys are trying to go \naround this process. Unless some order is brought to it, we are going \nto end vaccine production in the world. We don't want to do that. This \nis a good government provision that brings this process under the 1986 \nact, which was written by Senator Kennedy and Congressman Waxman.\n  Now, the second provision--and there are two that are criticized--has \nto do with liability limits. Senator Warner and Senator Allen \nintroduced an amendment, which we accepted, that puts the taxpayer on \nthe hook for paying any liability that occurs from items produced for \nfighting the war on terrorism. It is something we have done since the \nCivil War to try to indemnify manufacturers that are producing cutting-\nedge items that are desperately needed on a time-sensitive basis for \nthe war effort. The House had similar language, but with liability \nlimits included in the Transportation Safety Act. When it came to a \nchoice between the taxpayer being at risk or having previously \nestablished liability limits, we accepted those liability limits from \nthe House bill.\n  Another provision that has been criticized is a change in the \nWellstone amendment. The Wellstone amendment originally said any \ncompany that has ever been domiciled in the U.S. that is domiciled \nsomewhere else cannot sell items to be used in the war on terrorism. We \nthought there had to be some moderation on this language, so we added \nthree points. One, if the language produced a situation where you \nactually lose American jobs because a product was produced here, even \nthough the company's headquarters is in France, you could have a \nwaiver. Two, if you have a sole source bidder and no competition, you \ncan have a waiver. And three, if the product is cheaper with higher \nquality, a waiver can be given under those circumstances.\n  That is a good government provision. It makes eminently good sense. \nIf a company in France is producing something in Cleveland and selling \nit for the war on terrorism, why should we put people in Cleveland out \nof work to buy something produced in Japan by a company that has no \nemployees in the United States? It makes absolutely no sense. Those \nwaivers represent good government.\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\n  There are two final provisions in the bill. One doesn't matter, and \nthat is advisory councils. I don't know if they have any value or not. \nI don't see jeopardizing the bill to strike them.\n  The final provision has been referred to as a ``Texas A'' \nprovision--a provision I did not write and didn't have anything to do \nwith, and it doesn't specifically have anything to do with Texas A\n  I have a letter from the University of California supporting the \nprovision. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         University of California,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Ranking Member, House Select Committee on Homeland Security, \n         House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Pelosi: As you prepare to vote on H.R. \n     5005, the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the University of \n     California encourages your support for provisions in the bill \n     that aim to strengthen the role of science and technology in \n     the new Department and that ensure that the capabilities of \n     the U.S. Department of Energy's National Laboratories are \n     made available to the new Department. UC supports the \n     establishment of an Under Secretary for Science and \n     Technology and provisions to strengthen the important role \n     that academic research institutions play in protecting our \n     homeland.\n       As you are aware, UC is actively engaged in activities \n     associated with homeland security and our nation's war on \n     terrorism, including conducting ongoing research and \n     providing scientific expertise. UC faculty and researchers, \n     including those at the UC managed national laboratories, have \n     testified before Congress, developed bio-agent detection \n     devices, aided in the anthrax clean-up effort on Capitol \n     Hill, and analyzed the World Trade Center structure, among \n     many other activities.\n       Section 307 of H.R. 5005 calls upon the Secretary to \n     establish university-based centers for homeland security. \n     This section provides the Secretary with a list of merit \n     contingent criteria from which to base the selection of \n     colleges or universities as centers. The criteria range from \n     strong affiliations with animal and plant diagnostic \n     laboratories to expertise in water and wastewater operations. \n     UC would welcome the opportunity to compete for such an \n     important center. As the public research institution serving \n     the state of California, the ten-campus UC System, with its \n     three national laboratories, is uniquely qualified to address \n     all of the selection criteria. To improve the selection \n     process, UC would like to work with you and the conference \n     committee to ensure that the final version of the legislation \n     provide that the Secretary shall make the designation of \n     university centers with the advice of an academic peer review \n     panel.\n       I commend you for your leadership on this landmark \n     legislation and for your continued service to the people and \n     institutions of our state. If you need further information \n     about the issues raised in this letter, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 A. Scott Sudduth,\n                                         Assistant Vice President.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, that provision is similar to provisions we \nhave at the Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy. It \nbasically says the major research universities in the country will be \neligible to participate in a center or centers. It also says the agency \nand the President have the power to set up centers and do research \nwherever they want to. This is a provision that provides no money. It \ndoes say major research universities will be part of the process, but \nit doesn't say they will be the only part of it.\n  Let me conclude and then keep the balance of my time, because others \nmay need it if I have not used it up. The seven amendments that would \nbe stricken by the Daschle amendment are amendments that improve the \nbill. A couple of them didn't have to be there. They do no great harm. \nFive of them improve the bill by dealing with problems directly related \nto terrorism, and they all trace back to a provision, in one form or \nanother, that was in both the Senate and House bills.\n  I know this is going to be a close vote. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the amendment, A, on substance--the bill will be better if the \namendment fails--and, B, I think there is a substantial probability \nthat we will not get a bill this year, though we will certainly get one \nnext year. It simply would mean a 3-month delay.\n  So I urge colleagues to vote no on the amendments and to vote for the \nunderlying bill. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, how much time do the opponents have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me at the end \nof the consumption of 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. First of all, Mr. President, with regard to the \ncomments that have been made concerning the inversions, a couple of \ncolleagues on the other side said our amendment takes out the Wellstone \namendment to bar companies who leave the U.S. to evade taxes.\n  This doesn't eliminate the Wellstone amendment. That amendment to bar \nthe Department of Homeland Security from contracting with inverted \ncompanies is included in our amendment. What our amendment does, \nthough, is give the Secretary of Homeland Security the ability to waive \nthe bar if U.S. jobs would be lost, or if it would cost the Government \nmore taxpayer dollars because there would be less competition.\n  On this issue, I know this is extremely important politically for \nmany of our colleagues. When you examine it from the standpoint of \nsocial policy, or policy as it affects the U.S., it does not bear \nscrutiny. We in the Governmental Affairs Committee, I think on a \nbipartisan basis, over the years have tried our best not to interject \nsocial policy in our procurement process.\n  Our Government needs to be able to get the best and cheapest goods \nfor the taxpayers. One can think of many different things companies \nmight do that are totally legal, totally proper, that we might \ndisapprove of. We wish they were different kinds of companies, had \ndifferent kinds of social policies. But if we say, with regard to all \nof them, that if there would be a new batch every year under \nconsideration, we are not going to do business with them, we are going \nto cut off our nose to spite our face, even though their products are \nbetter, they are cheaper, and we are trying to protect homeland \nsecurity, we are not going to do business with them because we do not \napprove of your policies, even though they are perfectly legal, that \nwould hurt this country.\n\n  It is more important to have a viable Homeland Security Department to \nprotect this country than it is to make a political point or punish \nsome company. We are punishing, in some cases, companies that have \nthousands of domestic employees working in the United States. What we \nwould be doing is depriving them of contracting with the Department of \nHomeland Security and allowing a French company or a German company \nthat has always been a foreign company, always with foreign employees, \ngetting the contract.\n  That makes absolutely no sense. However, it apparently is an idea \nwhose time is come and is included in the amendment Senator Gramm, \nSenator Miller, and myself offered a while back.\n  What we do is this: We do not necessarily agree with the underlying \npolicy, but we are going to include it in the amendment. But at least \nlet's have some exceptions if it really benefits our country in terms \nof homeland security, our jobs, our costs. Let's give the Secretary the \ndiscretion to make some exception with regard thereto. It is just \ncommon sense and it focuses where we need to get, not for short term \npolitical gain but to punish some company.\n  Bermuda, for example, is the home of Intelsat from whom our \nDepartment of Defense gets satellite services. Do we want to cut \nourselves off from that? There are not that many companies like that \naround the world. Intelsat is an inversion. Why limit it to homeland \nsecurity?\n  Let's get away from the idea of punishing somebody or punishing some \ncompany when it hurts our country to do so. It does not say you have to \ndo business with them. It says let them compete. We are not giving them \nanything if it is not the best thing for our country. That is the \nphilosophy behind our approach, and it is incorporated in this \namendment. No one should have to make any apologies for this provision\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\nbeing in the Thompson amendment the way it is.\n  With regard to the other point Senator Gramm made concerning \nvaccines--and Senator Frist spoke eloquently about this. This is an \nincorporation. What the Lieberman amendment seeks to remove is the \nincorporation of a portion of a bill that was submitted by Senator \nFrist.\n  If one looks back at the history of vaccines, it is obvious vaccines \nhave been special cases in this country for years. We have treated them \nin a special way because the profit margin on vaccines is lower than \nmost drugs, and the risk is higher, and we need vaccines. As a part of \nour governmental policies, as part of our national policies, it has \nalways been that way.\n  We addressed that when the swine flu epidemic came about, and we made \nsome changes to the Federal Tort Claims Act. Back in the 1950s, an \nExecutive order was put forward that would provide some indemnification \nfor companies to produce vaccines. We have a long history of that \npractice.\n  Finally, in 1986, Congress created the National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program which said basically this to plaintiffs: Look, \nplaintiffs, you are not getting anywhere the way it is in the court \nsystem. Nobody ever gets any recovery off this because you cannot prove \ncausation. You cannot prove your injuries were actually caused by this \nvaccine. So we are going to set up a separate system so you do not have \nto prove causation; basically a no-fault situation.\n  If plaintiffs do not have to prove causation, on the other hand, \nthere is some limitation to the amount of damages they can get. Instead \nof a special court, you go to a special master. If you do not like the \nresults, then you can go to court. We think that is a pretty sound \ndeal. Congress thought it was in 1986 when it passed that legislation \nand it was signed into law.\n  Lawyers look at this and say: OK, we are cut out from suing in court \nif it has to do with a vaccine. So we will take this particular \nadditive and say it is not really a vaccine. It is an adulterant, a \npollutant in this vaccine; therefore, it is not covered by this \ncompensation process. That is the way they got to court.\n  We have scads and scads of lawsuits as a result of it, and it \nresulted in two U.S. companies left producing vaccines in this country. \nWhat Senator Frist was trying to do and what we are trying to do in our \namendment is to effectuate the intent of the 1986 law which was to roll \nall this in to the compensation program.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The intent was to roll these new lawsuits of the future \ninto this compensation program, so that in the future, not only with \nregard to vaccines, but components of vaccines, have a new definition, \na more comprehensive definition of vaccine and make that a part of the \nsystem.\n  It is not cutting plaintiffs off, it is putting them in the same \nposition we thought we were putting plaintiffs in in 1986, anyway, and \nthat is go through a special master and prove your case. You do not \nhave to prove your injury was actually caused by a vaccine, as one \nwould in a court of law; on the other hand, there is some limitation on \nrecovery. Then if you are not satisfied, you can sue in court.\n  A benefit to a company? When are we going to stop looking at who gets \nsome little benefit, who is able to survive, and start looking at what \nis in the interest of our national security? Sometimes I believe we had \nrather make some small point and put some company or group of companies \nout of business who are not in favor at the moment, even if it hurts us \nas a nation. And vaccines are a classic case. We have to have more.\n  We are trying to figure out what to do with smallpox. It is not going \nto be in our country's interest to drive these companies out of \nbusiness, and it does nothing to harm qualified plaintiffs to require \nthem to go through the compensation program we set up in 1986 and which \nmost people thought these plaintiffs would be a part of, anyway.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Chair interrupt me after 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak in opposition to the \nDaschle Lieberman amendment. There are some provisions that I consider \nvery important to the Department of Homeland Security and which \nSenators Daschle and Lieberman seek to strip from the House-passed \nlanguage--thus, in my opinion, making their amendment more about \nabusive litigation security rather than homeland defense security.\n  In order to provide for our homeland defense, we must take necessary \nsteps to promote research and development of important technologies and \nvaccines, and ensure their accessibility. We will have failed the \nAmerican people if the development and deployment of needed \ntechnologies and vaccines is prevented by the threat of unreasonable \nexposure to overwhelming lawsuits.\n  To foster quality research, the House established criteria to ensure \nthat when selecting universities as centers for the development of \nhomeland security technologies, we partner with the highest quality \nprograms. Many of these criteria mirror similar provisions routinely \nfound in current Federal laws funding research and development. \nProponents of the Lieberman-Daschle amendment claim the criteria are \ntoo selective and should be eliminated. Shouldn't we be concerned that \nthe Department of Homeland Security works with the best and the \nbrightest when developing technologies intended to protect the American \npeople? If the Lieberman amendment passes, I caution you that the \nuniversity-based centers could become more about pork and which \nlegislator can deliver the most in government funds to his or her \ndistrict, rather than protecting the American people with cutting edge \ntechnologies and programs.\n  To facilitate the development and deployment of needed technologies, \nthe House included its SAFETY Act provision, recognizing that we cannot \nsaddle manufacturers with unreasonable exposure to unlimited lawsuits. \nThe House-passed SAFETY Act language imposes reasonable provisions to \nmanage potential legal exposure of those companies that we have \nasked to step up to the plate in homeland security. Otherwise we will \nbe faced with a crisis in homeland security when companies are \nunwilling or unable to become involved. Let me be clear, contrary to \nassertions by some, the House-passed language does not give blanket \nimmunity to corporations. What it does is permit companies that \nmanufacture and deploy designated antiterrorism technologies, approved \nby the Federal Government for use in homeland security, to be afforded \nthe ``government contractor defense,'' but only if certain criteria and \nprecise government specifications are met.\n\n  It is important to note that if these criteria are not met, if the \nequipment deployed does not meet Government specifications or if the \nmanufacturer conceals any information regarding the dangers posed by \nthe equipment--the government contractor defense will not be \nsuccessful. Moreover, if a company engages in fraud or willful \nmisconduct, that are not protected. And if a State imposes additional \nrequirements which do not conflict with the Federal criteria, the State \nlaw is not preempted. The defense is not a blanket immunity from suit.\n  If the government contractor defense fails, and the plaintiff \nprevails at trial, the subsequent award would be subject to reasonable \nlimitations which include:\n  Proportionate liability for non-economic damages--Companies would \nonly be liable for noneconomic damages according to their portion of \nculpability. Under current joint and several liability laws in place in \nmany States, a defendant that is only 1 percent at fault could be \nforced to pay an entire award if payment cannot be obtained from those \nresponsible for the other 99 percent. It is unconscionable that we \nwould subject manufacturers that have stepped forward to protect the \nAmerican people to unlimited litigation exposure that could result in \ntheir paying damages for which they are not responsible. A crafty \nplaintiff's attorney\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\ncould conceivably add one of the terrorists as a defendant in a case to \ninflame the jury. Consequently, even if the jury finds the terrorist 99 \npercent liable because he perpetrated the act, the manufacturer of a \ndevice that may have failed one time in 1,000 might be forced to pay a \nhuge, often crippling award. Often these types of lawsuits become less \nabout culpability and more about the trial bar extorting huge \nsettlements based on emotions that run high in the aftermath of a \ntragedy. Nonetheless, the House-passed language only remedies this \ninjustice with regard to non-economic damages. Economic damages would \nnot be subject to proportionate liability and State laws forcing those \nless culpable to pay for the damages inflicted by those who are really \nresponsible, would still apply.\n\n  A Ban on Punitive Damages--It is appropriate to ban punitive damages \nin lawsuits which we can anticipate could very well be based more on \nemotion than legal culpability and are less in line with the real \npurpose of punitive damages--to punish bad behavior--and more about \nmaking a statement about a tragedy. Uncontrolled and inflated punitive \ndamage awards run the risk of drying up defendant resources and \nreducing awards to subsequent plaintiffs to pennies on the dollar.\n  We must provide some stability to the legal process, especially in \nthe context of terrorist attacks to ensure that private-sector \nresources are available for our homeland defense and that plaintiffs \nare compensated for their actual damages.\n  In order to facilitate the development and deployment of essential \nvaccines, the House-passed language recognized the importance of this \naspect of our homeland security and included language that would treat \ndoctors and hospitals who administer certain vaccines and manufacturers \nof certain vaccines as Federal employees. This means that the \ngovernment will step in under the Federal Tort Claims Act, FTCA, and \ndefend the lawsuit and pay any damages awarded, subject to the \nparameters of the FTCA. Claimants will still be compensated, but those \nwho partner with us to protect our people will not be overwhelmed by an \nunrestrained trial bar. Nobody is arguing with that particular \nprovision--but we must recognize that it works in tandem with the other \nprovisions that I have addressed.\n  If we suffer another attack, do my colleagues want to be faced with a \nshortage of important vaccines, or the inability to get those \nvaccinations to the public in a rapid and orderly manner? As Senator \nFrist noted, our vaccine capability is in crisis. Potential exposure to \nunlimited lawsuits has made it impossible for most companies to \nparticipate in a vaccine program. We have seen the number of vaccine \nmanufacturers fall from 12 to 4, only 2 of which are U.S. companies. \nDoctors and hospitals are legitimately concerned about their potential \nlegal exposure should they attempt to partner with the government in \nthe dissemination of a vaccine. Let me stress that the government \ncannot do this alone; we must partner with the private sector or else \nwe will leave significant portions of our constituents unprotected.\n\n  I must note that the last-minute inclusion of sections 1714-1717 in \nthe House-passed bill dealing specifically with liability for vaccines \nthat are covered under the current National Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram, NVICP, has raised many concerns. I have heard from many \nparents that feel the process by which this bill was brought to the \nfloor will deny them a meaningful opportunity to influence legislation \nthat is important to children and their families. Simply, the process \nleaves much to be desired. A piecemeal, unvetted approach to addressing \nthese specific, very complex vaccine injury compensation and supply \nissues is not the best way to protect our children and families. \nWithout broad debate and consideration of all the issues surrounding \nvaccine compensation, the narrow inclusion of certain provisions \nregarding NCVIP, such as ``clarification of definition of a \nmanufacturer,'' removal as ``an adulterant or contaminant any component \nor ingredient listed in a vaccine's product license application or \nproduct label,'' and application of these definitions to pending \nlitigation, without addressing other criticisms of NVICP may not be the \nbest course of action. What is most troubling is the fact that we have \nnot been given the opportunity to fully understand the implications of \nsections 1714-1717 and develop comprehensive solutions due to a poor \nlegislative process.\n  Maintaining a safe, adequate vaccine supply while fairly compensating \nvaccine injury is an important issue and deserves far more deliberation \nand debate than it was afforded. Americans are rightfully concerned \nabout the manner in which this important issue has been handled in the \neleventh hour. Clearly, on the one hand, the vast majority of our \nchildren and families have benefited from vaccines. On the other hand, \nunfortunately, there are rare adverse events that are caused by \nvaccines. Balancing these issues to ensure the health and well-being of \nour children requires careful consideration. Legislation introduced by \nSenator Frist, S. 2053, the Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act, \nwhich contained the original provisions now included in the Homeland \nSecurity bill, had never been subjected to any legislative scrutiny \nsuch as hearings or markups. Our citizens expect to be heard and their \nconcerns taken into account when forming legislation, especially when \nmodifying a current program. I am disappointed that this did not occur. \nEnsuring affordable, life saving vaccines while protecting our children \nfrom vaccine injury and fairly and expeditiously compensating the \nunfortunate families who suffer harm is not a simple matter, and at the \nvery least, should be the subject of an open, thoughtful legislative \nprocess. This issue was clearly not afforded the deliberation the \nAmerican public deserves.\n  Though I may not agree with every provision in the House-passed bill, \nand I must emphasize my disappointment in the hurried manner with which \nsome provisions were included, I recognize that if we allow this \namendment to strip the provisions which I feel are vital, we will \nthreaten overall passage of the bill.\n  Failure to enact this legislation would be a serious disservice to \nthe furtherance of our homeland security and the interests of the \nAmerican people because it would leave us in danger of being unable to \ndevelop the technologies or vaccines necessary for the defense of our \ncountry in the 21st century. We are in a new type of war, and \nlitigation that could follow terrorist attacks will not be garden \nvariety lawsuits. Leo Boyle, president of the Association of Trial \nLawyers conceded as much in a January 9, 2002, Washington Post article, \n``Legal Eagles, Beating Back the Vultures,'' where he stated that \nlawsuits seeking to blame the effects of the September 11 attacks on \nanyone but the terrorists ``deny the essential nature of the attacks'' \nand should be subject to special rules limiting the liability of \nAmericans. If that is true, the trial bar should not oppose these \nprovisions.\n  Fred Baron, a leading member of the trial bar, was recently quoted as \nreferring to an article in the Wall Street Journal that stated the \ntrial bar ``all but controls the Senate.'' Mr. Baron took issue with \nthe ``all but.'' I took issue with his assertion during a recent \nhearing in which he was a witness before the Judiciary Committee on \nasbestos litigation, because as I think it is clear to all of us--the \ntrial bar has so far been successful in preventing us from enacting \nessential reforms in the area of asbestos litigation and class actions \nwhich are spiraling out of control and crippling American businesses. \nOften these abusive lawsuits have little correlation to any actual \nculpability of these companies, and often end up being to the detriment \nof claimants deserving of appropriate compensation.\n  I challenge my colleagues to show the American people that we are \nserious about providing them with the technologies and medicines \nnecessary to protect them in the event of another terrorist attack by \nopposing this amendment, and thereby proving that the Senate will not \ncow tow to the special interests of the trial bar or their campaign \ncontributions.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the Daschle-\nLieberman amendment to the homeland security bill. Many people have \npointed out many of the problems this amendment attempts to address.\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\n  I share the concerns of my colleagues that the homeland security bill \nshould not include provisions protecting Eli Lilly from lawsuits over a \nvaccine that may be responsible for causing autism in children. The \nhomeland security bill is no place for these special interest, last \nminute provisions.\n  There are many other such provisions that I am concerned about which \nthis amendment will address.\n  In particular, I am extremely disappointed with the provision in the \nbill that essentially establishes Texas A as a homeland security \nresearch center. This provisions was drafted in such a way that many \nother universities, such as the University of Las Vegas-Nevada and \nUniversity of Nevada-Reno, will not be able to compete fairly for this \nimportant designation.\n  The war on terrorism will only be won when we utilize all the best \nand brightest academic minds all over the country. I am proud of the \nuniversities, colleges, and community colleges in the State of Nevada. \nWe have some of the best counterterrorism training and research \nfacilities affiliated with the Nevada universities and colleges. I am \ndisappointed that the administration and the House decided to support \none facility without taking the time to learn what these other \nfacilities have to offer.\n  If this amendment is not successful, I will still work to ensure that \nUNLV and UNR will be able to compete for this important distinction. By \ndoing so, these universities will continue the proud Nevada tradition \nof offering up our skills to serve the nation in times of crisis.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is only after long and careful \nconsideration, as well as assurances from leadership I and several of \nmy colleagues have secured which I will detail in a moment, that I have \ndetermined that I will not support the Daschle-Lieberman amendment \nbefore us today.\n  This is not a decision I have come to lightly. I am deeply troubled \nby a number of eleventh-hour additions to this major piece of \nlegislation, in the dead of night, as we face adjournment. This is not \nthe legislative process at its finest.\n  Even as we speak, unprecedented challenges face our national \nsecurity. Counterterrorism officials report that the level of \nintelligence ``chatter'', or information, being picked up from al-Qaida \nby the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency is approaching the volume \nseen in the weeks before September 11, promoting the FBI's recent \nwarning of ``spectacular'' attacks. That is why the President needs \nthis new Department, and must have the opportunity to begin its \norganization as soon as possible in order to respond to this national \nimperative and to secure American soil to the best of his ability.\n  Yet, here we are, with the House regrettably having adjourned having \nsent to us a Homeland Security bill encumbered with stealth provisions \nthat have prompted considerable and justifiable alarm, particularly the \nclarification of vaccine manufacturer liabilities, the criteria by \nwhich colleges and universities will be chosen to undertake work on \nbehalf of the new Department, and the waiver allowing the use \nof inverted domestic corporations as contractors for the purposes of \nhomeland security.\n\n  As to the vaccine program, some argue that the measure included in \nthe legislation is necessary in order to help ensure the continued \nviability of the industry, especially at a time when vaccination \nagainst a host of potential biological attacks has become all the more \ncritical. Others have serious concerns about the impact of this \nprovision on pending litigation.\n  I'm also extremely concerned about the loophole that was opened in \nthe bill's provision banning homeland security related contracts with \ninverted corporations.\n  It may be one thing to say that exceptions can be made should our \nsecurity requirements demand we deal with an inverted corporation \nbecause there simply is no other option. It is quite another to \nactually require Federal contracts to be awarded on the basis of the \nlowest bid regardless of where the company is incorporated, thereby \nrewarding the very companies that moved offshore for the purpose of \navoiding Federal taxation. What kind of message does that send? What \nkind of precedent does it set when just 5 months ago in the Finance \nCommittee we were working to crack down on the most egregious corporate \ninversions?\n  And finally, the under-the-radar provision concerning college and \nuniversity work mandated extremely selective and narrow criteria that \neffectively excluded the vast majority of institutions of higher \nlearning in America. The measure offered the new Secretary no \ndiscretion, but rather was tailored to apply to only a handful of \ncolleges and universities. Why shouldn't the University of Maine be \nable to contribute to the cause if the Secretary believes that specific \nsecurity needs match with a specific expertise they may possess?\n  The only reason I will not be supporting efforts to remove these \nprovisions from this legislation via the Daschle-Lieberman amendment is \nbecause I have been able to obtain assurances from the Republican \nLeader, the Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader-elect of the \nHouse and the Administration that these objectionable measures will be \naddressed with alacrity upon our immediate return in January, through \nthe first available appropriations vehicle in the 108th Congress.\n  All of these parties have been in close communications on this \nmatter. And let me say it is a credit to Leader Lott that he worked \nswiftly and decisively to address the concerns I and others raised, as \nwell as to secure the necessary assurances from House leadership.\n  I appreciate that our Republican leader came to the floor to speak to \nour concerns, agreeing there are items in the bill that cannot stand as \nthey are and pledging they will be redressed. And I applaud the \nleader's initiative to form a committee to remedy the most troublesome \nprovisions I have outlined, and as a member of that committee I look \nforward to achieving that goal so that we can right these wrongs as \npart of the first order of business we conduct in January.\n  As a result of these assurances, we can move forward toward \ncompletion on this bill that can no longer wait. After 6 month of \ndeliberation, at this sustained period of ``Code Yellow'' elevated \nalert status, the time has come for the perpetuity of purpose ensured \nby statutory status for a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  A Department responsible for safeguarding our homeland defense must \nnot be dependent solely on the relationship between a particular \nPresident and his or her Homeland Security director. Rather, it must be \nrun as efficiently and effectively as possible under the leadership of \na permanent, cabinet level official. That is the only way to achieve \nthe kind of ``continuity of urgency'' the security of our homeland \ndemands.\n  The fact of the matter is, we cannot afford a descent into \ncomplacency when it comes to this life-or-death obligation to protect \nthe American people. Under a new cabinet-level department, \nresponsibility would rest with a Secretary of Homeland Security--a \nposition created under law--who would manage the vital day-to-day \nfunctioning of the new department. Critically, this person would have \ntheir own budget, while they work closely with the Administration to \ndevelop and implement policy.\n  The bottom line is, I support the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security--the largest re-organization of our Government since \nWWII--because it will centralize our efforts to prevent and respond to \nany future terrorist attack. Currently, at least 22 agencies and \ndepartments play a direct role in homeland security, encompassing over \n170,000 people. This legislation consolidates these various \nresponsibilities into one Department which will oversee border \nsecurity, critical infrastructure protection, and emergency \npreparedness and response.\n  Every day we wait is another day that we risk having to look back and \nwonder, what if we had acted sooner? For this reason, along with the \ncommitment I have personally received from the Leader that we will \naddress the issues of vaccine liability, inverted corporations, and \nuniversity contracts next year, I will oppose the Daschle-Lieberman \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tucked away into the Homeland Security bill \nis a small provision that no one seems to want to take credit for and \nyet it would bestow huge benefits on just one interest group. According \nto news accounts, Sections 714 through 716 of the\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\nHomeland Security bill were ``something the White House wanted,'' not \nnecessarily something the House or Senate wanted.\n  This explanation hardly clarifies why we are including such a far-\nreaching amendment that has nothing to do with homeland security in \nthis bill. It hardly explains why, in these final days of the 107th \nCongress, we have decided so blatantly to put the interests of a few \ncorporate pharmaceutical manufacturers before the interests of \nthousands of consumers, parents and children.\n  Sections 714, 715 and 716 basically give a ``get out of court free \ncard'' to Eli Lilly and other manufacturers of thimerasol. Thimerasol \nis a mercury-based vaccine preservative that was used until recently in \nchildren's vaccines for everything from hepatitis B to diphtheria. \nUnfortunately, while these vaccines were intended to help protect our \nchildren's health, there are many health professionals and parents who \nnow believe the opposite occurred.\n  Parents and health professionals are now concerned that using \nvaccines with thimerasol has exposed as many as 30 million American \nchildren to mercury levels far exceeding the ``safe'' level recommended \nby the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1999, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the Public Health Service began urging vaccine \nmanufacturers to stop using thimerosal as quickly as possible. Since \nthen, parents of autistic children around the country have gone to \ncourt to hold pharmaceutical companies liable for the alleged damage \ncaused by thimerosal. Many of these parents now cite pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer's own documents to show that they knew of the potential \nrisk of using mercury-based preservatives back in the 1940s and yet did \nnot stop its use.\n  Now tucked away in the Homeland Security bill, we find this small \nprovision that changes the definition of a vaccine manufacturer to \ninclude those companies that made vaccine preservatives. This small \nchange to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program cuts the legs out \nfrom under the families involved in pending lawsuits against thimerosal \nmanufacturers. The amendment is obvious in its attempt to put up \nroadblocks to these cases. Those who brought the cases against \nmanufacturers would lose their option of going to court while the \nmanufacturers get new protections from large judgments.\n  Let's be clear about this provision. It has nothing to do with \nhomeland security. Smallpox and anthrax vaccines do not use thimerosal. \nWe should not take away the rights of our citizenry under the guise of \ntrying to protect them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. What is the current time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has 2 minutes 20 \nseconds, and the majority leader has 4 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Since the Republican leader is not here, I will use the \ntime remaining to respond to a couple of the points raised by my \ncolleagues.\n  First, with regard to the comments made by the Senator from Texas, I \nagain reiterate this has nothing to do with support for pharmaceutical \nresearch. This has everything to do with a questionable preservative \nused in combination with pharmaceutical vaccines. Thimerosal is an \nadditive, a preservative. There are those who have made the case that \nThimerosal may cause autism in children. We do not know. All over this \ncountry, there are class action suits by families who have sued to make \nthe case, who have sued to have their day in court, who want to get \nmore science and more answers than they have right now. That is what \nthis is about: Whether those thousands of families will have an \nopportunity to be heard in court; whether they will have an opportunity \nif, God forbid that there is that connection, to be indemnified. Make \nno mistake, this legislation eliminates all of that opportunity.\n  I heard the Senator say this is good government. I must say, I am \nbaffled by that expression. How can it be good government to say to \nfamilies all over the country who have been victimized, or at least who \nthink they have been victimized, that they can no longer go to court to \nseek redress?\n  Again, let me say, this has nothing to do with research or with the \nvaccines themselves. Thimerosal is no longer being made. We are not \neven dealing with future class action lawsuits. We are only dealing \nwith the ones currently pending. This legislation, let everyone \nunderstand, will wipe out--eliminate--the access to courts by families \nwho have been injured, whose children have autism, who want the right \nto make the case to the courts, and then the courts decide. If the \nevidence is not there, they do not get the compensation. But if they \ncan make the case and if the science will support the connection, then \nthere is some hope for these families who otherwise have none.\n  Why at the eleventh hour, why in the dead of night, somebody, even if \nthey thought they were right, would add legislation without debate, \ntotally stripping these families of that opportunity, is something I \ncannot explain, I cannot understand. That is what we are talking about. \nThat is not good government; that is shabby government. That should not \nbe allowed. That is really why we are taking it out.\n  We can explain, we all know how these targeted amendments get put in \nlegislation. In the course of any one Senator's career, those occasions \noccur. I don't think anyone can justify a Texas A earmark for \nresearch. I say to the Senator from Nebraska, the University of \nNebraska should be entitled to that research. The University of South \nDakota might be interested in that research. There ought to be a \nbidding process. There ought to be some open opportunity for colleges \nto compete. But to earmark, without debate, Texas A as the only \nuniversity allowed under this legislation--it may be justified; maybe \nafter all the competition they could win--is not the way to legislate. \nThat is also an embarrassment. I hope we can avoid that.\n  I will finally say, because I know I am out of time, for the Congress \nto reverse a decision we both have made--passed in the Senate, passed \nin the House, passed overwhelmingly in both bodies--to send a clear \nmessage to companies that go overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes, that \nwill not be tolerated, especially with regard to their ability to deal \nwith the Homeland Security Department, and now to say we were not \nserious, we were just kidding, those votes, as overwhelming as they \nwere, really did not mean anything; what we really mean is, go ahead \nand have that business, do that business, that is OK, you can go \noverseas, avoid paying taxes, you can renounce your U.S. citizenship, \nbut you can still do business with homeland security, that is OK--that \nis what we are saying if we oppose this amendment.\n\n  I could go on and on. I know I am out of time. I urge my colleagues \nto do the right thing. Let's cleanup this bill. Let's not have this \nvote and send the wrong message to the people of this country, to the \nfamilies who are victimized, to the businesses that have no business \ndealing with homeland security. We can do better than that. That is \nwhat this amendment will allow us to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 11 seconds remain.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I need additional time, I will yield \nmyself leader time so I can wrap up this discussion.\n  I regret I have not been able to hear all of the debate this morning. \nWe have had an opportunity to have a long and fruitful debate. A lot of \nSenators and Congressmen and the administration have been involved in \nthis process. There is no use rehashing all of the history. We know we \nneed a Department of Homeland Security. We know this 484-page bill that \nSenator Byrd referred to is not a perfect bill. There are things we \nwill find out very quickly we will have to add that are not there now. \nWe will find out some of the provisions are not good. We will have to \nrevisit that. This is a huge undertaking. We all know this has not been \ndone for 50 years.\n  We will bring together 170,000 people and try to make this thing work \nout of whole cloth. It will be a tremendous challenge, whether Gov. Tom \nRidge or whoever winds up being the Secretary. They will have to have a \nstrong Department. They will have to have support from Congress. We \nwill have to carry out our oversight responsibilities. This will be a \ncontinuing process.\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\n  However, if we do not do it now, when are we going to do it? Do I \nlike this process? No. Is a legislative process like making sausage? \nNo, it is not pretty and it is not done well, sometimes. Sometimes we \nare the problem, individually or collectively. Sometimes it is the \nHouse; sometimes even the administrations make mistakes.\n  The terrorists are not going to wait for a process that will go on \ndays, weeks, or months.\n  We have fought this fight. We need to get this done. And we need to \ndo it now. If we don't, we don't know when this process would end. \nWould we have to go to conference? When would conferees be appointed? \nWho would appoint them? When would the conference meet? I don't want to \nbe singing ``Jingle Bells'' here on December 21. We are all prepared to \ndo it if that is the right thing for the country.\n  But we could very well be working on this again next year. And then \nyou have to get this Department started. It could take a month, 2 \nmonths, 3 months, 4 months. Is our homeland going to be secure during \nthat process? Are we vulnerable still in our ports? How about our \ndrinking water? Are we at risk? Yes.\n  Now, there are some things in this bill that cannot stand, as it \npresently is.\n  We don't like it. Texas A University is a great university. \nMississippi State University could do this job. I don't think we ought \nto be setting criteria that directs research being done at one place or \nanother. We have to open that up. We have to make sure everybody has a \nshot at it and that the research will be done at universities--if that \nis needed, and I am not even sure it is--in the right way. We are going \nto change that. You have my commitment we will change that.\n  And I don't like the language in this expatriate area. I think it is \ntoo broad. However, a little bit of what is at stake here is trust. We \nhave to have some modicum of trust that the new Secretary and the \nPresident and the Congress are not going to let these things be done in \nan irresponsible way. We are not going to grant block waivers to \ncompanies that have left this country for tax purposes. But we also \nhave to have some common sense.\n  What if homeland security is at risk? What if a large amount of jobs \nis at stake? What if this particular company offers a particular thing \nwe really need that somebody else can't offer? We are going to have to \ndeal with the liability. We don't like limiting liability in some \nareas--some of our colleagues on both sides. But here is the question: \nAre they going to go into this business of homeland security without \nsome degree of reliability that what they are going to be able to do \nwill be without the threat of lawsuits going on and destroying them?\n  We are asking companies to produce items and to deal with this \nvaccine problem. Let me tell you, one of the toughest decisions the \nPresident of this United States is going to have to make is are we \ngoing to have a broad-based smallpox vaccination of the population? \nThat could kill hundreds, thousands of people, but perhaps protect \nmillions. It is a huge, tough, emotional, personal decision the \nPresident is going to have to make. And liability exposures could be \nhuge.\n  But do we want the vaccine? Do we want the inoculation opportunity to \nprotect our people? Yes.\n  So I am asking for common sense. I am asking for trust. I am asking \nfor action now. And we will address some of these issues. I am going to \nbe specific as the day goes forward about some of the changes that are \ngoing to have to be made. We will find what they are. We will find a \nvehicle.\n  Some people would say: Change it now and let the House deal with it. \nBut how do you do that? How do they do that? How do we get a \nconclusion? How much longer does it delay this? We need to get this \ndone, my colleagues, and now is the time to do it. We need to work \ntogether to make sure it is implemented in the right way.\n  We are going to find there are a lot of provisions here that are \ngoing to have to be refined. There are going to have to be technical \ncorrections. There are going to have to be amendments and they are \nprobably going to come soon. But I urge the Senate to go ahead and act \nnow.\n  As I said earlier, we have fought this fight. Is it perfect? No bill, \nno law, ever is. And I am going to ask the President of the United \nStates to give us some assurances, when he signs this legislation, that \nwe are going to look at it carefully and we are going to continue to \nwork to make sure he has the authority and that the Department does the \njob in the way we expect them to do it.\n  In conclusion, I thank Senator Lieberman, the chairman of the \ncommittee, for his work. He was for it before it was cool. And so were \nsome others on that side and this side. I thank Senator Fred Thompson \nfor his great effort. This is his swan song. He will be leaving at the \nend of this year and we are going to miss him. These are two fine \nSenators who have worked on a very difficult job. I think we should \nshow our appreciation to them and get this work complete.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4953.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Who yields time?\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if no proponent wishes to take the 1 minute, \nI will take 1 minute.\n  I say to my colleagues that the Senate had just 48 hours to review \nthe 484 pages of the House bill before cloture was invoked, before we \nstabbed ourselves with the dagger.\n  In reviewing the details of the bill finally, though, I have had a \nchance to do a cursory review. The Congressional Budget Office has \nidentified three provisions that increase mandatory spending by $3.26 \nbillion. Some of this new mandatory spending has nothing whatsoever to \ndo with homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my time has not expired. Senators should pay \nattention. I insist that I have the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for at least a \nhalf minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, at age 85, I need no hearing aid. I don't \nthink I will ever need one, but sometimes it is pretty difficult to \nhear, even for those who can even hear better.\n  These additional expenditures are not provided for in the budget \nresolution adopted in 2001 for fiscal years 2002 through 2011. \nTherefore, the amendment is subject to a point of order under section \n302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute. We have debated \nthis issue for 8 weeks. The American people spoke very clearly on this \nissue in the election. It is now time for us to speak.\n  This is the vote on homeland security and I urge my colleagues to \nvote aye.\n  I would like to thank Richard Hertling, the distinguished staff \nmember who has been the leader here. I thank Mike Solon of my staff, \nand I thank Rohit Kumar of the Republican leader's staff.\n  Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of order.

On this question, the yeas are 69, the nays \nare 30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is agreed to and the point of order \nfalls.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the next two votes be 10-minute \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Thompson \nsubstitute amendment to the Homeland Security bill. While I have \nconcerns about the process by which this legislation was put together \nand some of the provisions contained in it, I believe that passage of \nthe Homeland Security bill is a necessary first step in the \nGovernment's effort to secure our nation against future terrorist \nattacks.\n  I want to speak first about the provisions in the bill that will help \nmy State of New Mexico. First, I am pleased that this legislation \nincludes many provisions that will ensure that New Mexico's national \nlaboratories--Sandia and Los Alamos continue to play a key role in the \nfight against terrorism. To that end, the Thompson amendment \nincorporates a number of science and technology provisions from Senator \nLieberman's Homeland Security bill that I helped write.\n  In particular, I am pleased that the Thompson amendment allows the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to become a joint sponsor of the \nDepartment of Energy's national laboratories. I believe joint \nsponsorship retains the clear lines of authority needed for the \nGovernment to manage the national laboratory system effectively. I am \nalso happy to see that the bill includes $500 million for the \ntechnology acceleration fund, which represents a good starting point \nfor our investment in the new technology that will be needed to defend \nour homeland against terrorist threats. Finally, the amendment includes \nthe formation of a Homeland Security Institute, as called for by the \nNational Academy of Sciences. The Institute will provide vital \ntechnical analysis and policy advice to the new Department. In \nparticular, I look for the Institute to help the new Department strike \nan appropriate balance between the desire for greater information \ngathering by law enforcement and intelligence agencies and the \nfundamental need to protect the privacy rights of individuals. I \nbelieve we have done the right thing by establishing a not-for-profit \ninstitute to advise the Department on these most important issues.\n  The bill also transfers the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, \nFLETC, to the Homeland Security Department and ensures that the \nactivities currently underway continue to be carried out at the same \nlocations. This will ensure that the FLETC division in Artesia, NM, \nwill continue to play a key role in training Federal law enforcement \npersonnel who are on the front lines in the effort to keep our country \nsafe.\n  The legislation also creates a new Bureau of Border Security within \nthe Department of Homeland Security, which will include the Customs \nService and Border Patrol, as well as the other enforcement functions \nof the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS. While I would have \npreferred that the service and enforcement functions of the INS be kept \nunder a single directorate, as proposed by Senator Lieberman, I am \nhopeful that the consolidation of these border agencies under a single \nbureau will enable us to address the efficiency and security problems \nthat have been experienced at ports-of-entry along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder in recent years. That said, if we are ever going to ensure the \nsecurity of our borders, we must also take steps to improve the \nefficiency of the INS with regard to its processing of legal \nimmigrants. As the new Department takes shape, it is my hope that the \nSecretary of Homeland Security will make immigration reform a top \npriority.\n  I would also like to talk briefly about some of the concerns I have \nwith this bill. First, I was deeply troubled with the process by which \nthe final legislation was crafted. Senator Lieberman worked for months \nin good faith to craft a Homeland Security bill that was well thought \nout and included significant input from both the majority\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\nand minority in the Senate. His bill even passed the Governmental \nAffairs Committee with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, when the bill \ncame to the Senate floor, the Republican party and President Bush chose \nto politicize the issue and block many good faith efforts to pass the \nbill before the election. After the election, the President and the \nRepublican leadership, with virtually no other input, produced this \n484-page bill, which is loaded with numerous special interest \nprovisions and a bad deal for Federal workers. Further, as we \nconsidered this bill on the Senate floor, we were allowed only one \namendment. This process of last minute, backroom deals and limited \namendments is not the way the Senate should conduct its business.\n  Second, as I mentioned, this bill is loaded with special interest \nprovisions that were inserted at the eleventh hour by the Republican \nleadership at the request of the White House. The one amendment that \nwas considered would have stricken seven of the most egregious \nprovisions. One such provision will grant new liability protections for \npharmaceutical companies that make mercury-based vaccine preservatives \nthat may have caused autism in children. Provisions such as this have \nnothing to do with homeland security and have no business being in the \nHomeland Security bill. That is why I was greatly disappointed that the \nSenate voted against the Daschle/Lieberman amendment to strike these \nseven extraneous provisions from the bill.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize that I remain concerned with the lack of \nprovisions that address protections for civil service employees. I know \nthat support for these provisions has been characterized over the last \nfew weeks as support for the unions. I think that characterization is \noverly simplistic, however, and the issue far more complex. I believe \nthat all employees--whether they be in the public or the private \nsector--deserve to be protected against the arbitrary treatment this \nso-called ``flexible'' management system will allow. Over the decades \nwe have established a set of reciprocal principles and practices in \nGovernment service that require both employers and employees to treat \neach other with respect and integrity. Those principles and practices \nhave worked well through national crises of all kinds and a willingness \nhas always been evident on the part of both employers and employees to \nsit down and work through problems that have arisen.\n  The idea that we need to change that system because it will break \ndown in this instance is, in my view, a red herring. There is no \nevidence that this will occur, and there are no examples when it has \noccurred. From where I sit, the brave men and women who work along the \nborder in the Border Patrol, U.S. Customs, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service are patriots and are not inclined to take any \naction that would harm the national interest. They deserve better than \nthis bill offers. There are no protections against unlawful \ndiscrimination, political favoritism, and unjust decisions. There are \nno protections for whistleblowers. There are no protections against \nmanagement that use the ``flexibility'' available in this bill to \nsettle a personal or professional grudge. There was instead a decision \non the part of the administration to impose its ideological solution to \na problem that begged for discussion and compromise. What we ended up \nwith was a bill that establishes a system based on individual whims and \nnot established law. Government employees deserve better than this, and \nI believe in the end our capacity to serve the public will be \ndiminished because we did not find a way to address this issue in a \nmutually satisfactory manner. That said, I believe the need for the \ncreation of a Homeland Security Department outweighed the potential \nconsequences of these provisions in the bill. As the President takes \nsteps to establish the new Department, I will be watching his actions \nwith regard to Federal workers closely, and I hope that we will have \nthe opportunity to address this matter further during the 108th \nCongress.\n  It may seem like we have finally reached the end of a long and \ndifficult debate on how best to ensure our homeland security, but \npassage of this bill means that our efforts have just begun. It will \ntake some time to get the Homeland Security Department off the ground. \nDuring the coming transition, I am committed to helping President Bush \nmake this new Department operational as soon as possible, and I will \ncontinue working to ensure that the new Department has the funds \nnecessary to carry out its mission effectively. Further, I will \ncontinue working to maintain New Mexico's preeminent position in the \nfight against terrorism and to ensure that our national labs remain at \nthe leading edge of homeland security research and development. At the \nsame time, I will be monitoring closely the actions of the President \nand his administration as this legislation is implemented. We do not \nhave to sacrifice our civil liberties to maintain homeland security, \nand I will be working to ensure that the new Department remains \naccountable to the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on H.R. 5005.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may soon \nmake a unanimous consent request that the time be charged against the \npending measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, soon, I am going to ask unanimous consent \nto take up the emergency disaster relief bill that the Senate passed \nearlier with over 79 votes on September 10, 2002.\n  The only difference between my consent request today and that \namendment is today's bill reimburses the $752 million of section 32 \nfunds that were used to pay for the livestock compensation program \nearlier this year. This all really stems from the agricultural disaster \nour country has been facing for the last year and, frankly, in \npreceding years.\n  In 1996, not too many years ago--that is the year before the drought \nbegan in Montana--our producers earned $847 million from wheat sales. \nIn 2001, 4 years later into the drought--we have had a series of \ndroughts in Montana--producers made just $317 million from wheat sales, \na 62-percent decline.\n  That 62-percent decline in sales is through absolutely no fault of \nMontana wheat producers. These farmers haven't been cooking the books. \nThis is not an Enron matter or a WorldCom matter. They have not been \ntaking exorbitant bonuses at the expense of their shareholders. They \nhave been farmers and ranchers working the soil and doing their very \nbest, in many cases, just to survive. They are dedicated, honest, plain \nfolks, raising livestock for our country and the world, raising \nagricultural and grain products to try to make ends meet. They need our \nhelp.\n  The drought is no longer touching only isolated pockets of our \ncountry; it has become an epidemic that is affecting a majority of our \nNation.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 49 percent of our \nNation's counties were declared an agricultural disaster in 2001; 78 \npercent of our counties were declared a disaster in 2002; 38 percent of \nthose counties were declared a disaster in both 2001 and 2002.\n  So it is in many parts of the country. In fact, a map I displayed in \nthis body earlier showed that the western half of the United States \nbasically is experiencing drought conditions, and the eastern United \nStates as well. Now, there are also pockets. In Montana, for example, \nthere are some counties where farmers are devastated and other counties \nwhere they harvested a bit of a crop.\n  In any event, if you are a farmer who has lost his crop continuously \nand you are having a very difficult time making ends meet, I say you \ndeserve our help.\n  According to the New York Times, on May 3 of this year:\n\n       In eastern Montana, more than a thousand wheat farmers have \n     called it quits rather than try to coax another crop out of \n     ground that has received less rain in the last 12 months than \n     many deserts get in a year.\n\n  It is anticipated that another 1,300 wheat producers will call it \nquits this year if disaster assistance is not provided.\n  Continuing, Mr. President, that same New York Times article--this is \nan eastern newspaper, not Montana:\n\n       Those people, small businesses and rural communities have \n     been devastated by an unpredictable and uncontrollable \n     national phenomenon.\n\n  On September 3, 2002, the Wall Street Journal also printed an \narticle:\n\n       The United States may be looking at the most expensive \n     drought in its history inflicting economic damage far beyond \n     the farm belt.\n\n  Producers every day hope, plead, ask that Congress help them a little \nbit.\n  I could go on at great length. I am not going to go on at great \nlength except to say many times we have brought up this measure. It \npassed the Senate by a large margin both times, and the other body has \nsaid no, basically because the White House has said no. That is a fact. \nNobody denies that fact. I will ask again today; we still do have time \ntoday or tomorrow, however long we are here, to help our farmers. This \nis a disaster payment; it is an emergency disaster payment. This is \nwhat America does. If we have hurricanes, we provide disaster \nassistance. If we have floods, we provide disaster assistance. We have \nother natural disaster phenomena in this country, and the Government \nprovides assistance to help the people get back on their feet. That is \nall we are asking.\n  If we pass this legislation today, the other body can take it up and \npass it, and the President can sign it. It is that simple.\n  As we near the end of this session and approach the holiday season, \nthe very least we can do is provide disaster assistance to our farmers \nand ranchers, many of whom are either going out of business or about to \ngo out of business because of an agricultural disaster, in most cases, \ndrought and in some parts of our country it is flooding.\n  I see our distinguished majority leader on the floor. I am quite \ncertain he wants to speak on this matter as well. It is a huge issue in \nmany parts of our country. It is very much hoped we can take disaster \nassistance up and pass it at this time. I yield now to my colleague \nfrom South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nMontana. He has been at this now for over a year. The very first \nconversation I had about drought assistance was with Senator Baucus \nover a year ago. I believe it was in connection with the economic \nstimulus package of a year ago. It has been 278 days since the Senate \nacted. So he has been at it for over a year. We, as a Senate, have been \nat it now for 278 days.\n  I must say, we can go all the way back to a year ago when Senator \nBaucus made the case that if you want\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\neconomic stimulus in our part of the country, there is no better \neconomic stimulus than to provide some drought assistance.\n  I would use the word economic salvation. This is more than stimulus \nin our part of the country. This is salvation. This is the only way we \ncan provide some salvation to ranchers and farmers who otherwise will \nnot be here a year from now. We have done everything we know how to do. \nWe have passed amendments. We have passed legislation in various forms. \nWe have offered the House an opportunity to negotiate with us. We have \nsuggested to the White House: Act alone. It does not matter, use \nwhatever vehicle you will, but get it done.\n  How in the name of economic stimulus can we ignore a large part of \nour geographic population, a large part geographically of our country? \nIf these people are without this assistance, the rural communities \nassociated with these people simply cannot survive.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his leadership and for again \ncoming to the floor to remind our colleagues of the import of this \nquestion, of the urgency that we get something done before we leave. \nThis may be the last day. We may not be in session after today. If we \ndo not do it today, we will not do it. What kind of a message does that \nsend to rural America, to farmers and ranchers who have been waiting \nnow 278 days for the Congress to complete its work?\n  We voted, as he said, overwhelmingly--overwhelmingly, Republicans and \nDemocrats. I would hope we were not doing that just for a political \ncover because this is far more important than political cover. This is \neconomic survival. This will provide the only salvation to the farmers \nand ranchers who are desperately looking to Washington for help. Let's \ndo it right. Let's provide this assistance. Let's agree with this \nrequest. Let's get this assistance to them quickly. Let's save them \nbefore it is too late. I hope we will do that this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are many Senators who wish to speak \non this because it is so important. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nable to yield to other Senators without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to my good friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Montana for his leadership on this matter. As the majority leader \nsaid, the Senator has been superb in his leadership on this for now \nover a year and has been speaking out not only on behalf of Montana \nfarmers but on behalf of thousands of Minnesota farmers who have also \nbeen devastated over the last 2 years and have not seen $1 of disaster \naid provided to our State.\n  The message is: If you are a pharmaceutical company and you have that \nkind of political clout, you will be taken care of by the Congress. If \nyou are a company that has run away from this Nation to hide your tax \nobligation, you get a special consideration stuck in the bill that came \nover from the House of Representatives which we just voted on this \nmorning. If you are a farmer in Minnesota, however, Montana, or \nelsewhere and you have been devastated by conditions beyond your \ncontrol, the Congress is going to turn its back on you, the \nadministration is going to turn its back on you.\n  As the Senator pointed out, this Senate has not turned its back on \nfarmers on disaster aid. The 2002 farm bill--and I served with the \nSenator from Montana on the Senate Agriculture Committee--had \nagriculture disaster assistance in that measure, but, again, the House \nand the administration turned a cold shoulder and had no funding \nwhatsoever, and the conference report came back after many days of \nnegotiation with the House unyielding and the administration unyielding \nin their position of not providing disaster assistance.\n  The farmers in my State of Minnesota have lost over three quarters of \na billion dollars in crop devastation in the last 2 years--three-\nquarters of a billion dollars in 2 years, and not $1 back from the \nFederal Government. That is why people lose their faith and trust in \nGovernment because we do the wrong things for the wrong people and we \ndo not do the right things for the right people. By ``we,'' I mean the \ncollective bodies, because this Senator and the majority of the Senate \nhave said again and again: We want to stand with those farmers who are \nsuffering the greatest losses, who are being wiped out.\n  Over half the crops in my region have been wiped out over each of the \nlast 2 years.\n  I say let's stand with the farmers. I stand proudly with the Senator \nfrom Montana. I thank him for his leadership. Let's make one last plea \nto this body and the House and the administration to do what is right \nand do what is urgently needed on behalf of farmers in my State and \nelsewhere in this country.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding \nto me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I now yield as much time as he consumes to \nthe Senator from North Dakota, an ardent fighter on behalf of \nagriculture, I might add.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nbringing this issue before the Senate again and again.\n  It is interesting what people consider a priority in this Congress. \nWe have voted on this issue of drought relief and disaster assistance \nfor farmers in the Senate. Seventy-nine Members of the Senate voted to \ndo something. We passed legislation for $5.9 billion. Let me tell you \nwhy we did that.\n  This map shows what happened to a major part of the country. A major \npart of our country suffered a devastating drought. In my State, we had \nthat extreme drought in the southwestern corner. We also had extreme \nmoisture and therefore flooding in the northeastern corner.\n\n  Let me show a picture of two farmers in the same State. This farmer \nis standing on his land that looks like a moonscape. Put seeds in that \nground and nothing grows. Is that a disaster? It is if you put all your \nhopes, dreams, and capital into the ground. We had literally a \nmoonscape. No pasture, no crops in these areas.\n  In the same State, flooded land. Drought and flooding. No crop.\n  Now, when family farmers suffer this circumstance, they cannot make \nit from one year to the next. One of my colleagues said we really ought \nto name droughts. We do name hurricanes. If a hurricane came through \ntomorrow and it took a portion of the country and flattened it, \nimmediately airplanes would leave Washington, DC, FEMA would be on the \nairplane, other governmental offices would be on the plane, and they \nwould be rushing there. Why? Because Hurricane Andrew, Emma, or \nHurricane Myrtle hit land. We would all understand this was a disaster. \nAll of the mechanisms of the Federal Government racheting up to try to \ndeal with disasters would be on the way to help.\n  But this gripping, relentless drought that occurred in our country, \nwith flooding in some other parts, is something that happens over time. \nSo there are enough people in Congress--including the President of the \nUnited States--who decided we do not want to do anything; we want to \nblock this. We passed disaster assistance by 79 votes in the Senate. \nBipartisan. The Speaker of the House and the President say, We do not \nwant it, we will not do it.\n  My colleague from Minnesota made an appropriate point. What did they \nhave time to do? As to the question of whose side are you on, at least \npart of the answer this morning is we are on the side of corporations \nwho want to renounce their citizenship and move offshore to stop paying \ntaxes to the United States Government, or at least minimize those \ntaxes. We would like to become citizens of Bermuda, some corporations \nsay. So this morning the vote in the Senate was to say, at least by the \nmajority, regrettably, we would like to help those companies. The \nSenate already voted to say if you want to renounce your American \ncitizenship, you ought not be getting American contracts with the \nFederal Government.\n  In the homeland security bill they have stuck in a little piece that \nsays let's make it easier for corporations that renounce their \ncitizenship to get\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\nthese contracts. That was a priority. It was a priority, for those \ncorporations that renounce their citizenship, to help them out. We had \nthe time and the will by some in Congress to help them out.\n  It is interesting, exactly the same people who do not want to lift a \nfinger to help family farmers are saying we would like to help out \nthese poor corporations that renounce their citizenship.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How many family farmers in North Dakota are able to move \noffshore to Bermuda and not pay income taxes? How many would you guess \ncould do this?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The answer is zero. But the answer would be zero if every \nfarmer had the opportunity to do it. Do you know why? Because our \nfarmers are Americans. They do not want to move anywhere. They do not \nwant to become citizens of Bermuda. They do not want to avoid paying \nincome taxes. They would love to pay income taxes for a change. They \nwould like an opportunity to have an income to pay income tax.\n  There is no income with a moonscape farm or when your crop is under \nwater. Our farmers would not move to Bermuda for tax purposes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And that means they do not have to pay income tax.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. They consider that unpatriotic.\n  The question is, why does Congress have time to help those \ncorporations that renounce their citizenship but it does not have time \nto pass a piece of legislation that deals with disaster?\n  The point the Senator from Minnesota made is an important point. They \nhave the opportunity and the will, apparently, to help drug companies \nbut not family farmers.\n  It was Tom Paxon a couple of decades ago, when Congress gave some \nfinancial assistance to Poland, who wrote a song that said, ``I'm \nchanging my name to Poland.''\n  Well, the question is, What is important to the Congress? Do you have \nto change your name to get some help? My farmers are named Johnson, \nOlson, Christianson, Larson. And they are out there and they put \neverything they have in the ground in North Dakota. They do it on a \nhope and a prayer that somehow it will rain enough, not rain too much, \nthe insects will not come, the disease will not come, and they raise a \ncrop and take it out of the ground and take it to the elevator for some \nmoney. That is a hope beyond hope with a natural disaster.\n  We have a responsibility, if we care about rural America, care about \nfamily farmers and care about the special culture they provide for this \ncountry and contribution they make to this country, we have a \nresponsibility to help in tough times. That is what we ought to do, to \nextend a helping hand to say, we would like to help you during these \ntough times.\n  Yet, I regret, in answer to the question, Whose side are you on, too \nmany decided to block this. They blocked it at the White House, blocked \nit at the speaker's office in the other body. The Senator from Montana \nhas been on the floor before--again and again and again. I am proud to \nhave been here with him to say this is a priority for us. This is not a \ngiveaway. It is not something that is not desperately needed. This is a \nresponsibility as Americans to say to others in this country when they \nneed help, here is a helping hand.\n  I am proud to have served in both the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate. In every circumstance on every occasion where someone in \nthis country has been injured, hurt, or disadvantaged by fires and \nfloods and earthquakes and tornados and so many natural disasters, I am \nproud to say I have voted to provide disaster assistance to them \nbecause I believe that is the best of what we should do in this \ncountry.\n  I will never, ever vote against that kind of assistance to people who \nare down and out and need help. That is why I would have expected this \nCongress and this President to join us, 79 Members of the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to provide disaster help now when it is \nneeded.\n\n  I regret we may now, in the waning hours, leave this session with an \nobjection to the unanimous consent request, after it has already passed \nthe Senate by 79 votes and after the House is somewhere scattered \nacross America--done with their business, they will have left this \nCongress and left undone a significant piece of legislation that should \nhave been saying to America's family farmers, beset by disaster, that \nthis country cares about you and this country wants to help you in a \ntime of need.\n  Again, let me say thanks to the Senator from Montana for his effort \ntoday. I fully support him.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I notice my colleagues are coming \nover. This is an important matter, and we have an opportunity and we \nowe it to our people to get this legislation passed.\n  I yield to my friend from Michigan, Senator Stabenow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana who has \nbeen such a leader on this issue. We have all joined on the floor time \nand time again to talk about the need for emergency assistance, for \ndisaster assistance in our States. As a member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I stand with my colleagues to indicate that \nMichigan has been under a disaster from flooding, from drought, from \nchanging temperatures. We had our cherry growers this past year find \nextraordinarily high temperatures in April, only to see freezes just a \nfew weeks later. This has stopped the ability for practically any \ncherries to end up on the trees this year. It is incredible, the fact \nthat they have essentially been wiped out, not including what has \nhappened the last 2 years for our grape growers, what has consistently \nbeen the battle for our apple growers, what we have seen from dry beans \nin Michigan, asparagus.\n  I could go on and on. We have had harmed numerous crops in Michigan. \nWe have seen consistent emergencies come as a result of weather.\n  This is not only an issue for our family farmers but for the business \ncommunity as well. When we do not have the cherries on the trees, our \nprocessors do not have any business. We are seeing processing plants \nthat are cutting back or closing. This is a ripple effect throughout \nthe economy in Michigan. I am sure in other States, as well.\n  This is truly a disaster. As my colleagues have said, if this were a \nhurricane, if this were a tornado, if this were another circumstance, \nwe would all be joined together to help communities that find \nthemselves in a disaster situation because of no fault of their own. \nThis is no less a disaster. It is no less a situation out of the \ncontrol of our farmers and all of those involved in agriculture.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana again and stand, as I have \nthroughout this process, with the Senator. This is our last opportunity \nto do this and to indicate to our family farmers, to agriculture across \nthis country, that we understand what you are going through; that we \nsupport you and we will provide the same assistance we would for any \nother disaster and emergency that might occur.\n\n  I strongly hope we will be able to prevail in getting some action \ntoday.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might ask a question of the Senator. Did the Senator by \nany chance vote for disaster assistance to aid other parts of the \ncountry, such as, say, New York City?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. As our leader has just indicated, we are \nconsistently coming together on a bipartisan basis to support important \nefforts. I was proud to stand with all my colleagues in the time of \nneed of New York and New Jersey and all those who were affected after \n9/11. We consistently have requests from FEMA that come forward, to \nwhich it is necessary that we respond, and we do that and we step up \ntogether. Honestly, for the life of me, I do not understand why, when \nit comes to our farmers, we do not have the same bipartisan support nor \nthe same support from the administration. It is deeply concerning.\n  I very much hope as we come to the end of the session that we could \ncome together and stand up for those who fight hard every day against \nthe elements. They are in a tough job. They cannot control whether it \nrains or shines. Yet they are putting food on our tables, as well as \naround the world, and providing for a very important part of our \neconomy. I hope we stand up for them at this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus of Montana; \nSenators Dorgan and Conrad of North Dakota; Senator Stabenow of \nMichigan; my colleague, Tom Daschle of South Dakota; and others who \nhave risen on the floor to talk about the urgent need for disaster \nrelief to the agricultural sector of our economy. It seems \nextraordinary to me that at a time when we have passed disaster relief \nfor earthquakes in California, hurricanes in Florida or New York or \nwhatever--whenever there is a natural disaster that has occurred, our \ncountry has come together. Our colleague, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, \nsuggests perhaps we ought to give names to these droughts. If it was \nDrought Hugo or Drought Andrew, perhaps there would be a different \nperception at the White House.\n  I was profoundly disappointed this summer when President Bush \ntraveled all the way to Mount Rushmore, in fact, to announce to the \nagricultural sector that there would be no relief other than what \nmeager amount there might be available in the farm bill. That was never \ndesigned to address natural disasters. We have always dealt with \ndisasters in the agricultural sector or any other sector of the economy \non an individual basis. Some years we have them, some we do not. There \nis no slush fund in the farm bill designed to be utilized for a \ndisaster relief. It is simply not put together that way.\n  Yet we know we could do a full $6 billion level of drought relief and \ndo it in a fiscally responsible fashion because, in fact, the farm \nbill, over the course of this next year, is going to be using less \ncountercyclical payments, and those payments will not be required, and \nthat will come to around a $6 billion savings. It is not a technical \noffset, we know that, but it is a fiscally responsible way we can go \nabout doing this.\n  But to single out agriculture for the first time ever in this \nunprecedented way strikes me as an extraordinarily bad precedent. \nRepublican and Democratic administrations alike in the past have \nsupported disaster relief when disasters occur. It is not like we seek \nrelief every time we have a little shortage of rain or a little problem \nof one kind or another. That is the nature of agriculture. But what we \nhave here is a devastating circumstance that has damaged agriculture in \na significant way in some 37 different States, at least, across the \ncountry. Yet we have an administration for the first time ever saying \nwe will help tornado victims, we will help hurricane victims, will help \nearthquake victims, but if you are in the agricultural sector, forget \nabout it. We are not going to be there for you. That is a precedent \nthat is of profound consequence to the agricultural sector all across \nour country.\n  In South Dakota, the State university tells us the loss to the \neconomy is already in excess of $2 billion in our small State. \nObviously this ripples up and down every Main Street of every \ncommunity. Those who are the least capitalized, the younger producers, \nare the first to be forced off the land at a time when we have a \ndemographic problem as it is in terms of keeping our young people and \nyoung leaders in our rural communities. It has an enormous impact. We \nwill be feeling the effects for years and years to come. Even if we \nwere to have this disaster relief, as Senator Baucus well knows, this \nwould not make people whole. This would not make it as though the \ndisaster had not occurred. This would simply get people by through the \nwinter so they can know whether they have to continue to disperse their \nherds or whether they would continue to farm at all--they would have \nthat knowledge. They would be in the hope next year things would turn \nbetter.\n  As it is, we have had a 2001 and 2002 drought, 2 years back to back. \nOn top of that, we have unfair trade policy, concentration in the \nagricultural sector, and all kinds of conditions at work to lower the \nprice that our producers get in too many cases and it simply gangs up \non our producers to the point where income is falling off a radical \nlevel this year--down at least 23 percent this year; last year it \nwasn't good. What we are going to find is a depopulation of this part \nof the country.\n  If we were seeking something unique and special for the agricultural \nsector that no other sector gets, it would be one thing, but what we \nare looking for is equity, fairness. I ask my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Montana, who has played such a lead role in helping to raise this \nissue, is there any logic, is there any equity in singling out the \nagricultural sector to be devoid of any kind of disaster relief as \nopposed to any other sector that faces a natural disaster in America? \nWhy should agriculture be the one sector that is told to drop dead when \nyou have a natural disaster in your region?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my friend. Frankly, I was going to ask him \nroughly the same question; namely, what possible reason could the \nadministration have, the other side of the body have, for saying no? \nWhat possible reason? Can you even think of a reason? The only one I \ncan think of is, perhaps, that it costs money. That cannot be a reason \nwhen we spend so much money in so many areas where there is no \ndisaster, no emergency. This is black and white. This is so easy. As \nthe Senator has so articulately said, in so many instances it is the \nAmerican way to help parts of the country that suffer natural \ndisasters, America is there. America has a big heart. We are there. We \nare Americans. We work together to help other Americans who suffer \ndisasters.\n  The Senator has mentioned earthquakes. We know of the devastating \nearthquakes, say in California and we were there. We know of the \ndevastating hurricanes in Florida or on the eastern coast, and we have \nbeen there. We know of other floods and we have been there. All of us \ntogether have been there. As the Senator said, it has been nonpartisan, \nit has just been America.\n  But for some reason, and I cannot fathom what the reason is, the \nWhite House said no to this disaster; said no. The other body, on the \nother side, said no. The only possible reason I can think of, as the \nSenator has suggested, for some reason they think they can get away \nfrom it because farmers and ranchers are kind of stoic. They are good \npeople. They do not raise the rafters. They don't take to the streets. \nThey are good, solid people.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota made a good point earlier. He \nsaid, and frankly this is very poignant, it is ironic: When our beloved \nlate departed colleague, Senator Wellstone, often said, there are other \npeople--there are law firms, lobbyists, who can represent big companies \nin Washington, DC. But he, Senator Wellstone, was there to represent \nthe people who don't have big lobbyists and well-heeled people. He, \nSenator Wellstone, is there to represent the people. That is our job. \nIt is the job of both sides of the aisle, to represent the people. It \nis the job of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to represent the people.\n  Now we have our nation's farmers and ranchers, down and out--there \nare not better, more decent, hard-working, wonderful, people in America \nthan our farmers and our ranchers. They don't complain. They work \nreally hard. They do their very best. Yet the administration and the \nother body is turning their backs to them.\n  It reminds me sometimes of New York. The current occupant of the \nChair from New Jersey certainly knows this phenomenon. Certainly, when \nan administration or Congress says no to something New York wants, the \nheadlines are: Drop dead. The administration says drop dead.\n  Clearly this administration, the other party, to our farmers and \nranchers has said: Drop dead.\n  The Senator made another excellent point; namely, the farm bill is \nnot designed to take care of natural disasters. You must have a crop to \nparticipate in the Farm Bill. There is no slush fund, the Senator said, \nin the farm bill.\n  The farm bill is irrelevant to this phenomenon, this disaster, we are \nfacing. For the life of me, I cannot understand. Maybe drought is just \na ``silent killer,'' as some of our colleagues mentioned earlier. It is \nnot on the front pages. It is the silent killer in different parts of \nthe country. You do not see it coming slowly, but it just as pernicious \nand devastating, if not more so.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his insight \nbecause I think he is exactly right. While the damage is as great as \nwith any other disaster, it takes a matter of days and weeks and months \nfor this to occur, as opposed to the headline-grabbing earthquake or \ntornado or hurricane that may take a day or two and grab headlines.\n  I invite my colleagues from the House who have refused to even hold\n\n[[Page S11378]]\n\nhearings on this issue, much less have a vote of any kind on disaster \nrelief, and I invite the administration to come to my part of the \ncountry to look at what has happened to those fields, to those farms, \nand to those ranches. The liquidation of herds has already taken place. \nThe equity built up for generations has been lost over the course of \nthis last year. Again, we find a stone wall relative to disaster relief \nfor agriculture.\n  I applaud the leadership of my colleague from Montana, and my \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, and Senators Dorgan, \nConrad, Nelson, and others who have done so much to highlight the \nequity and the common sense of this action. It is my hope that before \nwe leave this place, we can in fact see to it that our rural parts of \nAmerica get the same kind of attention, the same kind of concern, and \nthe same kind of compassion that every other part of America and every \nother sector gets when they have unmitigated disasters facing them.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have the floor. Before I yield time to \nthe Senator from North Dakota, I see the distinguished minority leader. \nI ask if he can wait for a short while so the Senator from North Dakota \ncan give his statement, if that is OK with the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to withhold. I hope it \ndoesn't take too long.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am giving him in a little nudge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. I thank \nthe Republican leader. I appreciate that.\n  As you can imagine, this is deadly serious for the people I \nrepresent. This picture says it all. This is what southwestern North \nDakota looks like. It looks like a moonscape. Nothing grew this year. \nIt is the most devastating drought that many have faced since the \n1930s. Many would say it is an even more devastating drought than we \nhad in the 1930s because absolutely nothing grew this year. It is a \ndevastation.\n  One of the newspapers in our State published this headline: \n``Disaster Aid Just Common Sense.'' This is my hometown newspaper. They \nsaid: Look, this is a circumstance that demands a response. Always \nbefore, we have given disaster assistance to every other part of the \ncountry in every other circumstance, but not here.\n  The President of the United States says take the aid out of the farm \nbill. There is no disaster aid in the farm bill. That was specifically \nprecluded. But the farm bill can provide the funding because the \nsavings from the farm bill will directly provide the amount of money \nnecessary for disaster assistance.\n  Here is the circumstance we face, according to the USDA. Net farm \nincome is going to go down 21 percent even though prices are higher. \nEven though farm program payments will be lower, farm income is going \nto plunge. It is going to plunge because of natural disasters in every \npart of the country. Obviously, it is very acute in the Midwest--\nespecially Montana, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\n  I end by reminding colleagues of what Senator Wellstone, who so \ntragically died, said in his last days. He was fighting for disaster \naid. He said: ``Politics delays aid for northwest Minnesota farmers.''\n  Senator Wellstone may be prophetic in what he said because he was \nafraid that politics would kill the disaster assistance that is so \ndesperately needed.\n  In my State, literally hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of farm \nfamilies will be forced off the land if we don't do what we have always \ndone in the past; that is, provide disaster assistance--a disaster \npackage that can be fully offset and fully funded by savings out of the \nfarm bill. Because of these natural disasters, and because we have had \ndrought and floods, production is less and prices are higher. That \nmeans payments are less from the farm bill. That money could be used to \npay for disaster assistance that is so desperately needed.\n  I plead with my colleagues. I plead with them. Let us do now what we \nhave always done in the past. When any part of the country suffered a \ndisaster, we helped. We should do no less now.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3099, the bill to provide emergency \ndisaster assistance to agricultural producers, that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements thereon be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, before I ask the Chair to put that question, let me \njust say that I plead with my good friend, the minority leader--soon to \nbecome the majority leader--from Mississippi. I know he is about to \nobject. But I urge him to not object at this point.\n  Maybe there is a way to work something out here. I say that because \nthis is not a political gesture. As the Senator well knows, Mississippi \nfarmers are hurt for various reasons. As a final good-faith, bipartisan \nway to work something out with the White House, if he can possibly \nfigure it out--I don't want to put the Senator on the spot. Believe me. \nI don't. I am only putting it this way because this could be the last \nday we are in session, and we still have an opportunity here. I wonder \nif the Senator might not object. As the Senator from North Dakota \npointed out very well, there really is no cost to this because the farm \nbill costs will be about this amount less because of the way the farm \nbill works; namely, with the drought we have less production and higher \nprices and much less in government payments made to farmers, it works \nout to be very close to the amount of disaster assistance to farmers \nand ranchers who suffer from a natural disaster.\n  I know it is a long shot. I am still going to make the request. We \nhaven't given up around here trying to help our people.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have no \ndoubt about the seriousness of the sponsors of this effort. Also, I am \nsure the administration and the Congress are going to continue to look \nat this to find ways to be of assistance in every way that is possible \nand that is needed.\n  There are a couple of serious problems with this, though. First of \nall, we do not really know what the cost will be. We are being told it \nwouldn't cost anything because it would come out of the agriculture \nbill. I thought I heard another Senator say you can't take it out of \nthe agriculture bill that we passed because it is prohibited. I am not \nsure exactly how that would work.\n  Second, this bill came straight to the floor. It didn't come through \nthe committee. I have a lot of faith, even though I disagree sometimes \nwith the leadership on the Agriculture Committee. My colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, is certainly sensitive to agricultural \ndisasters. He will be the chairman of the Agriculture Committee next \nyear. We will have a chance to revisit this. But no committee \nconsidered it; it was just brought straight to the floor.\n  For those reasons and others, and the fact that the House will not \nhave an opportunity to fully consider it, or even take it up at this \nlate date, I would have to object. So I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am gravely disappointed that there is \nobjection.\n  Our farmers cannot wait, frankly, until next year. It looks like they \nare going to have to wait now. Those who are still farming, those who \nare still raising livestock are going to have to somehow dig deeper, if \nyou pardon the pun, to make a living, scratching off the land.\n  I am baffled. I am totally baffled. This case is so clear. With all \ndue respect to my colleague from Mississippi, he made two inconsistent \npoints. I heard no real reason, just an objection, as is any Senator's \nright under the rules of the Senate.\n  But, nevertheless, we have spoken. And I will fight this in January; \nthat is, we will figure out some way to help our farmers and ranchers \nwho are suffering from these disasters, just as other people around the \ncountry get aid when they experience disasters.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank you for this \nopportunity to speak today regarding the importance of disaster relief \nyet this year.\n  Now, in just the last few minutes it became fairly clear this is now \ngoing to have to carry over. And I respectfully disagree with the \nRepublican leader that this should be carried over. I do understand the \nrules and will have to abide by them, but I think it is important to \npoint out that while the legislation may wait, the people who need \nthese funds for their very survival are not going to be able to wait. \nThey are going to sell off their land. Many are selling their herds \nright now. They will not wait because they can't wait. We will have to \nwait for this legislation and do the best we can.\n  But I would like to quickly thank Senator Baucus and certainly \nSenator Daschle for their tireless efforts to provide drought \nassistance. And I certainly associate myself with the comments made by \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota, who I think very eloquently laid out \nthe numbers and what the implications are relative to the need for this \ndisaster relief in his State.\n  Nebraska isn't much different. Much of our land looks like a \nmoonscape because the pastures have had inadequate precipitation for a \nnumber of months and, in many cases, years, and they do not come back \nquickly. Without water, without snow, without the precipitation \nrequired, the grass simply will not grow.\n  This body has twice passed drought assistance--twice. We first passed \nit as drought relief. Then we passed it as part of the Interior \nappropriations process. We tried to include it in the farm bill.\n  Yet as we come to the conclusion of this 107th Congress, the House \nhas failed to act. We must try one more time to get the point across so \nthat, as the year turns from 2002 to 2003, there will still be a \nrecollection that just because the year has changed, the conditions \nhave not changed; they continue, unfortunately.\n  We are here not to make a point, although a point must, in fact, be \nmade, but to get the necessary drought assistance for our farmers and \nranchers in those areas of our country that are experiencing a \ncontinuing drought, a multiyear drought, that is devastating to their \neconomic well-being today and threatens to be even more devastating in \nthe days ahead.\n  Some are worried, apparently, about the cost. I, too, as a fiscal \nconservative, am worried about the cost. But I must ask, what would we \ndo if it was a different kind of natural disaster, let's say a \nhurricane or a flood or an earthquake, some other kind of disaster?\n  It is not that the people in this body are not worried about the \ncost; it is that when we have emergencies, we respond to those \nemergencies without looking for offsets because we recognize \nemergencies are special situations. They cannot be simply provided for \nwithin the current budget or in a future budget.\n  On disaster relief, the Congressional Budget Office has said \nGovernment spending is down, almost enough to pay for this disaster \nrelief, because of this year's high commodity prices. Why cannot we see \nour way clear, in some manner, before the end of the year, or right \nafter the beginning of the new year, to put disaster relief on the \ncontinuing resolution or be the first order of business in the next \nCongress?\n  If some believe this drought is really not as damaging as other \nnatural disasters, I invite them to come to Nebraska and visit with our \nfarmers and our ranchers and take a look at the landscape and begin to \nunderstand that if our farmers and ranchers are unable to make it \nfinancially, the lenders will require them to sell their land, to sell \ntheir herds, to go into bankruptcy.\n  This damaging drought is not only a problem for farmers and ranchers, \nbut it devastates main street Nebraska, main street North Dakota, the \nmain street in any community that depends primarily for its existence \non successful agriculture. If you talk to the merchants in these small \ncommunities, they will tell you what is happening to their business. \nThey are going under. They are not making it. They are worried about \nnot only next year but making it this year. Because if you don't have \nmoney coming from agriculture, these communities are going to wither, \nand they are not going to be able to make it.\n  So I only suggest, half in jest, that we begin to label droughts, \nbecause if this was ``Drought Andrew'' or ``Drought Margaret,'' it \nwould have some identity that could attract emergency aid for a \ndisaster. We make a mistake in not having these droughts named after an \nindividual, as we do with hurricanes, because then these natural \ndisasters, these natural events, that occur over a continuing period of \ntime might have a substance that could attract the attention of those \nwho are today saying: Well, let's put it off until next year.\n  I can assure you, if we had another type of disaster today, it is \nvery unlikely it would be put over until next year. If we had had a \nhurricane last month or the month before, I can absolutely assure you, \nit would not have been put over until next year.\n  I don't think it can be any more clear to me that America's farmers \nand ranchers need this effort in our Senate to go forward. We need the \nHouse to pass disaster relief. I have seen so much of the damage \nfirsthand. I have been across the State. I see the reports. This summer \nI was on a dryland farm that has had crops--some good, some bad--for 70 \nyears. During the Dust Bowl years that farm produced a crop. This year \nthere is no crop--for the first time in 70 years, and perhaps long \nbefore that, certainly in the recollection of the owners of that farm. \nThey can only go back 70 years. But they know there has never been a \nyear until this year where they have not had a crop.\n\n  A family farmer in my hometown of McCook, NE, Dale Dueland, whom I \nhave known since the days he crawled across his family's floor--he is \nnot going to like me saying that, but I remember when he was that \nlittle boy in that farmhouse, and today he is a man with children, and \nwith a successful farming operation, except for the drought. It is not \nsimply because of prices but because it does not matter what the price \nis if you do not have a crop.\n  He does not have a crop. He said he would have a zero yield on his \n900 acres of dryland corn. It would not matter if corn went to $5; if \nyou don't have anything to sell because of a disaster of this kind, you \nare not going to be able to make it. His poor crop performance is not \nthe result of poor planning or poor farming or nondrought-related \nweather. This is the result of a natural disaster that has been going \non in some cases for over 2 years.\n  For much of my State, this is, in fact, a no-yield year or, at best, \na low-yield year.\n  Al Davis from Hyannis, NE, told me that ``each day places another \nnail in the coffin of many individual ranchers in Nebraska and on the \nGreat Plains. Many ranchers have already thrown in the towel and are \nliquidating portions of their herds,'' which will have an impact not \nonly today but tomorrow, the next year, and the next year, because \nrebuilding herds is not a singular event that occurs in a short \ntimeframe. It takes years to build a herd. It takes only days to \nliquidate a herd.\n\n  Annette Dubas, who owns a ranch and farm in western Nance County in \nNebraska, told me that after the third year in a row of drought \nconditions, some farmers in her area have already been forced out while \nothers have been working two jobs just to be able to keep their farm \ngoing. That is neither a happy situation nor is that a good thought \nabout what the future is going to hold. They are going to have to be \nable to sell or they are going to have to be able to have a crop or \nthey are simply going to go out of business.\n  These are not big time corporate farms. Nebraska law bans corporate \nfarming. These are family farmers who are being driven out of business \nfor the first time in generations. These farms have been in their \nfamilies for many generations; in some cases, 100 years or more. \nFarmers and ranchers have not only been let down by Mother Nature, they \nhave been let down by those in the Senate and House who have blocked \nefforts to provide disaster relief despite its severity and despite \nCBO's savings indications.\n  We can't keep denying relief to those in need. Maybe the procedure is \nthat it be put over for another couple months. But it must be one of \nthe first things, if not the first thing, that this Senate\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\nand the House take up after the beginning of the year in the new \nCongress. We cannot allow the House to remain idle on the issue. We \nneed the White House to support this bill, and we cannot allow \nobjections from those few who don't understand that this drought is no \ndifferent than a flood or a hurricane or an earthquake to stop us from \nproviding relief. We must, in fact, recognize the savings from the farm \nbill are there. And if need be, we need to get it as part of this \ndrought assistance.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say, before the Senator from \nNebraska leaves the floor, that the statement made by the Senator from \nNebraska, former Governor, should be a primer for someone trying to lay \nout a case. He laid out a case as well as I have ever heard. He talked \nabout the State itself, about individual people. It is compelling.\n  Nevada, of course, does not have large agricultural interests. We \nhave some agricultural interests. But the Senator from Nebraska has \ndone as good a job as I have ever heard in presenting a case.\n  I hope the people of Nebraska know what an advocate they have in the \nSenator from Nebraska. When students study how to lay out a case, \nwhether it is for farm aid or whether it is for anything else, \nreviewing the statement of the Senator from Nebraska makes the case in \npoint.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. \nThe challenge we have in Nebraska is laid out by the fact that this is \nabout the present but also the future. The future will be dim if we are \nnot able to take care of the problems that have developed in the past \nand continue today. It is about young people, the future of the State, \nand the future food needs for the people of this country. Everybody \nwill be continually adversely affected if we don't remedy this \nsituation as soon as possible. If it can't be before January 7 of this \ncoming year, it would still be early enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n          Bay Mills Indian Community Land Claim Settlement Act\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss another bill, a \nvery important bill to communities in Michigan, a bill I introduced \nearlier this year, S. 2986, the Bay Mills Indian Community Land Claim \nSettlement Act. I also, on a personal note, thank Patty Bouch of my \nstaff for her excellent work on this issue. She has been diligently \nfocused for a number of months now in working with all those interested \nin this issue.\n  S. 2986 provides for congressional approval of a land claim \nsettlement agreement reached earlier this year by the State of \nMichigan, Governor Engler, and the Bay Mills Indian community of \nBrimley, MI. The agreement settles the tribe's longstanding claim to \nover 110 acres of land that was once deeded to the Governor of the \nState to hold in trust for the ancestral bands of the Bay Mills Indian \ncommunity.\n  This land, now called Charlotte Beach, MI, was later sold for unpaid \ntaxes and without the knowledge of the bands or consent of the State. \nIn agreeing to extinguish the historical land claim in the area, the \nBay Mills Indian community will be granted alternative lands in the \nState as outlined in the settlement agreement. These alternative lands \nare located in Port Huron, MI, and would become part of the reservation \nof the Bay Mills Indian community.\n  Furthermore, the legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to \ntake these alternative lands into trust as land obtained in a \nsettlement of a land claim under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The \nSenate Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on S. 2986 on October \n10 of this year. I am very appreciative of Chairman Inouye's \nwillingness to hold the hearing, particularly that week, in light of \nthe fact that the Iraq resolution was being debated at that time on the \nfloor. It was a very serious week with much happening. I am grateful \nfor his willingness to hold the hearing and to work with me on this \nissue as we have moved through the process.\n  The hearing afforded me and House colleagues in attendance and my \nconstituents a forum to explain the merits and the need for the \nlegislation. I appreciate the fact my House colleagues, Congressman \nBart Stupak and Congressman Dave Bonior, were in attendance. They \ntestified in support of S. 2986 as it directly affects their current \ncongressional districts.\n  Before the committee, Congressman Stupak discussed his past efforts \nto remedy this land claim for the Charlotte Beach landowners in his \ndistrict. He has worked on the issue for the last 8 years. He has been \ntrying to resolve it. He believes that S. 2986 will grant the clear \nproperty title to the landowners in Charlotte Beach, MI who have \ninadvertently been involved in an issue greater than themselves.\n  The settlement of this land claim will also greatly benefit a \ncommunity in Michigan. Port Huron, MI is a community that is in great \nneed of new economic development and jobs. The citizens of Port Huron \ncan look directly across the waters at a casino in Canada--right across \nthe bridge. There is a large bridge that goes from Port Huron to \nSarnia. They watch every day as people drive across that bridge, \ncitizens of Michigan and the United States taking their dollars to \nCanada where there are more jobs now as a result of that establishment.\n  On the other side we have a community desperately in need of jobs. \nThis community has wrestled with economic development and what to do. \nIn June of 2001, they had a referendum and the voters of that \ncommunity, after thoughtful discussion and debate, voted by a 55 to 45 \npercent margin to show their support for potential gaming activities in \ntheir community.\n  This was done, as in any community, with thoughtfulness about what \nthe alternatives are. I know they are very frustrated at the fact that \nthey can look at job loss, economic loss right across the river from \nthem.\n  Should my legislation pass this Congress, Port Huron could be the \nlast U.S.-Canadian border crossing in my State to have gaming, which \nwould provide some desperately needed economic development and job \ncreation for a community where the unemployment rate exceeds both the \nState and the national unemployment rate.\n  Unemployment in Port Huron is nearly 12 percent and the community \ndesperately needs new economic development and jobs. They have a plan \nnow. Community leaders have come together and developed a plan that \nwill work for them. It will create jobs in the building and \nconstruction industry, and it will create long-term jobs in the service \nindustry as it relates to this project. They are urgently asking us to \npass this legislation. They are ready to go to work and get it done. \nThey ask that we pass this now in the final day of the session. It is \nvery important to them that this be passed this year and not next year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Indian \nAffairs be discharged from further consideration of S. 2986 and the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of the bill; that the \nbill be read the third time, passed; and that the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, without any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, let me \nsay to my dear friend, the junior Senator from Michigan, I don't oppose \nIndian gaming. I am responsible for writing the Indian Gaming Act. It \nwas done many years ago. I am still a member of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee. I haven't liked the way the law has gone with the Indian \nGaming Act, but I follow what the courts have decreed.\n  I think there have been some very good things happening in the \ncountry in Indian gaming. They have been taken advantage of on a number \nof occasions, but that is the way it is in a lot of different \nbusinesses. I don't oppose Indian gaming, I repeat. While I had some \nconcerns initially, they basically have been met, and I have had some \nvery good relations with Indian gaming operators and operations across \nthe country.\n  I oppose this legislation that my friend from Michigan has asked be \npassed by voice vote today. I oppose it for a number of reasons, not \nthe least of which is that the legislation would undermine the gaming \ncompacts that were approved by the Michigan State Legislature after \nyears of careful and deliberate negotiations.\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\n  Senator Stabenow's bill would circumvent the terms negotiated in all \n11 tribal-State compacts, including the compact to which Bay Mills is a \nparty, which prohibits off-reservation gaming in the absence of a \nrevenuesharing agreement involving all of Michigan's Federally \nrecognized tribes.\n  Additionally, in recent gaming compacts, the tribes involved all \nagreed to limit themselves to one gaming site for each tribe; yet this \nlegislation would allow Bay Mills, which already has two gaming \nfacilities, to open still another facility hundreds of miles from its \nreservation and in direct competition with the tribes in the lower \npeninsula.\n  Secondly, allowing a tribe to settle a land claim and receive trust \nland hundreds of miles from their reservation for the express purpose \nof establishing a gaming facility sets a very dangerous precedent.\n  This pursuit of off-reservation gaming operations should continue to \nfollow the procedures outlined in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \nPublic Law 100-497, which authorizes tribal gaming operations on off-\nreservation ``after-acquired lands'' where the land to be acquired has \nno relationship to the land upon which the claim was based.\n  Let me say that the first gaming compact ever approved with an Indian \ntribe in the history of the country was done in Nevada. So it is not as \nif Nevada is here opposing this request. The first compact ever \napproved in the country was in Nevada. That is still an ongoing \noperation and a very successful one.\n  The proposed casino would be located just north of Detroit on a major \nlink to Ontario that is in the lower corner of the lower peninsula. Bay \nMills is located in the upper peninsula. The legislation is \nfundamentally flawed because it allows Bay Mills to establish gaming \nfacilities under the guise of settling a land claim.\n  The land claim is simply--and everybody knows this--an excuse to take \nland into trust for off-reservation gaming.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for up to 15 minutes and that the time be charged postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Health Care That Works for All Americans Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, recently I introduced with Senator Hatch \nhealth care legislation, the Health Care that Works for All Americans \nAct. I come to the floor today because I think many Senators are \nfrustrated about the inability to make more progress on the health care \nissue in this session of the Senate. I want to take a few minutes and \ntalk about what I think the key principles are for this country to make \nheadway with respect to health care.\n  The three principles that I believe are central on this health care \nissue are, first and foremost, to make sure the public is involved from \nthe ground floor. Again and again, what we have seen is health care \nlegislation proposed that is attacked by special interest groups, and \nthen it goes nowhere. The public gets understandably confused about the \ndiscussion, and the bill dies.\n  Under the Wyden-Hatch legislation, the public would get the first \ncrack at looking at the key issues, which are: What are the essential \nservices that people feel strongly about? How much would they cost? And \nwho would pay for them?\n  The second feature of our legislation is that it establishes a \nprocess to ensure that Congress actually votes for meaningful and \ncomprehensive health reform. The last time Congress took a crack at \nthis, almost a decade ago, there were not even votes in Congress on the \nlegislation.\n  The third principle we ought to zero in on with respect to health \ncare for the future is that it has to be bipartisan. The Wyden-Hatch \nlegislation is literally the first bipartisan effort in comprehensive \nhealth reform in a decade.\n  I come to the Chamber today to say those three principles--involving \nthe public at the outset, ensuring there will be an actual vote by the \nCongress on comprehensive legislation, and that the bill be \nbipartisan--ought to be the core of the Senate's effort to reform the \nhealth care system.\n\n  Today I wish to take a couple of minutes to talk about a central part \nof our legislation, and that is what to do about rising health care \ncosts in America.\n  Rising costs in American health care are a runaway train, and the \nAmerican people have literally been tied to the track. Again and again, \nsmall businesses come up to us and say they have been subjected to 15-, \n20-, 25-percent rate hikes year after year. This is all before the \ndemographic tsunami comes in 2010 and 2011 when we will have millions \nof baby boomers, and right now millions of working families, some with \ninsurance, some without, that cannot afford doctor visits and disease \ntreatments and the drugs they need. So certainly at the center of any \neffort to reform health care has to be putting the brakes on those \nrising costs that are literally a runaway train in our society.\n  There are going to be tough choices. If resources are limited, we \nhave to make some tough calls about how to allocate those resources and \nto focus on some of the ethical and moral questions that are inherent \nin rising costs. The tough moral and ethical considerations that will \nbe necessary to contain them are stark realities, but they have to be \nfaced if this country's health care system is going to work for all.\n  My colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and I have proposed in our \nlegislation, the Health Care that Works for All Americans Act, a \nspecific plan so that citizens can face those realities and fashion a \nbetter health care system.\n  Under our proposal, the American people will have a chance--a chance \nthey have not had in 57 years since health care reform was tackled by \nHarry Truman in the 81st Congress--the American people will have a \nchance, before the special interest groups have at it, to talk about \nthe kind of health care system they believe makes sense for them.\n  Our legislation has two major components: A public participation \nprocess at the outset over a relatively short period of time, and a \nguaranteed vote in both Houses of the Congress on the people's \nrecommendations.\n  When it comes to health care costs, there is a lot for the public to \nexamine. We are now spending 15 percent of our gross domestic product \non health care. The last time it was looked at, the country spent more \nthan $1.4 trillion on medical care, a 10-percent increase from the \nprevious year.\n  If you divide $1.4 trillion by the number of people in this country, \nit comes to almost $5,000 for every man, woman, and child. Tens of \nmillions of our citizens, in addition, slip through the cracks every \nday, even as our Nation pours more and more money into health care.\n  We are going to have to take a look at where the money is going. A \nstudy that has now been published on the Web site of the journal Health \nAffairs attributes spending increases primarily to higher hospital \ncosts and prescription drugs. Hospitals are raising prices to make up \nfor declining insurance, Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, and the \nmoney they lose treating patients with no insurance at all. Moreover, a \nbacklash against the tight hospitalization controls of managed care has \nclearly contributed to rising costs.\n  There are a host of relentless forces converging on American health \ncare. Technological innovations seem to be coming at us from every \narea, and each miracle cure comes with a high cost. More and more \nhealth information is available through the Internet through sites such \nas WebMD and health.gov. It shows up on the ticker on all the 24-hour \nnews channels, and each new discovery drives up the demand for care. If \nCNN runs a story on a medical breakthrough at 9:30 in the morning, it \nseems that an hour or so later we will be getting calls at our offices \nasking if Medicare or Medicaid or various insurance plans will pick up \nthat coverage.\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\n  We have an extraordinary appetite for health care, for new \ntreatments, but sometimes when we order these, we are not sure we are \ngetting what is medically effective. We are not sure we are getting \nservices that are worth the money. And most importantly, there is no \nway to measure it.\n\n  This is all compounded by the baby boomer explosion. Already, elderly \npeople make up 15 percent of the population and spend 40 percent of our \nhealth care dollars. Folks are not just getting older, they are living \nlonger. Those additional lives and the care that is necessary is going \nto require more funding. Life expectancy has risen more in the last 50 \nyears than it did in the preceding 5,000. In the last months of their \nlonger lives, Americans are spending more money than ever on health \ncare. But money does not always give the best results for a suffering \nindividual.\n  As a direct result of health spending increases in 2001, the Health \nAffair Study that I noted said health insurance costs have risen \nsharply, but at the same time coverage is getting harder and harder for \nmany to get. The costs have gone up two ways. The first is with simple \npremium increases. Insurance companies are asking purchasers to pay \nmore for the policies. The second way is through something called \nbuydown. Employers who subsidize insurance reduce available benefits \nand ask employees to pay a higher share of the subsidized premium. \nEmployees often get lower wages, even as they pay more for health \ninsurance, with no guarantee their insurance will meet their needs. \nWhen you combine that significant hike in premiums--12 percent has been \none assessment by the Kaiser Foundation--with a 3-percent increase in \nthe number of cases of the buydown, the total cost of insurance has \nrisen about 15 percent this year.\n  Nationally, businesses are still paying three-quarters or more of \nemployees' premium costs, but it is harder and harder for companies and \nindividuals to absorb those cost increases year after year. Fully 60 \npercent of those who have no insurance work for small businesses. For \nthe self-employed or for those who have to buy their own insurance, \npremium increases at this point have priced many plans out of reach.\n  If someone is listening today and saying, ``The health care system \nworks fine for me,'' let's also reflect on the fact that while it may \nwork for you, it is not working for tens of millions of others. The \nfact is, every single day in America those who have no coverage, those \nwho are going without, in effect, get subsidized by those who do have \ncoverage.\n  If an individual listens today and says, ``I am in pretty good shape; \nthings are going well for me,'' I only point out for the millions who \ndo not have coverage right now, those people are subsidized by those \nwho think everything is fine.\n  The fact is, it is just not right to leave millions of Americans in \nthis country with a feeling of helplessness and a sense that when they \ngo to bed at night they can see that train, that runaway train of \nhealth care costs I have mentioned bearing down on them.\n  The legislation Senator Hatch and I have proposed gives Americans the \npower to put the brakes on rising costs. It offers regular citizens the \nopportunity to make tough choices about spiraling medical bills. We \nwill be addressing, if our bill can pass, the tough questions of health \ncare directly related to our families: The question of what kind of \ncare do people believe is most essential; how much are people willing \nto pay; how do you contain the costs without sacrificing quality of \ncare; what about the government or private business being required to \npay part of the cost.\n  My bottom line is pretty simple. It is time, finally, after 57 years \nof trying the same thing--writing bills in Washington, DC, only to have \nthem attacked by special interests--it is time to try something \ndifferent, and that is to give the people of this country a chance to \nmake the judgment on calls with respect to what kind of health services \nthey want, how much those services are going to cost, and who is going \nto pay. The alternative is to continue to spend more and more on a \nsystem that, while scientifically prodigious, is flawed in many of the \nadministrative ways in which it is carried out.\n\n  At a time when America is becoming a nation of health care haves and \nhave-nots, this country can do better. We have many of our providers \nand businesses already making tough choices as they try to deal with \ngrowing costs. I know scores of small businesses in Oregon and across \nthis country who are dying to offer their people good coverage, and \nthey have had difficulty offering it without effective policies to \ncontain those rising costs.\n  Senator Hatch and I believe with a different approach it will be \npossible to reign in the costs, but it all has to begin--and begin in a \nfashion that has not been tried for 57 years--with the American people \nbeing given the opportunity to make some of the tough calls. The fact \nis, the options in the cost containment area do involve hard calls. The \nKaiser Commission, for example, on the uninsured, on Medicaid, recently \nlaid out a number of cost containment measures currently employed by \nour public health programs. They range from some that I think are \nprogressive to some that I think would make the problems that we have \ntoday in health care even more serious.\n  According to Kaiser, the main way public health programs are cutting \ncosts is by cutting payments to providers. Private insurers then follow \nsuit, paying less to providers for each patient seen and for each \nprocedure performed or for each bed the hospital provides. Then, in \neffect, the Robin Hood approach kicks in in a dramatic way with those \nwho do get payments, in effect, giving services to those who lack it. \nBut when the cutbacks get severe, when the reimbursements continue to \ngo down as we have seen in so many facilities, those providers, those \nhealth care facilities that have a great sense of community and caring, \njust cannot offer the services anymore. Instead of or even in addition \nto cutting provider payments, some insurers and public health programs \nare cutting back on what services they will cover, reducing the \navailability of some services. Unfortunately, services are often cut \nwith no regard to their overall effectiveness--only for their cost.\n\n  Many types of health care programs are asking patients to pay more at \nthe time of service--higher copayments. Higher copayments are also \nbecoming a regular feature at the pharmacy, as prescription drugs are \none of the biggest reasons behind rising costs. Options include those \nhigher copays, requiring more prior authorization for prescriptions, \nrequiring or covering only generics, or even limiting the number of \ncovered prescriptions per month.\n  I want to pause to note a couple of issues here--first, that \nprescription drugs are on the table in the Wyden-Hatch legislation, \njust as long-term care and Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance \nare. Senator Hatch and I are placing no limits on what the American \npeople can discuss and decide to change. And second, efforts to cut \nrising drug costs are perfect example of the range of choices that \nfolks will face in this national discussion. Some of the choices for \ncutting costs seem good and fair. Some seem punitive and unfair. \nSenator Hatch and I just believe that Americans have enough sense to \ntell the difference.\n  People participating in the health care discussion prescribed in our \nbill will take a look at some of the toughest cost-cutters being \nemployed today. In the case of private insurance, companies refuse to \ncover pre-existing conditions. They deny policies to people whose care \nis likely to be expensive. In the case of public insurance, States make \nlast-ditch efforts to cut costs by limiting the number of people to \nwhom coverage is available.\n  All across America today, mothers will tell their children that you \ndon't always get everything you want in this life. That's the stark \nreality people are going to have to face when it comes to reforming the \nhealth care system. The key will be to find solutions that do the best \njob of splitting the difference, cutting costs and providing essential, \neffective health care services.\n  Cost containment is not enough. Our health care dollars must buy \nquality care, that not only treats disease but also prevents it \nwhenever possible. That's the best cost containment. Failing that, care \nthat manages diseases to slow or prevent their progression may be the \nnext best thing. Disease management is a growing component of health \ncare today. Instead of allowing\n\n[[Page S11383]]\n\nmonths to go by between doctor visits, patients with chronic illnesses \nmeet or speak regularly with nurses or other health care providers to \nmonitor their specific condition. Doctors have concerns about their \npatients being treated or advised by others, and all the kinks aren't \nworked out of this system yet. But the result, in many cases, is a \nreduction in the number of expensive complications and hospital stays.\n  I want to see Americans educated about disease management, preventive \ncare, and every other option available for reforming health care. \nThat's why the Wyden-Hatch Act calls for the publication of a Citizens' \nGuide to the Health Care System. A panel that's a cross-section of \nAmericans using and running the health care system today will produce \nit. It will be designed so folks can be fully informed when the public \nparticipation portion of the process begins.\n  To me, some of these cost containment methods seem fairer than \nothers; some seem more sensible than others. The American people should \nhave the change to decide--because what's being done now isn't working. \nBenefits are usually considered in terms of cost-benefit, which \nbasically measures how much money you save for every dollar you spend. \nAnother way of looking at procedures and practices is their cost-\neffectiveness, which is how much good you do with every dollar.\n  Let me explain why I believe it is folly to continue to address \nquestions of health care and health coverage as purely economic \nconsiderations. The problem is, and families know this, it doesn't all \nboil down to money. You're not just dealing with a bottom line. You're \ntalking about maintaining people's health and about the basic care they \nhave a right to expect. Sometimes you're literally talking about life \nand death. It's time America started recognizing its ethical and moral \nresponsibilities with respect to health care, and acting on them.\n  This is not the seismic shift it sounds to be. Just as individual \ninsurers and state health administrators are making choices about how \nto contain costs, American citizens are making moral choices around \ntheir kitchen tables every day. People already have to answer questions \nlike, it okay to put off the colorectal screening my insurance won't \ncover because I really need to pay for my mother's prescription \nmedicines? If we pay for Jennifer's broken arm, does Bobby have to wait \na year to get braces?\n  Doctors and hospitals are already making ethical choices about what \ncare to get and give, or how much cost the hospital is willing to \nabsorb before cutting services. The question that must be answered is \nstill the same: do Americans want these choices made as they are now, \nin a back-door way? Or do they want a chance to discuss these issues at \nthe front door, decide on them as a community, and then ask Congress to \ndeliver a health care system based on the country's values?\n  A better way to make decisions is to look at what we are and are not \nable to do on a societal level, instead of deciding what we are and are \nnot able to do for a give patient at a given time. If that sounds \ntough, it is. But Mr. President, I'm here to urge that America tackle \nthese issues head on and turn them to the advantage of as many people \nas possible. That's far better plan then letting back-door decisions \nsuck away more funds and resources and deny people decent care.\n  It's time to look at questions on a broader scale. Is $315,000 of \npublic money better spent on one liver transplant and follow-up care \nfor a 70-year old man with cirrhosis, or on 3,00 preventive well-baby \nvisits costing about $100 each? Does a woman with known risk factors \nfor breast cancer have a right to a mammogram every year even if I have \nto help pay for it?\n\n  Because these choices are so tough, a variety of think tanks and \ngreat minds have tackled these issues, including Arthur Kaplan at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Daniel Callahan at the Hastings Center and \nothers. I admire their thoughtful work. Their conclusions and study \nhave provided valuable direction on these issues.\n  I believe that at the end of the day, only the citizens of this \ncountry can make the fundamental choices that affect their health and \ntheir well-being--and health and well-being of the society in which \nthey live.\n  Researchers shows that Americans believe that there are certain basic \nrights when it comes to health care and no one should be forced to go \nwithout. If it's been confirmed that the American people feel that way, \nthe key is to find out what the basics are and go from there. This \ncountry won't get anywhere on health care reform until we do.\n  Let me explain a little further. Most Americans operate on the idea \nthat they should have the latest tests and treatments on demand. That's \npossible--if America spends more of its dollars on health care and \nother budget items like educations take the hit. But spending more \ndoesn't necessarily buy better health care. More and more people are \nbeing let without even the essential health care services, let alone \nthe latest drugs and procedures.\n  Let me be clear. I'm not talking about keeping people from spending \ntheir own money on whatever kind of health care they want. If someone \nwants to rebuild himself limb by limb and has the money to pay for it, \nI say go for it. But when it comes to the health care system as a \nwhole, we can't just spend money for the sake of spending money. Health \ncare dollars must be used in better ways, or the people of this country \nmust decide that it's okay to keep spending and keep leaving people \nout.\n  I don't believe that's the way America wants it to work. As Marcia \nAngell wrote in the New York Times, there are some essential services \nin which we all agree the public has stake, and health care should be \none of them. For example, no one I know thinks of our country as a \nplace where it's okay for babies to go untreated because Mom and Dad \nare in financial straits.\n  Postponing care sometimes places more strain on the health care \nsystem. If a baby doesn't get treated at the beginning of an ear \ninfection, he may have to be treated as it goes further along, probably \nin the emergency room at a much higher cost than if he'd had a \npediatrician to see in the first place. If he's not treated, and ends \nup with hearing damage, the costs will skyrocket not only in the health \ncare system, but also in the educational system to meet his special \nneeds.\n  More than a decade ago, the people in my home State of Oregon \nrealized the interconnectedness of everyone in the health care system. \nFolks realized that no amount of money would ever be enough to pay for \nall the health care Oregonians wanted, and that too many people were \ndoing without health care at all. So the people of my state took on the \ntough task of sitting down and deciding what the basics were, what \nhealth care no one should have to do without.\n\n  That may sound like an easy task; if you could just sit and make a \nlist of all the things you'd like health care coverage to pay for, you \nwould be able to do that without much trouble. But there's a flip side. \nThe question Oregonians faced over and over again was, okay: if we want \nthis fundamental service covered, what do we have to give up? What \ncan't we afford to cover for anyone, if we want everyone to have at \nleast some help? Those questions sometimes translated into \nheartbreaking real-life situations, where people using public health \ncare couldn't get the latest and greatest innovations on demand. But \nlives were saved because people using public health care were able to \nget the basic when they needed them. That tradeoff, for the most part, \nmade the tough choices worthwhile.\n  Now, Senator Hatch and I are not asking America to come up with a \nlist of 880 health procedures in order of importance. But we are \nlooking for a general idea of people's priorities--so that Congress can \nact on them when it's time for health care reform.\n  I believe there are some priorities our people already agree on. I \nthink they agree that 18,000 Americans shouldn't have to die every year \njust because they can't get health insurance and health care. I believe \n280 million people will agree they'd rather cover the cost of \npreventive services than get stuck with the much higher costs of \npreventable diseases that go unchecked. I think with some serious \ndiscussion, they can agree on some basic concepts of how and where our \nlimited health care dollars should be spent to help the most people. I \nbelieve 280 million people can agree on a lot more than you think.\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\n  Some might say Americans aren't going to want to talk about this, \nthat the idea of not paying for someone's liver transplant to take care \nof babies isn't fit talk for the public. But I believe Americans have a \nright to this discussion. These choices are going to get made, one way \nor the other, and I want them made in the open with the input of the \npeople I'm here to represent. The stakes are just too high not to \ninclude the American people. And I believe they're up to the task.\n  To help Americans understand what's at stake, and make informed \ndecisions, the dissemination of information will be key. I believe the \nCitizens' Health Guide will be a real eye-opener for most people--for \ninstance, when they find out this: Medicare Part A will pay for \nprescription drugs when a patient is in the hospital. Part B will pay \nnothing for those same drugs on an outpatient basis. Some doctors are \nsticking patients in the hospital to the tune of thousands of dollars \njust to get their medicine to them. That money can't be spent, then, on \npreventive services or any other more beneficial health care concerns. \nDon't you think when people see the connection, they will insist on \nmaking a change?\n  Health care works like an ecosystem in this country. The consequence \nof every decision, and every reform effort, snakes through the system \nas a whole. Addressing health care properly, that, means addressing it \nas a system entire. Ad hoc is not going to work.\n  Just as a good doctor wouldn't prescribe a medicine that would treat \none symptom but leave the disease to run rampant, it's time to stop \nwith the piecemeal reforms that put a Band-Aid on the sucking chest \nwound of the health care system. To be most effective, you can't just \nmake decisions on broken bones one day, organ transplants the next and \nsomething else the next day like they don't have any effect on each \nother. This country needs a way to consider the moral and ethical \nchoices already being made that affect not just one person or one \nfamily, but the entire health care system. As hard as it's going to be, \nit must be done. The Wyden-Hatch bill provides a path to do that.\n  Yes, there are economic choices to be made about health care in this \ncountry. The runaway train of rising costs must be stopped somehow. And \nthere are moral questions underlying every economic decision. The \nWyden-Hatch proposal is built around the idea that these questions are \nsimply too important to duck any longer. People deserve the chance to \ndiscuss their own moral and ethical priorities when it comes to health \ncare, and to decide what's best for them and for our society as a \nwhole. Only then can Congress deliver health care reform that truly \nworks for all.\n  That's why our bill, the Health Care that Works for All Americans \nAct, centers on that public participation portion, and then guarantees \nthe people a vote in both houses of Congress.\n  Perhaps the people of this country will choose one or more cost-\ncontainment measures being used today. Perhaps in examining their own \nethics, they'll come up with new ideas. What Senator Hatch and I want \nto guarantee is that their voices will be heard--and that this Congress \nwill act, with a mandatory vote in both houses--to make the people's \nvision for health care come to pass. I believe that if Congress chooses \nto put the people in charge, Americans will choose to fight rising \ncosts, make tough moral choices, and direct this country toward better \nhealth care for everyone.\n  That is the point at which we have reached. That is why it is not \nright to leave so many underserved in so many communities without \nadequate health care.\n  I urge, finally, that as we leave and reflect on what is needed to \nreform the health care system in the next session, that the three \nprinciples in the Wyden-Hatch legislation of involving the money, \nforcing a vote in the Congress on the reforms that come from the \npeople, and making it bipartisan guide our work in the next session.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time, \npostcloture, be considered expired except for the following: 60 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Byrd, 70 minutes under the control of \nSenator Lieberman, 70 minutes under the control of Senator Thompson or \ntheir designees; that 20 minutes of Senator Thompson's time be under \nthe control of Senator Specter; that 15 minutes of the time of Senator \nLieberman be under the control of Senator Dodd; 15 minutes be under the \ncontrol of Senator Sarbanes; 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nCarper; and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Clinton; leaving \nSenator Lieberman, I believe, 20 minutes.\n  Again, it will be 70 minutes under the control of Senator Lieberman; \nSenator Dodd would have 15 minutes, Senator Sarbanes 15 minutes, \nSenator Carper 10 minutes, Senator Clinton 10 minutes, leaving Senator \nLieberman 15 minutes, with Senator Daschle having the final 5 minutes \nto close the debate.\n  That upon the use or yielding back of all time, the bill be read the \nthird time, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; \nprovided further that the 10 minutes prior to the vote be controlled by \nthe two leaders, with the majority leader controlling the final 5 \nminutes, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could further ask the Chair to consider \nthis unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that upon the adoption of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 3210, the terrorism risk insurance bill, the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 762, H.J. Res. \n124, the continuing resolution; that no amendments or motion be in \norder to the joint resolution; that there be up to 3 hours for debate, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled between the chairman, \nSenator Byrd, and the ranking member, Senator Stevens, of the \nAppropriations Committee, or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, with no intervening action or debate, the joint \nresolution be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the \njoint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I would ask is I hope, \nbecause I did move quite hurriedly here, that the time, the 70 minutes \nthat Senator Lieberman has adds up to 70 minutes. I am quite sure that \nit does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time I have just enunciated not start running until 4 \no'clock so people have time to get over here. But at 4 o'clock, I ask \nthat the time I have outlined here would begin to run and that anyone \nwho has the floor at 4 o'clock, they would have to yield to one of \nthese individuals who control the time at that hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator might speak for up to 8 minutes.\n\n\n                Honoring the Generosity of Andre Agassi\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, when I was first considering a run for \noffice almost 10 years ago, I found a quote from Chaplain Lloyd John \nOgilvie to be especially inspirational in helping me make my decision. \nChaplain Ogilvie once said:\n\n       You may only make a small difference, but that does not \n     relieve you of the responsibility to make that difference.\n\n  I want to tell you today about a constituent of mine who continues to \nraise the standard for how much difference one person can make.\n  The world knows this man as a top-ranked tennis star whose \npersonality and success of the court have made him an American \nfavorite. In Las Vegas, however, he's admired for his generosity and \ndedication to making a difference in the lives of our children.\n  Andre Agassi was born and raised in Las Vegas. Although he started \nplaying tennis as a toddler, he won his first professional title in \n1987. He has won at each of the four major professional tennis \ntournaments, and he holds a gold medal from the 1996 Olympics. As much \nas Las Vegans love to watch their ``son'' winning on the court, our \nhearts hold a special place for his devotion to underprivileged, \nabused, and at-risk children in Las Vegas.\n  You see, a top-ranked tennis player who has won as many tournaments \nas\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\nAndre has accumulates a good amount of wealth. Throw in a few lucrative \nendorsement deals, and you have someone who could live extremely \ncomfortably for the rest of his life. He could become his own island \nwith very few cares in the world. Unfortunately, many successful people \ndo just that.\n  Andre Agassi, on the other hand, created the Andre Agassi Charitable \nFoundation. Its Board of Directors is impressive and is led by another \nson of Las Vegas, Andre's best friend and president of Agassi \nEnterprises, Perry Rogers. I can't think of many other organizations \nthat have made the impact that this one has. Its goal is simple:\n\n       To assist those underprivileged, abused and abandoned \n     children who may be deprived of basic options in life. The \n     foundation funds a combination of emotional, physical and \n     academic programs designed to enhance a child's character, \n     self-esteem and career possibilities.\n\n  Among the programs funded by the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation \nare the Agassi Center for Education and the Andre Agassi Cottage for \nMedically Fragile Children at Clark County's public shelter for abused \nand neglected children. The Agassi Boys and Girls Club, which sees over \n2,000 members during the year and features a tennis team and a \nbasketball program, provides a safe after-school facility and a \nwonderful learning environment.\n  The Foundation, through the Assistance League of Las Vegas, provides \nthe means for new clothes for well over 2,000 destitute and homeless \nchildren; helps to send 20 physically challenged or disadvantaged \nchildren to camp for a week each summer; and introduces fourth and \nfifth graders to symphonic music.\n  There are many more programs funded by the Andre Agassi Charitable \nFoundation, but I want to tell you about the Andre Agassi College \nPreparatory Academy, known in Las Vegas as Agassi Prep, and located in \nthe heart of an at-risk community.\n  Agassi Prep is a charter school that focuses on technology, college \npreparation, cultural activities, and expanded involvement in community \naffairs. It also seeks to enhance character, respect, motivation, and \nself-discipline.\n  While HUD and the State of Nevada contributed significantly to the \nschool, the core funding came from Andre Agassi's Foundation. The \nschool's principal, Wayne Tanaka, is a distinguished educator who, in \nline with the goals of the Foundation, will truly impact the students \nwho are fortunate enough to benefit from Andre Agassi's generosity and \ndedication.\n  I also want to share with you the reach of Andre Agassi's deep-seated \nconcern for Las Vegas' at-risk children.\n  Since 1995, the Foundation has held the Grand Slam for Children \nconcert benefits. The yearly event continues to draw some of the \nbiggest names in entertainment, hundreds of volunteers, and crowds of \nalmost 10,000. As someone who looks forward to this event every year, I \ncan assure you--there is no better show on earth. This year's benefit \nfeatured Elton John, Martina McBride, Carlos Santana, Robin Williams, \nBabyface, and Rod Stewart. And that's just the entertainment.\n  A live and silent auction before the show included sports items from \nShaquille O'Neal, Wayne Gretzky, Greg Maddux, Muhammed Ali, and tennis \nlessons from Agassi and his wife, Stefanie Graf. I share these names \nwith you because they are a testament to the respect that Andre Agassi \nand his Foundation have earned from so many different people.\n  When I tell you that Andre Agassi continues to raise the standard for \nhow much difference one person can make, I mean it literally. Since its \ninception in 1995, the Foundation has raised $23.6 million to help at-\nrisk children. That includes $5.6 million from this year's Grand Slam \nfor Children--$1.4 million more than last year.\n  That's $23.6 million over 7 years, with every penny going to assist \nchildren. All administrative and overhead costs are funded through \ncontributions made by Andre Agassi or Agassi Enterprises, Inc. When you \nstep back and think about the enormous impact that this man has had in \nLas Vegas, it is incredible.\n  I share the story of Andre Agassi's impact on Las Vegas with the hope \nthat it will challenge and inspire other successful people to make \ntheir own difference in this world. We all have a responsibility to \nleave this world a better place, even if--as Chaplain Ogilvie stated--\nwe make only a ``small difference.''\n  Words are not enough to thank Andre for the way he has changed the \nlives of so many children. But Andre, your acts of loving kindness will \ntouch not just the children you help today. They will make a difference \nfor generations to come. Thank you for making a difference in our \ncommunity and for setting an example for us all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Might I inquire of the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes remaining on general \ndebate.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the time I use be a part of \nthe Thompson amendment of the homeland security bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today after talking with staff and \ngoing through what we are going to do with homeland security. This \nlegislation provides the framework of the largest reorganization of \nGovernment in many, many years; in fact, going all the way back to the \nDepression days in the 1930s. But it is done because we are facing one \nof the greatest security challenges that this country has faced in its \n26-year history from an enemy that identifies with no specific nation, \nan enemy that has shown us that fear is really something that erodes \nour freedoms--and we learn how fragile they are and how fragile our \neconomy is.\n  Is it a perfect piece of legislation to leave the Congress and go \ndowntown to be signed by the President? It is legislation that he has \nwanted and it has taken us too long to pass.\n  There are parts of this piece of legislation that concern most of us. \nWe have been around here long enough to know that once we pass a piece \nof legislation--no matter what the subject might be--we find that the \nadministrative rule writers interpret it differently than we do. \nSometimes the net result is not exactly how we envisioned it, and maybe \nnot even how the President envisioned it.\n  There are sections in here which I am very concerned about. I think \nas legislators in this body we must pay attention to how the \nadministrative rules are written and how some of the Departments are \nmoved into one called Homeland Security.\n\n\n                           Drought Assistance\n\n  I was interested a while ago in the statement on the floor about \ndrought assistance to our farmers. No State has been hit harder than my \nState of Montana. No one can argue that there is a need. In fact, we \nhave worked for over a year and a half with our colleagues here in the \nSenate, in the House of Representatives, and with the administration to \nget relief to our farmers and ranchers. We have been unsuccessful to \ndate for a variety of reasons.\n  There is drought assistance already in the appropriations process \nthat this Senate this year did not get passed--some $500 billion in \nrounded figures. But it wasn't allowed to move because of the debate on \nforest health.\n  Maybe this is the wrong place to talk about forest health. \nNonetheless, I could see no logic at all in every night turning on the \ntelevision, looking at the news, and watching America's forests go up \nin flames, and then denying the money and the change in policy--a \nchange in policy that would have allowed us to prevent or at least take \naway some of the possibilities for such catastrophic fires as we have \nexperienced in the last 2 years.\n  We were denied that--commonsense things, the relatively minor \ncommonsense things that we have to do to our forests in order to make \nthem healthy and productive and beautiful, as America envisions its \nnational forests.\n  I am reluctant to raise false hopes for our farmers right now and say \nthis is going to be done in the closing hours of the 107th Congress--\nunless it is done in January, or whenever we take up the appropriations \nbills. We have 11 more of them to pass. I imagine we will again try to \ndevelop some drought assistance for those States that have been hit \nhard this year by drought, and to help my farmers who are in the fifth \nyear of drought in that part of the country.\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\n  We see a little bit of posturing going on here on the floor today. I \ndo not like it. That wasn't the reason I was going to stand up here and \ntalk in the first place. Nonetheless, I had to discuss this topic.\n  I notice that my friend from Kansas has come to the floor, and he has \na problem, too, in Kansas. I think his State was probably the hardest \nhit this year of any State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, would the distinguished Senator from \nMontana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURNS. I will.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator really alerted me to this. And I apologize \nfor not watching on our closed-circuit television. Apparently some of \nour distinguished colleagues across the aisle are thinking about \nresurrecting the $6 billion emergency disaster relief package and \nputting it on the continuing resolution. Is that the case?\n  Mr. BURNS. That was the case, plus I think there have been a couple \nof suggestions made by our colleagues across the aisle. That is part of \nit. With the House being gone and not coming back, it would seem that \nthis would be an exercise that could not be successful.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to ask if the Senator \nwould yield for another question.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. How on Earth do you take a $6 billion disaster relief \nbill, which I happened to vote for, that was part of the Interior \nappropriations bill, as I recall--and, as I recall, the majority \nleadership filled the legislative tree and basically prevented this \nSenator from introducing an alternative to the $6 billion package that \nthis Senator thought might stand a chance of approval from the \nadministration, might stand a chance in regard to the hurdle that any \ndisaster bill faces to get through the House Agriculture Committee.\n  I am going to be very candid. There were certain farm groups and \ncertain commodity organizations that did not want to consider any \ndisaster legislation for fear of opening up the farm bill and having \nsomething happen to their payment limits. So you had the leadership of \nthe House Agriculture Committee saying no. You had the administration \nsaying no in regard to further expenditures over and above the $180 \nbillion we spent on a 10-year farm bill. You had the emergency \nassistance bill--not on Agriculture appropriations but on Interior \nappropriations.\n  Then, all of a sudden, we couldn't get any action on the Interior \nappropriations bill because there was a controversy in regard to forest \nmanagement. Is that not the case?\n  I know the Senator worked very hard, because of the State he \nrepresents, in regard to forest management as part of that Interior \nappropriations bill. But the disaster relief money was attached to the \nInterior appropriations bill, and then we couldn't move it. We couldn't \nget any action on this floor.\n  Is that about correct?\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, the Senator is correct. I am ranking \nmember on that Interior Appropriations Committee. There was money to \nreplenish the U.S. Forest Service for the moneys they had expended on \nfirefighting. That was also in there and needed, and would have passed. \nBut we got into a situation on forest health, and the other side would \nnot budge on some very commonsense recommendations to the Forest \nService on how we go about cleaning up our forests. I am sorry it \nhappened that way.\n  I would say to my Agriculture leaders, to my farmers, and to the \nfarmers in Kansas who, by the way, are not really interested in inside \nbaseball here in Washington, DC--a 17-square-mile logic-free \nenvironment--they are interested in not only what the farm legislation \nthat we passed late last spring would do for them but also how we deal \nwith disasters. None of those issues were covered.\n  But the Senator from Kansas is right on. We have all voted for \ndisaster assistance until we have just run our little fingers to the \nbone only to find it blocked by other legislation or parliamentary \nprocedures.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator to \nyield for several additional questions. I am a little confused about \nthis.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have a bone to pick. I want to see if the Senator from \nMontana shares the same bone.\n  Let us go back to the original problem of why in the Great Plains and \nthe great States of Montana, Wyoming--and move over into South Dakota, \nNebraska, Kansas, which, yes, this year was the hardest hit State. Many \nother States incurred bad weather and disaster conditions. But why did \nthis happen? The Good Lord was not willing. The Good Lord sometimes \ndoesn't have the creeks rise too much, or there is too much water in \nterms of the creeks. From time to time we have disaster bills. They \ntend to come during even-numbered years, by the way.\n  We have made a lot of progress in crop insurance. There has been crop \ninsurance reform. But when you have a total disaster, and you lose your \ngrain crop throughout the grain-producing areas, you would think you \nwould have a disaster bill.\n\n  Now, let me back up. I know one Senator from Kansas--this Senator \nfrom Kansas--who said, as we go through the consideration of the new \nfarm bill, $180 billion--make that $200 billion really over 10 years \nbecause the budget was 10 years long--that you would at least think \nthere would be some provision in there for a farmer who had no crops, \nno crops to harvest. The Senator knows that. You have gone through that \nup in Montana, how many years--1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years maybe?\n  Now, what did the new farm bill, I would ask the Senator, have? We \nhad four different components, four different payments, four different \nways to invest in agriculture.\n  We changed the old farm bill, which was a direct income supplement, \nto a price support farm bill, and there were four ways your farmers \ncould be helped. No. 1, we increased the loan a tad. We decided the \nloan rate would become an income protection device but--guess what--the \nprices over the loan rate do not do you any good.\n  Then you had something called a loan deficiency payment. That means \nif the price were below the loan rate, you would get that amount. \nWell--guess what--the price is above the loan rate, so you don't get \nthe loan deficiency payment.\n  Then you also had a target price deficiency payment. It is a little \nconfusing, all this gobbledygook, with all the agricultural acronyms \nand everything to do with farm bills.\n  But--guess what--the price was above the target price, so he did not \nget or the farmer did not get or she did not get or that person did not \nget any help from the target price deficiency payment. So we are zero \nfor three.\n  Then we had a direct payment.\n  Now, in the wisdom of the farm bill conference, of which this member \ndid not serve--I am not going to get into that, as to how that ratio \ncame down, and who was prevented from being on the conference, and who \nwas not; I could, but I will not--but in the wisdom of the conference, \nthey said: We are going to keep a direct payment just to make sure that \nif these other things don't work, and the farmer still wouldn't have a \ncrop, the price is increased. We are going to have a direct payment. \nThat was 6 cents a bushel in regard to wheat. And the corresponding \nnumbers were true in regard to corn and other crops--6 cents.\n  Why do I mention that? Because all the way through this, both you and \nI said--Senator Cochran said, most of us on this side said--don't go \ndown this road with this new farm bill and apply it to the 2002 crop \nyear because any farm bill is too complex to really figure out, with \nall the fishhooks and all the saddle burrs, to try to get it in place \nfor 2002.\n  What we would have had under the old farm bill--much maligned by the \nother side, constantly, day after day after day, for 4 or 5 years--the \nFreedom to Farm Act was a direct payment called an AMTA payment. Then \nwe were going to double that because of the problems we were having. \nThat was 60 cents a bushel. Now, there is a big difference between 6 \ncents and 60 cents.\n  I have given this speech to my farmers. Why do I give it to my \nfarmers? Because they are desperate. We had the worst drought since the \n1930s. It may have been hotter in some years, and it may have been \ndryer in some years, but it has never been hotter and dryer in the same \nyear. So they lost all their\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\ncrops. Now, we were able to get some livestock assistance, but disaster \nassistance, as compared to the old farm bill, which would have provided \nthem 60 cents a bushel, it did not happen.\n\n  So all the critics on our side of the aisle, and some on the other \nside, who say, well, we have a new farm bill, we are going to give the \nfarmer four mailboxes to open--the loan rate; nope, nothing there. The \nloan deficiency payment; nope, nothing there. Are we going to have the \ntarget price deficiency payment? No, nothing there. We are going to \nhave a direct payment--6 cents, as compared to the 60 cents we would \nhave had if we applied the new farm bill to 2003.\n  Now, that is my bone to pick because my farmers are hurting. And now \nafter having a $6 billion emergency disaster bill that I voted for, in \nregards to the Interior Appropriations Committee, we have those with \nthe temerity and chutzpah who will come to the continuing resolution \nand say, we are going to do it now, unless we shut down Government?\n  You know the administration is not going to support that. You know \nthe House has already left town. You know the House Agriculture \nCommittee, representing certain interests in agriculture, does not want \nto mess with the payment limitations. This is a horse going nowhere--\nnowhere.\n  The handling of this has been highly political. The election is over. \nThere are some who wanted an issue and not a bill. They got the issue. \nAnd I guess the result in South Dakota proved that. OK, it is over. But \nwhy you bring up this particular effort for disaster assistance during \nthis particular time is beyond me. It is not going anywhere. People \ncrawl out of train wrecks faster than this bill will ever get passed \nand signed and provide real relief. And the farmers are not interested \nin this.\n  The Senator pointed out a long time ago, our farmers are not \ninterested in politics or agriculture gobbledygook or legislative \nparliamentary gobbledygook as well.\n  I urge my colleagues who are thinking about this, don't do this. Now, \nwhen can we do this? We can do it in the omnibus bill.\n  We had some indication from the administration they will be a little \nbit more forward thinking. I don't want to leave them out of my tirade \nhere. I am not happy with this administration. I tried to explain that \nwheat country was in a dire situation, that the farm bill didn't work. \nAnd it was sort of: Oh, well, you know. And we are saving money we are \nnot spending on the farm bill, so I think we could score it. But there \nis no way they are going to do that.\n  So I just don't see why we are going through this exercise. And it \nhas obviously got me mighty exercised because my farmers are hurting. \nLand values are starting to decline. Their lenders have already told \nthem they hit their cap.\n  We have farmers who are mortgaging their place and their equipment in \norder to stay in business, and we sit here and introduce an emergency \ndisaster relief bill to the tune of $6 billion that is not going \nanywhere. That is not right, especially in a lame duck session.\n  So I would ask the Senator, finally, a question. You are going to \nwork with me, I know. I just talked to the majority leader about this, \nand I will talk to the minority leader about this. He is a good man. He \nhas been on the Agriculture Committee on the House side. He has been \nthe driving force in regards to the Agriculture Committee and the farm \nprogram policy in this session.\n  Let's get it done in the omnibus bill when we have a chance to get it \ndone. If we need offsets, we will find offsets. Otherwise, we are \nputting at great risk a lot of farmers in this part of the country on \nthe Great Plains. Quite frankly, other people, other farmers, other \nfarm groups, other commodity groups apparently don't care--apparently \ndon't care. Well, by golly, I care. I know the Senator from Montana \ncares. So let's don't go down this road.\n  What is going to happen is, you are going to have to vote against a \n$6 billion bill in a lame duck session of Congress, when the election \nis over, with no hope of actually getting the thing done. Farmers are \ndamned tired of that, and so am I.\n  So my question is, to the distinguished Senator from Montana, let's \nwork together with the plan we have already put together during the \nomnibus bill.\n  I just talked to the chairman-to-be of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and he said, yes, he will work with us. The \nadministration said they will work with us. And we can get some real \nhelp to farmers at the appropriate time.\n  So would the Senator work with me in that regard? That is the \nquestion.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I would be glad to work with him. But I \nam sure glad we didn't get him stirred up where he is really excited \nabout this issue. No one gets exercised more than the good Senator from \nKansas.\n  That is the common-sense way to approach it. There is no question \nabout it. I would like to see it happen that way.\n  I just wish that we could do something on forest health. I think \nthere is a chance of doing that this time.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Madam President, before I relinquish the floor, though, I just want \nto express my concerns again about homeland security, and in some \nareas.\n  As you know, we have spent the last 3 years trying to pass a privacy \nbill. We have worked with Senator Hollings, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, and also working with the Judiciary Committee. I \nwould hope we can now do a privacy bill coming up in the next Congress.\n  I notice the Senator from New York is on the floor, and I am looking \nforward to working with her on the E-911 caucus because we know we have \na lot of work to do on spectrum and spectrum management and how we \napply our emergency first responders in the days to come because of \nthis challenge we have before us. So I will be watching very closely as \nthe administration rules are written on this piece of legislation. \nThere it is right there. I can't even pack it back to the office. I \nprobably couldn't understand most of what I read in there, if I did. \nBut, nonetheless, those are the issues I think are very important.\n  Americans value their freedom. They value the privileges of living in \nthis country, but they also value something else; that is, their \npersonal privacy. A database or anything else that could be done in \nthis is a great mistake. Whenever we start doing R on technologies \nthat would allow us to invade the privacy of an individual citizen, \nwhether it be in wireless communications or in the Internet or the \nfirewalls we might burn, and before that technology is transferred into \nthe agency that is in charge of gathering intelligence, there should be \na firewall in there.\n  I hope whenever they write the administrative rules they will be \nsensitive to that and will allow congressional oversight before that \ntechnology is transferred. It is very sensitive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Montana about the importance of the \nimplementation of the Homeland Security Department, particularly as it \naffects the privacy issues that will be raised going forward. Further, \nI would like to add a few other cautionary notes to the legislative \nrecord as we are about to, in a few hours, vote on this Department.\n  My friend from Montana raises some of the important issues, and there \nare indeed others as well that we will have to be vigilant about and \nhopefully involved in going forward.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield so I could correct a terrible \nmistake I just made?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. I think I identified her as the Senator from Arkansas when \nI should have said the Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I appreciate that correction.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to correct it, if I could.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I must confess I thought he was referring to the \nSenator from Arkansas who perhaps was in the Chamber.\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\n  As I said, I appreciate the Senator's yellow, flashing lights about \nsome of the issues we are about to contend with going forward in the \nHomeland Security Department. In the months following September 11, \nwhich are really the time period that has brought us to this day, we \nknew as a Nation we had to take some additional steps, some \nunprecedented steps to protect ourselves. I believe we have attempted \nto do so certainly with respect to our men and women in military \nuniform.\n  I am very proud of the support we have given to our armed forces. I \nam proud to represent the 10th Mountain Division in upstate New York. \nWhen I go there, when I speak with the young officers and enlisted men \nwho come to see me or when I go to Fort Drum to see them, I feel \nconfident I can look them in the eye and tell them we are doing all we \nknow to do to make sure they are ready, well equipped, and compensated \nappropriately. They are trained to the best of their abilities, and we \nare doing all as a Nation we can to support them.\n\n  I do not have that same level of confidence when I go to my \nfirehouses, my police stations, my emergency rooms throughout New York. \nI cannot look into the eyes of our firefighters, our police officers, \nour emergency responders and tell them we have done all we need to do \nto make sure they are as well prepared, well trained, and safe in their \ndefense here in the homeland.\n  So are we safer today than we were on the morning of September 11, \n2001? The answer is only marginally. Because somewhere along the way, \nwe have not kept that laser-like focus we needed to match our will and \nour resources and to get those resources to the front lines at home as \nwe have around the world.\n  The people who we are going to count on to make our homeland safer \nare the ones who will pick up the phone when we dial 911. They will \nrespond to the call. They will leave the firehouse and the police \nstation. They will leave the emergency room. They will be there in \norder to protect us.\n  The votes we cast this afternoon for the creation of a Homeland \nSecurity Department are just that. They are votes to create a \nDepartment here in Washington.\n  My hope is the approval of this bill will set into motion a necessary \nreorganization process that will ultimately result in improved \ncoordination, information sharing, and a stronger, safer America.\n  But we have to be absolutely clear to the American people about what \nit is we are voting for. This bill has to do with structural \nreorganization. There are many things in this bill we absolutely need \nto make us safer. Unfortunately, there are many things in this bill \nthat have absolutely nothing to do with our security.\n  I am concerned that Americans will believe, because we have passed \nthis bill, our Nation is safer. But when we pass it and when Americans \nread about it or see coverage about it on television, they need to know \nthis measure does not increase patrols or technology along our northern \nborders. It does not give our firefighters, police officers, and \nemergency personnel the resources, training, and equipment they \ndesperately need. It does not increase security measures at our ports, \nour railroads, our public transportation systems. It does not increase \nour capability of detecting biological, chemical, radiological, and \nnuclear weapons.\n  What this bill does is fall short on many important measures. We had \nthe opportunity to do this right, to do more than create a Department. \nThe Senate's original bill coming out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee under Senator Lieberman's leadership, on a bipartisan vote, \nwould have included critical measures that would make our country safer \ntoday. In the end, we failed to act on those critical measures.\n  There is a lot in this bill that secures the future for special \ninterests at the expense of the security of the American people. I \nbelieve those who are using this legislation as a vehicle for their own \nparticular commercial or special interest have done this country a \ngrave disservice.\n  That is why Congress cannot stop with this vote. As the distinguished \nSenator from Montana said: We have to watch this process with \nvigilance. We have to be involved in the rulemaking. We have to ask the \nhard questions about resources. We have to continue to fight to make \nsure every substantive measure we need to enhance our security gets \npassed in the next Congress.\n  Let's start with the obvious. Let's support our first responders. \nThey are the ones who are our front line soldiers at home. We need to \ndo what we have been asked to do by mayors and police and fire \ncommissioners. They have asked us for direct funding that they can best \nutilize to make sure those firehouses stay open, those hazardous \nmaterial suits and equipment are bought and available. That is why I \nstill believe we should pass legislation I introduced last November \nthat would provide direct funding to local communities--the Homeland \nSecurity Block Grant Act.\n  We also know the recent report by former Senators Hart and Rudman, \nthe terrorism panel's report, clearly states we are not doing enough to \nsupport our first responders. That report expressed grave concern that \n650,000 local and State police officers still operate without close \nU.S. intelligence information to combat terrorists.\n  We have not done enough to help local and state officials detect and \nrespond to biological attacks. The report expressed concerns that our \nfirefighters and local law enforcement agencies still--more than a year \nlater--do not have the proper equipment to respond to a chemical or \nbiological attack. And they don't even have the communications systems \nthat will let them talk to each other--police departments, fire \ndepartments--across municipal and county lines in an emergency.\n  Madam President, I was also greatly disappointed that the SAFER Act, \nwhich would have allowed our Nation to hire 25,000 more firefighters \nover the next couple years, was completely eliminated from the bill. \nThis is the time to do more for our first responders, not less.\n  We also have to act immediately to secure our Nation's nuclear power \ninfrastructure. While the homeland security bill creates a new \nDepartment, it does not adequately address the real threat of terrorist \ncapabilities and desires to destroy our nuclear powerplants. Last year, \nSenators Jeffords, Reid, and I introduced the Nuclear Security Act. We \nmoved that act through the committee. It is unfortunate the bill does \nnot address nuclear security, particularly with respect to our nuclear \npowerplants. We clearly have a problem there, as we do with \nradiological attacks from a a so-called dirty bomb.\n  Every day that goes by without us having those resources available in \nlocal communities around our country to respond is a day I cannot look \ninto the eyes of my constituents and say, yes, we are safer today than \nwe were.\n  We have all gone over the many provisions in the bill that have \nabsolutely nothing to do with security. I regret deeply that they were \nincluded in this bill, and the impact of them will be known for years \nto come.\n  Madam President, this bill, which does some good by helping us better \nfocus here in Washington, does not do nearly enough of what needs to be \ndone out in our country. I am particularly concerned that New York does \nnot have a specific coordinator as the bill provides for Washington, \nDC. We know from every intelligence report that New York City is still \na high-risk area.\n  This bill has much that perhaps can make us safer, but nothing that \nwill immediately do so; and it does not address the most serious issues \nwith respect to the resources that are needed.\n  There is an article in this day's Washington Post about how the fact \nthat we have not funded the war on terrorism here at home means that \nmoney--even if it passes in January--will not get to the people who \nneed it the most for quite some number of months.\n  This is, unfortunately, a day where we have adopted a piecemeal \napproach to homeland security without the resources and the \ncomprehensive strategy that many experts have recommended. I hope we \nwill come back in January and address the gaps in our homeland defense \nstrategy going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Idaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I yield myself time from Senator \nThompson's time.\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I came to the floor for two purposes this \nafternoon. I will briefly speak about H.R. 5005, our homeland security \nlegislation, which will become law in a reasonable time, possibly \ntoday, to suggest I am really not going to play the political game that \nhas been played with this bill for the last 2 months, and that is being \ncaught up again in the rhetoric of the hour--that somehow you don't \nneed to structurally change the way Government thinks, that you can \nspend billions of dollars ahead of time to get it done.\n  You do need to change the way Government thinks. You do need to \nchange the culture of the Federal bureaucracy. You do need to \ncoordinate. That is what we are doing because, clearly, to anyone on \nthis floor, or anyone in any of the committees that have spent the last \nseveral years analyzing what happened prior to 9/11, and following 9/\n11, it became very clear our agencies did not connect, they did not \ncoordinate, they did not communicate, and the culture of the day--and \nprobably a prevailing attitude--was somehow what happened would not \nhappen here, didn't allow us to come to attention.\n  Well, we are now at attention. We have already spent billions of \ndollars getting there--both in the fine city of New York, which was \ntragically hit, and across this country. My State of Idaho alone--a \nState of 1.2 million people--for its first responders is going to get a \ncouple million dollars more this year. That is significant money for \nbeginning the process of coordinating and training and communicating, \nright hand to left hand, local responders to State responders to \nFederal responders.\n  There is a long way to go, but to suggest that the step we are taking \ntoday is unnecessary, or for 2 months did not prevail and, therefore, \nthe bill is no good, shame on those who want to play the politics of \nthe moment, because the politics of the moment is this country has \ndecided to make a major step in the right direction.\n  I will tell you that I can pick the bill apart and say there are bits \nand pieces in there I don't like. I agree, in part, with the Senator \nfrom New York and the Senator from Montana that it will take due \ndiligence, that we should not suspect that what we pass today goes on \nautopilot. My guess is we will be back next year making refinements in \nit. I am not quite confident that it protects the privacy of the \ncitizens of our country in our pursuit for security in a fashion I \nwould want to see happen.\n  I am glad we gave the President the flexibility not to be tied up in \nthe bureaucracy of the public employees unions, but to give them an \nample opportunity to express their concern; but in the end, in a \nnational crisis, to give the chief executive of our country the \nlatitude he or she should have and must have to make this system work. \nThat is what we finally won the day over.\n  I am sorry the other side lost that fight, but the country won, and \nthe legislation we bring today is a significant and appropriate step \nforward. I will probably be here on the floor within a couple of months \noffering some amendments, and my guess is my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle will be doing the same. But to demagog our way into a new \nform of Government in the context of homeland security, shame on us.\n\n  The politics of that day is over. The reality of what we must do is \nnow at hand and this Senate is stepping forward, as it should, to get \nthe job done.\n  I said I came to the floor to talk about a couple of other issues. I \nhave been watching from my office the great politics of agricultural \ndrought disaster. What I heard on the floor was in itself a bit of a \ndisaster. For one full month, we had a bill on the floor with drought \nassistance in it. When the bill was controlled by the other side, which \nhad the majority, I innocently came to the floor and said, hey, why \ndon't we add an amendment on forest health? Why don't we get to the \nbusiness of thinning and cleaning the seven or eight million acres of \nland that is desperately in need of our caretakership and our \nstewardship that, by every estimation, is a tinderbox waiting to \nexplode, like the seven million acres that burned this year across our \npublic forest lands, that burned up 2,800 homes and cost us 25 lives.\n  But for one full month, the other side refused to vote on it. Why? \nBecause of the November 5 election. They didn't want to put their \npeople at risk, or what they thought was risk, to vote for a good piece \nof legislation that would have passed the Interior bill and would have \nput forth the drought legislation and the money that was talked about \non the floor.\n  What I witnessed over the last hour is raw politics that won't get \ndone. The Senator from Kansas came down a bit exercised a few moments \nago, and he had every right to say, shame on them, it is politics, it \nwon't happen--and it won't happen. What will happen is we are going to \ncome back to a new Congress on the 7th of January called the 108th \nCongress. We are going to swear in some new Senators and convene, and \nwe are going to have a new organizational resolution; we are going to \nhave chairmen. And already, at that moment on the 8th, 9th, 10th, and \nbeyond, we are going to move, I believe, 11 appropriation bills that \ndidn't get cared for this year, that somehow, on their watch, didn't \nhappen. In those, we are going to take care of drought and a lot of \nother things that should have been done a long time ago. Sure, we have \nanxious farmers. They have every reason to be anxious. But now to blame \nus and bog up the works and put our Government in a stall at this \nmoment, all in the name of agricultural politics, is, in itself, wrong. \nI have farmers who have suffered from drought. I want to help them, and \nwe will help them. We will help them in January. Why do we come to the \nChamber today and play the politics of the game that will not happen? I \nthink we all know. It makes for good rhetoric and probably a few \nheadlines back home. But it will not accomplish the mission at hand, \nand the mission at hand is to solve our agricultural drought problems, \nand to do so in a responsible, meaningful way that actually produces \npolicy so the farmer can go to the farm service office and say: I have \na problem and here is my loss. And that farm service officer can say: \nAnd here is the program, and here is how we can help you.\n\n  That is not going to occur probably until we legislate it in January \nand it becomes law sometime in early February. Then, I say to my \ncolleagues on the other side, pick up the phone and call your farmer \nand say: Go to the farm service office, take your records and your \nlosses, and they will calculate what you deserve based on the program \nat hand. That is how one delivers a message home. That is how one \nsolves a problem that exists.\n  What has happened in this Chamber is the last moments of the last \nhour of the last day of the 107th, is that somehow a great amount of \npolitics got played out. Some of it worked and some of it did not work, \nand we just heard some of it that will not work.\n  We are about to vote, though, on homeland security, and in the end, \nover the course of the next 3 to 4 years, it will work because it must \nwork. We must be able in a real way, in a material way, to say to our \nfriends and neighbors and civilian populations at home that the world \nis a safer place, and we made it safer by the ability to craft a \ngovernment a good deal more sensitive to the reality of our current \ncircumstances, to change the culture of the CIA, the FBI, the Border \nPatrol, and the INS in a way that creates a level of communication that \nknows what the right hand and the left hand are doing in concert. Yes, \nallows us a level of training and expertise at the very local of levels \nso when that first responder goes out on the line, they have every bit \nthe skill and the equipment necessary to determine if they and/or the \npopulation they serve are at risk because of a potential terrorist act.\n  That is our charge. We do not do it overnight. It should have been \ndone 2 months ago. The politics of the day would not have allowed that, \nbut November 5 changed that, and that is why we are here and why we \nwill pass this bill today in its whole form, and it will go to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  Then, frankly, the hard work begins. If I were the administrator \nselected to craft a homeland security agency out of the bureaucracies \nthat will fight down to their very last bureaucratic breath to hang on \nto some authority, I would say it is a monstrous task. But we will be \nhere helping that administrator along because we know it is so\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\nnecessary for our country to have an agency that can respond to a new \nthreat to this Nation and to freedom-loving people all around the \nworld.\n  I hope out of the frustration of the day and the rhetoric that has \noccurred that, in the end, we will pass legislation and get on with the \nbusiness at hand, but I thought it was incumbent upon myself to come to \nthe Chamber to talk briefly about the idea that a drought has occurred, \nnot just on farmlands across this country, but in the reality of the \npolitics right here. And that drought is, we only have so much we are \ngoing to get done, and we better return come January and finish the \nwork that should have been done months ago. This side is up to it, and \nI trust my colleagues on the other side will join us in a fair and \nbipartisan way to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I am pleased to see that the Senate is \nfinally ready to pass legislation creating a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. My colleagues and I on the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nunder Senator Lieberman's leadership, began this process more than a \nyear ago. When we first started out, I must admit that I had some \nreservations about making such dramatic changes to the way the Federal \nGovernment is organized. The hearings Senator Lieberman chaired during \nthe first half of this year, however, showed me how truly ill prepared \nwe really are to face the threat of terrorism. That is why I supported \nthe original version of Senator Lieberman's homeland security bill when \nit came before the Governmental Affairs Committee on May 22, 2002, some \ntime before President Bush released his proposed reorganization plan. I \nsupported it again on July 24 after we incorporated a number of the \nPresident's recommendations into our original draft.\n  I believe we need to create a strong Department of Homeland Security \nthat brings together under one roof the various Federal agencies \ncharged with preventing and responding to terrorist attacks. I am a \nlittle disappointed, however, that we appear ready to do so in a way \nthat disregards a good deal of the hard work that went into the \nbipartisan bill we reported out of Governmental Affairs.\n  Among other things, the bill before us today abandons a compromise \narrived at in committee on information sharing and the Freedom of \nInformation Act and includes INS restructuring language that is \ndifferent from anything included in the President's proposal, the \nHouse-passed bill or anything that we have debated here in the Senate. \nIt also includes some controversial provisions we have never seen \nbefore that seemingly appeared overnight. In the 108th Congress, we can \nand should have a debate on tort reform. We can and should have a \ndebate on the safety of childhood vaccines. What we should not have \ndone is hastily slip brand new provisions into this critically \nimportant bill without debate at the behest of special interests. There \nare three changes, however, that are of the most concern to me.\n  First, there is the new personnel language. This bill gives the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) almost total authority to rewrite Federal \ncivil service laws for Department of Homeland Security employees \nrelated to hiring and firing, job classification, pay, rules for labor-\nmanagement relations, performance appraisal and employee appeals to the \nMerit Systems Protection Board. Thinking that the Secretary and OPM \ncould not possibly know what kind of personnel system was needed at the \nnew Department before they were able to start putting it together, our \ncommittee maintained current law and asked the Secretary to report on \nhis or her progress in setting the Department up at least every 6 \nmonths and to ask Congress for specific changes in civil service \nprotections to meet specific Department needs.\n  As a former Governor who had to reorganize parts of his own State's \ngovernment, I can appreciate President Bush's desire to have as much \nflexibility as possible when creating something as large, complex and \nimportant as a Department of Homeland Security. However, I do not \nbelieve it's necessary to give him or his new Secretary the power to \nunilaterally change or waive workplace rules over the objections of \nDepartment employees and Congress. That is why I supported the \ncompromise put forward by Senators Nelson, Breaux, and Chafee before we \nadjourned for the election. That language would have left the most \nimportant civil service protections related to union rights and \nemployee appeals untouched and set up a system of binding arbitration \nso that the Secretary and OPM would have to work out any personnel \nsystem they draft with the employees who will be required to work under \nit. I wish that the personnel language in this bill was closer to that \ncontained in Nelson-Breaux-Chafee bipartisan compromise.\n  The second issue that is of concern to me in this bill is the \nlanguage on collective bargaining rights. It says that the President \ncan only use the authority he currently has to remove employees' \ncollective bargaining rights on employees transferred into the new \nDepartment if their agency's mission materially changes and their \nduties involve intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work \ndirectly related to a terrorism investigation. It gives him broad \nauthority to waive this test, however, and to use his authority \nregardless of whether or not the mission of the relevant agency has \nchanged. Our committee-passed bill would have required the \nadministration to go through the Federal Labor Relations Authority to \nremove employees' collective bargaining rights. I was comfortable with \nthat provision, but even more so with the Nelson-Breaux-Chafee \ncompromise on this issue, which includes the same restrictions on the \nPresident's authority included in this bill but which gives Department \nemployees the assurances that their collective bargaining rights will \nnot be taken away arbitrarily simply because they are working in \nsomething called the Department of Homeland Security. I wish this bill \noffered future employees of the Department of Homeland Security as much \nassurance that their rights would be protected.\n  My greatest disappointment with this bill is the glaring omission of \nany meaningful provisions to improve the security of our Nation's \nrailroads. It is inexplicable that we stand ready to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security that does nothing to protect the \nmillions of Americans who travel by rail every day. After the tragedy \nof September 11, this Congress and the President moved quickly to \nstabilize and secure our aviation system and to create the \nTransportation Security Administration with the mission of protecting \nall transportation modes.\n  The Congress followed suit with the Maritime Transportation Security \nAct of 2002 to protect our ports and maritime industry, which \nsuccessfully passed in the Senate last week. And now it seems that the \nOver-the-Road Bus Security legislation is poised to pass this body. Yet \nin all these efforts, we have done little to protect rail from \nterrorist attacks and security threats, creating an Achilles heel in \nour Nation's efforts to secure our transportation system. For all of \nour commendable focus and attention on preventing future attacks \nagainst the aviation industry, it is unconscionable that we would not \nwork to ensure that the roughly 25 million intercity passengers and \nmany millions more that commute aboard our trains are as safe as the \nones in our skies.\n  How can we ignore the FBI warnings made a few weeks ago that al-Qaida \nis considering directly targeting U.S. passenger trains and that \noperatives may try to destroy key rail bridges and sections of track to \ncause derailments? How could the Senate have voted to appropriate $2 \nmillion to remove jars of formaldehyde and alcohol from the \nSmithsonian's buildings here on the Mall because of their threat to the \nCapitol and yet leave the rail tunnel traveling under the Senate and \nHouse office buildings and the Supreme Court unprotected from terrorist \nattack? How can we end the 107th Congress having approved increased and \nstrengthened security programs for every single transportation mode \nexcept rail, a mode we know that al-Qaida may currently be targeting?\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\n  In creating the Department of Homeland Security, we had the chance to \naddress this omission. We could have included provisions to secure the \nnation's critical rail infrastructure and facilities and augment the \nmission of the Transportation Security Administration. Recognizing the \nobvious need for greater rail security early on, Senators Hollings, \nMcCain and others worked within the Commerce Committee to produce a \nbipartisan rail security bill to protect Amtrak and our vital rail \ninfrastructure from attack or sabotage. This bill, S. 1550, was \nsupported by the Bush Administration and reported unanimously out of \nthe committee.\n  They understood the important role that Amtrak played immediately \nfollowing the tragic events of September 11, when, with the aviation \nsystem shut down and our highways clogged or closed, Amtrak kept people \nsafely moving in the northeast and across the country. They know it is \nessential that we provide Amtrak with the means to harden their \nphysical assets and protect the safety and security of the traveling \npublic if we want to ensure that Amtrak can serve the nation in the \nfuture as it did after September 11. They realized that more people use \nAmtrak's Pennsylvania Station in one day than use all of New York's \nthree airports combined. They recognized that, like our other modes, \nour rail network is essential to the mobility, defense, and economic \nvitality of our nation. Yet their efforts have been blocked in this \nbody and our railroads remain largely unprotected.\n  Following the Commerce Committee's good work and seeing the logical \nrole for rail security within the new Department, I offered, and the \nCommittee voted to accept, a rail security amendment to Senator \nLieberman's homeland security bill during the our markup in July. My \namendment authorized funds through the Secretary of Homeland Security \nfor critical security and safety needs across Amtrak's national \nnetwork. Totaling $1.2 billion, my amendment authorized funds to assist \nthe diligent efforts already being made by Amtrak's police force and \nother law enforcement agencies, giving them the tools to focus on real \nthreats beyond the harmless rail fans police were chasing away as \ndescribed in an article on the front page of the Washington Post last \nweek. The amendment included: $375 million to finance systemwide \nsecurity and safety enhancements. These funds would have been used to \nimmediately address serious security risks by protecting \ninfrastructure, stations, and facilities across the entire Amtrak \nsystem. Amtrak's top priorities to be addressed with these funds \ninclude:\n  No. 1, securing tunnels, bridges, interlockings, towers, and yard and \nstation facilities with surveillance equipment, perimeter fencing, \nsecurity lighting, bomb detection equipment and bomb resistant \ntrashcans for stations, vehicle barriers and other measures.\n  No. 2, investing in passenger information systems to allow the \ncreation of watch lists and passenger manifests for tracking purposes \nand data sharing between Amtrak Police Department and the FBI. \nCurrently, Amtrak does not have the realtime ability to track who is \nonboard its trains.\n  No. 3, communications and command/control upgrades to track and \nlocate trains enroute, to ensure adequate radio coverage across the \nAmtrak system, and to provide automated data for incident response and \ncrisis management;\n  $778 million for life-safety and security improvements to the Amtrak \ntunnels in New York, Baltimore and Washington. The life-safety problems \nwith the tunnels on the northeast corridor are well documented and \nrequire immediate action. The tunnels in New York, 1910, Baltimore, \n1872, and Washington 1904 are nearing, or are over 100 year olds and \nconstitute safety hazards due to problems with emergency exits and \nventilation. Of specific concern, is a possible terrorist action \ninvolving these tunnels, which have limited evacuation capacity, \nantiquated stairwells, and poor lighting. The results could be \ncatastrophic. The funds will enhance life safety features within the \ntunnels, including:\n  No. 1. Washington, $40 million: upgraded emergency access and egress, \nimproved ventilation and communications. This tunnel sees 50 Amtrak/VRE \ntrains a day and 2 million passengers annually. Additionally, these \ntunnels pass directly under the Supreme Court and House and Senate \nOffice Buildings.\n  No. 2, Baltimore, $60 million: New fire standpipes; improved lighting \nand communications, egress improvements; and a preliminary design study \nof tunnel replacement options. This tunnel sees 125 Amtrak/MARC trains \na day.\n  No. 3, New York, $678 million, 6 tunnels: upgraded ventilation, \naccess, and egress through new stairways and shafts; structural \nrehabilitation for tunnel access, and improved lighting and signage. \nThe 6 New York Amtrak tunnels provide access to Penn station for \nAmtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Railroad. They are \ngateway to New York and the heart of the Northeast Corridor. Work on \nthe tunnels has already begun with $220 million from the Long Island \nRailroad and the FRA, through $100 million from FY '02 DOD supplemental \nAppropriations Act. Funds authorized in this amendment would complete \nwork on 3 of the 4 rebuilt ventilation and escapes shafts, dramatically \nimproving the safety of passengers should an emergency occur in the \ntunnels;\n  $55 million for wrecked equipment repair to ensure Amtrak adequate \nfleet capacity in the event of a national security emergency. At the \ntime of my amendment, 96 damaged and wrecked cars and five locomotives, \nor nearly one out of every fifteen Amtrak cars, were sitting idle, out \nof service, and awaiting repair. Without these cars, Amtrak is in \nserious danger of being able to provide adequate equipment to service \nits current routes, let alone offer additional service should there be \nanother national emergency. With these funds, Amtrak could have \nrepaired about half of these, and have some equipment up and running \nagain within 90 days. In our effort to strength the security of the \nhomeland, that we must provide Amtrak with the equipment it needs to \nserve the existing routes and to handle increased traffic should \nanother security crisis occur.\n  After the Governmental Affairs markup and the inclusion of this \namendment to the Lieberman substitute, I worked with Senators Hollings \nand McCain to create a bipartisan rail security package based on the \nprevious Committee work and my amendment that would authorize needed \nresources while ensuring proper oversight and accountability. We agreed \nto work together to add this package to the homeland security \nlegislation, in whatever form it took. I believe that Senator McCain \nspoke briefly about his commitment to enhancing the security of our \nrailroads on the floor last week, and I want to thank him for working \nwith us to create a sound security proposal. I know that he and Senator \nHollings share my disappointment that we have not been able to get this \npackage included in the current homeland security bill. Though we were \nunable to achieve success today, we are committed to doing so next \nyear, and I urge my colleagues to join this effort. Until we have \npassed a rail security package, we cannot honestly say that we have \nsecured our national transportation system.\n  In conclusion, today we missed a tremendous opportunity to truly \nsecure our entire transportation network. Surely, we all agree that \ndoing so is one of the Federal government's chief responsibilities. \nDebates about the future of Amtrak should not stand in the way of this \neffort. The fact is that, today, several thousands of riders are on \nAmtrak trains and hundreds of thousands more use Amtrak's tracks for \ntheir daily commute to work. Securing these facilities and these \nservices is not an issue that can wait. As the intelligence community \nhas already warned, the risks to America's railroads are real and exist \nas we speak. We have a responsibility to act to protect our people and \nour nation. We must pass rail security legislation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to discuss two provisions of the \nHomeland Security bill, those substantially transferring the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, ``ATF,'' to the Department of Justice \nand modifying and improving our explosives laws.\n  A driving force behind the President's blueprint for the reorganized \nGovernment is the need for the various agencies and bureaus charged \nwith enforcing Federal law to work more cooperatively and effectively \nin defending\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\nthe country against terrorism. The President's plan shifted several \nagencies charged with different aspects of Federal law enforcement to \nthe proposed Department of Homeland Security, including the Secret \nService and the Bureau of Customs, both formerly housed in the \nDepartment of the Treasury.\n  Unfortunately, this realignment of Treasury's law enforcement \nagencies left out one vitally important bureau, one that has as its \nprimary mission the enforcement of the explosives and firearms laws. \nThe ATF has been the cornerstone of the Federal law enforcement \nfunctions at Treasury for decades, but now under the President's plan, \nit would be left as the only major law enforcement presence in the \nentire Department.\n  The Department of the Treasury is entrusted with responsibilities \nprimarily in the area of monetary policy such as budgets, taxes, and \ncurrency production and circulation. In contrast, the ATF's mission \nconsists of enforcing the firearms, arson, and explosives laws as well \nas the criminal and regulatory functions of the alcohol and tobacco \nlaws. Clearly, these two missions do not jibe.\n  ATF serves an important role not only in the enforcement of the \ncriminal laws regarding firearms, explosives, alcohol and tobacco, but \nalso in waging the war on terrorism. We only need to remember the \nlitany of terrorist bombings from the first attack on the World Trade \nCenters to Beirut in 1982, the East Africa embassies, the U.S.S. Cole, \nKhobar Towers, and Oklahoma City, among others, to understand the \nimportance of the ATF's expertise in explosives and firearms on the war \non terrorism. Indeed, in the last 20 years, the vast majority of \nterrorist attacks with Americans as targets have used explosives or \nfirearms. Any effort to strengthen our homeland security that does not \ntake note of this fact is a half measure.\n  This bill understands ATF's importance in the war on terrorism by \nmoving it to the Department of Justice where it can coordinate its \nefforts more easily with the FBI, DEA, and the other premier Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies. In addition, the bill authorizes the ATF for \nthe first time as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, ATFE, and refocuses its mission. It will no longer be \nresponsible for collecting alcohol and tobacco fees, but instead will \nfocus entirely on the criminal enforcement of the explosives, firearms, \narson, and tobacco and alcohol smuggling laws.\n  The amendment makes clear that along with the transfer of enforcement \nof the explosives, firearms, and arson laws, the new ATFE will have \njurisdiction over the criminal statutes in title 18 of the United \nStates Code as they relate to tobacco or alcohol laws. These few \ncriminal statutes are the extent of ATFE's jurisdiction over alcohol \nand tobacco. All alcohol and tobacco revenue collection and related \nregulatory functions performed by the current ATF will remain under the \njurisdiction of the Tax and Trade Bureau of the Treasury Department.\n  The renaming of the Bureau is more than simply symbolic. The addition \nof the ``E'' to the name of the Bureau demonstrates the importance of \nexplosives in their mission. To coordinate better law enforcement \ntraining in explosives, we created the Explosives Training and Research \nFacility at Fort AP Hill, VA, where Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agents from around the country will be trained to \ninvestigate bombings.\n  We trust that the Attorney General and the Department of Justice in \nconjunction with the Department of the Treasury will make ATFE's \ntransition as efficient as possible. Moving a large law enforcement \nagency is not easily done. For that reason, the Homeland Security bill \npermits a sufficient time frame for the transitions to occur both to \nthe new Department of Homeland Security as well as the ATFE's \ntransition to the Department of Justice. It is our intent that the ATFE \nbe permitted as much time to complete its transition as the other \nbureaus and agencies being shifted to the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  At the Department of Justice, the ATFE will have primary \nresponsibility for the enforcement of the firearm, arson and explosives \nlaws as well as criminal alcohol and tobacco laws. In that role, the \nATFE will be able to work cooperatively with the FBI and the DEA in \nenforcing the criminal law while at the same time taking the lead when \nthe case under investigation is primarily within their jurisdiction. \nAccording to recent news reports, the FBI and the ATF do not always \nhave the best of relations. In fact, despite a long-standing memorandum \nof understanding between the two agencies allocating responsibilities, \nthere is still a fair amount of competition between the two when it \ncomes to areas where their respective jurisdiction overlaps. Now, with \nthe ATFE working under the same leadership as the FBI, the Attorney \nGeneral will be able to sort out these differences and maximize the \ncooperation between the two agencies. More cooperation will lead to a \nbetter focus on the war on terrorism.\n  The establishment of the ATFE at the Department of Justice gives the \nGovernment a dynamic weapon in the war on terrorism and in the every \nday battle against violent crime involving explosives, firearms and \narson. We look forward to the ATFE joining the Department of Justice \nand its other law enforcement agencies. We also look forward to the \nATFE maximizing its capabilities in enforcing the explosives, firearms, \nand arson laws and fighting the war on terrorism.\n  In addition to transferring ATF to the Department of Justice, this \nmeasure contains a subtitle that modifies our explosives laws. This \nprovision is an amended version of S. 1956, the Safe Explosives Act, \nwhich was introduced earlier this year by Sen. Orrin Hatch and me and \nH.R. 4864, the Anti-Terrorism Explosives Act, which was introduced \nearlier this year by Chairman Sensenbrenner.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the measure this \nsummer. I want to explain some of the provisions in this title of the \nbill and provide a more detailed section by section analysis of it.\n  Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon, we have had a growing sense that Congress \nneeds to close numerous gaps in Federal law to help prevent future \ndisasters. The current explosives laws are effective, but the Safe \nExplosives Act closes some loopholes and significantly improves its \nadministration.\n  The Safe Explosives Act effects two major changes in our explosives \nlaws: first, it creates a systematic method of enforcing our laws \nregarding who can and cannot purchase and possess explosives; and \nsecond, it makes some commonsense additions to the list of people who \nare barred from purchasing and possessing explosives.\n  Creating a systematic method for enforcing our laws makes sense in \nthe current environment. Most Americans would be stunned to learn that \nin some States it is easier to get enough explosives to take down a \nhouse than it is to buy a gun, get a driver's license, or even obtain a \nfishing license. Currently, it is too easy for would-be terrorists and \ncriminals to obtain explosive materials. Although permits are required \nfor interstate purchases of explosives, there are no current uniform \nnational limitations on the purchase of explosives within a single \nstate by a resident of that State. As a result, a patchwork quilt of \nState regulations covers the intrastate purchase of explosive \nmaterials. In some States, anyone can walk into a hardware store and \nbuy plastique explosives or a box of dynamite. No background check is \nconducted, and no effort is made to check whether the purchaser knows \nhow to properly use this deadly material. In at least 16 States, there \nare little to no restrictions on the intrastate purchase of explosives.\n  By addressing the intrastate sale and possession of explosives, the \nSafe Explosives Act would help close one such loophole that allows \npotential terrorists and criminals easy access to explosive materials. \nLet me elaborate. As I said, under current law anyone who is involved \nin interstate shipment, purchase, or possession of explosives must have \na Federal permit. This legislation creates the same requirement for \nintrastate purchases. It calls for two types of permits for these \nintrastate purchasers: user permits and limited user permits. The user \npermit lasts for 3 years and allows unlimited explosives purchases. The \nlimited user permit also expires after 3 years, but only allows\n\n[[Page S11393]]\n\nsix purchases per year. We created this two-tier system so that low-\nvolume users would not be burdened by regulations. The limited permit, \nlike the user permit, imposes commonsense rules such as a background \ncheck, monitoring of explosives purchases, secure storage, and report \nof sale or theft of explosives. However, the Safe Explosives Act does \nnot subject the limited user to the record keeping requirements \ncurrently required for full permit holders.\n  In addition to closing the intrastate loophole, this measure expands \nslightly the class of people who are barred from purchasing or \npossessing explosives. Current federal law prohibits certain categories \nof people from purchasing and possessing explosives. However, some \nimportant categories, such as people in the United States on a tourist \nvisa, are not included in current federal explosives law. The committee \nfeels that in addition to being barred from obtaining a firearm, these \npeople should also be prohibited from purchasing and possessing \nexplosive materials.\n  Overall, this measure strikes a reasonable balance between stopping \ndangerous people from getting explosives and helping legitimate users \nobtain and possess explosives. Most large commercial users already have \nexplosives permits because they engage in interstate explosives \ntransport. These users would not be significantly affected by our \nlegislation. The low-volume users will be able to quickly and cheaply \nget a limited permit. And high-volume intrastate purchasers who are \nrunning businesses that require explosives should easily be able to get \nan unlimited user permit. Also, the measure will not affect those who \nuse black or smokeless powder for recreation, as the legislation does \nnot change current regulations on those particular materials.\n  Our goal is simple. We must take all possible steps to keep deadly \nexplosives out of the hands of dangerous individuals seeking to \nthreaten our livelihood and security. The Safe Explosives Act is \ncritical legislation, supported by the administration. It is designed \nsolely to the interest of public safety. It will significantly enhance \nour efforts to limit the proliferation of explosives to would be \nterrorists and criminals. It will close a loophole that could \npotentially cause mass destruction of property and life.\n  Let me thank the many people who assisted us in drafting these \nprovisions. Senators Hatch and Leahy and Chairman Sensenbrenner were \nvital, as were Senators Baucus and Grassley. The staff and leadership \nof the Department of Treasury, the Department of Justice and the ATF \nwere invaluable. We all worked together cooperatively and in close \ncollaboration, and I believe that the finished product reflects the \nprofessionalism and dedication of the staff of those agencies. They are \nall to be congratulated.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of the \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Section-by-Section Analysis of Title XI, Subtitle C\n\n     Section 1121--Short title\n       The short title of this bill is the ``Safe Explosives \n     Act.''\n     Section 1122--Permits for purchasers of explosives\n       First, the following terms referenced in the bill are \n     defined: permittee, alien, and responsible person.\n       Second, this section would require all purchasers of \n     explosives to obtain a permit from the Treasury's Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), a process that includes \n     a background check, thereby reducing the availability of \n     explosives to terrorists, felons, and others prohibited by \n     law from possessing explosives. Although permits are now \n     required for interstate purchases, there are no current \n     Federal limitations on the purchase of explosives within a \n     single state by a resident of that state.\n       The new permit requirement would significantly enhance the \n     government's ability to prevent the misuse and unsafe storage \n     of explosives. As part of the permit application and renewal \n     process, ATF would conduct background checks on all \n     individuals wishing to acquire or possess explosives \n     materials. Applicants would also be required to submit \n     photographs and fingerprints along with their applications, \n     to ensure that a thorough background check can be completed. \n     Fingerprints are not necessary to conduct a background check, \n     however it significantly reduces the work and amount of time \n     for the positive identification of applicants, and therefore \n     will greatly reduce the application turnaround time and \n     workload for ATF.\n       In the case of a corporation, partnership or association, \n     the applicant would be required to submit fingerprints and \n     photographs of responsible persons, meaning those individuals \n     who possess the power to direct the management and policies \n     of the corporation, partnership or association pertaining to \n     explosive materials. Consistent with ATF's current policy, \n     this section does not require corporate applicants for \n     explosives licenses to list every single corporate director \n     or officer as a ``responsible person'' on its application for \n     a license or permit. Those officials within the corporation \n     who have no power to direct the management and policies of \n     the applicant with respect to explosive materials need not be \n     listed on the application. For example, in a large \n     corporation that uses explosives in just one of many business \n     activities, there may be many corporate officials who have no \n     responsibilities or authority in connection with the \n     explosives aspects of the company's business. These officials \n     would not be listed as ``responsible persons'' on the \n     application, and would not need to submit fingerprints or \n     photographs to ATF. Furthermore, if corporate bylaws provide \n     that certain high-level corporate officials do not have the \n     power or authority to direct the management and policies of \n     the corporation with respect to explosive materials, then \n     such officials will not be considered to be responsible \n     persons.\n       We encourage the Secretary to strive for balanced \n     enforcement. In so doing, the Secretary should avoid imposing \n     unnecessary burdens on applicants for explosives licenses and \n     permits. There is no reason to require background checks for \n     corporate officials who have no responsibilities or authority \n     in connection with the explosives aspect of a company's \n     business. By the same token, companies have an obligation to \n     be forthright with the ATF, and we expect them to err on the \n     side of overinclusiveness in deciding who may be a \n     responsible person.\n       This section will also require applicants to list the names \n     of all employees who will have possession of the explosive \n     materials, so that the ATF can verify that these individuals \n     are not prohibited from receiving or possessing explosives. \n     In order to prevent an overload of employee background checks \n     all at once for the ATF, current licenses and permits will \n     remain valid until that license or permit is revoked, \n     expires, or until a timely application for renewal is acted \n     upon. Under current law, it is too easy for would-be \n     terrorists and criminals to obtain access to explosive \n     materials by obtaining jobs (such as driving trucks) with \n     explosives licensees. These expanded requirements would also \n     apply to entities seeking to obtain a license to sell \n     explosives.\n       It is the Committee's intention that ATF should work \n     closely with the regulated industry to develop guidance as to \n     which employees are considered to be in ``possession'' of \n     explosive materials in the course of their employment. \n     Applicants for explosives licenses or permits are not \n     required to list every single employee of the business. \n     Instead they are only required to list employees who are \n     expected to possess explosive materials as part of their \n     duties.\n       In developing these standards, ATF should be guided by the \n     case law interpreting the term ``possession'' under the Gun \n     Control Act of 1968, GCA, as amended. It is well established \n     that possession under the GCA may be demonstrated through \n     either actual or constructive possession. Actual possession \n     exists when a person is in immediate possession or control of \n     an object, and includes instances where a person knowingly \n     has direct physical control over the object at a given time. \n     Thus, employees who physically handle explosive materials \n     would clearly be in possession of those materials. This would \n     include, among others, employees who handle explosive \n     materials, as defined by the law as part of a production \n     process; employees who handle explosive materials in order to \n     ship, transport, or sell them; and employees who actually use \n     the explosive materials. All of these employees, as well as \n     any other employees who actually possess explosive materials \n     as part of their duties, must be listed on the application \n     for a license or permit.\n       Where direct physical contact is lacking, a person may \n     nonetheless have constructive possession where he or she \n     knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time to \n     exercise dominion and control over the explosives, either \n     directly or through others. Accordingly, this section would \n     require applicants for licenses or permits to list all \n     employees who will have constructive possession of explosive \n     materials as part of their duties. For example, an employee \n     who drives a truck with an explosives load is in constructive \n     possession of the explosives even though he may not \n     physically handle them. This individual has dominion and \n     control over the explosives while he transports them; \n     furthermore, he could easily divert them from their intended \n     destination. Such an individual should be subject to the \n     background check requirements of the amended law. Similarly, \n     a supervisor at a construction site who keeps the keys for \n     the building in which the explosives are stored, and directs \n     the use of explosives by other employees, would be in \n     constructive possession of those explosives.\n       Finally, this section recognizes the distinction between \n     small individual users of explosives and large commercial \n     users by creating\n\n[[Page S11394]]\n\n     a new ``limited permit'' for those infrequent purchasers. The \n     limited permit allows a purchaser to make no more that six \n     purchases of explosives within a 12-month period, and the \n     permit is only valid for purchases within the purchaser's \n     state of residence. While limited permit holder must pass the \n     background check like all other permit applicants, they are \n     not subject to spot inspections imposed on full permit \n     holders. To ensure that holders of limited permits are not \n     violating law by acquiring explosive materials more than six \n     times a year, this section requires anyone selling explosives \n     to a limited permit holder to report the sale to the ATF. \n     This allows the ATF to monitor misuse by limited permit \n     holders, and investigate suspicious volume purchases by such \n     individuals, while allowing infrequent users to access more \n     than enough for their needs. Holders of limited permits would \n     also be required to report their distribution of excess \n     stocks of explosives to other permittees or licensees.\n       All permittees, limited or otherwise, are subject to \n     inspection by the ATF to ensure that the explosives are being \n     properly stored. In the interest of minimizing the turnaround \n     time for approval of licenses and permits, and in order to \n     avoid overburdening ATF with an onrush of inspections \n     immediately after this act takes effect, the bill gives ATF \n     the discretion to defer immediate inspection of license and \n     permit applicants at the time of application. However, \n     because of concern for public safety, a provision requires \n     ATF to inspect both permitees and licensees within three \n     years of issuing a license or permit. Specifically, ATF must \n     inspect limited permitees prior to a third consecutive \n     renewal, and licensees or user permitees prior to the first \n     renewal. It also increases the amount of time ATF has to \n     approve or deny an application to 90 days. This will allow \n     ATF ample time to conduct thorough background checks, \n     especially important immediately following enactment of the \n     bill when there will likely be a surge in applications. These \n     provisions were put in the bill at the request of the House.\n       This section also includes an important measure that \n     ensures privacy for employees or potential employees of a \n     company that applying for a user permit that are subject to a \n     background check. The provision requires the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to notify the employer as to whether or not an \n     employee passes the background check. However, should an \n     individual not pass the employer will not be told the reason \n     why. Rather, the employee will be notified as to the \n     reason(s) for not passing.\n     Section 1123--Persons prohibited from receiving or possessing \n         explosive materials\n       This proposal expands the list of those people who are \n     prohibited from purchasing or possessing explosives to \n     include: mental incompetents, aliens other than lawful \n     permanent resident aliens, people dishonorably discharged \n     from the military, and Americans who have renounced their \n     citizenship. The addition of such categories to the list of \n     prohibited persons recognizes the potential for terrorists or \n     other criminals to use explosives to carry out their attacks \n     and brings the explosives law in line with most categories of \n     prohibited people in the Gun Control Act.\n       Congress has already determined that the possession of \n     firearms by the above categories of people is dangerous to \n     society. In order to combat terrorism and other violent \n     crime, it is essential that Federal law prohibit the receipt \n     or possession of explosive materials by such individuals \n     already deemed too dangerous to possess firearms. The \n     language relating to non-immigrant aliens differs slightly \n     from that in the Gun Control Act, as technical changes have \n     been made to improve the clarity of the provision.\n     Section 1124--Requirement to provide samples of explosive \n         materials and ammonium nitrate\n       This section would enhance the ATF's ability to solve cases \n     involving explosives by requiring Federally licensed \n     explosives manufacturers and importers and persons who \n     manufacture or import ammonium nitrate to provide to ATF, \n     upon request, with samples of, or chemical information on, \n     the products they manufacture or import. The ATF fulfills a \n     critical investigative role in the solving of crimes or acts \n     of terrorism committed by explosives. Such information is \n     essential to ATF's ability to prevent and solve bombings and \n     to trace explosive materials that are used in terrorist \n     activities and other violent crimes by matching residue with \n     the manufacturers' samples. Also, the ability to evaluate \n     such samples as well as information on the chemical \n     composition of these products will allow the ATF to \n     familiarize themselves with products that may be diverted to \n     criminal misuse.\n     Section 1125--Destruction of property of institutions \n         receiving federal financial assistance\n       This section expands ATF's authority to investigate \n     destruction of property by fire or explosion if the property \n     receives federal assistance.\n     Section 1126--Relief from disabilities\n       This section allows for a person who is prohibited from the \n     above mentioned explosive material possession, purchase, etc. \n     to apply to the Attorney General for relief from \n     disabilities. The Attorney General may grant that relief if \n     the circumstances regarding the disability are such that the \n     applicant is not likely to be dangerous to the public if \n     allowed to work with the above mentioned explosive materials, \n     and that it would not be contrary to the best interest of the \n     public.\n     Section 1127--Theft reporting requirement\n       According to this section, all licensees and permittees are \n     required to report the known theft of explosive materials \n     from that user no later than 24 hours after the discovery of \n     theft. Failure to do so can result in a fine not more than \n     $10,000, or imprisonment not more than 5 years, or both. It \n     is essential that ATF investigate theft of explosives in \n     order to prevent accidental or criminal misuse.\n     Sec. 1128--Authorization of appropriations\n       This section authorizes the appropriation to carry out the \n     provisions of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield myself 5 minutes from the time of Senator \nThompson and 5 minutes from the time of the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, this legislation to create a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security will result in the most significant \ntransformation of the executive branch in over 50 years and is of \nfundamental importance to our national security. I believe that \nCongress has the responsibility to establish a new Department of \nHomeland Security this year, before we adjourn for we know that those \nwishing to do our nation harm will not wait for us to act.\n  The longer we delay, the longer we leave vulnerabilities in place, \nthe longer we consciously rely upon a fragmented system to guard our \nhomeland. While creating a new department in and of itself will not be \nsufficient to safeguard our homeland, it will bring much needed focus \nand coordination to the task.\n  In the year since the terrorist attack, much has been done to make \nour nation more secure. Congress has approved billions of dollars to \nsecure our borders, protect critical infrastructure, train and equip \nfirst responders, and better detect and respond to biological or \nchemical attacks. Our brave men and women in uniform have fought \nvaliantly in the war against terrorism and have secured important \nvictories in Afghanistan.\n  The creation of the Department of the Homeland Security is the next \nstep in our efforts to secure our nation against another terrorist \nattack. The task before us is daunting. This sweeping reorganization \ndwarfs any corporate merger. It involves some 170,000 employees and a \nbudget of nearly $40 billion.\n  Despite the magnitude and challenge of the task, there should be no \ndoubt about the need for this new cabinet department. Currently, as \nmany as 100 Federal agencies are responsible for homeland security, but \nnot one has homeland security as its primary mission. When that many \nentities are responsible, nobody is really accountable, and turf \nbattles and bureaucratic disputes are inevitable.\n  If we are to overcome these problems and create a workable national \nsecurity structure, then we must unite the current patchwork of \ngovernmental entities into a new Department of Homeland Security. The \nnew agency will work to secure U.S. borders, ports, and critical \ninfrastructure. It will synthesize and analyze intelligence from \nmultiple sources, lessening the possibility of intelligence \ncommunication breakdowns. And it will coordinate security activities \nnow undertaken separately by agencies like the Customs Service, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service so that the resulting effort will be greater \nthan the sum of its parts. The new Department for Homeland Security \nwill help to remedy many of the current organizational weaknesses and \nto protect us against future attacks.\n  As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which held \nextensive hearings on the reorganization, I had the opportunity to \nconsider carefully myriad ideas and concepts about the creation of the \nDepartment. We heard testimony from Governor Ridge, from Director \nMueller of the FBI, from Director Tenet of the CIA, and from numerous \nother experts. They all shed light on the problems that have impaired \nour ability to defend our homeland, and on the threats that we now face \nand that will inevitably challenge us in the future.\n  While strongly supporting the creation of the Department, I believe \nthat we also must protect the traditional roles of institutions and \nagencies that\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\nare important to America's economic and social fabric. In particular, \nthe Coast Guard's traditional functions--such as search and rescue and \nmarine resource protection--must be maintained.\n\n  Since the attacks of September 11, the Coast Guard's focus has \nshifted to homeland security. The Coast Guard plays an essential role \nin homeland security, and I believe that it should play a leading role \nin the new Department. If, however, the current resource allocation is \nmaintained, and the Coast Guard continues to assume new \nresponsibilities, its traditional missions may be jeopardized.\n  Prior to September 11, port security accounted for approximately 2 \npercent of the Coast Guard's resources. Immediately following the \nterrorist attacks, the Coast Guard deployed 59 percent of its resources \nto port safety and security missions. As a result, many of the aircraft \nand vessels used for search and rescue were far removed from their \noptimal locations for search and rescue. Even after the immediate \nimpact of September 11 attacks subsided, its impact on the resources of \nthe Coast Guard remained. Indeed, the Coast Guard continues to devote \nfewer hours to its traditional functions than it did before 9/11.\n  Because of the Coast Guard's importance to coastal areas throughout \nour Nation, any reduction in its traditional functions is of great \nconcern. Last year alone, the Coast Guard performed over 39,000 search \nand rescue missions and saved more than 4,000 lives. On a typical day, \nthe Coast Guard saves 10 lives, interdicts 14 illegal immigrants, \ninspects and repairs 135 buoys, and helps more than 2,500 commercial \nships navigate into and out of U.S. ports. In short, the Coast Guard's \ntraditional missions are of vital importance and must be preserved.\n  Let me take a minute to talk about the Coast Guard's importance in my \nhome State of Maine. Each year, the Coast Guard performs about 300 \nsearch and rescue missions in my State. These missions are literally a \nmatter of life and death. Just a few weeks ago, the Coast Guard saved \ntwo Maine fishermen from their burning boat off the coast of \nMassachusetts after a 12 hour search.\n  Since October 1999, fourteen fishermen have lost their lives off the \ncoast of Maine. Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous of \noccupations. How many more fisherman or recreational boaters would have \ndied or been injured if the nearest Coast Guard cutter were not in \nport? How many more will lose their lives if the local Coast Guard \nstations must devote the majority of their time to homeland security \nalone? I agree that the Coast Guard must perform homeland security \nfunctions. But it is critically important that it not do so at the \nexpense of its traditional missions.\n  Senator Stevens and I addressed these concerns during the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's mark-up of the original homeland \nsecurity bill. We offered a successful amendment to preserve the \ntraditional functions of the Coast Guard.\n  The compromise bill ensures that the Coast Guard's non-homeland \nsecurity functions will be maintained after its transfer into the new \nDepartment, and also provides for flexibility to ensure our national \nsecurity. As our amendment provided, the compromise homeland security \nbill has the Commandant of the Coast Guard report directly to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, thus ensuring direct access for the \nCommandant's views. The protections for the Coast Guard will help \nsafeguard our coastal communities' economies, way of life, and loved \nones, while Americans, wherever they live, can rest assured that the \nCoast Guard will perform its necessary and vital homeland security \nfunctions.\n  Similarly, I am pleased that the compromise bill incorporates a \nprovision that Senator Levin and I proposed to create a Special \nAssistant position in the Secretary's office to promote public/private \npartnerships and to ensure that the business community has a place to \ngo to ask questions, voice concerns, and provide feedback. It is \nimportant to bear in mind that our homeland security and economic \nsecurity are closely linked, and that the failure of one jeopardizes \nthe other. Our economic vitality makes us strong and capable of \ndefending our nation against external and internal threats.\n  The issue of personnel and management flexibility, unfortunately, \nbecame the most controversial issue in this homeland security debate. \nThe creation of the new Department will transfer approximately 170,000 \ncurrent Government employees who are covered by a large number of \ndifferent work rules, personnel systems, and labor agreements from \nother departments and agencies. Given the pressing importance of the \nnew Department, and the vital functions it will perform, we need to \ngrant the new Secretary appropriate but not unlimited authority to \ncreate a flexible, unified new personnel system that meets the \nDepartment's unique demands.\n  This legislation strikes the right balance. Initially, the \nAdministration sought power for the Secretary to unilaterally modify \nall of the civil service laws which I opposed. The administration \ncompromised and will have flexibility in only those areas it deemed \nvital to the Department's efficient functioning.\n  Also, I would note that there are many safeguards to prevent abuse of \nthis authority that we are granting the Department, including a \nrequirement I authored requiring that any changes made to the appeals \nrights of the Department's employees be made only to ``further the \nfair, efficient and expeditious resolution'' of workers' appeals. \nAdditionally, any changes made will now be subject to mediation, unlike \nthe Administration's initial proposal, which only called for \nnotification.\n  As we create a new Department of Homeland Security, it is critically \nimportant that we remember those on the front lines of any emergency: \nour police, our firefighters, our EMS personnel. I am disappointed that \nthe compromise bill fails to include important amendments that I \noffered with Senators Feingold and Carper, and that were adopted both \nin committee and on the Senate floor.\n  The compromise bill includes an Office for State and Local Government \nCoordination, but it lacks the provisions needed to ensure that the new \nDepartment coordinates and communicates adequately and efficiently with \nstate and local first responders. Senators Feingold, Carper and I would \nhave placed a Department liaison in each State, thereby enhancing the \nDepartment's ability to work effectively with first responders, who \nperform such a critical role in our homeland defense. In my role as \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I plan next year to \nrevisit this issue to ensure that the new Department and our first \nresponders can work efficiently together not at cross purposes when \nemergencies arise.\n  The new Department of Homeland Security is an essential component of \nour response to current and future threats. As the brutal attacks of \nSeptember 11th demonstrated, distance from our enemies and the barrier \nof oceans no longer suffice to protect our nation. The bill that we are \nconsidering today is an important step in making our homeland more \nsecure.\n  I reserve any unused time for Senator Thompson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield myself 15 minutes off the majority side. I \nwould like to be notified by the Chair when 5 minutes have expired. I \nwould like to separate the remarks: 5 minutes spent on the homeland \nsecurity issue, and then 10 minutes on terrorism insurance, of which I \nwill be yielding some brief time to colleagues who want to be heard on \nthat matter. Senator Sarbanes, the chairman of the Banking Committee, \nwill be coming to the floor at which time he will also have 15 minutes \nto talk about terrorism insurance or other matters he may want to \nraise, in which case we will try to have our remarks appear \ncontinuously, if we can, regarding terrorism insurance.\n  On the issue of homeland security, I am going to vote for this bill \nin the end when we are called upon, in several hours, to do so.\n  First of all, let me commend my colleague from Connecticut, who has \nbeen the manager of this bill along with Senator Thompson of Tennessee \nfor the last number of weeks and months since this bill has been part \nof the debate in the Senate.\n  I want to commend Joe Lieberman. My colleagues should know--and I am\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\nsure they remember this--he introduced this legislation in October of \nlast year. The committee marked up that bill, I think, with just \nDemocratic votes out of the Government Affairs Committee to bring a \nhomeland security bill to this Chamber.\n  I am delighted to hear that we now have strong bipartisan support for \nthis effort. But let us be clear about the history. The history is that \nJoe Lieberman offered this idea to this body. It was his committee \nunder his leadership that marked up that bill and sent it to the floor \non a partisan vote, unfortunately. We are now going to vote on it.\n  I will vote for passage of the bill before the Senate today, but I \nwill do so with deep reservations. I believe that the bill before us \ndoes far too little to adequately protect average Americans from the \ndangers posed by terrorists. And regrettably, it does far too much to \nprotect special interests favored by the majority party in the other \nbody. That having been said, I believe that, on the whole, the bill \nwill make America marginally more secure and I would rather err on the \nside of improving security than on the side of inaction. I will to look \nfor every opportunity to make improvements in Department of Homeland \nSecurity in the months ahead.\n  This bill does take a step in the right direction by creating a \nunified department that can focus on security. Effectively reorganizing \nparts of the federal government can improve our security. The bill will \nallow the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate activities that \nhave previously been conducted by two dozen separate agencies. This \nbill will allow the Administration to consolidate layers of government \nand if the Administration does this well, it should improve the way our \ngovernment collects and shares information. By eliminating redundancy \nand conflicts within the government, the new department can make it \neasier to identify and respond quickly to threats as they emerge.\n  Further, if the Administration wisely uses the authority granted to \nit in this bill, it should be able to improve security at our borders. \nThis bill authorizes the administration to completely revamp our \nimmigration and naturalization services. If the Administration uses \nthis authority to truly modernize immigration services, it will be able \nto avoid problems like those we have all read about cases where the \nimmigration and naturalization services issued student visas improperly \nbecause of computer errors, poor record-keeping, and lax analysis of \ninformation.\n  Still, despite these and several other constructive provisions, this \nbill could have done more to strengthen homeland security. For example, \nit could have done more to foster better coordination and to better \nprepare local communities to respond to emergencies that may occur. I \noffered an amendment that would have authorized the Department of \nHomeland Security to establish a grant program to help local fire \ndepartments address the chronic understaffing problems that plague so \nmany local departments. The International Association of Firefighters \nand the International Associate Fire Chiefs have estimated that we need \nat least 75,000 additional firefighters in this country just to meet \npre-9/11 staffing needs. Since 9/11, firefighter labor shortages have \nbecome even more of a problem across the country. Senator Warner and I \nrecognized the full extent of the problem of firefighter understaffing \nshortly after September 11, 2001, and we wrote legislation to help \nsolve the problem. The amendment I offered was based on the bill that \nSenator Warner and I wrote. The amendment also built on the FIRE Act, \nwhich Senator DeWine and I authored in 2000. The FIRE Act, which became \nlaw thanks in large part to the effort of Senators Warner and Levin, \nhas provided more than $400 million to train and equip tens of \nthousands of firefighters around the country. Understaffing has become \nsuch a problem, that according to the International Association of \nFirefighters, nearly \\2/3\\ of all fire departments cannot meet minimum \nsafety standards.\n  I also attempted to offer a second amendment to provide equitable pay \nfor federal law enforcement officers. This amendment would have ensured \nthat the federal government could retain highly-qualified and \nexperienced law-enforcement professionals. All over the country, \nfederal law enforcement officers are retiring from the federal service \nbecause they can make more money working in the private sector or for \nstate and local governments. In New York, San Francisco, and Los \nAngeles, where living expenses are high, the FBI reported that 65% of \nits agents have been on the job for less than 5 years. This statistic \nreflects the fact that experienced officers would rather leave the \nFederal service than accept transfers to these expensive cities where \nthey cannot provide adequately for their families.\n  Don't get me wrong, all of the men and women who serve as Federal law \nenforcement officers do an outstanding job. But I also believe that \nexperience is an invaluable asset and I think we need to make sure that \nthe talent that comes with experience is available to the Federal \ngovernment. Our Federal law enforcement services should be more than \njust a training ground--our law enforcement officers should be among \nthe most experienced and highly skilled in the world so that they can \nprovide the high degree of protection that the American people so \nrightly deserve.\n  The bill before us would have been far better if it had more fully \naddressed the critically important needs of firefighters and federal \nlaw-enforcement officers. Sadly, however, their needs are all but \nignored in this legislation. I intend to seek any and every opportunity \nin future to remedy this shortcoming. A homeland security bill that \nlargely ignores the needs of these dedicated civil servants can only be \nconsidered a partial success.\n  Instead of focusing on the interests of the American people and those \nof firefighters and law officers, the bill before us contains numerous \nspecial interest provisions that help large corporations and do nothing \nto ensure the safety of the American public. In fact, I believe that \nsome of the provisions in this bill could potentially cause harm to the \npublic.\n  One provision of particular concern will bar parents from seeking \nlegal redress from pharmaceutical companies whose drugs may have caused \nautism in their children. Parents would be barred from pursuing \ncomplaints through the courts and instead would be forced into the \nFederal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which limits damages to \n$250,000. I have supported reasonable tort reform in the past, but this \nprovision changes the rules in the middle of the game for people who \nare already before the courts. Under this provision, pending lawsuits \nthat have absolutely nothing to do with homeland security will likely \nbe dismissed and parents who claim their children have become autistic \ndue to corporate malfeasance will be denied their day in court.\n  The homeland security bill before us also guts an amendment offered \nby Senator Wellstone, which would have prohibited the government from \ncontracting with companies that have moved their headquarters overseas \nto avoid taxes in the United States. Under the current bill, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security has broad authority to contract with \nthese corporate expatriates. This provision is a welcome relief to \nthose companies that would dodge their patriotic duty at a time of war \nby relocating to foreign shores.\n  I am concerned about another provision in the bill that exempts the \nnew Department's advisory committees from the open meetings \nrequirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). Agencies \nthroughout government use advisory committees that function under open \nmeetings rules and the open meetings law is careful to protect \ndiscussions and documents that involve sensitive information. The law \ncurrently applies to the Department of Defense, the Department of \nJustice, the State Department, the National Security Agency, and \nothers. In my view, the administration has failed to make the case for \nexempting the Homeland Security Department from the requirement that \nrecords for committee meetings should make available to the public.\n  Another blatantly unnecessary and misguided element of the bill would \ncreate a very narrow university-based homeland security research center \nprogram. Based on the criteria outlined in the bill, the research \ncenter that would be created is described so narrowly that it appears \nthat only a handful of universities--including Texas A University--\nmight qualify to host the center. This provision amounts to Congress \nintervening to pick winners and\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\nlosers in the field of science. The Democratic amendment would have \neliminated the list of highly specific criteria that appears to direct \nthe science center program to particular universities. This bill would \nhave been better if that amendment had succeeded.\n  I invite anyone who may be interested to call up the Web site at the \nWhite House to get an idea about what the homeland security bill looks \nlike. This is what it looks like. It is 35 pages long. This is the bill \nthe White House submitted as the homeland security bill. That is what \nyou will get if you call up the Web site. What we are actually going to \nvote on is this. The bill I just showed you is 35 pages long. The bill \nwe are going to vote on is 484 pages long. Once the House leadership \ngot their hands on this bill, it grew by 450 pages. Most of the \nextraneous material has nothing to do with homeland security. It has a \nlot to do with special interests, but not homeland security. When you \ncall up that White House Web site and you ask for the bill, you are \ngoing to get the short version, but we are going to vote on this \nmonstrosity of 484 pages.\n  I am told that the White House and others are going to clean this up \nin the coming Congress. They have a major job to do.\n  There are provisions in this bill that have no bearing and no \nrelationship whatsoever to homeland security that were stuck in here in \nan act of arrogance by the leadership in the other body. They assumed \nthey could put anything they wanted in here and then send it over and \nwe would have to support it. Most of us know that these matters have no \nbusiness being in this bill.\n  There are a number of provisions, of course, in the bill that Senator \nLieberman authored that are included here and therefore deserving of \nsupport.\n  That is the quandary in which we find ourselves. There are good \npieces here that truly deal with the necessity of bringing agencies of \nGovernment together so we can respond more effectively and efficiently \nto terrorists--a matter we have to confront. But it is a tragedy they \nhave taken language and then added to it all of these other provisions \nin these 484 pages.\n  There are some things that are left out as well. I want to commend my \ncolleague from Maine, Senator Collins, as did our colleague from New \nYork, Senator Clinton, for talking about the absence of dealing with \nfirst responders. It seems unfair, to put it mildly, that we are not \ndealing here with the police, firefighter, and emergency medical \nservices personnel. We're not giving them the kind of support and \nbacking that will be necessary if we are struck with another terrorist \nattack.\n  I am hopeful as we reconvene the 108th Congress in January that we \nwill be getting on with the business of doing what we can to see to it \nthat those provisions to help first responders are going to become the \nlaw of the land.\n  There have been provisions passed already that deal with homeland \nsecurity, but, unfortunately, the President decided to sequester those \nfunds.\n  For those who may not understand what sequester is, that is \ntantamount to a veto--about $150 million--sitting down there just \nwaiting for the President's signature which would become available to \ndeal with homeland security.\n  But again, there are good provisions in the original Lieberman \nproposal and many of those provisions remain intact. For those reasons, \ndespite the fact that the bill includes a lot of things that do not \ndeserve to be in here, and on the commitments we have received from the \nRepublican leadership as well as the White House to scrub this \nlegislation and get rid of a lot of these things that have been added \non here, I will support this bill.\n  But when you call up that Web site, you might ask them where the \nother 450 pages are which you won't get.\n  In closing, I would have preferred to lend my support to a more \nfocused, more effective, homeland security bill. I tried to improve \nthis bill, but at the end of the day this is the best we could do given \nthe opposition we faced. I presume that this is not the last \nopportunity Congress will have to address homeland security. In the \nmonths ahead, I will continue to fight for improvements to the \ndepartment we are creating. I will continue to fight for cops, not \ncorporations; firefighters, not firms. America's security from \nterrorism depends on the men and women who wake up every morning, put \non uniforms from state and local agencies across the country, and place \nthemselves at risk for our nation. We owe them--and the Americans they \nare sworn to protect--more than this bill provides. But to do nothing \nwould be to provide even less, and that is not wise under the present \ncircumstances. This bill is a start toward a more rational and \neffective approach to strengthening security for all Americans here at \nhome. For that reason I will support this homeland security bill.\n\n\n                    the terrorism risk insurance act\n\n  Madam President, I rise today in support of the conference report on \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. This conference report \nrepresents a truly bipartisan, bicameral compromise. The Senate \noverwhelmingly supported the underlying legislation, which I \nintroduced, along with Senators Sarbanes, Reid, and Schumer, in June of \nthis year by a vote of 84-14.\n  This conference report closely mirrors the Senate-passed bill, and in \nmany regards has been improved by negotiations with the House.\n  Late last week, the House passed this conference report by voice \nvote. It is my fervent hope that the Senate will move shortly to \nsupport it as well.\n  In the 14 months since September 11, 2001, Congress has taken many \nimportant steps to protect our Nation from the new threat of terrorism. \nMost of these measures have focused on protecting our Nation's physical \nsecurity--such as our new anti-terrorism laws, airport security \nlegislation, and other initiatives to shore up our ``homeland \ndefense.''\n  But we cannot, and must not, fail to respond to the effects that the \nnew threat of terrorism are having on our Nation's economic security.\n  The goal of the September 11 terrorists was not simply to cause an \nenormous loss of life--it was also to derail America's economy; to \nundermine the consumer and investor confidence that serves as the \ncornerstone of our free enterprise system.\n  It is, therefore, by no means an overstatement to say that a robust \nAmerican economy, and continued American prosperity, are as vital to \ndefeating the aims of terrorists as is protecting American lives.\n  As a result of the September 11 attacks, during the past year, \nseveral critical sectors of the economy--real estate, commercial \nlending, aviation, construction, and others--have experienced \nsignificant disruptions because of the difficulty in finding terrorism \ninsurance. By some estimates, this has cost American workers thousands \nof jobs and cost our economy tens of billions of dollars in economic \ngrowth activities--at a time our economy can surely use responsible \neconomic stimulus.\n  The bottom line is that the insurance which protects America's \nbuildings, businesses, homes, and workers from terrorist acts is no \nlonger readily available or affordable. The impact on our economy of \nthe shortage and expense of terrorism insurance has been detrimental.\n  According to the Real Estate Roundtable, over $15 billion worth of \nnew real estate projects across the country have been stalled or \ncanceled because of a continuing scarcity of terrorism insurance during \nthe past year.\n  The Risk Insurance Management Society, RIMS, recently released a \nsurvey which revealed that 71 percent of its membership found it very \ndifficult or impossible to obtain adequate terrorism insurance. Also, \n84 percent felt that their companies were inadequately covered against \na future terrorist attack, while nearly 70 percent had no terrorism \ncoverage whatsoever.\n  Rating agencies like Moody's have downgraded the credit ratings of \nnearly $5 billion in commercial mortgage backed securities because \nterrorism insurance could not be obtained on the underlying properties.\n  It has estimated that the lack of terrorism insurance has caused \nconstruction workers to potentially lose up to 300,000 jobs because \nprojects couldn't get financing without such insurance. According to \nEdward Sullivan, President of the Building and Construction Trades, \nAFL-CIO, ``The unavailability of terrorism risk insurance is hurting\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nthe construction industry by making the cost and risk of undertaking \nnew building projects prohibitive. Building projects are being delayed \nor canceled for fear that they may be future terrorist targets. Lenders \nare refusing to go forward with previously planned projects where \nterrorism insurance coverage is no longer available. As a result, \nconstruction workers are losing job opportunities.''\n  Just last week, a survey conducted by the New York City Comptroller \ncited the ``dramatic'' increases in commercial insurance premiums \ncoupled with a ``significant decline'' in the availability of insurance \nsince the September 11 attacks. The comptroller has urged the passage \nof federal legislation--such as that contained in this conference \nreport.\n  Without Federal action, the General Accounting Office has warned that \nanother terrorist attack would seriously impact America's economy by \nexposing businesses and property owners to potentially enormous \nlosses--losses that could wipe out those businesses as well as the \nbusinesses that insure them.\n  No one wants to think about another terrorist attack. However, our \nfree market system, in order to function efficiently, has to factor the \nrisk of such an attack into its economic thinking.\n  The fact is, experts are estimating that, should another attack \ncomparable to the September 11 attacks take place, only about 20 \npercent of the losses would be covered. This exposes our economy--and \nour entire country to a significant--and in the opinion of many, an \nunacceptable level of vulnerability.\n  We are here today to address this vulnerability. The passage of this \nconference report will go a long way toward calming our nervous \ninsurance marketplace, and allow American businesses to continue to \ninvest, and expand--in short, to continue business as usual.\n  This conference report makes sense because it calls upon the Federal \nGovernment to act only as an insurer of last resort. The private \ninsurance industry will maintain front-line responsibility to do what \nit does best: calculate risk, assess premiums, and pay claims to \npolicyholders.\n  The insurance industry is paying off the losses from the September 11 \nattacks, estimated to be roughly $30 billion--$40 billion. And the \nindustry has made clear that despite this unprecedented loss, it \nremains strong and solvent.\n  Insurance isn't something we think about every day, yet it is vital \nto the overall health of our economy. By protecting people and \nproperty, goods and services in every sector of America's $10 trillion \neconomy, insurance provides the stability and certainty required to \nkeep our economic engine humming. Every prospective homeowner needs \ninsurance to obtain a mortgage from a bank. Similarly, industries as \ndiverse as commercial real estate, shipping, construction, \nmanufacturing, and even ``mom and pop'' retailers require insurance to \nobtain credit, loans, and investments necessary for their normal \nbusiness operations.\n  So although insurance isn't something we can touch and feel, its \navailability is as vital to rebuilding our economy in the aftermath of \nSeptember 11 as bricks and beams will be to rebuilding lower Manhattan.\n  But the private insurance market cannot at this time bear the full \nrisks of future attacks. As part of our defense against terrorism, and \nspecifically to maintain the strength of America's economy, our \ngovernment must share, at least temporarily, some of the risk \nassociated with damage from terrorist acts.\n  And that's what the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 does--by \nestablishing a temporary Federal program under which the government \nwould share the risk of future terrorist attacks with the insurance \nindustry for up to three years.\n  In order to protect the American taxpayer, federal cost-sharing would \nbecome available only if total losses from terrorist attacks exceed $10 \nbillion in the first year of the program. Insurers and policyholders \nwould retain responsibility for the initial $10 billion in losses. This \nindustry retention increases gradually throughout the life of the \nprogram.\n  For losses between $10 billion and $100 billion, the government would \nassume responsibility for 90 percent of the costs. Should losses top \n$100 billion, Congress would determine the appropriate mechanism for \nensuring payment.\n  For payments made by the federal government for insured losses during \nthe course of a year, the Treasury Secretary will recoup the difference \nbetween total industry costs and $10 billion. The recoupment will be \naccomplished through a surcharge on policyholders.\n  In order to insure that insurance consumers are both adequately \ninformed and able to take full advantage of this program, several key \nconsumer protections are included. Insurance companies are prohibited \nfrom discriminating amongst consumers in their offering of terrorism \ncoverage. This conference report, like the Senate-passed bill, requires \nthat insurers offer terrorism coverage in all of their property and \ncasualty policies during the first 2 years of the program.\n  Additionally, at the time that policies are offered, purchased, or \nrenewed, insurers must provide a clear and conspicuous disclosure of \nthe premiums charged for terrorism insurance. Insurance consumers may \nnot be charged for coverage that is not explicitly disclosed.\n  Lastly, nothing in this legislation prohibits state insurance \nregulators from retaining full authority to disapprove any rates or \nforms that violate state laws.\n  Simply put, our bill would ensure that the federal government would \nprovide a temporary backstop to bring stability to a part of the \neconomy that was seriously destabilized on September 11, 2001 against \nfuture terrorist attacks. This is the only way to bring full confidence \nback into the insurance markets that are so vital to our Nation's \noverall economic health.\n  This conference agreement is based on three important principles. \nFirst, it makes the American taxpayer the insurer of last resort. The \ninsurance industry maintains front-line responsibility to do what it \ndoes best: calculate risk, assess premiums, and pay claims to \npolicyholders.\n  Second, it promotes competition in the current insurance marketplace. \nCompetition is the best way to ensure that the private market assumes \nthe entire responsibility for insuring against the risk of terrorism, \nwithout any direct government role, as soon as possible.\n  Third, it ensures that all consumers and businesses can continue to \npurchase affordable coverage for terrorist acts.\n  Some say such a plan would be an unwarranted ``bailout'' of the \ninsurance industry. Far from it. Not only will this measure be \ntemporary, but any money the Federal Government spends through the \nprogram will go to victims of terrorism, not insurance companies. This \nconference report is needed to protect insurance consumers--consumers \nwho need and deserve the stability promoted by this conference report.\n  America will win this war on terrorism. But to do so, our economic \nfront must remain strong. Preserving the availability of terrorism \ninsurance will act as ``homeland defense'' for our economy.\n  We must remember, on September 11 the terrorists did not target just \nthe World Trade Center and Pentagon--they targeted our entire Nation. \nAnd we must have a national response. This conference report is part of \nthat response.\n  Madam President, I would like to particularly thank, of course, the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for his leadership \nand support.\n  I would also like to thank the President of the United States. We \nwould not be passing terrorism insurance were it not for the efforts of \nthe White House that weighed very significantly in trying to bring this \nbill to closure and fruition.\n  This bill has been around for a long time--since October of last \nyear. We have dealt at a number of levels with the physical security of \nour Nation since 9/11. But our Nation's security is complete without \ndealing with our economic security, and this terrorism insurance \nconference report is designed to do just that.\n  As a result of the efforts of Senator Sarbanes, of Senator Corzine, \nand of my colleague, Senator Schumer from\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\nNew York, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island as well as others who have \nworked on this legislation.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank Congressman Mike Oxley of Ohio, \nchairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and John Lafalce, \nthe ranking member for their efforts on this front as well.\n  I thank the Members who worked so diligently on this legislation. We \nspent a great deal of time on liability issues. In the end, we were \nable to strike a fair compromise. It is truly a bipartisan bill. It is \nbicameral in that both Chambers have been involved in the structure of \nthis language. At lot of hours were spent--until the wee hours of the \nmorning on one particular night until 5 a.m. working with the House and \nSenate staff to work out the differences and come to a final agreement \non a conference report.\n  I know there are those in the other Chamber and some here who would \nhave liked this bill to become the vehicle for tort reform. But the \nreality is we needed to deal with terrorism insurance and this \nlegislation does just that.\n  Again, I thank the President of the United States. I have been \ncritical of the President on numerous occasions. He deserves \ncommendation here. But for his efforts and his staff to pull this \ntogether, we would not be talking about a final product. I am very \ngrateful to him and to my colleagues and staff for their work.\n  I would like to particularly thank Alex Sternhell of my staff who \nworked tirelessly on this product for the past year to try to get us to \na point where we can pass terrorism insurance.\n  Again, I thank those who have contributed so much to this conference \nreport.\n  Senator Sarbanes, Chairman of the Banking Committee, has played an \ninvaluable role. Other conferees, Senators Schumer and Jack Reed, were \ncritical to reaching consensus on this important legislation. Senators \nCorzine, Clinton, and Ben Nelson also make important contributions.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of Senators Daschle \nand Reid, who tirelessly shepherded this bill through the legislative \nprocess. I would like to thank my colleagues in the House, Mike Oxley \nand John LaFalce.\n  Also, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Undersecretary Peter Fisher \nand other members of the Treasury Department--Pat Cave, Laura Cox, Ed \nDeMarco, Mario Ugoletti--who put in long hours in order to ensure that \nthe mechanics of the Federal backstop created in this conference report \nare sound.\n  And lastly, I would like to thank the staffs of the Senate and House \nwho played a critical role in this conference report:\n  Sarah Kline, Aaron Klein, Didem Nasanci, Polly Trottenberg of the \nSenate Banking Committee.\n  Terry Hains, Robert Gordon, Charles Symington, Michael Paese, and \nLawranne Stewart of The House Financial Services Committee.\n  I would also like to recognize two members of the Legislative \nCounsel's office Laura Ayoud and Paul Callen, who have performed their \nduties so capably and in a nonpartisan fashion that is so important to \nthe legislative process.\n  This conference report is about economic security. As important as \nour physical security is, our economic security is critically \nimportant. This conference report is an important piece of ensuring our \nnation's economic security. I look forward to the coming hours and days \nwhen the President will sign this bill into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I understand I have 15 minutes on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator also seek to speak on this bill?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, if I may respond, I will seek \nrecognition. I will be glad to wait until the Senator from Maryland \nconcludes. I do intend to seek recognition to speak on the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator allow us to use up the time that we \nhave on this bill--I have 15 minutes and Senator Dodd has 5 left--so we \ncan complete the consideration of that?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be agreeable to that. If I might propound a \nunanimous consent that, at the conclusion of the 20 minutes referred to \nby the Senator from Maryland, I be recognized for 20 minutes which I \nhave on homeland security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. And I thank my colleague from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, let me try to parcel out the time \nhere.\n  The Senator needs 3 minutes, as I understand it.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And the Senator from New Jersey needs 3 minutes. And \nthe Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. REED. Three minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is 9 minutes. And the Senator from Nebraska, 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes each to Senators \nSchumer, Corzine, Reed, and Nelson of Nebraska, and reserve the other 3 \nminutes for myself. And then Senator Dodd, I think, still has just \nunder 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will use my time at the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank my chairman of the Banking Committee for yielding. I want to \nmake a few brief points both on terrorism insurance and on homeland \nsecurity.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  First, on homeland security, briefly, I will vote for the bill. I \nthink it is a far-from-perfect measure. In fact, reorganizing the \nGovernment does not really do most of the job we need to do. It will \nnot make the computers at the INS put those on a terrorist watch list \non that list. It will not make the Coast Guard patrol out to 200 miles.\n  We are going to have to spend some dollars. And we are going to have \nto do some work within the agencies after we reorganize them.\n  So it is a first step. It is better than nothing, but I hope and pray \nthat this Nation will understand that if we just do this on homeland \nsecurity, and nothing else, we are woefully unprepared. When we come \nback in January, it ought to be our highest priority.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Madam President, on terrorism insurance, I, first, thank my \ncolleagues from Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island, \nNebraska, and everyone else who worked so long and hard on this \nlegislation. This is vital to our cities and our country.\n  Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of construction jobs not \nfilled because there is no terrorism insurance. There are billions of \ndollars worth of construction projects not being undertaken because we \ndo not have terrorism insurance. And there are higher costs for even \nthose who can get terrorism insurance, putting a large crimp in the \neconomy.\n  Right now, when our economy is swishy soft, this insurance bill is \nthe shot in the arm the economy needs. Thankfully, at this last hour, \nafter the perils-of-Pauline voyage that took over a year, this bill is \nabout to pass this Chamber, be put on the President's desk, and be \nsigned into law.\n  It comes none too soon because we desperately need it. We need to \nallow our companies to know that if, God forbid, there is a second \nterrorist incident--we hope and pray there isn't--the Government will \nbe there as a backup.\n  To some of the ideologues who have opposed this bill, I would suggest \nto them that the Government has always been behind insurance in times \nof war. We have always had that. And this new terrorism is a time of \nwar.\n  To those who say, well, let the market take over, we never did that \nunder huge and new circumstances out of the control of individuals, \nwithout any predictive ability. So insurance companies have no \nknowledge of what they face.\n  We are going to have to do more. We are going to have to deal with \nlife insurance. We are going to have to deal with workers' compensation \ninsurance. All of these things, in this brave, new\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\npost-9/11 world, need some Government help and Government involvement \nor the economy will come to a standstill.\n  So I want to say, thank God we passed this bill. My city and State, \nmany of the larger cities and States throughout the country, \ndesperately need it. We hope it will move to the President's desk \nquickly and be signed into law and remove a major roadblock on the path \nto recovery that this country needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President. Again, I thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland for his generous yielding of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank Chairman Sarbanes for yielding me \ntime. But also I thank and commend my colleagues who worked so \ndiligently on this important legislation: Senators Schumer, Corzine, \nand Nelson of Nebraska, and particularly Senator Dodd. Senator Dodd \nreally led the charge on this important effort, and together with his \nelectoral reform legislation, he has made major contributions in this \nsession. I commend him and thank him for his leadership.\n  This is a vitally important issue. After September 11, the reaction \nof the insurance industry to the potential of terrorist attack was \ncontraction coverage. Premiums went up, coverage has shrunk, and many \norganizations, particularly many properties, could not secure \ninsurance. That inhibited economic growth, and that inhibition \ncontinues to weigh on our economy.\n  This legislation, we hope, and I hope, will go a long way to start \nreviving activity, particularly construction activity and real estate \nactivity. But the effects of this legislation go beyond simply the \nproperty market and the real estate market.\n  One of the interesting aspects of the 9/11 attacks was the fact that \nworkers' compensation insurance was put at risk because, as you \nrealize, workers' compensation, under law, must cover practically all \ninjuries to workers. And if there is a terrorist event in a particular \nlocale, it is likely that hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of workers \ncould be injured. Those liabilities fall on very few companies. Without \nreinsurance, those companies cannot operate.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, there is one workers' compensation \ninsurance company which is actually a quasi-governmental entity. It is \nsupported by the State. If that company failed, literally the State of \nRhode Island would be on the hook to provide the resources to pay \nworkers' compensation claims. It would be a great blow to my State.\n  This legislation also provides help and reinsurance for workers' \ncompensation claims. So it is legislation whose effect, and beneficial \neffect, will go throughout our entire economy. It will help, I hope, to \nstimulate economic activity. And it certainly will give, I hope, \nbusiness men and women the confidence to, once again, undertake real \nestate projects, undertake economic activity, and do those things which \nare so essential for our continued economic prosperity.\n  Once again, this has been a long and arduous process. It has taken \nmonths. It has been the result of great effort and great diligence and \ngreat patience by my colleagues, again, particularly by Senator Dodd.\n  I am pleased we are passing it this evening. I hope the President \nwill sign it quickly. I hope we can get on to other legislation that \nwill assist our economy in a material way, in a positive way.\n  I thank the Senators, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I, too, want to speak to the terrorism \ninsurance legislation, but I also would like to make a brief comment \nwith regard to homeland security.\n  I will be voting to support the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security. Like many of my colleagues, this was a close call. \nUnfortunately, there were far too many adds to what was presented to us \nin this 484-page document, things that were really special interests, \nnot the people's interests. They have been enumerated with regard to \npharmaceuticals, colleges and universities, et cetera. It is \nunfortunate. And there are many details that are left out with regard \nto chemical plant security, nuclear powerplants, railroads, other \nissues that I think are vital.\n  Finally, we really have not dealt with the appropriations process to \nmake sure that our first responders, the people who really are fighting \nthe war on terrorism day to day have the resources to do their job. It \nis not even dealt with in this 484-page effort, and it is a serious \nshortcoming. It will move the ball down the field, but we are not where \nwe should be. We have a lot of work to do. It is unfortunate that we \nhave done it, in my view, in a halfhearted way here.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Madam President, with regard to terrorism insurance, this is about \nthe economy. It really is quite simple. This was never about the \ninsurance industry. This was about making sure that investments would \ngo forward in the construction, commercial real estate field. It was \nabout making sure there was not a tax on the consumer, on everything \nfrom whether you went to a football game, or any kind of process you \nneeded to have terrorism insurance to make sure that our economy is \nworking efficiently. This was missing since September 11. And it is \nabsolutely essential that we got to this compromise.\n  I cannot tell you, cannot tell my colleagues, how proud I am to have \nseen the tremendous work that both Senators Sarbanes and Dodd performed \nto try to get a compromise.\n  The holdup on this was never about the need to push forward to \nprotect our economy, to support our industry. This was about tort \nreform, issues that really were relevant to protecting the economic \nsecurity of the American people. Their tenacity, their effectiveness in \nnegotiating compromise has led to a great result. I can only say \ncongratulations to them, to the others who helped bring it about. The \nPresident was certainly at the forefront.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the terrorism insurance \nlegislation. I am very appreciative of the help of my senior \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                          Terrorism Insurance\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my esteemed colleague from Maryland \nfor the opportunity to rise today in strong support of the conference \nreport to S. 2600. I commend Senator Dodd and all those who have worked \nto bring this together after having passed it earlier. It is now a \ngreat opportunity for us to come back and pass it in its final form.\n  It is about the economy; it is not simply about insurance. The \neconomic impact of the events of September 11 have had a continuing \ndevastating impact on our commercial real estate market, mortgage \nlenders, the construction industry, the investment community, and other \nsegments of our economy. Many of these areas have yet to recover and do \nnot look for recovery for a long time.\n  Fundamentally, this is a jobs bill. It is just one small step \nCongress can take to help stimulate our weak economy by providing this \nFederal backstop--not a bailout--for catastrophic losses resulting from \nacts of terrorism in the future.\n  It is estimated that the property damage alone from the attack on the \nWorld Trade Center is about $50 billion. While the carriers involved in \nthis loss have indicated they could cover these losses while \nmaintaining their solvency, we can only speculate as to where and when \nthe next attack might come and the nature and extent of the damages. \nWithout this backup, all insurers providing this coverage, if they do \nprovide it, will only risk not being able to respond to the next loss.\n  The underlying premise of insurance is the ability of the insurer to \nassess the nature and the extent of the loss, applying actuarial \nprinciples, the historical approach to determine the likelihood of \nloss, and then calculating the premiums necessary to build reserves \nsufficient to cover that loss. Clearly, under these circumstances, \nwithout a historical perspective, there is no way for insurers to \nrealistically underwrite for the risk of terrorist attack.\n  Who among us knows where or when the next event might occur, what the \nnature of the attack might be, and\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nwhat type and extent of loss might be sustained? Will it be primarily \nproperty damage? Will it be massive loss of life in a concentrated area \nsuch as we had with the World Trade Center? Will it be a chemical or \nbiological agent released or will it be a dirty bomb? These are the \nquestions to which we don't know the answers.\n  The fact is, we cannot make those decisions without knowing what the \nopportunity will be for the next terrorist attack. We all hope there \nwon't be one, but insurance is against that kind of loss that you don't \nnecessarily expect but you anticipate could in fact happen. The long-\nterm effect on our industry would be devastating.\n  I hope we will all rise today in support of this important \nlegislation. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am pleased that we will shortly, I \nassume, be passing this legislation, although I understand we have to \ngo through a cloture vote prior to reaching the legislation itself. I \nwanted to underscore that this represents an extraordinary effort on \nthe part of many people. I particularly recognize the leadership my \nable colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, provided on this issue. \nWe have been working at this now for about a year. So it has been a \nlong time coming. It is fair to say that we would never have reached \nthis point without Senator Dodd's commitment to this issue and his \ntireless efforts with respect to this legislation.\n  I also thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle, who was \nconsistently trying to get terrorism insurance legislation, despite \nefforts by many to turn it into something over and above that.\n  Senators Schumer and Reed, our colleagues on the conference \ncommittee, made significant efforts to move the bill forward. And also \nSenator Corzine, although he wasn't on the conference committee, was \nvery closely involved in developing this legislation. Of course, \nChairman Oxley and Congressman LaFalce, our colleagues in the House, \nwere obviously instrumental in moving the legislation through the other \nbody.\n  I also want to take a moment to underscore the outstanding work done \nby staff on this legislation. We come to the floor and, of course, \nMembers are deeply involved. And I particularly underscore Senator \nDodd's efforts in this regard. But there are staff who back us all up.\n  I particularly want to recognize from the Banking Committee staff \nSarah Kline, Aaron Klein, and Alex Sternhell, who worked literally day \nand night on this matter. Also Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg and Steve \nKroll, and the staff of our conferees: Didem Nisanci from Senator \nReed's office, and Polly Trottenberg from Senator Schumer's office; and \nwhile he was not a conferee, Senator Corzine's staffer, Roger \nHollingsworth, also participated throughout.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work and the professionalism that \nour legislative counsels brought to this process: Laura Ayoud from the \nSenate legislative counsel's office, who is just an outstanding \nprofessional and renders great service to this body, and Paul Callen \nfrom the House legislative counsel's office. Laura Ayoud stayed up all \nnight working on this legislation. I simply want to underscore that.\n  We have had strong support for this legislation from the \nadministration. The President has indicated that he will sign it. The \nadministration was instrumental in dealing with some of the objections \nthat were actually raised more with respect to items that are not in \nthe legislation rather than items that are in it. In the course of \nthis, we have developed a piece of legislation which I believe will \naddress the challenge that confronts us.\n  We have had troubling reports about the availability of terrorism \ninsurance, and the impact of that upon the economy.\n  Since the tragic attacks of September 11th, many property and \ncasualty insurers are excluding coverage of losses from acts of \nterrorism from the policies they write. In those cases where terrorism \ninsurance is available, it is often unaffordable, and very limited in \nthe scope and amount of coverage. The Banking Committee explored this \nissue in two days of hearings shortly after the attacks, in which we \nheard from Treasury Secretary O'Neill, CEA Chairman R. Glenn Hubbard, \ninsurance regulators, business and insurance leaders, and outside \nexperts. The testimony of these witnesses helped to define the scope of \nthe problem in the insurance marketplace and to shape our thinking on \nthe appropriate solution.\n  The fact that so many properties are uninsured or underinsured \nagainst the risk of terrorism could have a negative effect on our \neconomy and our recovery if there were to be another terrorist attack. \nIn the event of another attack, many properties would have to absorb \nany loses themselves, without the support of insurance. As a result, \nthe GOA has observed, ``another terrorist attack similar to that \nexperienced on September 11th could have significant economic effects \non the marketplace and the public at large.''\n  But even in the absence of another attack, the lack of insurance can \nhinder economic activity. The GAO has found example of ``large projects \ncanceling or experiencing delays . . . with a lack of terrorism \ncoverage being cited as a principal contributing factor.''\n  Most industry observes are of the opinion that, given time, the \ninsurance industry will develop the capacity and the experience that \nwill allow them to underwrite the terrorist risk. However, those \nconditions do not appear to exist today. In the interim experts believe \nthat a Federal reinsurance backstop of limited duration would give the \ninsurance markets the necessary time to stabilize.\n  The conference report before us establishes a temporary, three-year \nbackstop under which the Federal Government will share the risk of loss \nfrom future terrorist attacks with the insurance industry. The program \nis triggered when the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with \nthe Secretary of State and the Attorney General, certifies that an \nevent meets the definition of an act of terrorism provided in the \nlegislation.\n  The Terrorism Insurance Program requires that insurers pay a share of \nlosses before Federal assistance becomes available. Each insure that \nsuffers losses in a terrorist attack will be responsible for paying out \na certain amount in claims--an insurer deductible--based on a \npercentage of that insurer's direct earned premiums from the previous \ncalendar year. Beyond their deductibles, insurance companies will \ncontinue to have `skin in the game,' as they will be liable for a \ncopayment for additional losses. For losses above an insurer's \ndeductible, the Federal government will cover 90 percent while the \ninsurer will pay 10 percent.\n  These provisions are intended to create partnership between insurers \nand the Federal Government in the event that losses occur. By requiring \ncompanies both to cover initial losses and to continue to share in \nadditional losses, this program provides the coverage and the certainty \nof the Federal backstop while also providing incentives to promote a \nhealthy private market. And while no system is perfect, the legislation \ngrants the Treasury Secretary certain powers, such as the ability to \naudit and inspect claims, that are necessary to protect the government \nagainst unscrupulous behavior. It is our intent that insurers do not \nalter their behavior in an attempt to procure more value from this \nprogram than they would otherwise receive from the course of their \nnatural business practices.\n  In addition to limiting the exposure of individual insurance \ncompanies, the legislation also includes certain mechanisms to limit \nthe exposure of the Federal Government, first by requiring the \ninsurance marketplace as a whole to absorb a prescribed amount of any \nterrorism losses--$10 billion for year 1; $12.5 billion for year 2; and \n$15 billion for year 3--and second, by capping total losses covered by \nthe program at $100 billion per year. Any Federal payments made before \nthe prescribed insurance marketplace retention is reached must be \nrecouped by the Secretary of the Treasury through a policyholder \nsurcharge.\n  One of the guiding principles of this bill is that, to the extent \npossible, state insurance law should not be overridden. To that end, \nthe bill respects\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nthe role of the state insurance commissioners as the appropriate \nregulators of policy terms and rates. Each state commissioner currently \nhas the responsibility to ensure that insurance rates are not \ninadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or excessive, and this legislation \ndoes not change that responsibility.\n  At the same time, in order to ensure that the Federal program will \nwork as intended, certain Federal requirements are needed to ensure \nthat consumers of terrorism insurance will benefit from this program.\n  For example, insurance companies will be prohibited from \ndiscriminating amongst their policyholders by picking and choosing \nwhich ones to cover for terrorism. The bill requires that insurance \ncompanies must offer terrorism coverage in all of their property and \ncasualty policies during the first two years of the program. The \nSecretary has discretion to extend their important requirement to the \nthird year of the program.\n  In addition, insurers must provide policyholders with clear and \nconspicuous disclosure of the premium charged for terrorism coverage \nand the existence of a sizeable Federal backstop. This disclosure is \nintended to enhance the competitiveness of the marketplace by allowing \nconsumers to comparison-shop for the best rate on terrorism insurance. \nIn addition, the disclosure is intended to make policyholders aware \nthat the Federal Government will be sharing the costs of terrorism \nlosses with their insurers, to help the policyholders assess the \nappropriateness of the premium being offered.\n  Moreover, the bill ensures that the State regulators and the Federal \nGovernment will have access to the information needed to assess the \nimpact of this program on insurance consumers. The Secretary is \nrequired to compile annually information on the terrorism risk premiums \nbeing charged by insurers].\n  This is a limited bill in duration. Of course, the objective is that \nby the end of that time, the insurance market will have come fully back \ninto play and that these matters can be dealt with in a more \ntraditional way.\n  But as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out frequently, as we \nhave addressed the issue over the course of this last year, we face \nextraordinary circumstances created by the risk of terrorism. This \nlegislation represents a reasonable and rational response to this \nchallenge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I have 2 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me again thank my colleagues for their \nwork. I mentioned Mike Oxley of Ohio, chairman of the House Banking \nCommittee, and John LaFalce. John LaFalce and I were elected to \nCongress together back in the 1970s. He has made a decision to retire \nfrom his service in the Congress. I thank him for a remarkable record \nof public service over the more than 2\\1/2\\ decades.\n  I also thank some of the White House staff in addition to our own \nstaff here. I include all the names in the remarks I have already \nsubmitted. I want to thank Nick Calio and Matt Kirk of the White House \nlegislative operations. I commend them for their efforts.\n  They helped to broker this final agreement. You need to have people \nat the executive branch who are willing to try to put pieces together. \nThey are two very professional staff people. The President is fortunate \nto have them working with him. I know that in the process of doing so, \nthey disappointed some. I know how they strongly agreed with some of \nthe people they disappointed on substantive matters but believe they \nare serving their President and the country well in coming to a final \nconclusion that is fair to all. I thank them for their professionalism \nand straightforwardness in dealing with these difficult matters.\n  I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Lott for their leadership as \nwell. Both leaders have done a very fine job.\n  Mark Childress of Senator Daschle's staff was tremendously helpful on \nthis legislation. Senator Sarbanes is absolutely correct that we don't \noften give those staff members who put in countless hours on matters \nlike this the credit they deserve. But were it not for Mark and Senator \nDaschle's other staff members working with Alex Sternhell of my office, \nand Senator Sarbanes' staff, we would not have been able to achieve \nthis result.\n  This conference report is about economic security. As important as \nour physical security is, our economic security is critically \nimportant. This conference report is an important piece of ensuring our \nnation's economic security. I look forward to the coming hours and days \nwhen the President will sign this bill into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the legislation on homeland security, which I believe the Senate \nis about to pass. It has been accurately characterized as historic \nlegislation. It reorganizes the Government of the United States of \nAmerica to meet the threat of terrorism.\n  On September 11, 2001, this country sustained a devastating loss, a \nloss deeply emblazoned on the minds of all Americans. With the attacks \non the World Trade Center, the attack on the Pentagon, and the plane \nthat went down in Somerset County, PA, it was obvious that we faced a \nvery extraordinary threat.\n  We should have taken action against al-Qaida long before September \n11. There were many warning signals available. Osama bin Laden was well \nknown for his jihad against the West, against our values, against our \ncivilization. Osama bin Laden was indicted for killing Americans in \nMogadishu in 1993. Osama bin Laden was indicted for blowing up the U.S. \nembassies in Africa in 1998. He was known to have been involved with \nal-Qaida and the terrorism against the destroyer Cole, and he had made \nhis announcement of his worldwide jihad.\n  But the United States has historically been reluctant to take \npreemptive action. We did little in responding to the attacks on the \nembassies of August 20, 1998. When we sent a missile to Afghanistan, it \nwent to an empty factory. When we put a missile in a factory in the \nSudan, it may or may not have been a factory with chemical weapons. But \nthen, with the events of 9/11, it became apparent that we had to \nrespond, and we had to respond very dramatically and emphatically.\n  Senator Lieberman and I introduced legislation on October 11, 2001--\nexactly 1 month after the 9/11 attack. It was apparent to many of us at \nthat time that we needed to have an office of homeland defense and a \nSecretary with power to deal with the many agencies that would be \ninvolved. First and foremost among those agencies, in my view, was the \ncoordination of activities among our intelligence agencies.\n  When I was chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress, I introduced legislation in 1996 to bring all of the \nintelligence agencies under one umbrella, under the Director of Central \nIntelligence. That had been the spot that was supposed to coordinate \nall of the intelligence activities.\n  But the fact of the matter was that the Director of the CIA did not \nhave that authority because there were too many independent agencies--\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the \ncounterintelligence of the FBI, intelligence units in the State \nDepartment, and intelligence units spread throughout the Government--\nand there were fierce battles on turf, and the coordination was not \nundertaken.\n  As a result of not having all of the intelligence agencies under one \numbrella, the United States paid a very heavy price. It is my view that \nhad all of the dots been on the board, had there been coordination at \nall of these intelligence agencies under one umbrella, we might well \nhave prevented September 11.\n  After the fact, we learned that in July there was a very important \nFBI report coming out of Phoenix, AZ, about a suspicious man taking \nflight training, and he had a big picture of Osama bin Laden in his \nliving quarters. That memorandum was buried somewhere in the FBI \nheadquarters. We found out after the fact that the CIA had information \non two al-Qaida agents at Kuala Lumpur. The CIA did not tell the FBI or \nthe Immigration\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nand Naturalization Service that those agents came into the United \nStates, and they were two of the suicide bombers on 9/11.\n  There was information about a man named Zacarias Moussaoui. The FBI \nfield office in Minneapolis made an effort to get a warrant under the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. They never got the warrant. They \nwere using the wrong standard. They were using a standard of probable \ncause of 51 percent. The FBI agent testified that the U.S. attorney in \nMinneapolis thought he had to have a 75- to 80-percent probability.\n  The fact is that, under the law, Gates v. Illinois, an opinion by \nJustice Rehnquist--now the Chief Justice, then an Associate Justice on \nthe Court--says that probable cause is judged by the totality of the \ncircumstances and suspicion, and had the warrant been obtained under \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the computer of Zacarias \nMoussaoui was a virtual treasure trove of information.\n  Then a man named Murad, a Pakistani, a member of al-Qaida, gave a \nstatement in 1995 that al-Qaida had plans in 1995 to load explosives on \nan airplane and fly them into the White House or into the CIA. Then you \nhad the experience with the trade towers themselves, attacked in 1993 \nby al-Qaida's agents. They had made an effort to blow up one of the \ntowers to try to topple into the other tower to destroy them both. It \nwas known that they were very unhappy about their failure.\n  So the risks were present, but there was not coordination. We didn't \nbring all of those dots onto one screen. When FBI Director Mueller \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee in early June, I asked him \nabout all of these facts and concluded that there was a veritable \nblueprint had all of these dots been put together. That is what we have \nan opportunity to do now with homeland security, under the direction of \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I had submitted an amendment, which would have given the Secretary \ngreater authority than is present in the existing bill. The Secretary \nof Homeland Defense, under the existing legislation, may request that \nthe agencies coordinate, but the Secretary does not have the authority \nto direct, and I believe that is a significant failing in this bill.\n  When the House of Representatives passed a homeland security bill \nlast Wednesday and, in effect, left town, sending a bill to the Senate, \nit was pretty much a matter of take it or leave it. If I had pressed my \namendment to do what I thought was a very important improvement, to \ngive the Secretary authority to direct all of these agencies, the bill \nwould have had to go back to conference, and the Members of the House \nof Representatives had dispersed. They are present only in pro forma \nsession. They can take some technical amendments without reconvening, \nbut to press a substantive amendment would have sent the matter back \nfor a conference, and it would have delayed the matter perhaps as long \nas April of next year.\n\n  I had a long discussion on this matter with homeland security \nadviser, former Governor Tom Ridge, and pressed the point. Then I \ndiscussed the matter with Vice President Cheney and sought some sort of \na commitment that the administration would look favorably upon this \nkind of an amendment when we reconvened. The Vice President said he \ncould not speak for the President. I talked to President Bush, who \nurged me not to press the amendment, and I told him I would not because \nI did not want to tie up the bill. I did not want to put on a \nsubstantive amendment that would have required a conference.\n  Early in the 108th Congress, I will refile that amendment to give the \nSecretary of Homeland Security the authority to direct these agencies \nbecause I am still concerned about their turf battles. Turf battles in \nWashington, DC are endemic and epidemic. It is too serious a matter to \nengage in turf battles any longer. Now is the time where we have to use \nall of our resources to prevent another attack.\n  We have made very significant advances on a number of lines--on the \nBorder Patrol, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. We put up $3 \nbillion last year on serums to deal with smallpox and anthrax, such as \nCipro. That came through the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human \nServices, and Education. Senator Harkin, then the chairman, and I, \nranking member, took the lead in putting up that money. All of these \nprecautions in building up the hospital infrastructure and giving \nassistance to the fire departments is vital. Having coordination with \nFederal, State, and local authorities is vital, but if we have to \nrespond to an attack, if we do not prevent an attack, then we will be \nin very bad shape. That is why I do believe our efforts have to be \ndirected to preventing another attack.\n  I discussed also with the administration, with Governor Ridge, Vice \nPresident Cheney, and President Bush the labor-management relations \nissue. I believe we could have worked out an accommodation which would \nhave been satisfactory to all parties.\n  When we had the amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nNelson, cosponsored by Senator Chafee and Senator Breaux, there was \ninitial confusion as to whether the two paragraphs of the Breaux \namendment, which incorporated the so-called Morella amendment from the \nHouse bill, was in place of, substituted for, or in addition to.\n  In a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, we \nestablished the amendment was in addition to and did not remove the \nPresident's national security authority to take steps if national \nsecurity was endangered. That model could have been applied to the \nother five chapters on flexibility.\n  The Subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education will \nschedule hearings promptly when we reconvene the 108th Congress to go \ninto these issues, to have a thorough airing, have people from the \nOffice of Personnel Management come in and explain what they need; to \nhave labor representatives come in and explain what they have in mind, \nin order to work out an accommodation which is satisfactory for all \nparties to maintain a high level of morale.\n  We also have to be concerned about provisions in this bill which \ncould have the effect of trampling on civil liberties \nand constitutional rights. There is no doubt about the danger posed by \nal-Qaida, but there is similarly no doubt that we cannot give up our \ncivil liberties and our constitutional rights in our efforts to combat \nal-Qaida. If we do that, if we give up our civil liberties, al-Qaida \nwould have, in effect, won.\n\n  There is an ongoing responsibility for oversight, and that \nresponsibility will fall on the shoulders of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee to see to it that the detention \nof aliens is based upon some reason; to see to it that if American \ncitizens are tried in a military court that there is an observance of \nconstitutional rights. There is grave concern in America that we be \nprotected from another terrorist attack, but there is also grave \nconcern that we be careful in the preservation of our civil liberties.\n  Madam President, how much of my 20 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes and 26 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I notice the Senator from Connecticut \nhas come to the Chamber. In his absence, I had commented that the \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I, had introduced \nhomeland security back on October 11, 2001.\n  There was resistance in many quarters to having a Department of \nHomeland Security. Governor Ridge, at that time, and I had discussed \nthe matter. I have worked very closely with Tom Ridge for many years--\n12 years in the Congress and two terms as Pennsylvania's distinguished \nGovernor. Governor Ridge said he was sure the people would not say no \nto the President; he could walk down the hall, and he could solve the \nproblems.\n  I had a view, having been chairman of the Intelligence Committee and \nknowing what goes on in the CIA, that it was not going to be that easy; \nthat the man in charge of homeland security really needed some muscle.\n  Having worked on the Judiciary Committee chairing the oversight \ncommittee on the FBI, I knew the problems there. I knew the turf \nbattles, and I thought the adviser in charge of homeland security \nneeded some muscle.\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\n  Senator Lieberman and I constructed that bill, when we had hearings. \nWe reintroduced an updated version last May, and it has had a number of \ndevelopments. I do believe it is going to be necessary to revisit some \nprovisions. I mentioned two--the authority of the Secretary to direct \nthe intelligence agencies to consolidate under one umbrella, and a \nrefinement of some of the provisions on labor-management relations.\n  Then the House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday and sent \nit to the Senate on Thursday. Senator Lieberman offered an amendment to \nstrike which was voted upon earlier today.\n  I agreed with a great deal of what Senator Lieberman had to say. I \nfelt it necessary to vote against Senator Lieberman's amendment because \nthat would have called for a conference, the appointment of conferees, \nand great delay. It could have been delayed until April.\n  We have been asked a lot of questions about this. Yesterday in \nPennsylvania in a number of meetings, a number of people asked me about \nit. I told them about the old statement: You never want to see \nlegislation or sausage made. If you saw what the House of \nRepresentatives did, the bill they sent over here and some of its \nprovisions gave sausage a bad name. But we are going to work through \nit. We are going to pass the bill.\n  It is not unusual for the Congress, for the Senate to be confronted \nwith a bill which has a lot of clunkers, which has a lot of problems, a \nlot of major disadvantages. Then we have to make a public policy \ndetermination as to whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\n  In my judgment, it is not even a close call at this point. We have to \nhave a Department of Homeland Security to protect America.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Connecticut. I compliment the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, for the tremendous job he has \ndone on the bill, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and his swan \nsong. It is a tough legislative battle, but before the stroke of \nmidnight, I believe we will have moved ahead. I am told by the White \nHouse that the President intends to sign this bill early next week. He \nis not going to let any grass grow under anybody's feet. We are going \nto do our best to protect America and try to prevent another terrorist \nattack.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11405-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11405-S11511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nSenate\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n\n                             The safety act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to thank the Republican \nLeader for his willingness to address concerns raised by me and our \ncolleagues from Maine regarding certain provisions in H.R. 5005, the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002.\n  In the interests of clarity, I wanted to discuss one aspect of the \nSupport Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act \nof 2002, which is included in H.R. 5005. The SAFETY Act provides that \nthe ``government contractor defense'' will be available to certain \nsellers of anti-terrorism technology. In Boyle v. United Technologies \nCorp., 487 U.S. 500, 108 S. Ct. 2510 (1988), the U.S. Supreme Court \nrecognized that the government contractor defense offers relief to \ncertain defendants from liability for design defects. It is my \nunderstanding that the drafters of the SAFETY Act were aware of the \nBoyle decision and intended for the government contractor defense to \napply solely to design defect claims, rather than offering blanket \nrelief to any and all causes of action.\n  Mr. LOTT. I concur with the Senator from Rhode Island. It is clear \nthat the government contractor defense contained in the SAFETY Act \ncould be raised only in response to design defect claims.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Republican Leader, and look forward to the \nopportunity to correct three other provisions of the Homeland Security \nAct when the 108th Congress convenes in January.\n\n\n                            First Responders\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I would like to speak about a very \nimportant first responder matter which, I hope, the Senate will include \nin the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\n  By definition, emergency management usually occurs in crisis. The \nincident managers must assess the emergency, organize the staff, and \ndirect their responses under very difficult conditions. Currently, \nhowever, many first responders are not fully prepared for attacks like \nSeptember 11, 2001.NOTICE\n\nIf the 107th Congress, 2d Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 22, 2002, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 107th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 16, 2002, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 13. The final issue will be dated Monday, December \n16, 2002, and will be delivered on Tuesday, December 17, 2002.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \neither on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \nthe Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at http://clerkhouse.house.gov.

It is also designed to \nimprove the Federal Government's response to terrorist attacks and \nother major disasters.\n  To date, however, most of the homeland security training and \nconsulting contracts have been awarded to Fortune 500 companies. \nPostsecondary educational institutions have been left out of the \nprocess. It is essential that our country's colleges and universities \nalso collaborate on the design of homeland defense-integrated emergency \nmanagement and training systems. Demonstration programs should train \nfirst responders to use new technologies that would reduce the \ndevastations from terrorist attacks. They can integrate these \ntechnologies into management procedures that will improve \naccountability, command, and control. The results of those \ndemonstration programs could then be disseminated nationwide.\n  Am I correct to assume that funding for colleges and universities to \ndevelop homeland defense-integrated emergency management and training \nsystems could be provided through provisions in the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will request that the new Secretary of the Homeland \nSecurity Department give attention to the concerns about emergency \nmanagement raised by the Senator from Minnesota, and I hope that \nhomeland defense-integrated emergency management and training systems \nwill be given due consideration for funding through grants from the \nextramural programs.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator for his consideration and support.\n\n\n                  Background Checks for Truck Drivers\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, last November, Congress included a \nprovision in section 1012 of the USA Patriot Act, P.L. 107-56, which \nrequires all commercial truck drivers who haul hazardous materials to \nundergo a background records check before receiving or renewing their \nCommercial Driver's License, CDL, endorsement to haul hazmat. \nUnfortunately, over a year has passed and regulations to promulgate \nthis requirement have not been issued.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I want to associate myself with the concerns raised by \nmy colleague. This is a very important issue to both of us. In fact, we \nworked together in a bipartisan fashion on S. 1750, the Hazmat \nEndorsements Requirements Act, which would clarify existing law and \nguide the process for administering the checks. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee approved S. 1750 in April without objection. However, the \nSenate has not taken up this legislation, nor has the Department of \nTransportation issued a rulemaking to implement Section 1012.\n  Last week, we took an important step forward in addressing Port and \nMaritime Security when we passed S. 1214. That important measure \nincludes requirements for background records checks for many port \nworkers, and clarifies that if a driver holds a valid CDL with a \nhazardous materials endorsement obtained after a background records \ncheck, the driver would not need to have a duplicative check to access \nsecure port areas. Unfortunately these checks are not being performed \nand it is unlikely that will change until the DOT issues a rule or the \nCongress approves legislation to address concerns regarding the hazmat \nendorsement background records check requirements enacted last year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. We have not fully addressed the issue of \nbackground checks for commercial drivers and more work remains.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I hope we can continue our bipartisan work on this \nimportant issue early next year to ensure the requirements in the USA \nPatriot Act will be carried out and that truck drivers are afforded a \nright to a formal appeals process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree that the issue must be addressed. In the absence \nof any regulatory action by DOT, I will certainly want to continue our \njoint efforts to provide the appropriate guidance to DOT and the states \non this important security matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleague and look forward to working with \nhim on this issue during the next Congress.\n\n\n                        AGRICULTURAL PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I want to enter into a colloquy \nwith the ranking minority member of the Committee, Senator Lugar, \nregarding the agricultural provisions in the compromise homeland \nsecurity legislation.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am pleased to join with my colleague to discuss some of \nthe agricultural provisions in this legislation. A provision in Section \n421 dealing with the transfer of certain agricultural inspections from \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture--USDA--to the new Department of \nHomeland Security--DHS--needs clarification. This section requires that \nUSDA and DHS enter into a transfer agreement and stipulates that the \nagreement shall address USDA supervision of training of employees who \nwill be carrying out agricultural inspection functions at the new DHS \nand the transfer of funds from USDA to the new DHS. We want to make \nclear that we expect that the transfer agreement shall include these \ncomponents and that USDA will be responsible for agricultural \ninspection training and that appropriate funds would be transferred \nfrom USDA to the new DHS.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with your interpretation of that provision. I \nalso want to provide additional explanation about a section that \noriginated from our mutual concern about the safety of food that enters \nour country. Like you, I have been concerned that agencies that inspect \nfoods and food products that come through our borders do not have the \nability to share information in order to jointly track shipment and \nother crucial information. As a result, we crafted a provision, now \nincluded in this legislation, to ensure that information systems--i.e., \ncomputers--will be coordinated across agencies with border security \nresponsibilities. This includes agencies that will be housed in the new \nDHS as well as those like the Food and Drug Administration and the Food \nSafety Inspection Service--that will not, but have a homeland security \nfunction.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is an important provision in this legislation. I also \nwant to clarify a provision related to the transfer of the Plum Island \nAnimal Disease Center from USDA to the new DHS. Due to a technical \nerror, there appears to be a contradiction between Section 303(3) and \nSection 310 of the House passed bill. The intent of this bill is to \ntransfer the assets and liabilities of this center, which is now part \nof USDA, but not the USDA personnel or functions. While I am fairly \nconfident this technical error will yet be rectified, in implementing \nthis new law, I would expect that the language in Section 310 would \ngovern.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you for that clarification. Finally, we are aware \nthat the Chairman and ranking minority member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, during consideration of this legislation in the House, \nentered into the Record their understanding of how these agricultural \nprovisions would be implemented. While I question whether or not it is \nnecessary to transfer Plum Island to the new DHS at this time, I concur \nwith the House's interpretation of the provisions that are included.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I also concur with their interpretation which follows and \nwould expect that these agricultural provisions be carried out \nconsistent with this description. I ask unanimous consent it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sec. 310. Transfer of Plum Island Animal Disease Center, \n     Department of Agriculture. Transfers the Plum Island Animal \n     Disease Center from the Department of Agriculture to the \n     Department of Homeland Security and requires the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the Secretary of Homeland Security, upon \n     completion of the transfer, to enter into an agreement \n     providing for continued access by USDA for research, \n     diagnostic and other programs.\n       The Committee recognizes the critical importance of the \n     Plum Island Animal Disease Center to the safety and security \n     of animal agriculture in the United States. The Committee \n     expects that the transfer of this foreign animal disease \n     facility to the new DHS shall be completed in a manner that \n     minimizes any disruption of agricultural research, diagnostic \n     or other USDA activities. Likewise, the Committee expects \n     that funds that have and continue to be appropriated for the \n     maintenance, upgrade, or replacement of agricultural \n     research, diagnostic and\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\n     training facilities at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center \n     shall continue to be expended for those purposes.\n       The Committee shares the goal of expanding the capabilities \n     of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Likewise, the \n     Committee supports the accompanying goal of building agro-\n     terrorism prevention capabilities within the new DHS. With \n     this in mind, the Committee fully expects that in the absence \n     of alternative facilities for current USDA activities, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall make every possible \n     effort to expand and enhance agricultural activities related \n     to foreign animal diseases at the Plum Island Animal Disease \n     Center.\n       Sec. 421. Transfer of Certain Agricultural Inspection \n     Functions of the Department of Agriculture.\n       (a) Transfers to the Secretary of Homeland Security the \n     functions of the Secretary of Agriculture relating to \n     agricultural import and entry inspection activities.\n       The Committee is aware that the Agricultural Quarantine and \n     Inspection Program of the Department of Agriculture's Animal \n     and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) conducts numerous \n     activities with respect to both domestic and international \n     commerce in order to protect the health of agriculturally \n     important animals and plants within the United States. Within \n     the new DHS will be created a mission area of Border and \n     Transportation Security. In order that the new streamlined \n     border security program operates efficiently, the Committee \n     has transferred to the new DHS the responsibility for certain \n     agricultural import and entry inspection activities of the \n     USDA conducted at points of entry. This transfer will include \n     the inspection of arriving passengers, luggage, cargo and \n     means of conveyance into the United States to the Under \n     Secretary for Border and Transportation Security. In addition \n     to inspection at points of entry into the United States, \n     responsibility for inspections of passengers, luggage and \n     their means of conveyance, at points of departure outside the \n     United States, where agreements exist for such purposes, \n     shall be the responsibility of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security. The provision allows the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security to exercise authorities related to import and entry \n     inspection functions transferred including conducting \n     warrantless inspections at the border, collecting samples, \n     holding and seizing articles that are imported into the \n     United States in violation of applicable laws and \n     regulations, and assessing and collecting civil penalties at \n     the border. The Committee intends that USDA will retain the \n     responsibility for all other activities of the Agricultural \n     Quarantine and Inspection Program regarding imports including \n     pre-clearance of commodities, trade protocol verification \n     activities, fumigation activities, quarantine, diagnosis, \n     eradication and indemnification, as well as other sanitary \n     and phytosanitary measures. All functions regarding exports, \n     interstate and intrastate activities will remain at USDA.\n       (b) Delineates the laws governing agricultural import and \n     entry inspection activities that are covered by the transfer \n     of authorities.\n       The Committee is aware that the authority to inspect \n     passengers, cargo, and their means of conveyance coming into \n     the United States is derived from numerous statutes that date \n     back, in some cases, more than 100 years. The Committee does \n     not intend that the reference to these statutes should be \n     construed to provide any authority to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security beyond the responsibility to carry out \n     inspections (including pre-clearance inspections of \n     passengers, luggage and their means of conveyance in such \n     countries where agreements exist for such purposes) and \n     enforce the regulations of USDA at points of entry into the \n     United States.\n       (c) Excludes quarantine activities from the term \n     ``functions'' as defined by this Act for the purposes of this \n     section.\n       While agricultural inspection functions, as well as those \n     related administrative and enforcement functions, shall be \n     transferred and become the responsibility of the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, the legislation retains all functions \n     related to quarantine activities and quarantine facilities \n     within USDA. Although the Committee has excluded quarantine \n     activities from those functions transferred to the new DHS, \n     the Committee does not intend to preclude the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security from taking actions related to inspection \n     functions, such as seizure or holding of plant or animal \n     materials entering the United States. These authorities fall \n     within the purview of inspection related enforcement \n     functions that shall be transferred to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security.\n       (d) Requires that the authority transferred to the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall be exercised in \n     accordance with the regulations, policies and procedures \n     issued by the Secretary of Agriculture; requires the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate with the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security whenever the Secretary of Agriculture \n     prescribes regulations, policies, or procedures for \n     administering the covered laws related to the functions \n     transferred under subsection (a); provides that the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, may issue guidelines and directives to ensure \n     the effective use of personnel of the Department of Homeland \n     Security to carry out the transferred functions.\n       One intention of this legislation is to create a \n     streamlined Border and Transportation Security program at \n     points of entry into the United States. With regard to the \n     protection of animal and plant health, the Committee does not \n     intend or expect the new DHS to make the determination of \n     what animals, plants, animal or plant products, soils, or \n     other biological materials present an unacceptable risk to \n     the agriculture of the United States. Policies and procedures \n     regarding actions necessary to detect and prevent such \n     unacceptable risks shall remain the responsibility of the \n     Secretary of Agriculture. Likewise, policies and regulations \n     defining restrictions on movement into the United States of \n     substances that would pose a threat to agriculture \n     shall continue to be the responsibility of the Secretary \n     of Agriculture.\n       The Committee has provided authority for the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to issue directives and guidelines in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture in order to \n     efficiently manage inspection resources. When exercising this \n     authority, the Committee expects that the agricultural \n     inspection function at points of entry into the United States \n     shall not be diminished, and as a result, the Committee \n     expects that Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that \n     necessary resources are dedicated to carrying out the \n     agricultural inspection functions transferred from the \n     Department of Agriculture.\n       (e) Requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security to enter into an agreement to effectuate \n     the transfer of functions. The agreement must address the \n     training of employees and the transfer of funds. In addition, \n     the agreement may include authority for the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to perform functions delegated to APHIS for \n     the protection of domestic livestock and plants, as well as \n     authority for the Secretary of Agriculture to use employees \n     of the new DHS to carry out APHIS functions.\n       The Committee is aware of the unique nature and the \n     specialized training necessary for effective and efficient \n     border inspection activities carried out by the Agricultural \n     Quarantine and Inspection Program. The Committee expects that \n     the training of personnel and detector dogs for this highly \n     specialized function will continue to be supervised by the \n     Department of Agriculture. While a large proportion of the \n     personnel employed by the Agricultural Quarantine and \n     Inspection Program is permanently stationed at one of 186 \n     points of entry into the United States, the Committee is \n     aware that the Secretary of Agriculture commonly redeploys up \n     to 20% of the border inspection force in order to manage \n     agricultural pests and diseases throughout the United States. \n     In completing the transfer of Agricultural Quarantine and \n     Inspection Program border inspectors to the DHS, the \n     Committee expects that the Secretary of Agriculture and the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security will enter into an agreement \n     whereby inspection resources, where possible, would continue \n     to be made available to the Secretary of Agriculture in \n     response to domestic agricultural needs.\n       (f) Provides that the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     transfer funds collected by fee authorities to the Department \n     of Homeland Security so long as the funds do not exceed the \n     proportion of the costs incurred by the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security in carrying out activities funded by such fees.\n       Beginning in fiscal year 2003, the unobligated balance of \n     the Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Fund will be \n     transferred to other accounts within USDA and will be used to \n     carry out import and domestic inspection activities, as well \n     as animal and plant health quarantine activities, without \n     additional appropriations. Fees for inspection services shall \n     continue to be collected and deposited into these accounts in \n     the manner prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary \n     of Agriculture. In effectuating the transfer of agricultural \n     import inspection activities at points of entry into the \n     United States, the Committee intends that funds from these \n     accounts shall be transferred to the DHS in order to \n     reimburse the DHS for the actual inspections carried out by \n     the Department. The Committee expects that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall continue to manage these accounts in a \n     manner that ensures the availability of funds necessary to \n     carry out domestic inspection and quarantine programs.\n       (g) Provides that during the transition period, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall transfer to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security up to 3,200 full-time equivalent positions \n     of the Department of Agriculture.\n       (h) Makes conforming amendments to Title V of the \n     Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000 related to the \n     protection of inspection animals.\n\n\n                  federal alcohol and tobacco statutes\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is clear that the Secretary of the \nTreasury presently possesses the authority to administer the Federal \nalcohol and tobacco statutes referenced in the bill before us. These \nauthorities currently are delegated to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms and now will be delegated to the new Tax and Trade Bureau. \nI appreciate this colloquy to confirm that the language in section \n1111(c) (1) concerning the transfer to the Department of Justice not \nonly excludes the authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nthat will be retained within the Department of the Treasury as set \nforth in paragraph (2) of this section, but also excludes the functions \nof the Secretary of the Treasury that relate to these retained \nauthorities, functions, personnel, and assets.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I also wanted to confirm that section 1111(b) as it \nrelates to alcohol and tobacco only invests the Bureau of Alcohol \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives at the Department of Justice with the \nresponsibility to investigate with respect to the Title 18 laws \npertaining to the smuggling of alcohol and tobacco. All other \ninvestigatory responsibilities pertaining to alcohol and tobacco remain \nat the Department of the Treasury under the new Tax and Trade Bureau, \nor as otherwise delegated under existing law.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct and his reading is consistent with \nthe provisions of this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Finally, I wish to confirm that Treasury retained the \nauthority to audit or investigate violations such as false or \ninaccurate records of production, false or inaccurate tax returns, \nfailure to respond to delinquency notices, unlawful transfers in bond, \nand the unlawful production, labeling, advertising and marketing of \nalcoholic beverages.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct, and I appreciate my good friend from \nIowa for clarifying these points.\n\n\n               Preserving Coast Guard Mission Performance\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to thank the chairman of \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, the Senator from Connecticut, for his \ntireless efforts and leadership concerning the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Our country is facing a range of \nthreats that we must address--from port and airport security to cyber \nterrorism. We need funding for a new organizational structure to reduce \nthese risks.\n  I also would like to engage in a colloquy with the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Appropriations, the Senior Senator from Alaska, \nregarding the Coast Guard. The men and women of our Coast Guard make \nsignificant contributions to our nation each and every day, and they \ndeserve our support and admiration.\n  Last week, our colleague from Alaska addressed an important section \nin this legislation, Section 888, which governs the Coast Guard's role \nin the new Department of Homeland Security. His statement clearly \nestablished that it is the intent of this provision that the Coast \nGuard's non-homeland security missions and capabilities must be \nmaintained without significant reduction when the Service transfers to \nthe new Department.\n  As the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee and \nas a Senator from a coastal state, I emphatically agree with my Alaska \ncolleague's remarks about the intent and effect of Section 888. I also \nwould like to ask him some questions about the Coast Guard and its role \nin the Homeland Security Department.\n  Does my colleague from Alaska agree that the United States Coast \nGuard is integral to the security of this country, and that the Coast \nGuard provides a wide range of services to our nation? Does he also \nrecognize that some of these services are related to homeland security \nwhile others are not? For instance, the Coast Guard provides vital \nservices in the areas of marine safety, search and rescue, aids to \nnavigation, fisheries enforcement, marine environmental protection, and \nice operations. While these traditional missions do not directly \ncontribute to national security, they do ensure the safety of our \ncitizens and our environment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I firmly agree with my colleague from Washington about \nboth the Coast Guard's role in securing our nation and the importance \nof its non-homeland security missions and capabilities.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, does the Senator from Alaska believe \nthat it is imperative that these essential non-homeland security \nmissions be maintained, and that the language in the bill clearly \nidentifies the need to protect these critical services?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I strongly agree with this imperative and with my \ncolleague's interpretation of Section 888. Indeed, Section 888 mandates \nthis protection.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, as the Senator from Alaska has \npreviously indicated, the essential non-homeland security missions are \nto be protected pursuant to Section 888. It is also my understanding \nthat the Coast Guard organizational structure shall be maintained. To \nensure that we achieve our objectives, the Inspector General of the \nDepartment shall conduct an annual review to assess the Coast Guard \nperformance of all its missions, with a particular emphasis on \nexamining the non-homeland security missions. Is this the understanding \nof the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I share my colleague's understandings on these matters.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, does the Senator from Alaska agree that \nany significant changes to the authorities, functions, missions and \ncapabilities of the Coast Guard can be implemented only if they are \nspecified in subsequent legislation? And to that end, does he believe \nthe language contained in the bill will serve to protect the non-\nhomeland security missions of the Coast Guard while moving the \norganization into an important homeland security role?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do agree. Section 888 is a clear statement that \nCongress will play a major role in deciding whether there would be any \nsignificant changes to the Coast Guard in these areas. The language \nalso preserves the Service's non-homeland security missions while \npermitting it to perform important homeland security missions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe Senator from Alaska is aware that, as part of the fiscal year \nTransportation Appropriations bill reported unanimously in July, the \nCommittee mandated that the Coast Guard submit quarterly mission hour \nreports detailing precisely how the Coast Guard has allocated its human \nand capital resources by mission for the preceding quarter.\n  The Committee also granted the Commandant unprecedented budget \nflexibility with the dramatically increased funds provided above the \nfiscal year 2002 level to address simultaneously his homeland security \nneeds while ensuring that his other critical missions return to their \npre-September 11, 2001 levels.\n  Finally, the Committee required the Commandant to submit a detailed \nplan as part of his fiscal year 2004 budget request to show us \nprecisely how he would maintain such mission balance. I am sure that \nthe Senator from Alaska agrees with me that, notwithstanding the fact \nthat the fiscal year 2003 Transportation Appropriations bill has been \nentangled in the larger delay in the Appropriations process, the \nbipartisan leadership of the Appropriations Committee expects the \nCommandant to move forward with the submission of these reports.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, I concur with the Senator that the Committee should \nbegin receiving these reports without delay so that we can monitor the \nCoast Guard's progress in complying with not only the Appropriations \nCommittee's directives but with the requirements articulated under \nSection 888 of the Homeland Security Act.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is with great disappointment that I have to tell the \nSenator from Alaska that I am greatly concerned by some preliminary \nindications from the Department of Transportation Inspector General, \nIG, that the Coast Guard may not have fulfilled its statutory \nobligations to fully fund mandated improvements to its Search and \nRescue Program in fiscal year 2002.\n\n  As part of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2002, the Committee mandated that not less than \n$14,541,000 be used solely to address the many deficiencies that the IG \nfound with the Coast Guard's readiness in the area of Search and \nRescue. We also mandated that the Inspector General monitor the Coast \nGuard's compliance with this directive.\n  While the Inspector General's office has not yet finalized its \nreport, I am greatly concerned by preliminary indications that the \nCoast Guard did not, I repeat ``not fulfill the requirement in the law. \nThis is precisely the kind of concern that makes it essential that we \ncontinue to monitor the Coast Guard's compliance with Appropriations \nCommittee directives as well as\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nwith Section 888 of the Homeland Security Act. Again, I commend your \nleadership in this area and look forward to working with you and \nAdmiral Collins, the Commandant, on these issues in the future.\n  I also want to thank the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee again for his foresight and leadership in the efforts to \ncreate the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, as the Ranking Member of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I strongly agree with the \nremarks made by my distinguished colleague from Alaska last week \nregarding the Coast Guard and its treatment in the Homeland Security \nlegislation. I commend his leadership to preserve the traditional role \nof the Coast Guard as it becomes an agency of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  The unique strength of the Coast Guard in its multi-mission \noperational capability--the ability to perform a variety of missions \nfor the nation. It is one of several agencies to be subsumed into the \nnew Department that has both on-homeland security and homeland security \nmissions. It is critical to maintain all of the Coast Guard's missions \nand capabilities instead of allowing one mission area to eclipse any \nother. Section 888 takes a significant step forward in preventing that \nfrom happening by preventing assets, personnel, and budget resources \nfrom being diverted away from the Coast Guard's traditional missions, \nincluding rescuing mariners in distress.\n  Madam President, I share the concerns expressed by the Senator from \nAlaska about the utmost importance of maintaining the Coast Guard's \nnon-homeland security missions and capabilities. When I became Chairman \nof the Subcommittee in the next Congress, I shall look forward to \nworking closely with him as the Full Appropriations Committee Chairman \nto ensure that Section 888 is implemented as Congress intends.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I would like to thank the Senior Senator from Alaska for \nthe leadership he has shown in helping to preserve the traditional \nfunctions of the Coast Guard after it becomes part of the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Maine and Alaska share a common \ninterest in preserving the Coast Guard's traditional functions, \nincluding its search and rescue mission, which are so critical to our \nfishing communities.\n  The Senior Senator from Alaska and I teamed up in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee to ensure that, when we transfer the Coast Guard to \nthe Department of Homeland Security, we do not leave its traditional \nmissions behind. Our language ensured that the authorities, functions, \nassets, and personal of the Department would be maintained intact and \nwithout reduction after its transfer to the new Department except as \nspecified in subsequent Acts.\n\n  I am pleased that the fundamental elements and purposes of our Coast \nGuard amendment are included in the final compromise homeland security \nbill. Section 888 of the final compromise measure is intended to \npreserve the traditional functions of the Coast Guard such as marine \nsafety, search and rescue, aids to navigation, living marine resources, \nand ice operations. The Coast Guard will also be a separate and \ndistinct entity in the new Department, and the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard will report directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security, thus \npreventing a demotion from the Commandant's current status in the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  There is, however, a question that I would like to address to my \nfriend from Alaska. It is my understanding that Section 888 of the \nfinal compromise bill is intended to prohibit changes in the Coast \nGuard's personnel, assets, or authorities that would adversely impact \nthe Service's capability to perform its non-homeland security \nfunctions. Is that also the Senator's understanding of this provision?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is my understanding also.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to enter into a colloquy with several of my \ncolleagues from coastal States regarding Section 888 of the final \nversion of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The provisions of Section \n888 were drafted to preserve the traditional roles and missions of the \nCoast Guard and ensure they are not altered or diminished.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard has taken on additional \nhomeland security responsibilities resulting in its largest peacetime \nport security operation since World War II. While our new reality \nrequires the Coast Guard to maintain a robust homeland security \nposture, these new priorities must not diminish the Coast Guard's focus \non its other traditional missions such as marine safety, search and \nrescue, aids to navigation, fisheries law enforcement, and marine \nenvironmental protection.\n  As a Senator from a coastal State, and as the ranking member on the \nOceans, Atmosphere, and Fisheries Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, I can attest that all these missions are critically \nimportant and that the American people rely on the Coast Guard to \nperform them each and every day.\n  The language in Section 888, which I developed with Senators Stevens \nand Collins, strikes the proper balance and ensures the Coast Guard's \nnon-homeland security missions will not be compromised or decreased in \nany substantial or significant way by the transfer to the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  First and foremost, it ensures that the Coast Guard will remain in \ndistinct entity and continue in its role as one of the five Armed \nServices. The Coast Guard plays a unique role in our government, in \nwhich it serves as both an armed service as well as a law enforcement \nagency, and this must not be changed or altered.\n  This language in Section 888 maintains the primacy of the Coast \nGuard's diverse missions by establishing the Coast Guard as a distinct \nagency under the Secretary of Homeland Security and mandates that the \nCoast Guard Commandant will report directly to the Secretary, rather \nthan to or through a Deputy Secretary.\n  Additionally, this section prevents the Secretary of this new \nDepartment from making substantial or significant changes to the Coast \nGuard's non-homeland security missions or alter its capabilities to \ncarry out these missions, except as specified in subsequent Acts. It \nalso prohibits the new department from transferring any Coast Guard \nmissions, functions, or assets to another agency in the new Department \nexcept for personnel details and assignments that do not reduce the \nService's capability to perform its non-homeland security missions.\n  This section also requires the Inspector General of the new \nDepartment to review and assess annually the Coast Guard's performance \nof its non-homeland security missions and to report the findings to the \nCongress.\n  I also am pleased to see the inclusion of my amendment requiring the \nnew Homeland Secretary, in consultation with the Commandant, to report \nto Congress within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the benefits of \naccelerating the Coast Guard's Deepwater procurement time line from 20 \nyears to 10 years. The Deepwater project, which will recapitalize all \nof the Coast Guard assets operating 50 or more miles from our coasts, \nis already underway. However, the Coast Guard must wait up to 20 years, \nin some instances, to acquire already existing technology. I believe \nthat we must accelerate the Deepwater acquisition project and acquire \nthese much-needed assets for the Coast Guard now, not 20 years down the \nroad.\n  Madam President, Section 888 is a strong statement by the Congress \nthat the Coast Guard is an essential component of the new Department \nand that its non-homeland security missions and capabilities must be \nmaintained due to their overriding importance, not only to coastal \nStates such as Maine, but also to the entire nation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, as manager of the legislation to \ncreate a Department of Homeland Security, I want to share with the \nSenate my views on the meaning and intent of several key provisions in \nH.R. 5005, the final homeland security legislation approved by the \nSenate on November 19, 2002. These provisions have been through several \niterations and they have been debated extensively.\n  H.R. 5005 is the result of over a year of deliberations begun last \nOctober when I introduced legislation (S. 1534) with Senator Specter to \ncreate a Department of Homeland Security. That legislation was \nsubsequently combined\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nwith legislation by Senator Graham (to create a White House Office for \nCombating Terrorism) and became S. 2452, which was reported out of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs on May 22, 2002.\n  Before the Senate had a chance to consider that bill, however, the \nPresident announced his support for a Department of Homeland Security. \nThe Administration's bill, first submitted to Congress on June 18, \n2002, encompassed almost all of S. 2452's organizational elements \nregarding the Department. The Governmental Affairs Committee held \nhearings to consider the administration's proposals, and, I prepared an \namendment to S. 2452 that was considered, and adopted, at a July 24-25 \nbusiness meeting of the Committee. That expanded version of S. 2452 \nwent a considerable way to incorporate the administration's proposals.\n  In late July, the House of Representatives passed its version of the \nHomeland Security bill, H.R. 5005. This House bill became the base bill \nfor floor consideration in the Senate, and the amended version of S. \n2452 was offered on the Senate floor as SA 4471 to H.R. 5005.\n  The following statement will discuss various provisions in H.R. 5005 \nand, where appropriate, their relationship to similar provisions in SA \n4471. It is intended to supplement a statement and other material I \nsubmitted for the Record on September 4, 2002, (S8159-S8180) which \ninterpreted key provisions in SA 4471 (also referred to as the \nCommittee bill).\n\n\n                              Intelligence\n\n  Title II, Subtitle A, Section 201 of H.R. 5005, establishes a \nDirectorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. \nThis is a critical provision that goes to the heart of the weaknesses \nthat have been exposed in our nation's homeland defenses since \nSeptember 11, 2001--that is, the lack of information sharing related to \nterrorist activities between intelligence, law enforcement, and other \nagencies. This directorate stems from the President's legislative \nsubmission in June, which included a proposal to create an information \nanalysis and infrastructure protection directorate in the Department. \nHowever, the President's concept has been altered and expanded in \nresponse to testimony before the GAC and input from key Senators. The \nversion in H.R. 5005, while not exactly what the GAC recommended, \nrepresents a substantial improvement over the President's June 18th, \n2002 proposal. If fully implemented, and if the new department and the \nvarious agencies responsible for gathering and providing intelligence \nproperly interpret its provisions, it will improve our capacity to fuse \nthat intelligence in order to prevent terrorist attacks before they \noccur.\n  S. 2452, as originally reported on May 22, 2002, and based largely on \nrecommendations by the bi-partisan Hart-Rudman Commission, included \ndirectorates for critical infrastructure, emergency preparedness, and \nborder security. The President's June 18th proposal added a fourth \ndirectorate for ``information analysis and infrastructure protection.''\n  SA 4471 was developed after examining the President's proposal and \nhearing from expert witnesses on the critical need for a national level \nfocal point for the analysis of all information available to the United \nStates to combat terrorism. On June 26 and 27, the GAC held hearings on \nhow to shape the intelligence functions of the proposed Department of \nHomeland Security--to determine how, in light of the failure of our \ngovernment to bring all of the information available to various \nagencies together prior to September 11, 2001, the government should \nreceive information from the field, both foreign and domestic, and \nconvert it, through analysis, into actionable information that better \nprotects our security.\n  The GAC's hearings focused specifically on the relationship between \nthe Department of Homeland Security and the Intelligence Community. The \nhearings featured testimony from some of our country's most noted \nexperts in intelligence issues, including Senators Bob Graham and \nRichard Shelby, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. Other witnesses included Lt. Gen. Patrick M. \nHughes, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Jeffrey \nSmith, former General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency; Lt. \nGen. William Odom, former Director of the National Security Agency; \nChief William B. Berger, President of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police; and Ashton B. Carter, former Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for International Security Policy. Finally, CIA Director George \nTenet and FBI Director Robert Mueller also testified.\n\n  Senator Graham's written testimony stated that the Intelligence \nCommittee's hearings thus far have uncovered several factors that \ncontributed to the failures of Sept 11--one of which is ``the absence \nof a single set of eyes to analyze all the bits and pieces of relevant \nintelligence information, including open source material.'' Senator \nShelby's written testimony stated that ``most Americans would probably \nbe surprised to know that even nine months after the terrorist attacks, \nthere is today no federal official, not a single one, to whom the \nPresident can turn to ask the simple question, what do we know about \ncurrent terrorist threats against our homeland? No one person or entity \nhas meaningful access to all such information the government possesses. \nNo one really knows what we know, and no one is even in a position to \ngo to find out.'' General Patrick Hughes, former director of the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, echoed these points. His testimony stated \nthat, ``in our intelligence community, we currently have an inadequate \ncapability to process, analyze, prepare in contextual and technical \nforms that make sense and deliver cogent intelligence to users as soon \nas possible so that the time dependent operational demands for \nintelligence are met.''\n  These hearings made it clear that: (1) there is currently no place in \nour government where all intelligence available to the government is \nbrought together to be analyzed, (2) the Department of Homeland \nSecurity requires an all-source intelligence analysis capability in \norder to effectively achieve its mission of preventing, deterring, and \nprotecting against terrorist attacks, (3) the intelligence function \nshould be a smart, aggressive customer of the intelligence community, \n(4) the intelligence function must have a seat at the table when our \nnation's intelligence collection priorities are determined, (5) the \nDepartment is already a significant collector of intelligence-related \ninformation, through such agencies such as the Customs Service and the \nCoast Guard being transferred into the Department, and (6) the \nDepartment must have sufficient access to information that is collected \nby intelligence, law enforcement, and other agencies. This final point \nwas underscored by Senator Shelby, who testified that the relatively \nlimited ``access to information'' provisions in the President's \nproposal were unacceptable, and that it would be a mistake if they were \nadopted.\n  The President's proposal was to create an ``information analysis and \ncritical infrastructure protection division''--whose most important \nrole, as CIA Director Tenet testified at the GAC hearing on June 27, \n2002, would be ``to translate assessments about evolving terrorist \ntargeting strategies, training, and doctrine overseas into a system of \nprotection for the infrastructure of the United States.'' Its purpose \nwould be to focus the intelligence function on detecting and mitigating \nagainst threats to critical infrastructure rather than the entire range \nof potential threats. Consequently, the intelligence analysis function \nin the Department of Homeland Security would not be designed to uncover \nterrorist plots or prevent acts of terrorism before they occurred. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee rejected this more limited approach and \nsubsequently approved a more robust intelligence directorate, along \nwith a separate directorate for critical infrastructure protection, \nwhich were incorporated in SA 4471. Some of these improvements are now \nincorporated in H.R. 5005.\n  Most importantly, like SA 4471, H.R. 5005 makes it clear that the \npurpose of the information analysis function in the Department goes \nbeyond critical infrastructure protection to encompass disseminating \nintelligence in order to deter, prevent, and respond to all terrorist \nthreats. Section 201(d) of H.R. 5005, which describes responsibilities \nof the Under Secretary for Information\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection, at paragraph (1), states: ``to \naccess, receive, and analyze law enforcement, intelligence information, \nand other information from agencies from the Federal Government, State \nand local government agencies), and private sector entities, and to \nintegrate such information in order to--(A) identify and assess the \nnature and scope of terrorist threats to the homeland; (B) detect and \nidentify threats of terrorism against the United States; and (C) \nunderstand such threats in light of actual and potential \nvulnerabilities of the homeland.'' Clause (B) especially establishes \nthat the information analysis function must be designed in order to \n``detect and identify'' threats of terrorism.\n  In addition, Section 201(d)(9) states that the responsibilities of \nthe Under Secretary (for information analysis and infrastructure \nprotection) shall include the following: ``to disseminate, as \nappropriate, information analyzed by the Department within the \nDepartment, to other agencies of the Federal Government with \nresponsibilities relating to homeland security, and to agencies of \nState and local governments and private sector entities with such \nresponsibilities in order to assist in the deterrence, prevention, \npreemption of, or response to, terrorist attacks against the United \nStates.'' Again, it is important that the new information analysis \ndivision focus on doing everything within its power to deter, prevent \nand preempt, acts of terrorism, while also ensuring that our nation is \nadequately prepared to respond.\n  As noted earlier, the President's June 18th proposal would have \nestablished a more limited function primarily designed to assess \nthreats and vulnerabilities to our critical infrastructure. This is an \nimportant task and will clearly be a major focus of the Department of \nHomeland Security, but the Department's information analysis role will \nnow encompass all terrorist threats, not just those to critical \ninfrastructure. Many potential terrorist attacks--for example a bomb in \na shopping mall and attacks using weapons of mass destruction--are not \ndirected at critical infrastructure, but at producing mass casualties. \nThus, the intelligence analysis function in the Department can and must \nfocus on the full range of threats that we face. And it must have the \ncapacity to access and properly analyze all of the information about \nterrorist attacks that our government possesses.\n  Secondly, though it falls short of the Committee's recommendation, \nthe final legislation does establish dedicated leadership for both the \ninformation analysis and infrastructure protection functions. SA 4471 \nestablished separate, Senate confirmed Under Secretaries for \n``intelligence analysis'' and ``critical infrastructure protection.'' \nThis was to ensure that focused leadership--with sufficient clout--was \nprovided for each of these complex, and major challenges facing our \ngovernment. With 85 percent of our critical infrastructure owned by the \nprivate sector, it is clear that full time leadership will be required \nto ensure that adequate protective measures are identified and put in \nplace. Similarly, the tremendous challenge of overcoming barriers to \ninformation sharing within the intelligence community and establishing \na robust intelligence analysis division will likely occupy a \nsignificant amount of time of the Secretary and Under Secretary.\n\n  H.R. 5005 takes a somewhat different approach: like the President's \nJune 18th proposal, it establishes a single Under Secretary with \noverall responsibility for both information analysis and infrastructure \nprotection. However, in Title II, Section 201, (b)(1) and (b)(2) it \nalso creates two Assistant Secretaries to lead information analysis and \ninfrastructure protection, respectively. Earlier, Title I, Section 103 \nof the legislation establishes several officers who shall be appointed \nby the President ``with the advice and consent of the Senate,'' \nincluding not more than 12 Assistant Secretaries (Sec. 103 (a)(8)). The \nAssistant Secretaries for information analysis and infrastructure \nprotection will clearly occupy two of the most critical positions in \nour government: consequently, Congress' expectation is they will be \namong the 12 Assistant Secretaries who will be appointed by the \nPresident with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  Third, responding to the testimony of Senator Shelby and others, the \nSA 4471 provided broad, routine access to information for the Secretary \nof Homeland Security. The assumption behind the Committee's approach \nwas that, unless the President determined otherwise, all information \nabout terrorist threats, including so-called ``unevaluated \nintelligence,'' possessed by intelligence agencies would be routinely \nshared by intelligence agencies and other agencies with the Department \nof Homeland Security. In contrast, the President's proposal would \ncurtail the Secretary's access to unanalyzed information. The Secretary \nwould have routine access to reports, assessments and analytical \ninformation. But, except for vulnerabilities to critical \ninfrastructure, the Secretary would receive access to unanalyzed \ninformation only as the President may further provide.\n  H.R. 5005 has wisely moved towards SA 4471. In Section 202 (a), H.R. \n5005 states that, ``except as otherwise directed by the President, the \nSecretary shall have such access as the Secretary considers necessary \nto all information, including reports, assessments, analyses, and \nunevaluated intelligence relating to threats of terrorism against the \nUnited States and to other areas of responsibility assigned by the \nSecretary, and to all information concerning infrastructure or other \nvulnerabilities of the United States to terrorism, whether or not such \ninformation has been analyzed, that may be collected, possessed, or \nprepared by any agency of the Federal Government.'' This is crucial \nbecause the Secretary must have access to the information he or she \ndeems necessary to protect the American people, and cannot simply rely \non agencies that have historically been reluctant to share information \nto determine what the Secretary should have.\n  In Section 202(b)(1) the legislation provides that the Secretary may \nenter into cooperative agreements with agencies to provide access to \nsuch information. At the same time, if no request has been made, or no \nagreement has been entered into, agencies are still required to provide \ncertain information that is specified in the legislation. This \nincludes, at Section 202(b)(2) (A) all reports (including information \nreports containing intelligence which has not been fully evaluated), \nassessments and analytical information relating to threats of terrorism \nagainst the United States and to other areas of responsibility assigned \nby the Secretary; (B) all information concerning the vulnerability of \nthe infrastructure of the United States, or other vulnerabilities of \nthe United States, to terrorism, whether or not such information has \nbeen analyzed; (C) all other information relating to significant and \ncredible threats of terrorism, whether or not such information has been \nanalyzed; and (D) such other information or material as the President \nmay direct.\n  These provisions require agencies to provide significant amounts of \ninformation to the Secretary, even in the absence of a cooperative \nagreement. With respect to the information required in Section \n202(b)(2)(C); in many cases, it may be impossible for agencies to know \nif certain information is related to ``significant and credible \nthreats'' of terrorism precisely because that can only be determined \nonce the information is fused with information from others. \nConsequently, to meet the statutory requirement, agencies should \nclearly endeavor to collect requested information, even if it is not \nalready available, and they should err on the side of providing more, \nrather than less, information that is already on hand to the \nDepartment's analysts. This is clearly the best way to help ensure that \nthe Department can effectively carry out its mandate to prevent, deter, \nand preempt terrorist attacks.\n  Finally, like SA 4471, H.R. 5005 makes the Department responsible for \nworking with the Director of Central Intelligence to protect sources \nand methods and with the Attorney General to protect sensitive law \nenforcement information (Section 201(d)(12)). Also, as the Committee \nrecommended, the substitute formally includes the elements of the \nDepartment concerned with analysis of foreign intelligence in the \n``intelligence community'' (Section 201(h)) while also empowering the \nSecretary to consult with the Director of\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\nCentral Intelligence and other agencies on our nation's intelligence \ngathering priorities (Section 201(d)(10)). These provisions will ensure \nthat the Department becomes a full partner with the Central \nIntelligence Agency and other agencies in our intelligence community, \nand that is has a crucial seat at the table in all proceedings where \nintelligence-gathering priorities are established.\n  Though H.R. 5005 is not exactly what the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee recommended in SA 4471, it does contain key aspects of the \nCommittee's approach and establishes a single point in our government \nwith the responsibility for receiving and assessing all information \nabout terrorist threats to our homeland. Thus, it does represent a very \nsignificant improvement over the Administration's proposal. As a \nresult, the information analysis and infrastructure protection function \nin the Department, assuming it is properly implemented, will greatly \nimprove our nation's overall capacity to prevent, deter, protect \nagainst, and respond to terrorist threats against our homeland.\n\n\n                         Science and Technology\n\n  The Department will have profound scientific and technological needs, \nand both the immediate and long-term success of its mission will \nrequire the implementation of a broadly-coordinated, tightly-focused, \nand sustained effort to invest in critical areas of research, \naccelerate technology development, and expedite the transition and \ndeployment of such technologies into effective use. H.R. 5005 attempts \nto meet this objective by creating a strong, coherent, and well-funded \nDirectorate of Science and Technology. The Directorate established in \nthis legislation follows directly from the model embodied in the \nhomeland security bill passed by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, SA 4471, and explicated in the Chairman's Statement on \nSeptember 4, 2002 (Congressional Record, pages S8162-S8164). In keeping \nwith that model, the Directorate will be headed by a Senate-confirmed \nUnder Secretary for Science and Technology with expansive \nresponsibilities, as outlined in Section 302, for directing and \nmanaging homeland security research, development, demonstration, \ntesting, and evaluation (RDDT) activities; coordinating the federal \ngovernment's civilian efforts, as well as developing a national policy \nand strategic plan, for meeting homeland security R needs; advising \nthe Secretary and supporting the Department's efforts to analyze risks \nand threats; ensuring the rapid transfer and deployment of technologies \ncapable of advancing homeland security objectives; and conducting \nresearch on countermeasures for biological and chemical threats.\n\n\n       Research, Development, Demonstration, Testing & Evaluation\n\n  With respect to his RDDT responsibilities, the Under Secretary will \nact through an array of mechanisms and authorities established in H.R. \n5005. The primary driver of innovation within the Directorate will be a \nHomeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA), which is \nconceived to be similar in purpose and organization to the highly \nsuccessful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) within the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD). Over the past five decades, DARPA has been \nrecognized as one of the most productive engines of technological \ninnovation in the federal government. Its success has been grounded in \nits ability to recruit outstanding scientific and technical talent, \npromote creativity and adaptability under a lean, flexible \norganizational structure, and entice collaboration from other R \nentities by leveraging an independent source of funds. Because the \nHSARPA created in H.R. 5005 is purposefully patterned after the nearly \nidentical Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (SARPA) contained \nin SA 4471, the legislative intent concerning the missions, roles, \nAcceleration Fund, and structure of that organization (see Chairman's \nStatement on September 4, 2002, Congressional Record, pages S8162-8163) \nare, of course, straightforwardly applicable to HSARPA.\n  In order to enable HSARPA to achieve parallel success to DARPA, \nSection 307 of H.R. 5005 provides HSARPA with a $500 million \nAcceleration Fund to support key homeland security R both within and \noutside of the federal government, leverage collaboration from R \nentities external to the Department, and accelerate the development, \nprototyping, and deployment of homeland security technologies. The \nSecretary is likewise provided with DARPA's flexible authority to hire \nand manage top-flight personnel. Although SA 4471 placed limits on this \nauthority by setting a ceiling of 100 personnel who may be hired \npursuant to this authority and instituting a 7-year sunset provision \n[SA 4471, Section 135(c)(3)(C)], those limits have been eliminated in \nH.R. 5005 to allow the Secretary greater discretion in exercising such \nauthority commensurate with need [Section 307(b)(6)]. In a later \nsection, Section 831, H.R. 5005 also confers the Secretary with another \nimportant authority currently available to the DOD--the ability to \nengage in ``other transactions'' for both research and prototype \nprojects. This flexible contracting authority for such projects has \nbeen integral to DARPA's success, and HSARPA will therefore have the \nsame authority. While the legislation vests this authority directly in \nthe Secretary, it is clearly and specifically contemplated that such \nauthority will be delegated appropriately to other officials within the \nDepartment, particularly the Under Secretary for Science and Technology \nand the Director of HSARPA, for use in connection with R and \nprototyping activities under their direction or management, including \nextramural RDDT projects and projects supported by the Acceleration \nFund. Nothing in this legislation should be construed as requiring or \nencouraging HSARPA to adopt or replicate any specific programs within \nDARPA, such as the Total Information Awareness Program, or as \nconferring HSARPA with any additional authority to overcome privacy \nlaws when developing technologies for information-collection.\n  Separate provisions for the Department's other extramural and \nintramural RDDT activities are set forth in Section 308. These \nprovisions are not intended to supercede the specific provisions \nestablished for HSARPA under Section 307, and should not be in any way \nlimiting on HSARPA. Regarding the university-based center or centers \nfor homeland security described in Section 308(b)(2), legislative \nintent regarding the need for flexible application of this provision in \norder to avoid unfairly favoring one or more particular institutions \nwas clarified in the November floor statements of the Republican \nmanager of the final bill, Senator Phil Gramm. It should therefore be \nemphasized that the criteria listed under Section 308(b)(2)(B) should \nnot be considered absolute or dispositive in nature, but rather, as \nfactors that should be considered in the context of national homeland \nsecurity needs and the relative strengths of candidate institutions in \nmeeting those needs. Consistent with this intent, Section 308(b)(2)(C) \nspecifically provides the Secretary and the Under Secretary with full \n``discretion'' in determining whether, how, and when to implement these \nprovisions. Consideration of additional relevant criteria to supplement \n(and, within their discretion, to supercede) those delineated under \nSection 308(b)(2)(B) is specifically contemplated in Section \n308(b)(2)(C). This subsection anticipates as the Secretary and Under \nSecretary exercise their discretion that they actively engage in a \ncomprehensive, dispassionate, and competitive review of available \ninstitutions to determine the optimal selection for serving national \ninterests. It is contemplated that consortia of universities capable of \nmeeting particular areas of required expertise would be eligible to \nserve as a university center or centers; therefore, there is no \nrestriction on such consortia being considered under Section 308(b)(2). \nTo assure full oversight of the fairness of the selection process, the \nSecretary is required to report to Congress under Section 308(b)(2)(C) \non the full details of the selection and implementation of the \nuniversity centers.\n  Regarding the headquarters laboratory described in Sections \n308(c)(2)-(c)(4), it deserves reiterating that the establishment of \nsuch a headquarters laboratory is not mandatory under the legislation. \nThe Secretary and the Under Secretary should use their discretion in \ndetermining whether the designation of such a laboratory is necessary \nand would better assist the Directorate in fulfilling its functions. It\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nis the intent of H.R. 5005 that the Directorate coordinate and draw \nbroadly upon the full range of S resources and expertise available in \nthe federal government rather than creating new, duplicative \nstovepipes. Accordingly, the risks attaching to the latter should be \nweighed carefully against the potential benefits of establishing a \nsingle headquarters laboratory. As an alternative, the Secretary could \ncertainly opt to select a group of institutions and laboratory elements \nwith expertise in a variety of fields to fill the pertinent need.\n  Consequent to the principle of affording the Department with rapid, \nnon- bureaucratic, expansive, and flexible access to existing federal \nS capabilities, the legislation in Section 309 provides the Secretary \nwith authority to utilize any of the Department of Energy (DOE) \nlaboratories and sites through a variety of mechanisms, most notably, \njoint sponsorship agreements, and in Section 309(g), establishes an \nOffice for National Laboratories within the Directorate to create a \nnetworked laboratory system among the DOE laboratories to support the \nmissions of the Department. With regard to Section 309(c), it should be \nclarified that this provision is limited to those programs and \nactivities that are transferred from the DOE to the Department under \nthis legislation. There is no general requirement or obligation within \nthis or any other provision to execute or maintain separate contracts \nfor work commissioned by the Department to non-transferred DOE \nlaboratories or sites or their operators.\n\n\n  Interagency Coordination and the National Policy and Strategic Plan\n\n  Notwithstanding the mechanisms described above for enabling the \nDepartment to engage and support important homeland security R, H.R. \n5005 recognizes that the vast bulk of research and development relevant \nto homeland security will continue to occur outside the direct control \nof the Department--in other agencies, in academia, and in the private \nsector. A critical challenge, therefore, will be to ensure that the \nDepartment has the proper tools and mechanisms to elicit cooperation \nacross a wide range of disparate R entities, each with their own \nmissions and priorities, and to coordinate their collective efforts in \nservice to homeland security goals.\n  A key coordination mechanism envisioned by the legislation is the \ndevelopment of a national policy and strategic plan as described in \nSection 302(2). This national policy and strategic plan integrates the \nconcepts of the National Strategy for Combating Terrorism and the \ntechnology roadmap articulated in SA 4471 [Title III and Section \n135(c)(2)(B)] into a single national blueprint for meeting S goals \nand objectives for homeland security. It is intended that a \ncomprehensive technology roadmapping exercise (which is commonly \naccepted within the S community as a prerequisite to optimal \norganization and coordination of large-scale R projects) serve as a \nbasis for, and central component of, the larger policy and plan, and \nthat the resulting roadmap, policy, and plan provide the framework \nwithin which all relevant stakeholders, both within and outside of \ngovernment, will coordinate on a common homeland security RDDT \nagenda.\n  Effective coordination will also require a forum and body through \nwhich intensive communication and collaboration may occur. Along these \nlines, the legislation in Section 311 establishes a Homeland Security \nScience and Technology Advisory Committee (``Advisory Committee'') \nconsisting of representatives from academia and the private sector to \nboth advise the Department and coordinate with communities outside the \nfederal government in conducting homeland security R The utility of \nhaving an external, independent entity to inform and guide intra-\nDepartment and interagency S efforts has been previously demonstrated \nby the advisory group assembled by the National Academy of Sciences \n(NAS) in response to the September 11th attacks. This group, which \npublished a prominent review of the government's homeland security R \nefforts in June 2002 (Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and \nTechnology in Countering Terrorism), played an important and \nconstructive role in identifying and stimulating much needed \nimprovements. Section 311 requires a similar entity to be established \nthat may, among other things, advise the Department by continuously \ncritiquing homeland security S efforts in a ``red team'' capacity or \nfunction, and recommending new approaches for the Department and \noutside agencies. It is specifically anticipated that the National \nResearch Council of the NAS, drawing on its extensive network of S \ncontacts and the expertise it developed in compiling its June 2002 \nreport, will select appropriate candidates for membership onto the \nAdvisory Committee [Section 311(b)(2)], as well as support the Advisory \nCommittee's work on an ongoing basis. The Advisory Committee is \ninitially authorized for three years, which is a reasonable time period \nto permit the Secretary to meaningfully assess the Advisory Committee's \nefficacy in fulfilling its defined purpose. Should the Secretary \ndetermine after the initial authorization period that the Advisory \nCommittee has provided, or is likely to provide, useful support and \nfunctionality to the Department, it is anticipated that the Secretary \nwill reconstitute or re-establish the Advisory Committee pursuant to \nhis authority under Section 871(a).\n  With respect to R coordination among the federal agencies, H.R. \n5005 does not specifically carry over the Homeland Security Science & \nTechnology Council (``S Council'') from SA 4471 given that it may be \nunnecessarily redundant to create a new interagency council when \ninteragency coordination mechanisms already exist in the form of the \nNational Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and its various \nsubcommittees. This does not diminish the importance of such an \ninteragency body to the homeland security R effort. To the contrary, \nan active interagency coordination entity must be considered \nfundamental to enabling the Secretary and the Under Secretary to \nfulfill their core responsibilities of coordinating the federal \ngovernment's civilian homeland security R efforts [Section 302(2)] \nand carrying out the Department's S agenda through coordination with \nother federal agencies [Section 302(13)]. The omission of the \ninteragency S Council from H.R. 5005 assumes that the NSTC and the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), working with the \nSecretary and the Under Secretary, will establish and promote the \nstrong interagency coordination mandated in Sections 302(2) and \n302(13). Consequently, the Secretary, the Under Secretary, the OSTP, \nand all members of the NSTC are expected to commit to ensuring the \nviability of the NSTC as a productive coordination mechanism. In the \nevent that such faith proves to be misplaced, a separate interagency \ngroup composed of senior R representatives from relevant federal \nagencies and officials from the Executive Office of the White House \nshould be immediately constituted by the Secretary and the Under \nSecretary based on the authorization for interagency S coordination \ncontained in Sections 302(2) and 302(13). These provisions also \nconstitute a directive to agencies with S expertise in areas \npertinent to homeland security to fully and actively participate in \nsuch interagency efforts.\n\n\n   scientific and technical support, risk analysis, and the homeland \n                           security institute\n\n  Another major set of responsibilities assigned to the Under Secretary \nrelates to providing specialized advise, expertise, and support to \nother actors within the homeland security organization [Sections 302 \n(1), (2), and (3)]. Perhaps the most critical of such responsibilities \nis supporting the Department with respect to assessing, analyzing, and \nmitigating homeland security threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. \nSection 302(2) calls for including coordinated threat identification \nwithin the national policy and strategic plan, and Section 302(3) \nspecifically calls for the assessment and testing of ``homeland \nsecurity vulnerabilities and threats.'' Although primary responsibility \nfor coordinating and integrating risk analysis and risk management \nresides with the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Information \nAnalysis and Infrastructure Protection, the highly complex and \ntechnical issues inherent to modern risk analysis methods demand \nsubstantial scientific and technical expertise. Section 302(3) mandates \nthat the Under Secretary for S support\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nthe Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection in this regard. Therefore, Section 305 addresses the problem \nof obtaining the necessary S expertise by giving the Secretary broad \nauthority to establish or contract with Federally Funded Research and \nDevelopment Centers (FFRDCs), which could perform functions not only \nrelated to R, but extending to risk, threat, and vulnerability \nanalysis. While this authority is discretionary, H.R. 5005 anticipates \nthat it will be exercised actively in accordance with need. In fact, so \ncompelling was the NAS's recommendation in its June 2002 report to \ncreate an independent, non-profit institution for critical analysis and \ndecision support, that H.R. 5005 includes another provision to trigger \nimmediate exercise of the broad FFRDC authority. Specifically, Section \n312 mandates the creation of a Homeland Security Institute \n(``Institute'') focusing expressly on capabilities related to risk \nanalysis, scenario-based threat assessments, red teaming, and other \nfunctions relevant to homeland security. The Institute is initially \nauthorized for three years, which is a reasonable time period to permit \nthe Secretary to meaningfully assess the Institute's efficacy in \nfulfilling its defined purpose. Should the Secretary determine after \nthe initial authorization period that the Institute has provided, or is \nlikely to provide, useful support and functionality to the Department, \nit is anticipated that the Secretary will, pursuant to his authority \nunder Section 305, renew, reconstitute, or re-establish the Institute \nwith appropriately expanded or modified functions to service the \nDepartment's ongoing and expanding risk assessment mission.\n\n\n                         technology transition\n\n  The Under Secretary is responsible for ensuring that technologies \ncapable of supporting homeland security are quickly tested, evaluated, \ntransitioned, and deployed to appropriate users within or outside the \nDepartment. Section 302(6) explicitly requires the Under Secretary to \nestablish a system for transferring such technologies. This system \nshould include processes and mechanisms for identifying homeland \nsecurity actors and entities with unmet technological needs; matching \nsuch entities and needs with available technologies or, if none are \nreadily available, assisting in the development, testing, evaluation, \nand deployment of new technologies to meet identified needs; ensuring \nviable technology transition paths for products of homeland security \nR, including HSRAPA-derived technologies; aligning internal R \npriorities and programs to technological needs inside or outside the \nDepartment; communicating externally with both technology developers \nand users to promote alignment of extra-Departmental R efforts with \nhomeland security-related technological needs; providing technology \ndevelopers with information and guidance on interfacing with \ngovernmental customers of homeland security technologies; and providing \ntechnical assistance to potential governmental users of homeland \nsecurity technologies. To support the Under Secretary in executing \nthese responsibilities, Section 313 establishes a Technology \nClearinghouse (''Clearinghouse'') to serve as a national point-of-\ncontact for both technology developers and potential users. The \nClearinghouse must coordinate with the Technical Support Working Group \n(TSWG), and may fully integrate with the TSWG. In light of the fact \nthat the mission of the TSWG dovetails with, and is fully embraced by, \nthat of the Directorate, it is contemplated that the Under Secretary \nmay assume full or joint management, technical, and/or policy oversight \nof the TSWG.\n\n\n  testing and evaluation of technologies for internal acquisition and \n                               deployment\n\n  With respect to technologies being considered for internal use \nDepartment-wide or within one or more of its constituent entities, \nintelligent and well-coordinated testing, evaluation, procurement, and \ndeployment will be crucial given that the new Department will have \nextensive technological needs, requirements, and dependencies. Too \noften, government agencies are hampered and distracted from their \nfundamental missions as a result of unstructured, technically \nunsophisticated approaches to technology acquisition and deployment \nthat generate interoperability problems downstream. In order to \neffectively carry out the requirement for the Under Secretary to \ncomprehensively conduct, direct, integrate, and coordinate the \ndemonstrating, testing, and evaluation activities of the Department as \narticulated in Sections 302(4), 302(5), and 302(12), the Secretary and \nthe Under Secretary should implement procedures to ensure that new \ntechnologies being considered for acquisition will be compatible and \ninteroperable with other existing or anticipated technologies. New \ntechnologies should not be permitted to move to acquisition without the \nUnder Secretary's sign off on the prior stages in the innovation \nprocess, particularly the demonstration, testing, and evaluation \nstages. The Under Secretary is understood to occupy the role of the \nDepartment's chief technology officer, and it is anticipated that he \nwill be provided with responsibilities and authorities befitting that \nrole. Accordingly, the Secretary shall act through the Under Secretary \nto operationally test and evaluate all major systems targeted for \npotential acquisition by any entity within the Department, and grant \nthe Under Secretary authority to approve or reject such systems in his \ndiscretion. Nothing in this provision is to be construed as proscribing \nother Departmental entities from undertaking testing and evaluation \nactivities so long as they do so in coordination with, and subject to \nthe final approval of, the Under Secretary. The Under Secretary should \nalso coordinate with the Department's Chief Information Officer, the \nUnder Secretary for Management, and other federal agencies in promoting \ngovernment-wide compatibility and interoperability of homeland security \ntechnologies and systems.\n\n  By vesting in the Under Secretary the full and broad authority to \nmanage the Department's full spectrum of innovation, from basic \nresearch [Sections 302(4), 302(5), 302(11), and 302(12)] through \ndemonstration, testing, and evaluation [Sections 302(4), 302(5), and \n302(12)] to transition and deployment [Section 302(6)], the Under \nSecretary will have the means and mandate to initiate a powerful, \nsystematic approach to innovation that generates new technologies for \ncombating terrorism and ensures integrated acquisition and use of such \ntechnologies. Placing control of all the key innovation stages with the \nUnder Secretary is critical to assuring that research, development, \ndemonstration, testing, evaluation, and deployment in the Department do \nnot become disjointed and fractured so that a coherent innovation \nprocess can prevail.\n\n\n    Research on Countermeasures for Biological and Chemical Threats\n\n  True preparation for future biological, chemical, radiological, and \nnuclear attacks will depend upon the development of vaccines and \nmedicines to combat the most likely threats. At present, our nation is \nwoefully unprepared for this type of attack. In his June 28, 2002 \ntestimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Dr. J. \nLeighton Read discussed the barriers to the development of a national \nmedical arsenal to combat terrorism. The federal government has a long \nand successful history in conducting basic biomedical research. The \nNational Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS) have served as an international model for funding and \nconducting human health-related research. However, in facing biological \nand chemical terrorism, we face a new challenge. In addition to \nencouraging basic research and training the next generation of \nscientists, the federal government will have to deliver actual \npharmaceutical products and will have to deliver them quickly. Unlike \nthe traditional pharmaceutical market, companies that choose to develop \ndrugs to fight bioterrorist attacks that may never occur will not be \nable to rely on an existing market. Yet producing actual products to \nmeet biological and chemical threats will depend upon private sector \ninvolvement. As a result, the Under Secretary should incorporate the \ngoal of engaging the private sector into develop biothreat \ncountermeasures into every level of his strategy, and adopt plans and \npolicies to enable such private sector participation to occur.\n  H.R. 5005 provides tools to accomplish this task. While Section \n302(4) states generally that the Under Secretary's responsibilities do \nnot extend\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nto human health-related research and development activities, this \nprovision should be construed consistent with other specific provisions \nin H.R. 5005 ascribing the Under Secretary a major role in addressing \nbiological and chemical threats related to terrorism, a role which will \nrequire the Under Secretary to conduct specific types of human health-\nrelated research and development activities. Section 302, therefore, \ndoes not circumscribe the Under Secretary's authority to conduct \nresearch necessary to implement the major biothreat-related functions \ndelineated in Sections 302(2) (requiring the Under Secretary to develop \na national policy and plan that addresses, among other things, chemical \nand biological terrorist threats, and further requiring the Under \nSecretary to coordinate the Federal Government's civilian efforts to \nidentify and develop countermeasures to chemical, biological, \nradiological, nuclear, and other emerging terrorist threats), 302(5) \n(requiring the Under Secretary to direct, fund, and conduct national \nresearch and development for detecting, preventing, protecting against, \nand responding to terrorist attacks, which perforce include those \ninvolving biological or chemical agents), 302(8) (requiring the Under \nSecretary to collaborate with the Secretary of Agriculture under the \nAgricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002), 302(9) (requiring \nthe Under Secretary to collaborate with the Secretary of HHS in \ndetermining biological agents and toxins to be listed as select \nagents), 303(1)(A) (transferring control and management of certain \nchemical and biological national security programs within the \nDepartment of Energy into the Department of Homeland Security), and \nSections 303(2) and 1708 (establishing and transferring into the \nDepartment a National Bio-Weapons Defense Analysis Center).\n  The National Bio-Weapons Defense Analysis Center (``Center'') \nestablished and transferred in H.R. 5005 will, in particular, require \nthe Under Secretary to engage in extensive human health-related R \nThe Center is intended to lead the Department's research efforts on \nbioterrorism by developing ``countermeasures to potential attacks by \nterrorists using weapons of mass destruction'' (Section 1708). The \nCenter will conduct research on bioterrorism, and by definition, this \nshould include study of the pathogenesis of bioterrorist agents, the \nimmune response to these pathogens, and research on vaccines, drugs, \nand other medical antidotes. Since the Center is placed under the \ndirection and management of the Directorate, the Under Secretary is \nconferred with substantial obligations to conduct human health-related \nR\n  While the Secretary clearly has the authority to conduct the type of \nR discussed above internally, H.R. 5005 contemplates that the \ncivilian human health-related countermeasures research carried out by \nHHS shall remain under the direction of the Secretary of HHS. Sections \n304(a) and (b) mandate that while the Secretary of HHS shall retain \nauthority for such research, he shall collaborate with the Secretary of \nHomeland Security in developing between the two Departments a \ncoordinated strategy and outcome measurements for these research \nactivities. As outlined in H.R. 5005, it is crucial that such research \nreflect the overall national policy and strategic plan developed by the \nSecretary and the Under Secretary under Section 302(2), and that the \nefforts of the two Departments be fully in concert. In the biothreat \nand chemical threat areas, the Secretary should work to ensure the \nresulting policy, plan, and benchmarks mandated under Section 302(2) \nreflect what is most needed and what pharmaceutical products can be \ntimely developed against the most likely and dangerous threats to the \npublic. Since this will require participation from the private sector, \nthe policy and plan, which will include a technology roadmap, must \nnecessarily include a strategy for translating basic science results \ninto product development within the private pharmaceutical and \nbiotechnology sectors.\n\n\n                  Emergency Preparedness and Response\n\n  The Department will coordinate the federal response to disasters. \nThis responsibility will encompass natural and manmade disasters, \nterrorist attacks and all incidents involving weapons of mass \ndestruction, and other large-scale emergencies. In addition, the \nDepartment will assist the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and \nthe Department of Agriculture in responding to public health and \nagricultural emergencies. The Directorate for Emergency Preparedness \nand Response was designed to spearhead this effort within the \nDepartment.\n  In order to accomplish these tasks the Department will need an \ninterdisciplinary, well funded, and well-organized Directorate of \nEmergency Preparedness and Response. The initial design of this \ndirectorate was established by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in S. 1534. This original design was refined by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee amendment, SA 4471, and further \nexplained by the Chairman's statement on September 4, 2002 \n(Congressional Record, pages S8162-S8164). Consistent with this \noriginal design, H.R. 5005 establishes a Directorate that includes the \nessential federal emergency response agencies and offices.\n  The Directorate shall build and direct a comprehensive national \nincident management system and consolidate existing federal emergency \nresponse plans into a single, coordinated national plan as outlined in \nH.R. 5005, Sections 502(5), 502(6), and 507(b)(1-2). States and \nlocalities should have access to and information about these systems \nand plans to ensure optimal coordination during an emergency. These \nplans should encompass all affected governmental entities and reflect \nboth local and national needs. The consolidated federal response plan, \noutlined in Sections 502(6) and 507(b)(1-2), must interface with state \nand local response plans and should utilize local resources wherever \npossible.\n\n\n                            Interoperability\n\n  The planning responsibilities of the Under Secretary shall include \nthe development of a comprehensive plan and effort for improving \ncommunication interoperability during emergency response (H.R. 5005, \nSection 502(7)). In developing the communication technology and \ninteroperability, the Under Secretary must pay particular attention to \nthe development, support and utilization of effective telemedicine \nnetworks, as well as the application of advanced information technology \nto effective training for and delivery of emergency medical services.\n\n\n                               Standards\n\n  In order to implement the missions delineated in Section 502, the \nDirectorate shall establish and disseminate standards for equipment, \npersonnel, training, resources, and the resulting emergency response. \nStandards shall be used as benchmarks for training and acquisition to \nensure a uniform quality and interoperability during a response. The \nUnder Secretary shall use these standards to provide recommendations \nand guidance to state and local governments.\n\n\n               Public Health and Agricultural Emergencies\n\n  The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and the Department of \nAgriculture shall retain the authority to oversee the federal response \nto public health and agricultural emergencies, respectively. This \nauthority includes the authority to declare such emergencies. However, \nthese agencies shall fully collaborate with the new Department which \nshall support these agencies in their response, especially with regards \nto chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. The \nDepartment should serve as an active and involved resource during \nbioterrorist and agroterrorist attacks. As outlined in Section 887 of \nH.R. 5005, the Department shall work in conjunction with the Department \nof Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and \nother engaged federal agencies to optimize information sharing between \nagencies commencing forthwith, as well as before and after the \ndeclaration of a public health emergency. This provision was intended \nto ensure that all involved agencies have all the information necessary \nto effectively perform their role in the federal response. See also, \nSection 892.\n\n\n                                Training\n\n  In order to help ``ensure the effectiveness of emergency response \nefforts'' as required in Section 502(1) of H.R. 5005, the Directorate \nshall lead federal efforts to train first responders in disaster \nresponse. The term, first responder, shall include law enforcement,\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nfire fighting, emergency medical, health care, and volunteer personnel. \nTo be effective, training shall encompass exercises, on-line computer \nsimulations, drills, courses, and other interactive learning \nenvironments. Personnel should be trained in every aspect of emergency \nresponse, including prevention/preparation, mitigation, active \nresponse, and recovery efforts. Training should include utilization of \nthe Noble Training Center, transferred to the new Department as part of \nthe Office of Emergency Preparedness (Section 503(5)) and other \ntraining sites and campuses within the Federal Emergency Management \nSystem, as well as full coordination with the National Guard. Finally, \nthe Directorate shall improve, and train first responders in use of, \ngovernmental on-line resources to ensure they have the latest \ninformation available during a response.\n\n\n                      Strategic National Stockpile\n\n  Authority to oversee the Strategic National Stockpile shall be \ntransferred to the new Department. In H.R. 5005, this transfer of \nauthority is described in Sections 502(3)(B), 503(6), and 1705. This \nlanguage clarifies that the existing structure of the Stockpile \nprogram, as described in Section 121 of the Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-\n188), shall remain intact. The Stockpile shall continue to be a multi-\nagency effort, with significant roles for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs and the Department of Health and Human Services. In particular, \nthe Department should continue to incorporate the recommendations of \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Preparedness (CDC) and the Office \nof the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness \n(OPHEP), within the Department of Health and Human Services, in \ndetermining the composition of the stockpile and the parameters for its \nuse. The Department shall consult the CDC and OPHEP in deciding which \nmedications, vaccines, and medical supplies are most appropriate for \nthe Stockpile (Section 1705(a)(1)(C)). The Department shall also \ncoordinate with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in \ndetermining the need to deploy the stockpile, on an incident-by-\nincident basis. The Under Secretary should continue to use the \nresources of Department of Veterans' Affairs in procuring and storing \nthe contents of the Stockpile (Section 1705(a)(1)(B)). And the Under \nSecretary shall call upon the Department of Defense and the National \nGuard to help transport and secure the contents of the stockpile as \nappropriate.\n\n\n                  The Office of Emergency Preparedness\n\n  SA 4471 described, in detail, the transfer of the Office of Emergency \nPreparedness (OEP) from the Department of Health and Human Services to \nthe Department. The transfer of OEP was retained in H.R. 5005 in \nsections 502(3)(B) and 503(5). Since the Office of Emergency \nPreparedness is not defined in statute, it should be clarified that the \ntransfer of OEP shall include the Office and all of its component \nagencies. This includes the National Disaster Medical System, the \nMetropolitan Medical Response System, the Noble Training Center, the \nSpecial Events Disaster Response program, and all other programs \ndirected by OEP. Of course, nothing in the final legislation should be \nconstrued to mean that the transfer of the OEP programs shall result in \nthe transfer of personnel whose primary duties reside outside of OEP.\n\n\n                  The National Disaster Medical System\n\n  For example, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) is an inter- \nagency program. It involves personnel, facilities, and equipment from \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies. The \npersonnel and assets from these departments that are deployed by NDMS \nduring the an emergency response, but whose primary day to day roles \nare central to the missions of agencies outside of the Department, \nshall remain part of their home agencies. This includes members of the \nDisaster Medial Assistance Teams (DMATs), the Disaster Mortuary \nAssistance Teams (DMATs), and the Veterinary Medical Assistance Teams \n(VMATs). The transfer of the NDMS component of OEP shall be restricted \nto the management, organizational, and coordinating personnel, \nfunctions, and assets.\n\n\n                The Metropolitan Medical Response System\n\n  Similarly, the transfer of the Metropolitan Medical Response System \n(MMRS) does not include transfer of member hospitals. Rather it shall \nconsist of a transfer of the grant programs and related personnel. The \nMMRS grants have been used to improve hospital and first responder \npreparedness in select metropolitan regions across the country. \nAdministration of these ongoing grants will become part of the new \nDepartment.\n  Although H.R. 5005 transfers the authority of the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the Assistant Secretary for \nPublic Health Emergency Preparedness for OEP (Section 503(5)), the \nUnder Secretary shall at all times attempt to maximize communication \nand interaction between OEP and its component programs and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, which will be crucial in \nmeeting the Directorate's mission requirements. As the preceding \ndiscussion illustrates, OEP will have to coordinate efforts of \npersonnel from several different agencies. But in addition, OEP and its \nprograms must remain integrated into the larger national public health \ninfrastructure. Particular efforts should be made to coordinate OEP \nprograms with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health \nEmergency Preparedness. This office, within the Department of Health \nand Human Services, is charged with coordinating intra and interagency \nhealth preparedness efforts. OEP should remain a part of this larger \nwhole.\n\n\n          Conduct of Certain Public Health-Related Activities\n\n  Section 505 of H.R. 5005 addresses two critical issues. First, it is \nimperative that the efforts to improve our public health infrastructure \nand their emergency preparedness remain under the control of the \nSecretary for Health and Human Services, although coordinated with the \nSecretary. On June 28, 2002 the Governmental Affairs Committee heard \ntestimony from several public health experts. In their testimony, the \nwitnesses concurred that in order to be functional during an emergency, \npublic health preparedness efforts had to be integrated into the larger \npublic health system. This ``dual-use'' improves underlying public \nhealth efforts while ensuring health providers remain familiar with \nemergency preparedness networks and programs. Their testimony pointed \nout that dual-use was particularly important during a response to a \nbiological attack. In this case, the terrorist attack may not be \nimmediately apparent and detection may depend upon the ability of \nnormal health care systems to detect unusual patterns of illness. H.R. \n5005 also stressed this important theme through Section 505 and \nlanguage in Section 887, which calls for interaction between the \nagencies before and after the declaration of a public health emergency.\n  Section 505 stipulates that the Department of Health and Human \nServices shall retain primary authority over efforts to improve State, \nlocal, and hospital preparedness and response to chemical, biological, \nradiological, and nuclear and other emerging terrorist threats \n``carried out by the Department of Health and Human Services.'' In this \nregard, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall have authority \nto set priorities and preparedness goals. However, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, working through the Assistant Secretary for \nPublic Health Emergency Preparedness, must develop a coordinated \nstrategy for these activities in collaboration with the Secretary \n(Section 505(a)). In doing so, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices will also collaborate with the Secretary in establishing \nbenchmarks and outcome measures for success. Nothing in Section 505 \nshould be interpreted as disrupting ongoing preparedness efforts within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. All ongoing emergency \npreparedness grants should continue. Selection criteria and the \nevaluation of grant application shall continue to be determined by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, consistent with Section 505 \nprovisions.\n\n\n                       Human Resources Management\n\n  H.R. 5005 contains two key provisions relating to employees at the \nnew Department--section 841, which governs\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nthe establishment of a human resources management system, and section \n842, which deals with labor-management relations at the Department. \nThese provisions have been among the most contentious in debate on this \nlegislation.\n  The Administration has consistently sought what it calls \n``flexibility'' in the personnel area, by which it means a carte \nblanche to waive civil service protections and union rights of the \nemployees at the Department. Sections 841 and 842 of H.R. 5005 are \nsignificantly more protective in this regard than the provisions in the \nPresident's original proposal (i.e., the one released June 18, 2002), \nbut these sections remain a major disappointment. A risk remains of \npoliticization, arbitrary treatment, and other personnel abuses in the \nfederal government, in a way that may damage the merit-based workplace \nfederal employees and the American people have come to depend on. I \nhope what I fear does not come to pass, and that this Administration \nand future Administrations will not overstep bounds, overexert \nauthority, and thereby undermine the effectiveness of the new \nDepartment. I have summarized below the protections that sections 841 \nand 842 do provide.\n  Establishment of Human Resources Management System. Section 841 \nauthorizes the Secretary, jointly with the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), to prescribe a ``human resources management \nsystem'' (HRMS) for the Department. The section provides that the HRMS \nmay waive certain provisions of the civil service statutes, and \nspecifies required procedures by which the system is to be developed, \nnegotiated, and adopted.\n  When it comes to the creation of a HRMS, the law still requires that \nemployees in the new Department will be hired, promoted, disciplined, \nand fired in conformity with all merit system principles and in \nviolation of no prohibited personnel practices. If and when existing \ncivil service rights and protections come up for consideration in the \ndevelopment of a HRMS, the Administration may waive, modify, or \notherwise affect such rights and protections only to the extent it can \nclearly demonstrate that they clearly conflict with the homeland \nsecurity mission, and that they are not being waived merely in the \ninterest of administrative convenience. Fair and independent procedures \nmust be maintained for employees with grievances, such as those who \nallege abuse or corruption within the Department. Changes to the system \nmust be carefully crafted through negotiation and collaboration with \nemployees and their representatives; and, if a disagreement arises, the \nperiod of at least 30 days that section 841 requires for bargaining and \nmediation between the Administration and the employee representatives \nmust be substantial and in good faith, not cosmetic.\n  The provisions in section 841 that allow a HRMS to waive statutes are \nprecisely drawn, detailing which parts of the United States Code may be \nwaived, modified, or otherwise affected and which parts may not. For \nexample, the legislation specifically forbids waiver of merit system \nprinciples or prohibited personnel practices. Furthermore, as to \nprovisions referred to in 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2302(b)(1), (8) and (9), \nthe legislation forbids waiver not only of the provisions themselves, \nbut also of provisions implementing those protections through \naffirmative action or through any right or remedy. Sections 2302(b)(1), \n(8) and (9) include laws against discrimination, against reprisal for \nwhistleblowing, and retaliation for exercising rights. Section 841 thus \nassures that the HRMS will not affect employees' ability to appeal a \npersonnel action to the Merit Systems Protection Board, under existing \nlaw, in a case where the employee alleges a discrimination, \nretaliation, or reprisal covered and referred to by \nSec. Sec. 2302(b)(1), (8) and (9). Section 841 also requires the HRMS \nto ensure that employees may organize and bargain collectively, subject \nonly to exclusion from coverage or limitation on negotiability \nestablished by 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 or other law.\n  Furthermore, the grant of waiver authority under section 841 refers \nexplicitly and only to part III of title 5, United States Code. Section \n841 thus grants no authority to waive any provision of law outside of \npart III. This means, for example, that the HRMS may not waive, modify, \nor otherwise affect such government-wide employee rights and \nprotections as, for example: (1) the Office of Special Counsel's \nauthority to investigate any prohibited personnel practice and seek \ncorrective action or disciplinary action from the Merit Systems \nProtection Board (MSPB) (5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1211 et seq.); (2) \nemployees' right to seek corrective action from the MSPB in a case of \nreprisal for whistleblowing (5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1221-1222); (3) the \nEthics in Government Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-521, as amended; printed \nas an appendix to 5 U.S.C.); (4) Veterans benefits (including appeal \nrights to MSPB) (38 U.S.C.); and (5) the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n1938 (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 201 et seq.). Likewise, some of the right and \nprotections applicable to particular agencies or groups of employees \nbeing transferred to the Department are set forth in portions of the \nUnited States Code outside of part III of title 5, or were not enacted \nby Congress as incorporated into the United States Code at all, and \nthese rights and protections may not be waived by the HRMS.\n  While the waiver authority granted by section 841 is broad, the \nprovisions noted above and other provisions that may not be waived \nunder section 841 can afford significant protections against \npoliticization, arbitrary action, and abuse. The Secretary and the \nDirector must be scrupulous in not attempting to waive, modify, or \notherwise affect any provisions of law that are beyond the express \nwaiver authority, because such an attempt would violate section 841.\n  Labor-Management Relations. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7103(b)(1) states that the \nPresident may issue an executive order excluding any agency from \ncoverage under the Federal Sector Labor-Management Relations Statute \n(FSLMRS) if the President determines: that the agency has a primary \nfunction in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or \nnational security work, and that the provisions of the FSLMRS cannot be \napplied consistent with national security. Section 842 of H.R. 5005 \nbuilds on that existing provision by stating that, for the President to \nissue an executive order excluding an agency transferred to the \nDepartment, not only must the criteria in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7103(b)(1) be \nsatisfied, but also two additional clarifying criteria must be \nsatisfied: that the mission and responsibilities of the agency \nmaterially changed, and that a majority of the employees in the agency \nhave as their primary duty intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative work directly related to terrorism investigation.\n  That provision would provide employees at the Department some \nappropriate measure of stability in their labor relations, although the \nprovision is subject to a subsequent provision of section 842. The \nPresident can override the earlier provision if he determines that the \nearlier provision would have a substantial adverse impact on the \nDepartment's ability to protect homeland security, and provides \nCongress a detailed written finding explaining the reasons for the \ndetermination. The President has to give the Congress 10 days' advance \nnotice by submitting the written explanation. At the expiration of the \nten day period, the President would then have the power to issue an \nexecutive order under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7103(b)(1) under the criteria of \nthat section only.\n  I still fail to understand why any President would need to remove \ncollective bargaining rights from federal employees, whose union rights \nare very limited in comparison with the private sector, and who have a \nlong history of helping to protect the homeland and continue to do the \nsame protective work in the new Department. But if and when this \nPresident or a future President does move to eliminate collective \nbargaining within a unit of the Department, the President can take this \nstep only if it is truly essential to national security and homeland \nsecurity and not merely a convenience to management. This requires that \nthe Department's leadership must first make good-faith efforts to work \ncooperatively with the unions before the President can determine that \nunion representation is incompatible with national security or homeland \nsecurity.\n  And the written explanation that the President is required to provide \nto Congress must of course be thorough and specific. The requirement \nreflects a bipartisan concern that this Administration and future \nAdministrations must\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nmake the case for stripping workers of their right to bargain \ncollectively before issuing an Executive Order. The President must \nprovide Congress a comprehensive and specific explanation on the \nthreshold issue of how and why the right of workers in a particular \nagency or subdivision to collectively bargain would have a substantial \nadverse impact on homeland security.\n  Other provisions. Two other provisions of H.R. 5005 relating to human \nresources management warrant comment.\n  Section 881 requires that the Secretary, in consultation with the \nDirector of OPM, shall review the pay and benefit plans of each agency \ntransferred to the Department and, within 90 days, submit a plan to \nCongress for ensuring the elimination of disparities, especially among \nlaw enforcement personnel. Nothing in section 881 provides for how the \nelements of the plan shall be put into effect, however, so I believe it \nwould be desirable for the plan to identify the specific changes to \nlaw, regulation, and policy that would be needed to eliminate the \ndisparities, and make specific recommendations for effecting those \nchanges.\n  Section 1512(e) states that the Secretary, in regulations prescribed \njointly with the Director of OPM, may adopt the rules, procedures, \nterms and conditions established by statute, rule, or regulation before \nthe effective date of the Act in any agency transferred to the \nDepartment under the Act. This section 1512 contains the Savings \nProvisions for the reorganization effected by the Act, and subsection \n(e) is intended to enable the Secretary to keep a transferred agency \nsubject to the same rules, procedures, terms and conditions that \napplied to the agency before the transfer. This provision does not, of \ncourse, provide authority to the Secretary to take a provision that was \napplicable to one agency before the effective date and apply it to \nanother agency or other part of the Department.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, putting a significant piece of \nlegislation like this bill together is a difficult and time-consuming \ntask. Many Senators have played important roles in this legislation, \nbut the contributions of our staff members have also been of great \nsignificance. Without the aid of our staff members, little would get \ndone in this institution. I would like to take a moment to recognize \nthe hard work and dedication of just a few of the staff members who \ncontributed significantly to this legislation.\n  For the Majority, I want to recognize the contributions of Chairman \nLieberman's staff, especially his staff director, Joyce Rechtschaffen, \nand Laurie Rubenstein, Mike Alexander, Kiersten Coon, Holly Idelson, \nKevin Landy, Larry Novey, and Susan Propper. Also, let me acknowledge \nthe contributions of staff to the other members of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and of Sarah Walter of Senator Breaux's staff, David \nCulver of Senator Ben Nelson's staff, and Alex Albert of Senator \nMiller's staff.\n  IOn the Republican side, I must single out the work of Rohit Kumar of \nSenator Lott's Leadership staff. He has been the linchpin around whom \neverything got done. We would have no bill without his persistence, \ndiligence, and intellect. Mike Solon of Senator Gramm's staff also \nplaced a crucial role in developing the Gramm-Miller amendment on which \nmuch of the final legislation is based. David Morgenstern of Senator \nChafee's staff was also helpful.\n  Finally, let me recognize my own staff on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, who provided me with outstanding support. The successful \nadoption of this legislation is due to their hard work and constant \nefforts. Almost my entire staff was involved in some way or another \nwith this bill. I want to recognize the efforts of Richard Hertling, my \nstaff director on the Governmental Affairs Committee, who led the \neffort, and Libby Wood Jarvis, my legislative director. Other members \nof my staff whose assistance I wish to recognize are Ellen Brown, Bill \nOuthier, Mason Alinger, Alison Bean, John Daggett, Johanna Hardy, \nStephanie Henning, Morgan Muchnick, Jayson Roehl, Jana Sinclair, and \nElizabeth VanDersarl, along with Allen Lomax, a fellow in my office \nfrom the General Accounting Office.\n  Our staff members toil diligently and well, largely in anonymity. I \nthink it appropriate on occasion to recognize their work publicly, so \nthat Americans may share the knowledge of the members of this \ninstitution about how well served they are by our staff members.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to take this brief time \nto recognize the efforts of some of the staff members responsible for \nthis bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, soon after the vicious attacks of \nSeptember 11, it became clear that Congress needed to act on a \nbipartisan basis to win the war on terrorism and protect the country \nfrom future attack. Congress quickly approved strong bipartisan \nlegislation authorizing the use of force against the terrorists and \nthose who harbor them. It also enacted bipartisan legislation to \nprovide aid to victims and their families, to improve airport security, \nto give law enforcement and intelligence officials enhanced powers to \ninvestigate and prevent terrorism, to improve border security, and to \nstrengthen our defenses against bioterrorism.\n  The September 11 attacks also demonstrated the need to consolidate \noverlapping functions and establish clear and efficient organizational \nstructures within the Federal Government. I fully support these goals. \nReorganization without reform, however, will not work. It is not enough \nto consolidate different agency functions, if the underlying problems \nrelating to management, information sharing, and coordination are not \nalso addressed. And we do the Nation a disservice if, in the course of \nreorganizing the Government, we betray the ideals that America stands \nfor here at home and around the world.\n  We know that our Nation faces a very serious threat of terrorism. To \nprotect our national security in today's world, we need an immigration \nsystem that can carefully screen foreign nationals seeking to enter the \nUnited States and protect our Nation's borders. Our current Immigration \nand Naturalization Service is not up to these challenges. For years, \nINS has been unable to meet its dual responsibility to enforce our \nimmigration laws and to provide services to immigrants, refugees, and \naspiring citizens.\n  The Lieberman homeland security bill included bipartisan immigration \nreforms that were carefully designed to correct these problems and \nbring our immigration system into the 21st century. It untangled the \noverlapping and often confusing structure of the INS and replaced it \nwith two clear lines of command--one for enforcement and the other for \nservices. It also included a strong chief executive officer to ensure \naccountability, a uniform immigration policy, and effective \ncoordination between the service and the enforcement functions.\n  On these key issues, the Republican bill moves in exactly the wrong \ndirection. It transfers all immigration enforcement functions to the \nBorder and Transportation Security Directorate. Immigration service \nfunctions are relegated to the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration \nServices, which lacks its own Under Secretary. These agencies will have \nauthority to issue conflicting policies and conflicting interpretations \nof law. The formulation of immigration policy--our only chance to \nachieve coordination between these dispersed functions--will be subject \nto the conflicting views of various officials spread out in the new \nDepartment. With its failure to provide centralized coordination and \nlack of accountability, the Republican bill is a blueprint for failure.\n  The Republican bill also eliminates needed protections for children \nwho arrive alone in the United States. Often, these children have fled \nfrom armed conflict and abuses of human rights. They are traumatized \nand desperately need care and protection. The Lieberman bill included \nsafeguards, developed on a bipartisan basis, to ensure that \nunaccompanied alien children have the assistance of counsel and \nguardians in the course of their proceedings. Under this bill, \nimmigration proceedings will remain the only legal proceedings in the \nUnited States in which children are not provided the assistance of a \nguardian or court-appointed special advocate.\n  Finally, the Republican bill will seriously undermine the role of \nimmigration judges. Every day, immigration courts make life-altering \ndecisions.\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nThe interests at stake are significant, especially for persons facing \npersecution. We need an immigration court system that provides \nindividuals with a fair hearing before an impartial and independent \ntribunal, and meaningful appellate review. The Republican bill \nundermines the role and independence of the courts and the integrity of \nthe judicial process.\n  It vests the Attorney General with all-encompassing authority, \ndepriving immigration judges of their ability to exercise independent \njudgement. Even more disturbing, the bill gives the Attorney General \nthe authority to change or even eliminate appellate review. This result \nis a recipe for mistakes and abuse. An independent judicial system is \nessential to our system of checks and balances. Immigrants who face the \nseverest of consequences deserve their day in court.\n  Today, many Americans are concerned about the preservation of basic \nliberties protected by the Constitution. Clearly, as we work together \nto bring terrorists to justice and enhance our security, we must also \nact to preserve and protect our Constitution. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican bill undermines the civil rights and privacy safeguards that \nSenator Feingold and I worked to include in the Lieberman bill. In \nparticular, I am disappointed that the civil rights officer in the new \nDepartment will not be subject to Senate confirmation, and that there \nwill not be a designated official in the Inspector General's Office to \ninvestigate civil rights violations.\n  These changes to the civil rights and privacy safeguards are \nparticularly disturbing in light of the fact that the bill explicitly \nauthorizes the new Department to engage in the controversial practice \nof data mining. This practice allows the Government to establish a \nmassive data base containing public and private information, with files \non every American. The bill provides no language ensuring that the \nGovernment acts in compliance with Federal privacy laws and the \nConstitution.\n  On the issue of worker rights, we should remember that union members \nrisked and lost their lives and saved countless others through their \nactions on September 11. We will never forget the fine example that \nfirefighters, construction workers, and many Government workers set \nthat day. Union workers have also shown great bravery and sacrificed \nmightily in the service of homeland security since September 11. The \npostal workers and the hospital worker killed as a result of \nbioterrorism were all union members. The brave flight attendant whom \nthe President recognized in the State of the Union Address for \npreventing terrorism was a member of a union.\n  The dedication and resolve of these union members truly represents \nthe best of America. Over 43,000 of the Federal workers affected by the \nproposed Government reorganization are currently union members. On \nSeptember 11, unionized Federal workers played critical roles at both \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon as they worked round the clock \nto make our homeland secure. These are the workers who risk their lives \neach day to protect our Nation's borders.\n  This bill completely undermines the collective bargaining rights of \nthe unionized employees transferred to the new Department on whom our \nsecurity depends. It gives the President unlimited and unchecked \nauthority to eliminate those collective bargaining rights. He only \nneeds to claim that continued union rights would interfere with \nhomeland security. Federal workers will also have no opportunity to \nmeaningfully participate in creating the personnel system for the new \nDepartment. Moreover, this bill does not include any Davis-Bacon \nprotections, despite longstanding Federal policy that workers should be \npaid prevailing wages on Federal construction projects. This bill \ndisplays a contempt for the Federal workers who serve with dedication \nevery day to keep our Nation Safe.\n  Denying Federal workers fundamental rights will also undermine our \nNation's homeland security at a time when we can ill afford it. Among \nthe many lessons we have learned since September 11 about lapses in \nintelligence efforts connected with those events is that Federal \nworkers need protection to be able to speak out when they believe our \nNation's security is at risk. Without the protections afforded by a \nunion, Federal workers will be far less likely to speak out and protect \nthe public for fear of unjust retaliation.\n  The Republican bill's fundamental flaws were compounded to by the \nlast-minute addition of numerous special-interest provisions. These \nprovisions include the creation of new procedural barriers for the \nissuance of emergency security rules deemed essential to protect \ntravelers by the Transportation Security Agency; an earmark for a new \nhomeland security research center program at Texas A and an \nexemption from the open-meetings requirement of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act. The bill gives broad liability protection to \nmanufacturers of ``anti-terrorism technology'' for claims arising from \nacts of terrorism. This provision will reduce the incentive of industry \nto produce effective antiterrorism products and limit the ability of \nvictims to recover if future terrorist acts occur. It also shields from \nliability pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccine additives such \nas Thimerosal--the subject of pending litigation initiated by parents \nof autistic children. This provision has nothing to do with \nbioterrorism preparedness or homeland security--and everything to do \nwith rewarding a large contributor to the Republican Party.\n  While I agree with my Republican colleagues that we need to \nreorganize the Government in responses to the challenges that we now \nface, I cannot support the deeply flawed bill now before the Senate. In \ntoo many aspects, it misses the opportunity for real reform and is \nlikely to undermine, not strengthen, the security of our homeland.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nreject the pending Lieberman amendment to the homeland security bill. \nThis amendment will prevent the President from gaining the authorities \nhe needs to effectively deal with the very real and growing threat to \nour homeland. We should act, and act quickly. to give the President \nthis authority.\n  The current amendment would keep the President from addressing a key \nissue in providing protection to our homeland, that is, the issue of \nliability risk which must be resolved if the private sector is to \nactively provide innovative homeland defense technologies and \nsolutions. Some form of indemnification or limitation of lability has \nbeen a part of U.S., war efforts since World War II, as evidence by \ncongressional passage of the War Power Act of 1941 2 weeks after Pearl \nHarbor, and, since 1958, the use of the National Defense Contracts Act, \nor Public Law 85-804, to indemnify contracts issued by the Department \nof Defense and other national security agencies.\n  To address the current terrorist threat, I have worked on the \nliability issue with the High Technology Task Force under the \nleadership of Senators Allen and Bennett to fashion various solutions \nto enable America to access the best private sector products and \ntechnologies to defend our homeland. This is particularly important to \nthose innovative small businesses who do not have the capital to \nshoulder significant liability risk.\n  The Lieberman amendment would nullify the compromise recently worked \nout with the House to limit this liability risk through limited tort \nreform. The Lieberman amendment would not provide any alternative to \naddress the underlying problem. If this amendment passes what would be \nthe incentives for This amendment is contractors to provide innovative \nsolutions to our homeland security? For example, contractors will not \nsell chemical/biological detectors already available to DOD to other \nFederal agencies and State and local authorities because of the \nliability risk. Some of our Nation's top defense contractors will not \nsell these products because they are afraid to risk the future of their \ncompany on a lawsuit. There is an urgent need for authority to address \nthis situation.\n  While my earlier proposal on indemnification, which is another \napproach to addressing liability risk, is not included in the current \nbill, I believe that the compromise language will go a long way to \naddressing the problem. If it appears that additional authorities are \nnecessary to complement the language in this bill, I pledge to work in\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nthe coming Congress to provide any necessary authority that the Present \nneeds to ensure that innovative homeland defense technologies and \nsolutions are available to the Federal State and local governments, as \nwell as to the private sector.\n  I would also like to remark on the importance of Section 882 in the \nhomeland security legislation to create an Office for National Capital \nRegion Coordination within the new Department. This office will enable \nthe Washington metropolitan region to prevent and respond to future \nterrorist attacks by coordinating the efforts of the Federal Government \nwith state, local and regional authorities.\n  The September 11 attacks underscored the unique challenges the \nNational Capital Region faces. As the seat of our Nation's Government, \nthe location of many symbolic structures, the venue for many public \nevents attended by large numbers of people, a key tourism destination \npoint and home to thousands of Federal workers and lawmakers, it has \nbeen and may continue to be a prime location for potential future \nterrorist attacks.\n  The Washington metropolitan region needs a central Federal point of \ncoordination for the many entities in the region which must deal with \nthe Federal Government on issues of security. These authorities include \nthe Federal Government, Maryland, Virginia and the District of \nColumbia, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, the Military District of Washington, the \njudicial branch, the business community and the U.S. Congress. In no \nother area of the country must important decisionmaking and \ncoordination occur between an independent city, two States, seventeen \ndistinct local and regional authorities, including more than a dozen \nlocal police and Federal protective forces, and numerous Federal \nagencies.\n  A central Federal point of contact compliments the work of the \nMetropolitan Washington Council of Governments, COG, which established \na comprehensive all-sector task force to improve communication and \ncoordination when an incident of regional impact occurs. Currently, \nseveral Federal agencies have been involved in the task force, \nincluding the Office of Homeland Security, FEMA, the Office of \nPersonnel Management, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Military \nDistrict of Washington, the Department of Health and Human Services, \nthe U.S. Public Health Service, and the Centers for Disease Control. \nWithout a central Federal point of contact, it has been difficult, if \nnot impossible, for effective coordination to occur among the region \nand these many entities.\n\n  For example, the Continuity of Operations Plans for several federal \nagencies are instructing employees to use Metrorail and Metrobus \nservice in the event of an emergency. There is not a central Federal \ncontact, however, for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit \nAuthority, WMATA, to work with to ensure that the Federal Government's \nneeds are met and Federal employees are fully protected.\n  This new office within the Department of Homeland Security will \nresolve this problem by providing a much needed central Federal point \nof coordination. It will give all entities in the region a one-stop \nshop for dealing with the Federal Government on security issues, \nincluding plans and preparedness activities, including COG, WMATA, the \nGreater Washington Board of Trade and the Potomac Electric Power \nCompany, PEPCO, whose statements have appeared in previous versions of \nthe Congressional Record.\n  On behalf on the region's 5 million residents, I commend the House \nand Senate for recognizing the unique needs of our nation's capital in \npreventing and responding to terrorism by supporting creation of the \nOffice for National Capital Region Coordination.\n  Passage of legislation to create a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is crucial to our Nation's ability to respond to and prevent \npossible future terrorist attacks.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the idea of coordinating homeland \nsecurity functions in a cabinet-level department is a constructive one \nand a sounds one. In large part it originated in this body with \nlegislation offered by Senator Lieberman and Senator Specter, who \ndeserve great credit for their work. President Bush, after initially \nopposing this idea, also deserves credit for coming to understand its \nvalue and for reversing his administration's resistance to it.\n  In the several months that the Congress has spent in writing and \ndebating this complex bill, the issue has not been whether such a \ndepartment should be created, but how it should be created. The \nJudiciary Committee, which I chair, has played a constructive role in \nexamining these issues in our hearings and in providing guidance in the \nwriting of this bill, and I have supported and helped to advance the \nkey objectives envisioned for this new department. The fact that we are \non the verge of enacting a charter for the new department is good for \nthe Nation and our efforts to defend the American people against the \nthreats of terrorism. Many of the ``hows'' that have found their way \ninto this bill, and the process by which that has happened, are a \nneedless blot on this charter. As we act to approve this charter, we \nshould also feel obligated to remedy many of these ill-advised and ill-\nconsidered provisions in succeeding congressional sessions, through \ncorrective steps and through close oversight.\n  As they come to understand some of the imprudent extraneous additions \nto this bill, many Americans will feel that their trust and goodwill \nhave been abused, and I share their disappointment about several \nelements of this version of the bill that has been placed, without due \nconsideration, before the Senate. This deal, negotiated behind closed \ndoors by a few Republican leaders in the House and Senate and the White \nHouse, has been presented to us as a done deal. It includes several \nblatant flaws that should at the very least be debated. That is why I \ncould not vote for cloture to end debate on a bill almost 500-pages \nlong that was presented to us for the first time only five days ago, on \nNovember 14.\n  The bill undertakes a significant restructuring of the Federal \nGovernment by relocating in the new Department of Homeland Security \nseveral agencies, including the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nthe U.S. Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Coast Guard. In \naddition, many functions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives would be transferred to the Department of Justice.\n  Overall I support the President's conclusion that several government \nfunctions should be reorganized to improve our effectiveness in \ncombating terrorism and preserving our national security, although he \nhas been responsible for leading all of these agencies and fulfilling \ntheir responsibilities since assuming the Presidency in January 2001, \nand the President himself opposed significant reorganization until \nrecently. Homeland security functions are now dispersed among more than \n100 different governmental organizations. Testimony at a June 26, 2002, \nJudiciary Committee hearing illuminated the problem of such a confusing \npatchwork of agencies with none having homeland security as its sole or \neven primary mission. I had thought that the Department of Justice and \nFBI were the lead agencies responsible for the country's security in \n2001 and 2002, but I understand why the President has come to realize \nthat the lack of a single agency responsible for homeland security \nincreases both the potential for mistakes and opportunities for \nterrorists to exploit our vulnerabilities.\n\n  The bill will bring under one cabinet level officer agencies and \ndepartments that share overlapping missions for protecting our border, \nour financial and transportation infrastructure and responding to \ncrises. Having these agencies under a single cabinet level officer will \nhelp coordinate their efforts and focus their mission with a single \nline of authority to get the job done.\n  This is something that I support.\n  The bill also encourages information sharing. Our best defense \nagainst terrorism is improved communication and coordination among \nlocal, State, and Federal authorities; and between the U.S. and its \nallies. Through these efforts, led by the Federal government and with \nthe active assistance of many\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nothers in other levels of government and in the private sector, we can \nenhance our prevention efforts, improve our response mechanisms, and at \nthe same time ensure that funds allotted for protection against \nterrorism are being used most effectively.\n  The recent sniper rampage in the Washington, DC area demonstrated the \ndire need for such coordination among Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies. Fortunately, we were able to see the productive \nresults of effective information sharing and coordination with the \narrests of the two alleged snipers on October 31.\n  While we all support increased sharing of relevant information with \nthe new Department of Homeland Security by and among other Federal, \nState and local agencies, we must be careful that information sharing \ndoes not turn into information dumping. We want our law enforcement \nofficials to have the information they need to do their jobs \neffectively and efficiently, with communications equipment that allows \ndifferent agencies to talk to each other and with the appropriate \ntraining and tools so that multiple agencies are able to coordinate \ntheir responses during emergencies. We know that large amounts of \ninformation were collected, but never read or analyzed, before \nSeptember 11, and we know that translators and resources are what we \nneed to help make the already-gathered information useful.\n  There is no dispute that information sharing is critical, but we have \nto make sure we do not go overboard. Information dumping is harmful to \nour national security if the information is not accurate, complete, or \nrelevant, or if it is dumped in such a bulk fashion that end-users are \nunable to determine its reliability. The legislation before us provides \nvery broad authority for information collection from and sharing with \nnot just Federal, State and local law enforcement authorities, but also \nother government agencies, foreign government agencies and the private \nsector. Highly sensitive grand jury information, criminal justice, and \nelectronic, wire, and oral interception information is authorized to be \nshared to not just across this country but also around the world. \nWithout clear guidance, this sweeping new authority can be a recipe for \nmischief. The Congress now will have an imperative to monitor \nvigilantly and responsibly the implementation of this new authority to \nensure that the risks to the privacy of the American people and the \npotential for abuse do not become a reality.\n\n  This bill contains several constructive provisions, including \nestablishment in the new Department of a Privacy Office and an Office \nfor Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The bill also includes the \nSessions-Leahy bill, S. 3073, and whistleblower protections that the \nadministration's original proposal rejected. In addition, as I will \ndiscuss in more detail in these remarks, the bill includes a \nprohibition on both the TIPS Program and a national identification \nsystem or card.\n  I am pleased the bill, in section 880, forbids the creation of \nOperation TIPS, a proposed citizen reporting program theoretically \ndesigned to prevent terrorism. The ill-designed program threatened to \nturn neighbors into spies and to discredit valuable neighborhood watch \nprograms. When I questioned the Attorney General about the program \nearlier this year, I found his answers to be incomplete and far from \nreassuring. As such, I was prepared to offer an amendment in the Senate \nto bar Operation TIPS, and I welcome the House's strong opposition to \nthe program that has made my amendment unnecessary.\n  Under the plan originally announced by the Justice Department, \nOperation TIPS would have enlisted millions of Americans as volunteers \nwho would report their suspicions about their neighbors and customers \nto the government. This plan was criticized by Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, and Justice Department officials then said they \nplanned to make the program smaller than originally anticipated. But \nthe Department never made clear how the program would work, what it \nwould cost, or how the privacy interests of American citizens would be \nprotected.\n  Indeed, the administration offered a constantly shifting set of \nexplanations to Congress and the public about how Operation TIPS would \nwork, leaving Congress unable even to evaluate a program that could \neasily lead to the invasion of the privacy of our fellow Americans. \nEven the Operations TIPS website offered differing explanations of how \nthe program would work, depending on what day a concerned user accessed \nit. For example, before July 25, the web site said that Operation TIPS \n``involving 1 million workers in the pilot stage, will be a national \nreporting system that allows these workers, whose routines make them \nwell-positioned to recognize unusual events, to report suspicious \nactivity.'' By contrast, the July 25 version declared that ``the \nprogram will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily \ncourse of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially \nunusual or suspicious activity in public places.'' It was unclear \nwhether these changes reflected actual changes in the Justice \nDepartment's plans, or whether they were simply cosmetic differences \ndesigned to blunt opposition to the program raised by concerned \ncitizens, newspaper editorials, and Members of Congress.\n  The administration originally proposed Operation TIPS as ``a \nnationwide program giving millions of American truckers, letter \ncarriers, train conductors, ship captains, utility employees, and \nothers a formal way to report suspicious terrorist activity.'' In other \nwords, the administration would recruit people whose jobs gave them \naccess to private homes to report on any ``suspicious'' activities they \ndiscovered. Nor would this program start small; the Administration \nplanned a pilot program that alone would have enlisted 1 million \nAmericans.\n\n  We also never received a full understanding of how the Administration \nplanned to train Operation TIPS volunteers. The average citizen has \nlittle knowledge of law enforcement methods, or of the sort of \ninformation that is useful to those working to prevent terrorism. Such \na setup could have allowed unscrupulous participants to abuse their new \nstatus to place innocent neighbors under undue scrutiny. The number of \npeople who would have abused this opportunity is undoubtedly small, but \nthe damage these relatively few could do would be very real and \npotentially devastating. In addition, it was crucial that citizen \nvolunteers receive training about the permissible use of race and \nethnicity in their evaluation of whether a particular individual's \nbehavior is suspicious, but the Justice Department seemed not to have \nconsidered the issue.\n  Even participants acting in good faith may have been prone to report \nactivity that would not be suspicious to a well-trained professional. \nOne law enforcement agencies are already operating under heavy burdens, \nand I questioned the usefulness of bombarding them with countless tips \nfrom millions of volunteers. As the Washington Post put it in a July \neditorial: ``It is easy to imagine how such a program might produce \nlittle or no useful information but would flood law enforcement with \nendless suspicions that would divert authorities from more promising \ninvestigative avenues.''\n  The administration's plan also raised important questions about how \nand whether information submitted by TIPS volunteers would be retained. \nMany of us were deeply concerned about the creation of a TIPS database \nthat would retain TIPS reports indefinitely. When he testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee in July, the Attorney General said that he, \ntoo, was concerned about this. He told us that he had been given \nassurances that there would be no database, but he could not tell us \nwho had given him those assurances. Many months later, the \nadministration's plans on this issue still are unclear. We simply \ncannot allow a program that will use databases to store unsubstantiated \nallegations against American citizens to move forward.\n  Opposition to Operation TIPS has been widespread. Representative \nArmey, the House Majority Leader, has led the fight against it in the \nHouse. The Postal Service refused to participate. The Boston Globe \ncalled it a scheme Joseph Stalin would have loved. In an editorial, The \nNew York Times said: ``If TIPS is ever put into effect, the first \npeople who should be turned in as a threat to our way of life are the \nJustice Department officials who thought up this most un-American of \nprograms.'' The Las Vegas Sun said that ``Operation TIPS has the \npotential\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nof becoming a monster.'' The Washington Post said that the \nAdministration ``owes a fuller explanation before launch day.''\n  In evaluating TIPS, we need to remember our past experience with \nenlisting citizen informants on such a grand scale. During World War I, \nthe Department of Justice established the American Protective League, \nAPL, which enrolled 250,000 citizens in at least 600 cities and towns \nto report suspicious conduct and investigate fellow citizens. For \nexample, the League spied on workers and unions in thousands of \nindustrial plants with defense contracts and organized raids on German-\nlanguage newspapers. Members wore badges and carried ID cards that \nshowed their connection to the Justice Department and were even used to \nmake arrests. Members of the League used such methods as tar and \nfeathers, beatings, and forcing those who were suspected of disloyalty \nto kiss the flag. The New York Bar Association issued a report after \nthe war stating of the APL: ``No other one cause contributed so much to \nthe oppression of innocent men as the systematic and indiscriminate \nagitation against what was claimed to be an all-pervasive system of \nGerman espionage.'' No one wants to relive those dark episodes or \nanything close to them.\n\n  I am pleased that we have achieved bicameral and bipartisan agreement \nthat Operation TIPS goes too far, infringing on the liberties of the \nAmerican people while promising little benefit for law enforcement \nefforts. If the administration comes to Congress with a limited, \ncommon-sense proposal that respects liberties, Congress will likely \nsupport it. But Congress cannot simply write a blank check for such a \ntroubled program.\n  I am also pleased that the bill, in section 1514, states clearly that \nnothing in the legislation shall be construed to authorize the \ndevelopment of a national identification system or card. Given the \nother provisions in the bill that pose a risk to our privacy, this at \nleast is a line in the sand which I fully support.\n  The House-passed bill also includes, in section 601, a provision that \nSenator Sessions and I introduced last month as S.3073. This provision \nwill facilitate private charitable giving for servicemen and other \nFederal employees who are killed in the line of duty while engaged in \nthe fight against international terrorism. Under current law, \nbeneficiaries of members of the U.S. Armed Forces get paid only $6,000 \nin death benefits from the government, over any insurance that they may \nhave purchased. Moreover, these individuals may not be eligible for \npayments from any existing victims' compensation program or charitable \norganization. The Session-Leahy provision will provide much-needed \nsupport for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor their country. It encourages the establishment of charitable trusts \nfor the benefit of surviving spouses and dependents of military, CIA, \nFBI, and other Federal Government employees who are killed in \noperations or activities to curb international terrorism. This \nprovision also authorizes Federal officials to contact qualifying \ntrusts on behalf of surviving spouses and dependents, pursuant to \nregulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. This will \nhelp to inform survivors about benefits and to ensure that those who \nare eligible have the opportunity to access the money. It will also \nspare grieving widows the embarrassment of having to go to a charity \nand ask for money. Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, this provision \nmakes clear that Federal officeholders and candidates may help raise \nfunds for qualifying trusts without running afoul of federal campaign \nfinance laws.\n  I am also pleased that, unlike the President's original, the current \nbill would ensure that employees of the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity will have all the same whistleblower protections as employees \nin the rest of the Federal Government. As we saw during the many \nFBI oversight hearings that the Judiciary Committee has held over the \nlast 15 months, strong whistleblower protection is an important \nhomeland security measure in itself.\n\n  Indeed, it was whistleblower revelations that helped lead to the \ncreation of this Department. The President was vehemently opposed to \ncreating the new Department of Homeland Security for 9 months after the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Then, just minutes before FBI whistleblower \nColeen Rowley came before the Judiciary Committee in a nationally \ntelevised appearance to expose potential shortcomings in the FBI's \nhandling of the Zacarias Moussaoui case before 9/11, the White House \nannounced that it had changed its position and that the creation of a \nnew cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security was vital. Of course, \nthat made it all the more ironic that the President's original proposal \ndid not assure whistleblower protections in the new Department.\n  In any event, although the new Department has the same legal \nprotections as those that apply in the rest of the government, the \nprotections will mean nothing without the vigorous enforcement of these \nlaws by the administration. The leadership of the new Department and \nthe Office of Special Counsel must work to encourage a culture that \ndoes not punish whistleblowers, and the Congress--including the \nJudiciary Committee--must continue to vigorously oversee the new and \nother administrative departments to make sure that this happens.\n  While I am glad that the many employees of the new Department will \nhave the same substantive and procedural whistleblower protections as \nother government employees, I wish that we could have done more. \nUnfortunately, a Federal court with a monopoly on whistleblower cases \nthat is hostile to such claims has improperly and narrowly interpreted \nthe provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Senators Grassley, \nLevin, Akaka and I had proposed a bipartisan amendment to this measure \nthat would have strengthened whistleblower protections in order to \nprotect national security. The amendment was similar to S. 995, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, and our amendment would have corrected some of \nthe anomalies in the current law. It is unfortunate for the success of \nthe Department and for the security of the American people that the \namendment was not part of the final measure, and I hope that we can \nwork to pass S. 995 in the 108th Congress.\n  The administration was slow to accept the idea for a cabinet-level \ndepartment to coordinate homeland security, but experience in the \nmonths after the September 11 attacks helped in the evolution of the \nAdministration's position. Soon after the President invited Governor \nRidge to serve as the Director of an Office of Homeland Security within \nthe White House, I invited Governor Ridge in October, 2001, to testify \nbefore the Judiciary Committee about how he would improve the \ncoordination of law enforcement and intelligence efforts and about his \nviews on the role of the National Guard in carrying out the homeland \nsecurity mission, but he declined our invitation at that time. The \nadministration would not allow Director Ridge to testify before \nCongress.\n  Without Governor Ridge's input, the Judiciary Committee continued \noversight work that had begun in the summer of 2001, before the \nterrorist attacks, on improving the effectiveness of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, the lead Federal agency with responsibility for \ndomestic security. This task has involved oversight hearings with the \nAttorney General and with officials of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the \nweeks immediately after the attacks, the committee turned its attention \nto hearings on legislative proposals to enhance the legal tools \navailable to detect, investigate and prosecute those who threaten \nAmericans both here and abroad. Committee members worked in partnership \nwith the White House and the House to craft the new anti-terrorism law, \nthe USA PATRIOT Act, which was enacted on October 26, 2001.\n\n  We were prepared to include in the new anti-terrorism law provisions \ncreating a new cabinet-level officer heading a new Department of \nHomeland Security, but we did not do so at the request of the White \nHouse. Indeed, from September, 2001, until June, 2002, the \nadministration was steadfastly opposed to the creation of a cabinet-\nlevel department to protect homeland security. Governor Ridge said in \nan interview with National Journal reporters in May, 2001, that if \nCongress put a bill on the President's desk to make his position \nstatutory, he would, ``probably\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\nrecommend that he veto it.'' That same month, White House spokesman Ari \nFleischer also objected to a new department, commenting that, ``You \nstill will have agencies within the Federal government that have to be \ncoordinated. So the answer is: Creating a Cabinet post doesn't solve \nanything.''\n  In one respect, the White House was correct: Simply moving agencies \naround among departments does not address the problems inside agencies \nlike the FBI or the INS--problems like outdated computers, hostility to \nemployees who report problems, lapses in intelligence sharing, and lack \nof translation and analytical capabilities, along with what many have \ntermed ``cultural problems.'' The Judiciary Committee and its \nsubcommittees have been focusing on identifying those problems and \nfinding constructive solutions to fix them. We have worked hard to be \nbipartisan and even nonpartisan in this regard. To that end, the \nCommittee unanimously reported the Leahy-Grassley FBI Reform Act, S. \n1974, to improve the FBI, especially at this time when the country \nneeds the FBI to be as effective as it can be in the war against \nterrorism. Unfortunately, that bill has been blocked on the Senate \nfloor since it was reported by the Judiciary Committee in April, 2002, \nby an anonymous Republican hold.\n  The White House's about-face on June 6, 2002, announced just minutes \nbefore the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing with FBI Special \nAgent Coleen Rowley, telegraphed the President's new support for the \nformation of a new homeland Security Department along the lines that \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Specter had long suggested.\n  Two weeks later, on June 18, 2002, Governor Ridge transmitted a \nlegislative proposal to create a new homeland security department. It \nshould be apparent that knitting together a new agency will not by \nitself fix existing problems. In writing the charter for this new \ndepartment, we must be careful not to generate new management problems \nand accountability issues. Yet the administration's early proposal \nwould have exempted the new department from many legal requirements \nthat apply to other agencies. The Freedom of Information Act would not \napply, nor would the conflicts of interest and accountability rules for \nagency advisors. The new department head would have the power to \nsuspend the Whistleblower Protection Act and the normal procurement \nrules and to intervene in Inspector General investigations. In these \nrespects, the administration asked us to put this new department above \nthe law and outside the checks and balances these laws are there to \nensure.\n\n  Exempting the new department from laws that ensure accountability to \nthe Congress and to the American people makes for soggy ground and a \ntenuous start--not the sure footing we all want for the success and \nendurance of this endeavor.\n  We all wanted to work with the President to meet his ambitious \ntimetable for setting up the new department. Senate Democrats worked \ndiligently to craft responsible legislation that would establish a new \ndepartment but would also make sure that it was not outside the laws. \nWe all knew that one sure way to slow up the legislation would be to \nuse the new department as the excuse to undermine or repeal laws not \nliked by partisan interests, or to stick unrelated political items in \nthe bill under the heading of ``management flexibility.'' \nUnfortunately, the Republican leadership and the White House have been \nunable to resist that temptation, even as they urge prompt passage of a \nbill unveiled for the first time only 5 days ago.\n  This bill has its problems. As I will discuss in more detail in the \nbalance of my remarks, this legislation has five significant problems. \nIt would: (1) undermine Federal and State sunshine laws permitting the \nAmerican people to know what their government is doing, (2) threaten \nprivacy rights, (3) provide sweeping liability protections for \ncompanies at the expense of consumers, (4) weaken rather than fix our \nimmigration enforcement problems, and (5) under the guise of \n``management flexibility,'' it would authorize political cronyism \nrather than professionalism within the new department. These problems \nare unfortunate and entirely unnecessary to the overall objective of \nestablishing a new department of homeland security. Republican leaders \nand the White House have forced on the Senate a process under which \nthese problem areas cannot be substantively and meaningfully addressed, \nand that is highly regrettable and a needless blot on this charter. \nThough I will support passage of this legislation in order to get the \nnew department up and running, the flaws in this legislation will \nrequire our attention next year, when I hope to work with the \nadministration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to monitor \nimplementation of the new law and to craft corrective legislation.\n  First, the bill guts the FOIA at the expense of our national security \nand public health and safety. This bill eliminates a bipartisan Senate \nprovision that I crafted with Senator Levin and Senator Bennett to \nprotect the public's right to use the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, \nin order to find out what our Government is doing, while simultaneously \nproviding security to those in the private sector that records \nvoluntarily submitted to help protect our critical infrastructures will \nnot be publicly disclosed. Encouraging cooperation between the private \nsector and the government to keep our critical infrastructure systems \nsafe from terrorist attacks is a goal we all support. But the \nappropriate way to meet this goal is a source of great debate--a debate \nthat has been all but ignored by the Republicans who crafted this \nlegislation.\n  The administration itself has flip-flopped on how to best approach \nthis issue. The administration's original June 18, 2002, legislative \nproposal establishing a new department carved out of FOIA exemption, in \nsection 204, and required non-disclosure of any \n``information'' ``voluntarily'' provided to the new Department of \nHomeland Security by ``non-Federal entities or individuals'' pertaining \nto ``infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to \nterrorism'' in the possession of, or that passed through, the new \ndepartment. Critical terms, such as ``voluntarily provided,'' were \nundefined.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to query Governor Ridge \nabout the administration's proposal on June 26, 2002, when the \nadministration reversed its long-standing position and allowed him to \ntestify in his capacity as the Director of the Transition Planning \nOffice.\n  Governor Ridge's testimony at that hearing is instructive. He seemed \nto appreciate the concerns expressed by Members about the President's \nJune 18th proposal and to be willing to work with us in the legislative \nprocess to find common ground. On the FOIA issue, he described the \nAdministration's goal to craft ``a limited statutory exemption to the \nFreedom of Information Act'' to help ``the Department's most important \nmissions [which] will be to protect our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure.'' (June 26, 2002 Hearing, Tr., p. 24). Governor Ridge \nexplained that to accomplish this, the Department must be able to \n``collect information, identifying key assets and components of that \ninfrastructure, evaluate vulnerabilities, and match threat assessments \nagainst those vulnerabilities.'' (Id., at p. 23).\n  I do not understand why some have insisted that FOIA and our national \nsecurity are inconsistent. The FOIA already exempts from disclosure \nmatters that are classified; trade secret, commercial and financial \ninformation, which is privileged and confidential; various law \nenforcement records and information, including confidential source and \ninformant information; and FBI records pertaining to foreign \nintelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism. These \nalready broad exemptions in the FOIA are designed to protect national \nsecurity and public safety and to ensure that the private sector can \nprovide needed information to the government.\n  Current law already exempts from disclosure any financial or \ncommercial information provided voluntarily to the government, if it is \nof a kind that the provider would not customarily make available to the \npublic. Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871 (D.C. Cir. \n1992) (en banc). Such information enjoys even stronger nondisclosure \nprotections than does material that the government requests. Applying \nthis exception, Federal regulatory\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nagencies are today safeguarding the confidentiality of all kinds of \ncritical infrastructure information, like nuclear power plant safety \nreports (Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 874), information about product \nmanufacturing processes land internal security measures (Bowen v. Food \n& Drug Admin., 925 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir. 1991), design drawings of \nairplane parts (United Technologies Corp. by Pratt & Whitney v. F.A.A., \n102 F.3d 6878 (2d Cir. 1996)), and technical data for video \nconferencing software (Gilmore v. Dept. of Energy, 4 F. Supp.2d 912 \n(N.D. Cal. 1998)).\n  The head of the FBI National Infrastructure Protection Center, NIPC, \ntestified more than 5 years ago, in September, 1998, that the ``FOIA \nexcuse'' used by some in the private sector for failing to share \ninformation with the government was, in essence, baseless. He explained \nthe broad application of FOIA exemptions to protect from disclosure \ninformation received in the context of a criminal investigation or a \n``national security intelligence'' investigation, including information \nsubmitted confidentially or even anonymously. [Sen. Judiciary \nSubcommittee On Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, \nHearing on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Toward a New Policy \nDirective, S. HRG. 105-763, March 17 and June 10, 1998, at p. 107]\n  The FBI also used the confidential business record exemption under \n(b)(4) ``to protect sensitive corporate information, and has, on \nspecific occasions, entered into agreements indicating that it would do \nso prospectively with reference to information yet to be received.'' \nNIPC was developing policies ``to grant owners of information certain \nopportunities to assist in the protection of the information (e.g., \n`sanitizing the information themselves') and to be involved in \ndecisions regarding further dissemination by the NIPC.'' Id. In short, \nthe former administration witness stated: ``Sharing between the private \nsector and the government occasionally is hampered by a perception in \nthe private sector that the government cannot adequately protect \nprivate sector information from disclosure under the Freedom of \nInformation Act (FOIA). The NIPC believes that this perception is \nflawed in that both investigative and infrastructure protection \ninformation submitted to NIPC are protected from FOIA disclosure under \ncurrent law.'' (Id.)\n  Nevertheless, for more than 5 years, businesses have continued to \nseek a broad FOIA exemption that also comes with special legal \nprotections to limit their civil and criminal liability, and special \nimmunity from the antitrust laws. The Republicans are largely granting \nthis business wish-list in the legislation for the new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Governor Ridge, I \nexpressed my concern that an overly broad FOIA exemption would \nencourage government complicity with private firms to keep secret \ninformation about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, reduce the \nincentive to fix the problems and end up hurting rather than helping \nour national security. In the end, more secrecy may undermine rather \nthan foster security.\n  Governor Ridge seemed to appreciate these risks, and said he was \n``anxious to work with the Chairman and other members of the committee \nto assure that the concerns that [had been] raised are properly \naddressed.'' Id. at p. 24. He assured us that ``[t]his Administration \nis ready to work together with you in partnership to get the job done. \nThis is our priority, and I believe it is yours as well.'' Id. at p. \n25. This turned out to be an empty promise.\n  Almost before the ink was dry on the administration's earlier June \nproposal, on July 10, 2002, the administration proposed to substitute a \nmuch broader FOIA exemption that would (1) exempt from disclosure under \nthe FOIA critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to \nthe new department that was designated as confidential by the submitter \nunless the submitter gave prior written consent, (2) provide limited \ncivil immunity for use of the information in civil actions against the \ncompany, with the likely result that regulatory actions would be \npreceded by litigation by companies that submitted designated \ninformation to the department over whether the regulatory action was \nprompted by a confidential disclosure, (3) preempt State sunshine laws \nif the designated information is shared with State or local government \nagencies, (4) impose criminal penalties of up to one year imprisonment \non Government employees who disclosed the designated information, and \n(5) antitrust immunity for companies that joined together with agency \ncomponents designated by the President to promote critical \ninfrastructure security.\n  Despite the administration's promulgation of two separate proposals \nfor a new FOIA exemption in as many weeks, in July, Director Ridge's \nOffice of Homeland Security released The National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity, which appeared to call for more study of the issue before \nlegislating. Specifically, this report called upon the Attorney General \nto ``convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to enable \nsharing of essential homeland security information between the \ngovernment and the private sector.'' (p. 33)\n\n  The need for more study of the administration's proposed new FOIA \nexemption was made amply clear by its possible adverse environmental, \npublic health and safety affects. Keeping secret problems in a variety \nof critical infrastructures would simply remove public pressure to fix \nthe problems. Moreover, several environmental groups pointed out that, \nunder the administration's proposal, companies could avoid enforcement \naction by ``voluntarily'' providing information about environmental \nviolations to the EPA, which would then be unable to use the \ninformation to hold the company accountable and also would be required \nto keep the information confidential. It would bar the government from \ndisclosing information about spills or other violations without the \nwritten consent of the company that caused the pollution.\n  I worked on a bipartisan basis with many interested stakeholders from \nenvironmental, civil liberties, human rights, business and government \nwatchdog groups to craft a compromise FOIA exemption that did not grant \nthe business sector's wish-list but did provide additional \nnondisclosure protections for certain records without jeopardizing the \npublic health and safety. At the request of Chairman Lieberman for the \nJudiciary Committee's views on the new department, I shared my concerns \nabout the administration's proposed FOIA exemption and then worked with \nMembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee, in particular Senator \nLevin and Senator Bennett, to craft a more narrow and responsible \nexemption that accomplishes the Administration's goal of encouraging \nprivate companies to share records of critical infrastructure \nvulnerabilities with the new Department of Homeland Security without \nproviding incentives to ``game'' the system of enforcement of \nenvironmental and other laws designed to protect our nation's public \nhealth and safety. We refined the FOIA exemption in a manner that \nsatisfied the Administration's stated goal, while limiting the risks of \nabuse by private companies or government agencies.\n  This compromise solution was supported by the administration and \nother members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs and was \nunanimously adopted by that Committee at the markup of the Homeland \nSecurity Department bill on July 24, 2002. The provision would exempt \nfrom the FOIA certain records pertaining to critical infrastructure \nthreats and vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new \nDepartment and designated by the provider as confidential and not \ncustomarily made available to the public. Notably, the compromise FOIA \nexemption made clear that the exemption only covered ``records'' from \nthe private sector, not all `'information'' provided by the private \nsector and thereby avoided the adverse result of government agency-\ncreated and generated documents and databases being put off-limits to \nthe FOIA simply if private sector ``information'' is incorporated. \nMoreover, the compromise FOIA exemption clearly defined what records \nmay be considered ``furnished voluntarily,'' which did not cover \nrecords used ``to satisfy any legal requirement or obligation to obtain \nany grant, permit, benefit (such as agency forbearances, loans, or \nreduction or modifications of agency penalties or rulings), or other\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\napproval from the Government.'' The FOIA compromise exemption further \nensured that portions of records that are not covered by the exemption \nwould be released pursuant to FOIA requests. This compromise did not \nprovide any civil liability or antitrust immunity that could be used to \nimmunize bad actors or frustrate regulatory enforcement enforcement \naction, nor did the compromise preempt state or local sunshine laws.\n  Unfortunately, the new Republican version of this legislation that we \nare voting on today jettisoned the bipartisan compromise on the FOIA \nexemption, worked out in the Senate with the administration's support, \nand replaced it with a big-business wish-list gussied up in security \ngarb. The Republican FOIA exemption would make off-limits to the FOIA \nmuch broader categories of ``information'' and grant businesses the \nlegal immunities and liability protections they have sought so \nvigorously for over 5 years. This bill goes far beyond what is needed \nto achieve the laudable goal of encouraging private sector companies to \nhelp protect our critical infrastructure. Instead, it will tie the \nhands of the federal regulators and law enforcement agencies working to \nprotect the public from imminent threats. It will give a windfall to \ncompanies who fail to follow Federal health and safety standards. Most \ndisappointingly, it will undermine the goals of openness in government \nthat the FOIA was designed to achieve. In short, the FOIA exemption in \nthis bill represents the most severe weakening of the Freedom of \nInformation Act in its 36-year history.\n  In the end, the broad secrecy protections provided to critical \ninfrastructure information in this bill will promote more secrecy which \nmay undermine rather than foster national security. In addition, the \nimmunity provisions in the bill will frustrate enforcement of the laws \nthat protect the public's health and safety.\n  Let me explain. The Republican FOIA exemption would allow companies \nto stamp or designate certain information as ``Critical Infrastructure \nInformation'' or ``CII'' and then submit this information about their \noperations to the government either in writing or orally, and thereby \nobtain a blanket shield from FOIA's disclosure mandates as well as \nother protections. A Federal agency may not disclose or use \nvoluntarily-submitted and CII-marked information, except for a limited \n``informational purpose,'' such as ``analysis, warning, \ninterdependency, study, recovery, reconstitution,'' without the \ncompany's consent. Even when using the information to warn the public \nabout potential threats to critical infrastructure, the bill requires \nagencies to take steps to protect from disclosure the source of the CII \ninformation and other ``business sensitive'' information.\n  The bill contains an unprecedented provision that threatens jail time \nand job loss to any Government employee who happens to disclose any \ncritical infrastructure information that a company has submitted and \nwants to keep secret. These penalties for using the CII information in \nan unauthorized fashion or for failing to take steps to protect \ndisclosure of the source of the information are severe and will chill \nany release of CII information not just when a FOIA request comes in, \nbut in all situations, no matter the circumstance. Criminalizing \ndisclosures--not of classified information or national security related \ninformation, but of information that a company decides it does not want \npublic--is an effective way to quash discussion and debate over many \naspects of the Government's work. In fact, under this bill, CII \ninformation would be granted more comprehensive protection under \nFederal criminal laws than classified information.\n  This provision has potentially disastrous consequences. If an agency \nis given information from an ISP about cyberattack vulnerabilities, \nagency employees will have to think twice about sharing that \ninformation with other ISPs for fear that, without the consent of the \nISP to use the information, even a warning might cost their jobs or \nrisk criminal prosecution.\n\n  This provision means that if a Federal regulatory agency needs to \nissue a regulation to protect the public from threats of harm, it \ncannot rely on any voluntarily submitted information--bringing the \nnormal regulatory process to a grinding halt. Public health and law \nenforcement officials need the flexibility to decide how and when to \nwarn or prepare the public in the safest, most effective manner. They \nshould not have to get ``sign off'' from a Fortune 500 company to do \nso.\n  While this legislation risks making it harder for the Government to \nprotect American families, it will make it much easier for companies to \nescape responsibility when they violate the law by giving them \nunprecedented immunity from civil and regulatory enforcement actions. \nOnce a business declares that information about its practices relates \nto critical infrastructure and is ``voluntarily'' provided, it can then \nprevent the Federal Government from disclosing it not just to the \npublic, but also to a court in a civil action. This means that an \nagency receiving CII-marked submissions showing invasions of employee \nor customer privacy, environmental pollution, or government contracting \nfraud will be unable to use that information in a civil action to hold \nthat company accountable. Even if the regulatory agency obtains the \ninformation necessary to bring an enforcement action from an \nalternative source, the company will be able to tie the government up \nin protracted litigation over the source of the information.\n  For example, if a company submits information that its factory is \nleaching arsenic in ground water, that information may not be turned \nover to local health authorities to use in any enforcement proceeding \nnor turned over to neighbors who were harmed by drinking the water for \nuse in a civil tort action. Moreover, even if EPA tries to bring an \naction to stop the company's wrongdoing, the ``use immunity'' provided \nin the Republican bill will tie the agency up in litigation making it \nprove where it got the information and whether it is tainted as ``fruit \nof the poisonous tree''--i.e., obtained from the company under the \n``critical infrastructure program.''\n  Similarly, if the new Department of Homeland Security receives \ninformation from a bio-medical laboratory about its security \nvulnerabilities, and anthrax is released from the lab three weeks \nlater, the Department will not be able to warn the public promptly \nabout how to protect itself without consulting with and trying to get \nconsent of the laboratory in order to avoid the risk of job loss or \ncriminal prosecution for a non-consensual disclosure. Moreover, if the \nlaboratory is violating any State, local or Federal regulation in its \nhandling of the anthrax, the Department will not be able to turn over \nto another Federal agency, such as the EPA or the Department of Health \nand Human Services, or to any State or local health officials, \ninformation or documents relating to the laboratory's mishandling of \nthe anthrax for use in any enforcement proceedings against the \nlaboratory, or in any wrongful death action, should the laboratory's \nmishandling of the anthrax result in the death of any person. The bill \nspecifically states that such CII-marked information ``shall not, \nwithout the written consent of the person or entity submitting such \ninformation, be used directly by such agency, any other Federal, State, \nor local authority, or any third party, in any civil action arising \nunder Federal or State law if such information is submitted in good \nfaith.'' [H.R. 5710, section 214(a)(1)(C)]\n  Most businesses are good citizens and take seriously their \nobligations to the government and the public, but this ``disclose-and-\nimmunize'' provision is subject to abuse by those businesses that want \nto exploit legal techniques to avoid regulatory guidelines. This bill \nlays out the perfect blueprint to avoid legal liability: funnel \ndamaging information into this voluntary disclosure system and pre-empt \nthe Government or others harmed by the company's actions from being \nable to use it against the company. This is not the kind of two-way \npublic-private cooperation that our country needs.\n\n  The scope of the information that would be covered by the new \nRepublican FOIA exemption is overly broad and would undermine the \nopenness in government that FOIA was intended to guarantee. Under this \nlegislation, information about virtually every important sector of our \neconomy that today the public has a right to see can shut off from \npublic view simply by labeling\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nit ``critical infrastructure information.'' Today, for example, under \ncurrent FOIA standards, courts have required Federal agencies to \ndisclose (1) pricing information in contract bids so citizens can make \nsure the government is wisely spending their taxpayer dollars; (2) \ncompliance reports that allow constituents to insist that government \ncontractors comply with federal equal opportunity mandates; and (3) \nbanks' financial data so the public can ensure that federal agencies \nproperly approve bank mergers. Without access to this kind of \ninformation, it will be harder for the public to hold its Government \naccountable. Under this bill, all of this information may be marked CII \ninformation and kept out of public view.\n  The Republican FOIA exemption goes so far in exempting such large \namount of material from FOIA's disclosure requirements that it \nundermines Government openness without making any real gains in safety \nfor families in Vermont and across America. We do not keep America \nsafer by chilling Federal officials from warning the public about \nthreats to their health and safety. We do not ensure our nation's \nsecurity by refusing to tell the American people whether or not their \nfederal agencies are doing their jobs or their Government is spending \ntheir hard earned tax dollars wisely. We do not encourage real two-way \ncooperation by giving companies protection from civil liability when \nthey break the law. We do not respect the spirit of our democracy when \nwe cloak in secrecy the workings of our Government from the public we \nare elected to serve.\n  Notably, another part of the bill, section 892, would further \nundermine Government sunshine laws by authorizing the President to \nprescribe and implement procedures requiring Federal agencies to \n``identify and safeguard homeland security information that is \nsensitive but unclassified'' The precise type of information that would \nbe covered by this new category of ``sensitive'' information that is \nnot classified but subject to carte blanche executive authority to keep \nsecret is not defined and no guidance is provided in the Republican \nbill as to how far the President may go.\n  As the Rutland Herald so aptly put it in an editorial on November 16, \nthe Republicans ``are moving to cloak the Federal Government in an \nunprecedented regime of secrecy.'' The argument over the scope of the \nFOIA and unilateral executive power to shield matters from public \nscrutiny goes to the heart of our fundamental right to be an educated \nelectorate aware of what our government is doing. The Rutland Herald \ngot it right in explaining. ``The battle was not over the right of the \ngovernment to hold sensitive, classified information secret. The \ngovernment has that right. Rather, the battle was over whether the \ngovernment would be required to release anything it sought to \nwithhold.''\n  Second, extraneous provisions added by the House also pose \nsignificant privacy risks. As I noted before, increased information \nsharing is necessary but also poses privacy risks if the government is \nnot properly focused on the information necessary to collect, the \npeople appropriate to target for surveillance and the necessary \ncontrols to ensure that dissemination is confined to those with a need \nto know.\n  Recent press reports have warned that this bill will turn it into a \n``supersnoop's dream'' because it will allow creation of a huge \ncentralized grand database containing a dossier or profile of private \ntransactions and communications that each American has had within the \nprivate sector and with the government. Indeed, in section 201, the \nbill authorizes a new Directorate for Information Analysis and \nInfrastructure Protection to collect and integrate information from \ngovernment and private sector entities and to ``establish and utilize . \n. . data-mining and other advanced analytical tools.'' In addition, in \nsection 307, the bill authorizes $500,000,000 next year to be spent by \na new Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, HSARPA, to \nmake grants to develop new surveillance and other technologies for use \nin detecting, preventing and responding to homeland security threats.\n  We do not want the Federal Government to become the proverbial ``big \nbrother'' while every local police and sheriff's office or foreign law \nenforcement agency to become ``little brothers.'' How much information \nshould be collected, on what activities and on whom, and then shared \nunder what circumstances, are all important questions that should be \nanswered with clear guidelines understandable by all Americans and \nmonitored by Congress, in its oversight role, and by court review to \ncurb abuses.\n  Other provisions added in haste to the Republican House-passed bill \nraise serious concerns about privacy protections for the sensitive \nelectronic communications of law-abiding Americans. In particular, the \nso-called ``emergency disclosure'' amendment in section 225(d) would \ngreatly expand the ability of Internet service providers to reveal \nprivate communications to Government agencies without any judicial \nauthority or any evidence of wrongdoing.\n  As Americans move their lives online, the privacy of their sensitive \ne-mails, instant messages, and web traffic is of growing concern. \nCurrent law protects the privacy of electronic communications by \nprohibiting service providers from revealing the contents of those \ncommunications to anyone without proper lawful orders. Emergency \ndisclosure provisions exist in the current law based on the reasonable \npremise that ISPs who encounter an imminent threat of death or serious \ninjury should be able to reveal communications to law enforcement \nagencies on an emergency basis, even without judicial oversight. We \njust recently expanded that emergency exception a year ago in the USA \nPATRIOT Act to provide even more flexibility for service providers.\n  In practice, however, the emergency disclosure authority is being \nused in a different way. Reports in the press and from the field \nindicate that ISP's university and libraries are approached by \nGovernment agents and asked to disclose communications ``voluntarily'' \nfor ongoing investigations. Providers are then faced with a terrible \nchoice--turn over the private communications of their customers without \nany court order, or say ``no'' to a government request. Of course, many \ncomply with the requests. Small providers have few legal resources to \nchallenge such requests. The agents who are making the requests may be \nthe same agents to whom the providers will have to turn for help in the \nevent of hacking attacks on other problems. So without proper \nrestrictions, such ``voluntary disclosure'' provisions risk becoming a \nmajor exception to the law. Section 225(d) takes this exception even \nfurther and turns it into a loophole big enough to drive a truck \nthrough. It would allow literally thousands of local, State and Federal \nemployees to seek private e-mails, instant messages, and other \nsensitive communications without any judicial orders ad even a \nsubpoena. ISPs could turn over those communications based on vague \nconcerns of future injury to someone, even if those concerns are \ntotally unreasonable.\n\n  Section 225(d) makes three important changes to the already very \ngenerous authorities for these extraordinary disclosures, which \nCongress gave to law enforcement in the USA PATRIOT Act just one year \nago. First, it would remove the requirement that there be ``imminent'' \ndanger of injury or death. Instead it would allow these extraordinary \ndisclosures when there is some danger, which might be far in the future \nand far more hypothetical. As the Attorney General and the President \nhave warned us consistently over the last year, the entire country \nfaces some risk of future attack. Under this new language, there will \nalways be a rationale for using the so-called ``emergency'' disclosure \nprovision.\n  Second, section 225(d) would remove even the low hurdle that there be \na ``reasonable belief'' in danger on the part of the ISP. Instead, this \nnew provision would allow these sensitive disclosures if there is any \ngood faith belief--even if totally unreasonable--of danger. Vague, \nincoherent, or even obviously fictitious threats of future danger could \nall form the basis for disclosing our most private electronic \ncommunications under this new provision of law.\n  Finally, section 225(d) would allow disclosure of sensitive \ncommunications to any local, State or Federal Government entity, not \njust law enforcement agents. That could include literally hundreds of \nthousands of Government employees. The potential for abuse is\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nenormous. More importantly, in cases of real threats of death or \nserious injury, it is law enforcement agencies--trained to deal with \nsuch situations and cognizant of legal strictures--who should be the \nfirst contact point for concerned citizens.\n  As a result of Section 225(d), many more disclosures of sensitive \ncommunications would be permitted without any court oversight. \nMoreover, these disclosures would happen without any notice to people--\neven after the fact--that their communications have been revealed. It \nwould allow these disclosures to be requested by potentially thousands \nof government employees, ranging from cotton inspectors to dogcatchers \nto housing department administrators.\n  The public's most sensitive e-mails, web transactions, and instant \nmessages sent to love ones, business associates, doctors and lawyers, \nand friends deserve the highest level of privacy we can provide. The \nprovisions of section 225(d) make a mockery of our privacy laws, and \nthe carefully crafted exceptions we have created in them, by allowing \ndisclosure of our most private communications to thousands of \nGovernment officials based on the flimsiest of excuses. These \nprovisions were never approved by any committee in the Senate, are not \nin the interests of the American people, and should not now be finding \nthere way into the law of the land.\n  Third, the bill provides liability protections for companies at the \nexpense of consumers. I am disappointed that the measure also contains \nsweeping liability protection for corporate makers of vaccines and any \nother products deemed to be ``anti-terrorism technology'' by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. This unprecedented executive authority \nto unilaterally immunize corporations from accountability for their \nproducts is irresponsible and endangers the consumers and our military \nservice men and women.\n  These provisions, for example, would apply to negligence, gross \nnegligence and even willful misconduct in producing vaccines, gas \nmasks, airport screening machines and any other ``anti-terrorism \ntechnology'' used by the general public and our service men and women.\n  In addition, the bill would completely eliminate punitive damages \nagainst the maker of such a defective product. Without the threat of \npunitive damages, callous corporations can decide it is more cost-\neffective to continue cutting corners despite the risk to American \nlives. This would let private parties avoid accountability in cases of \nwanton, willful, reckless, or malicious conduct.\n  There is no need to enact these special legal protections and take \naway the rights of victims of defective products. At a time when the \nAmerican people are looking for Congress to take measured actions to \nprotect them from acts of terror, these ``tort reform'' proposals are \nunprecedented, inappropriate, and irresponsible. At the very moment \nthat the President is calling on all Americans to be especially \nvigilant, this legislation lets special interests avoid their \nresponsibility of vigilance under existing law.\n  I am disappointed that some may be taking advantage of the situation \nto push ``tort reform'' proposals that have been rejected by Congress \nfor years. This smacks of political opportunism. I strongly oppose \nrewriting the tort law of each of the 50 States for the benefit of \nprivate industry and at the expense of consumers and our service men \nand women, and their families.\n  Further, I am saddened that this so-called compromise provides \nretroactive liability protection for some private airport security \nfirms involved in the September 11th terrorist attacks. Last year, \nCongress explicitly excluded private airport security firms from the \nliability limits for airlines in the Aviation and Transportation \nSecurity Act because we did not know if any airport screening firm may \nhave contributed to the September 11th attacks through willful \nmisconduct or negligence. Unfortunately, we still do now know all the \nfacts regarding the 9/11 attacks because the Bush Administration has \nopposed Congressional oversight and an independent commission to \ninvestigate the attacks.\n  This special-interest provision in the so-called compromise is a \ntravesty to the families of the victims of September 11th. Indeed, I \nhave already been contacted by a family member of a 9/11 victim \noutraged by this retroactive liability protection. I share their \noutrage.\n  I also find it particularly galling, that just because ``the White \nHouse wants it,'' this bill includes a provision that balantly puts the \ninterests of a few corporate pharmaceutical manufacturers before the \ninterests of thousands of consumers, parents, and children. Sections \n714 through 716 give a ``get out of court free card'' to Eli Lilly and \nother manufacturers of thimerasol. Let's be clear, this provision has \nnothing to do with homeland security. Smallpox and anthrax vaccines do \nnot use thimerosal. Thimerasol is a mercury-based vaccine preservative \nthat was used until recently in children's vaccines for everything from \nhepatitis B to diphtheria. By making changes to the Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program sought by the pharmaceutical industry, this \nprovision cuts the legs out from under thousands of parents currently \nin court seeking compensation for the alleged harm caused by \nthimerosal.\n  For years, I have been working to remove sources of mercury from our \nenvironment because of the neurological effect of mercury on infants \nand children. Although Eli Libby's own documents show that they knew of \nthe potential risks from mercury-based preservatives in the 1940s, its \nuse was not stopped until 1999 when pediatricians and the Public Health \nService acted. Instead of looking into why pharmaceutical companies and \nthe Federal Government failed to act for so long or improving the \ncurrent compensation system, the Homeland Security bill takes away the \nlegal options of parents and gives pharmaceutical companies new \nprotections from large penalties.\n  Fourth, the bill weakens immigration enforcement just when we need it \nthe most. The Republican House-passed bill fails to take important \nsteps to help fix and restructure our immigration agencies. This \nRepublican package abandons the close coordination between immigration \nenforcement and immigration services that was included in the Lieberman \namendment to the Homeland Security bill. Instead, immigration \nenforcement falls under the Undersecretary for Border and \nTransportation Policy, while immigration services are relegated to a \nbureau that lacks its own undersecretary. Apparently, the \nUndersecretary for Border and Transportation Security is expected to be \nan expert in immigration enforcement, FEMA, agriculture, and other \nissues. Meanwhile, there is no one figure within the Homeland Security \nDepartment who is responsible for immigration policy. Testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee showed clearly the numerous links between the \nenforcement of our immigration laws and provision of immigration \nbenefits--it is unfortunate that this bill fails to acknowledge those \nlinks.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation fails to codify the Executive Office \nof Immigration Review appropriately. Instead of defining the functions, \nshape, and jurisdiction of the EOIR as the Lieberman amendment did, it \nsimply says there shall be an EOIR and the Attorney General shall have \ncomplete discretion over it. It is critical that both immigrants and \nthe Government have a meaningful opportunity to appeal adverse \ndecisions, and we should have done more through this legislation to \nguarantee it.\n  In addition, I am disappointed that provisions designed to guarantee \ndecent treatment for unaccompanied minors were not included in the \nRepublican amendment. Through Senator Feinstein's leadership, the \nLieberman substitute assured that unaccompanied alien minors received \ncounsel. The Judiciary Committee heard earlier this year from children \nwho had been mistreated by the immigration system, and we had a real \nopportunity to solve that problem through this bill. We have failed to \ntake advantage of that opportunity.\n  I will continue to work to ensure that the reorganization of our \nimmigration service proceeds in as orderly and appropriate a fashion as \npossible. I have spoken often about the valuable service provided by \nemployees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Vermont, and \nthe need to retain their expertise in any reshuffling of the agency's \nfunctions. We will not make\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\n our nation safer by alienating, underutilizing, or discarding \nknowledgeable employees, and I will do what I can to prevent that \noutcome.\n  Finally, the bill undermines the professionalism in favor of the \n``management flexibility'' to engage in political cronyism at the new \nDepartment. Although it has already received substantial comment, I \nwant to add my voice to those who have criticized the administration \nfor its heavy-handed and wrong-headed approach to the rights of \nemployees who will come under the new Department. At the same time we \nare seeking to motivate the Government workers who will be moved to the \nnew Department with an enhanced security mission, the administration is \ninsisting on provisions that threaten the job security for these \nhardworking Government employees.\n  The administration should not use this transition as an excuse to cut \nthe wages and current workplace security and rights of the brave \nemployees who have been defending the Nation. That is not the way to \nencourage retention or recruitment of the vital human resources on \nwhich we will need to rely.\n  I represent some of those employees and have firsthand knowledge of \ntheir dedication to our nation and their jobs. Contrary to the \nadministration's pre-election rhetoric, where disputes over employment \nconditions have had potential effects on the public safety, they have \nbeen resolved quickly. I am disappointed that the bill we consider \ntoday contains so few protections for these vital employees, and that \nthe White House chose to use these valuable public servants in an \nelection year tactic.\n  So our vote today will help answer the question of whether a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security will be created--a question that has \nnever really been at issue or in doubt. Perhaps there are members of \nthe Senate who oppose creation of this Department, though I am not \naware of such opposition. But many troubling questions remain about the \n``hows'' as we move forward to charter this massive new agency. A \nprocess has been imposed on the Senate that prevents addressing them \nadequately in the remaining hours of this session. But answering and \nresolving these questions, in the interest of the security and privacy \nand well-being of the American people, will be an imperative that the \nadministration and the next Congress must not shirk.\n\n\n                    OFFICE OF DOMESTIC PREPAREDNESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, one of the Senate's highest priorities, \nand one of my own personal priorities, has been ensuring that State and \nlocal first responders are prepared to handle a terrorist attack, \nespecially one involving weapons of mass destruction. One of the \nprincipal ways I have tried to do this is through the Office of \nDomestic preparedness at the Department of Justice. Through the \nAppropriations subcommittee that Senator Hollings and I oversee, the \nSenate built ODP from a $5 million program into an $800 million program \nin just five years. Since 1998, ODP has been the focal point within the \nFederal Government for State and local jurisdictions to receive \nequipment grants, training, technical assistance, and exercise support \nfor combating terrorism.\n  The original legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security \nwould have combined the preparedness functions of ODP and the response \nfunctions of FEMA into a single Directorate, the Directorate of \nemergency Preparedness and Response. The problem with this framework is \nthat the much larger FEMA would have dominated the new Directorate, and \nits priorities and philosophies would have obscured those of ODP. ODP \npossesses unique experience and expertise when it comes to preparing \nthe State and local jurisdictions to handle terrorism. FEMA has very \nlittle experience with this side of the equation: its role has always \nbeen to respond after an event occurs.\n  FEMA employs something called the ``all-hazards'' approach to \ndisaster response. Under the all-hazards approach, all disasters are \nhandled the same way. But we cannot treat terrorism the same way we \ntreat other disasters. The attack on the World Trade Center provides an \nexcellent case in point. On September 11, New York City first \nresponders treated the first explosion as a high-rise fire and set up \ntheir command center in Tower II. Because the responders employed a \ngeneric, all-hazards response, they did not anticipate the second \nexplosion in Tower II. Our approach to terrorism must be different from \nour approach to natural disasters--it must be innovative and adaptive. \nIt must anticipate a predatory adversary that constantly devises new \nways to get around each new set of measures we take.\n  There are four key components, or ``pillars'', involved in combating \nterrorism: prevention, preparedness, crisis management, and consequence \nmanagement. Justice has traditionally been responsible for \npreparedness, and FEMA has traditionally been responsible for \nconsequence management, or disaster response. The Homeland Security \nlegislation, as originally written, would have lumped these components \ntogether. However, the people who are responsible for responding in the \nimmediate aftermath of an attack cannot also be responsible for \ncarrying out sustained training, equipment, and exercise programs. \nThese are programmatic initiatives that must be executed day in and day \nout. FEMA is a response agency. It will not be able to give terrorism \npreparedness the time and attention it deserves because it must \nconstantly respond to disasters around the country.\n  The amendment I offered to the Homeland Security bill acknowledged \nthe importance of consolidating the preparedness and response functions \nin the new Department of Homeland Security. However, the amendment set \nthem apart in order to preserve both FEMA's and ODP's areas of \nexpertise. The amendment created the Office for Domestic Preparedness \nunder the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security and \ntransferred terrorism preparedness functions to this new office from \nboth the Justice Department and FEMA. Specifically, the new Office for \nDomestic Preparedness includes Justice's current Office for Domestic \nPreparedness and parts of FEMA's Office of National Preparedness. ODP \nwill be responsible for all of our preparedness activities and FEMA \nwill continue to have the lead for consequence management. Under this \nframework, the preparedness and response functions will be preserved, \nyet will be closely coordinated by the Secretary of Homeland Security. \nThis is the best way to prevent FEMA's and ODP's critical functions \nfrom being blurred within the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The responsibilities of the new Office for Domestic Preparedness will \nbe similar to what they are now under the Department of Justice: \ncoordinating terrorism preparedness at the Federal level; assisting \nState and local jurisdictions with their preparedness efforts; \nconducting strategic and operational planning; coordinating \ncommunications at all levels of government; managing the preparedness \ngrants to State and local jurisdictions; and assisting them in the \nimplementation of the President's National Strategy. This is, in fact, \none of the key reasons why I have pushed for the creation of the Office \nfor Domestic Preparedness within the new Department. It ensures the \ncontinuity of preparedness assistance for State and local \njurisdictions. The office they have looked to for the last five years \nfor equipment, training, and exercise assistance will continue to \nexist, but under the leadership of the Undersecretary for Border and \nTransportation Security.\n  If not for this amendment, ODP would most likely have been subsumed \nby FEMA, and all of the work ODP has accomplished would have been lost. \nODP's successful methodologies for providing assistance to State and \nlocal jurisdictions would have been scrapped in favor of FEMA's \nundeveloped and untested approach. An example of one such successful \nmethodology is the system of accountability ODP established by \nrequiring States to have a terrorism preparedness strategy before they \ncould receive Federal funding. The State strategies have allowed ODP to \nmake informed and strategic decisions about how to allocate funding for \nequipment, training, and exercises. FEMA has no such system in place. \nBy keeping ODP's and FEMA's activities distinct, we preserve the \nprogress each has made in their respective areas of expertise.\n  The amendment permits FEMA to concentrate on a mission that it is \nuniquely equipped to perform: disaster response. This is extremely \nimportant,\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\nespecially in light of the fact that there is an average of 34 major \ndisaster declarations per year in the U.S. I know that my coastal State \ncolleagues were very concerned that FEMA's natural disaster \nresponsibilities, in particular its mission of responding to \nhurricanes, would be eclipsed by its new homeland security \nresponsibilities. I am certain that this concern is shared by Senators \nfrom States that face the threat of earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. \nThis provision makes it clear that FEMA is out of the preparedness \nbusiness.\n  This was one of the primary reasons why I felt such an amendment was \nnecessary. It will help prevent competition between terrorism response \nand natural disaster response within the new Department. Under the \noriginal legislation, the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and \nResponse would have been pressured on the one hand to focus its \nresources and attention on natural disasters, and on the other hand on \ncombating terrorism. This competition would have weakened our level of \npreparedness for either type of disaster. By setting them apart within \nthe new Department, we have built in a natural balance between these \ntwo critical areas.\n  I was disappointed to learn that some at FEMA are already busy \nplanning ways to avoid having to execute the directive. I am told that \nFEMA intends, during the next few weeks, to re-designate all of the \npreparedness staff at the Office of National Preparedness as ``all-\nhazards staff''. By renaming them all-hazards, FEMA could retain its \npreparedness functions. These actions come despite the fact that at \nleast 38 U.S. Senators believe those functions should reside at the \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness and not at FEMA. These actions come \ndespite our having negotiated in good faith with the White House. These \nactions come despite agreement among the Office of Homeland Security, \nthe House of Representatives, and the Senate.\n  On a different note, it has recently come to my attention that the \nOffice of Management and Budget is considering requiring State and \nlocal jurisdictions to match the Federal preparedness grants. OMB \nshould not impose this requirement on State and local jurisdictions. \nThey do not have the fiscal resources to support such a requirement. \nThe equipment, training, and exercise initiatives that I have here \ndiscussed are part of a comprehensive National preparedness program. \nState and local jurisdictions will not be able to achieve the standards \nor readiness that are required, especially at this time of increased \nthreat to our Nation, if they are forced to comply with matching \nrequirements. In point of fact, State and local governments already \nbear most of the burden in protecting our Nation from terrorism. They--\nthe first responders, who willingly and courageously put themselves in \nharm's way--protect the American people. Just after September 11, the \nPresident duly acknowledged how critical first responders are to our \nNational security. We cannot shortchange them now. We are at war and \nthe Federal Government must fully support our State and local first \nresponders.\n  ODP has provided training to approximately 114,000 first responders \nand exercise support to more than 100,000 first responders nationwide. \nIt has given out nearly $600 million in equipment grants to State and \nlocal jurisdictions since its creation in 1998. It also executed the \nlargest terrorism exercise in U.S. history, TOPOFF. I have heard \nreports that those who participated in the multi-venue TOPOFF were the \nonly ones truly prepared to handle the challenges presented on \nSeptember 11. The amendment acknowledges that we do have an effective \nsystem in place and it preserves what has been accomplished.\n  The amendment I submitted acknowledges that the Office of Domestic \nPreparedness and FEMA both perform critical roles and must work closely \ntogether. I commend the administration for recognizing the need and \nworking with the Senate to get the job done. I would also like to thank \nSenator Lott for his excellent work on this bill, as well as his \ncounsel Rohit Kumar. Finally, I would like to recognize Dean Kueter, \nJr., of the National Sheriffs Association for his tireless work in \ngenerating grassroots support on this important issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, there is nothing more important than \nAmerica's national security. I will vote for the Homeland Security Act \nbecause it organizes our Government to better detect, prevent and \nrespond to acts of terrorism.\n  This bill organizes twenty-two very different agencies into a one-\nstop-shop for homeland security a single, mission-driven agency whose \nprimary goal is protection of the homeland. Why is this important? \nBecause it will improve our ability to detect terrorism before it \noccurs, by strengthening immigration systems, better coordination of \nintelligence. It will improve our ability to prevent terrorism, through \nstronger port security, border security, transportation security. It \nwill improve our ability to respond to acts of terrorism through the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency.\n  Yet I am disappointed that this legislation has been politicized in \naddressing an issue as important as national security. Congress and the \nPresident shouldn't be Democrats or Republicans. We should be the Red, \nWhite, and Blue Party. In recent weeks, I've seen some cynical actions. \nI've seen Federal employees treated as if they're the enemy. I've seen \na Vietnam War hero's patriotism questioned. I've seen this \nadministration claim that the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity was its idea and its priority, though we all know they long \nopposed it--just as they opposed the creation of a national commission \nto look at what went wrong on September 11. I've seen a package of \nspecial interest goodies forced into a bill for no other reason than \npay-back politics.\n  Let's consider some of these issues. First, on Federal employees, I \nresent that I am being forced to chose between Homeland Security and \nprotecting the rights of those who guard the homeland--our Federal \nemployees who have the constitutional right to organize, to have \nfreedom of assembly, to do collective bargaining. In standing up for \nAmerica, why aren't we also standing up for those who are protecting \nAmerica? Our brave and gallant Federal employees who are out there \nevery day on the front line wanting to do their job, whether they are \ncustoms inspectors, border agents or FEMA's emergency workers.\n  Federal workers stand sentry every day to protect America. When our \nfirefighters ran up those burning buildings at the World Trade Center, \nnobody asked if they were union. They didn't look at the clock or check \ntheir work rules. When our emergency workers from Maryland dashed over \nto be part of the mutual aid at the Pentagon, they were mission driven. \nThey were there because they were union members. They belong to a \nunion. They belong to a union called the United States of America. \nThat's the union that they belong to, and that's the union they put \nfirst.\n  America is in the midst of a war against terrorism. We have a long \nway to go. Yet instead of focusing on the war effort, we're waging war \non Federal employees. The administration must use this new flexibility \nresponsibly and judiciously. It is not a blank check. If anyone takes \nundue advantage of this new flexibility, I will lead the charge to \nchange it. But it is sad and disgraceful that the rights of our Federal \nemployees were held hostage in an effort to make our Nation secure \nagainst terrorism.\n  I'm also disappointed with the special interest provisions that were \nadded to this bill. The late Senator Wellstone added a provision on \ncompanies that move overseas to avoid paying U.S. taxes. His amendment \nwould have prevented these corporations from being able to contract \nwith the new Department of Homeland Security. Why does the House of \nRepresentatives insist on helping those companies who make their money \nin the U.S. but then turn their backs on the U.S.? What about their \nresponsibility to the U.S.?\n  This legislation also provides immunity from liability for \nmanufacturers of products or technologies that harm Americans. Why did \nthe House think it's important to protect companies that are grossly \nnegligent, and how does this improve the security of Americans?\n  Another special interest provision would provide liability protection \nfor pharmaceutical companies that are being sued for using vaccine \npreservatives that some people believe have\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\ncaused autism. This should be decided by scientists and the courts: not \nby Members of the House of Representatives trying to sneak unrelated \nprovisions into a bill on homeland security. The list of special \ninterest pay backs goes on and on.\n  I strongly oppose the provisions of this bill that limit the rights \nof Federal employees, as well as the administration's plan to privatize \nmuch of the Federal workforce. I will continue to fight these \nproposals. I'm also disappointed that the House Republicans have used \nthe need for homeland security to sneak so many special interest give \nbacks into the bill.\n  Yet despite the serious problems with this bill, I will vote for it \nbecause it will enable our government to better detect, prevent and \nrespond to terrorism. Nothing the Senate does is more important than \nproviding security for America. That is why I will vote to create the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--for America's national security.\n  I'm tired of the cynical manipulation of the legislative process. I'm \ntired of the politicization of something as important as Homeland \nSecurity. I hope this is the last time that an issue of national \nsecurity is politicized. Let's put these politics and hard feelings \nbehind us. Let us get our act together, and let's show America we can \ngovern. Let's show the bullies of the world we're willing to take them \non.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I strongly support the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I am a cosponsor of the Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute and the President's proposal, and have consistently voted to \novercome Democratic roadblocks to create a Homeland Security \nDepartment. I want this legislation to be enacted, but the House-passed \nbill includes a number of egregious special interest riders that should \nnot be part of this landmark measure.\n  If the legislative process had allowed us an opportunity to vote on \nmany of the provisions Senators Daschle and Lieberman are now seeking \nto strike, I believe most of them would have been rejected. \nUnfortunately, we now find ourselves in a ``take it or leave it'' \nsituation. This is an artificial and unnecessary construct. The \nHomeland Security legislation effectuates the most dramatic \nrestructuring of the Federal Government in half a century. With the \ngoal of safeguarding our citizens, it creates a 170,000-person cabinet-\nlevel department that encompasses almost every governmental function \nthat contributes to protecting Americans against terrorism in the \nUnited States. That the Senate is being told that the House will \neffectively kill the entire bill if this body dare remove politically \nmotivated riders signals to me that the other chamber's priorities have \nbecome grossly confused.\n  I do not approach this vote lightly, but I must vote my conscience, \njust as each of my colleagues must do. I sincerely hope that upon \nresolution of the vote, we can move forward expeditiously with the \nHouse to resolve the differences and still send a bill to the President \nby the end of the week.\n  The Daschle-Lieberman amendment would strike seven special interest \nprovisions that were included in this 484- page bill by the House.\n  Texas A: among them, the amendment proposes to strike a provision \nthat many believe is designed to provide an earmark for Texas A \nUniversity. Specifically, the House-passed bill requires the Secretary \nto designate a university-based center or centers for homeland \nsecurity. However, the bill further stipulates 15 specific criteria to \nbe used in making this designation, criteria that many suspect are \ntailored to describe only one university--Texas A While the \nprovision allows the Secretary to expand the criteria, it doesn't \npermit the Secretary to eliminate or alter the 15 criteria set forth in \nthe bill.\n  How many colleges have ``strong affiliations with animal and plant \ndiagnostic laboratories, expertise in water and wastewater operations, \nand demonstrated expertise in port and waterway security,'' not to \nmention 12 other requirements?\n  I have long opposed attempts in Congress to by-pass competitive, \nmerit-based selection processes. There is absolutely no justification \nfor attempting to do so in the Homeland Security bill for a function as \nimportant as the one to be fulfilled by the university-based centers.\n  The Safety Act: the Daschle-Lieberman amendment strikes a provision \nin the House-passed bill titled ``The SAFETY Act'', which purports to \nprovide reasonable liability protections for antiterrorism technologies \nthat would not be deployed in the absence of these protections.\n  I believe that real harm has been inflicted on our economy by trial \nattorneys' abuse of our tort system. I have seen the unfathomable greed \nof certain attorneys who use ``consumer protection'' as an excuse to \nextort billions of dollars from corporations, and ultimately, the same \nconsumers they claim to protect. Outrageous awards that may benefit \nonly the lawyers have stifled innovation, kept products off the market, \nand hurt consumers.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, I have advanced legislation to \nreform products liability litigation, and overseen the enactment of a \nlaw to limit litigation and damages that might have arisen from the Y2K \nbug. Despite its potential to kill the bill because of opposition from \ntrial lawyers, I voted to cap attorneys' fees on the comprehensive \ntobacco legislation that I sponsored. I am appalled that the demise of \nthat bill opened the door for a private settlement under which a \nhandful of lawyers have received literally billions of dollars, and I \nintend to ensure that these fees are closely examined in the Commerce \nCommittee next year. In addition, I have repeatedly voted for \nlimitations on damages for medical malpractice.\n  In short, I appreciate the need for legal reform and have long \nsupported it. Despite this, I cannot support the ``SAFETY Act'', which \nnever received a hearing in either chamber, and which was inserted into \nthe House Homeland Security bill late in that chamber's process when \nMembers decided that the government indemnification provisions \npreviously considered would be too costly.\n  This ill-considered ``SAFETY Act'', which I understand is supported \nby defense contractors and others seeking liability protection, does \nnot provide reasonable limitations on liability. Intentionally or not, \nit appears to eliminate all liability in tort claims against Sellers \nfor the failure of any ``antiterrorism technology.'' Whereas previous \ntort reform measures have sought to limit the abuse of our system by \navaricious lawyers, while protecting plaintiffs' rights to obtain a \nquick and reasonable award, no such balance is reflected in the \n``SAFETY Act.''\n  While many of my Democratic colleagues object instinctively to \nliability limitations such as those in the SAFETY Act, including the \ncreation of a Federal cause of action, the prohibition on punitive \ndamages, and the requirement for proportional liability for non-\neconomic damages, I have supported these concepts in the past, and \ncontinue to support them in this context. What I find objectionable, \nhowever, fatally so, is that the SAFETY Act was never the subject of \nany hearing, was never considered by a committee in either chamber, \nand, perhaps as a consequence, is to confused in its wording and \nconcepts as to be almost incomprehensible.\n  While the need for liability protection for manufacturers and sellers \nof antiterrorism technologies may be very real, this is an issue of \nsignificant import that deserves more careful consideration. At a \nminimum, the SAFETY Act must be rewritten to ensure that its language \nis consistent with what I understand to be its intent. At present, it \nis not.\n  One particularly troublesome provision in the SAFETY Act appears to \ntransform a common law doctrine known as the ``government contractor's \ndefense,'' into an absolute defense to immunize the seller of an \nantiterrorism technology of all liability. This is a dramatic departure \nfrom current law and one that does not seem to have been well thought-\nout.\n  Currently, the ``government contractor's defense'' provides immunity \nfrom liability when the federal government has issued the \nspecifications for a product; the product meets those specifications; \nand the manufacturer does not have any knowledge of problems with the \nproduct that it does not share.\n  While I am told that the House advocates of the SAFETY Act did not \nintend to provide protections for products whose specifications are not\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\nissued by the government, or which do not meet these specifications, \nthe bill language indicates otherwise. It says ``Should a product \nliability or other lawsuit be filed for claims . . . and such claims \nresult or may result in loss to the Seller, there shall be a rebuttable \npresumption that the government contractor defense applies to such \nlawsuit. This presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing \nthat the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in \nsubmitting information to the Secretary during the course of the \nSecretary's consideration of such technology under this subsection.''\n  What happens if the Seller submits proper information to the \nSecretary, and the Secretary certifies a technology, such as a vaccine \nor chemical detection device, but a year later there is a gross defect \nin the manufacturing process, and as a result, the product doesn't work \nand Americans are injured or killed in a terrorist attack. The language \nin the bill suggests that the Seller still is not liable. But who is? \nCan the injured victim seek compensation under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct? The SAFETY Act does not say. Should they be able to? This is one \nof many questions affecting plaintiffs that does not seem to have been \ncontemplated or considered when the SAFETY Act was included on the \nHouse bill.\n  Clearly, Congress as a whole should work to address the legitimate \nliability concerns that may be keeping protective technology off the \nmarket. We should do this, however, thoughtfully, if swiftly, and \nensure that the language reflects our considered intent.\n  Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates: the Homeland \nSecurity bill prohibits the Secretary from contracting with any \n``inverted domestic corporation'', which is an American corporation \nthat has reincorporated overseas. More and more U.S. companies are \nusing this highly profitable accounting scheme that allows a company to \nmove its legal residence to offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, where \nthere is no corporate income tax, and shield its profits from taxes.\n  I applaud efforts to discourage this practice. Already, at least 25 \nmajor corporations have reincorporated or established themselves in \nBermuda or the Cayman Islands in the past decade. Although I understand \nthat American tax policy has encouraged them to do so, corporations \nthat have moved their legal headquarters offshore to avoid taxes give \nthe appearance of ingratitude to the country whose sons and daughters \nare risking their lives today to defend them.\n  This provision, however, has not escaped untouched by special \ninterests. Although the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the late \nSenator Wellstone that flatly barred the Secretary of Homeland Security \nfrom contracting with inverted domestic corporations unless doing so \nwas in the interest of national security, the measure being offered to \nus on a ``take it or leave it'' basis contains loopholes you could \ndrive a truck through or an entire fleet of trucks to be supplied by a \nrelocated corporation. Although it generally prohibits the Secretary \nfrom entering into contracts with inverted domestic corporations, the \nHouse-passed measure allows the Secretary to waive this prohibition in \nthe interest of homeland security, or to ``to prevent the loss of any \njobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any \nadditional costs that otherwise would not occur.''\n  The Daschle-Lieberman amendment tightens this loophole by permitting \nthe Secretary to waive the contracting limitation only in the interest \nof homeland security. That is what this bill is about, it is not a jobs \nbill, or a fiscal belt-tightening bill. The Senate determined, in \nadopting the Wellstone amendment, that it was important to stop more \ncorporations from adopting corporate ``flags of convenience.'' We \nshould honor this.\n  Childhood Vaccines: among the most inappropriate provisions that the \nDaschle-Lieberman amendment strikes is a modification to the Childhood \nVaccine Injury Act of 1986. The language included in the House-passed \nbill has far-reaching consequences and is wholly unrelated to the \nstated goals of this legislation. Inserted without debate in either \nchamber, this language will primarily benefit large brand name \npharmaceutical companies which produce additives to children's vaccines \nwith substantial benefit to one company in particular. It has no \nbearing whatsoever on domestic security.\n  The National Vaccine Injury Compensation, VIC, Program, established \nunder the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, set up a no-fault \ncompensation program as an alternative to legal action to compensate \nchildren injured or killed by a vaccine. The VIC Program was adopted in \nresponse to a flood of plaintiffs' suits in the early 1980s which \nravaged the vaccine industry. Incentives, such as limitations on \ndamages, were established to encourage manufacturers to continue to \nproduce safer vaccines, while education programs and an adverse \nreaction reporting system were established to ensure prevention of \nfuture vaccine injuries.\n  The 1986 law did not define ``vaccine,'' and suits emerged between \nfamilies and manufacturers of vaccine additives, many of which are \nstill ongoing. The language contained within the House-passed Homeland \nSecurity Act would modify the definition of a ``vaccine'' to include \nadditives. Originally contained within a well-rounded bill written by \nmy friend, Senator Frist, this language served a sound purpose. \nHowever, I am concerned that the passage of these select provisions \nwhich benefit pharmaceutical manufacturers will eliminate the incentive \nto continue negotiations on the important reforms within Senator \nFrist's bill which has been negotiated in the HELP Committee for close \nto a year. Additionally, unlike the bill in Committee, this language \nwould intervene in ongoing litigation without modifying the statute of \nlimitations for bringing a claim under the Vaccine Act, and in so \ndoing, would leave families of some injured children with no available \nrecourse.\n  As I stated earlier, I am not opposed to reasonable legal reform. I \nsupport a comprehensive reform package such as the bill sponsored by \nSenator Frist, and hope that such a measure will pass early in the next \nCongress. It is wrong, however, to cherry pick provisions beneficial to \nindustry and insert them in a Homeland Security bill and to leave for \nanother day those provisions that protect children.\n  Special interests have no place in any congressional action, least of \nall one of this magnitude. For this reason, I am compelled to support \nthe Daschle-Lieberman amendment. This administration has worked \ntirelessly with the House and Senate to produce an extraordinary \nrestructuring of Government to better protect the American people. They \nhave accomplished an amazing feat. Legislation of this gravity should \nnot be sullied by a few special interest riders. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in striking them.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I voted for the Thompson \nsubstitute amendment to the Homeland Security Act--the largest \nrestructuring of the Federal Government in over 50 years and perhaps \nthe most important legislation considered in this Congress.\n  This historic legislation would create a new department combining \nsome 22 Federal agencies with what would amount to about 200,000 \nFederal employees.\n  The bill would create one of the biggest departments in the U.S. \nGovernment, with an initial annual budget of at least $37 billion.\n  I voted for this legislation because our current terrorism policy is \nterribly disjointed and fragmented. I have long supported additional \nefforts to consolidate and coordinate our terrorism policy.\n  Currently, homeland security functions are scattered among more than \n100 different Government organizations. There is much unnecessary \noverlap and duplication. There is also a failure to communicate and \nshare information--making it hard to for the law enforcement and \nintelligence community to ``connect the dots'' to prevent a terrorist \nattack.\n  I also voted for the bill because I believe our country is currently \nat great risk. Terrorists are doing all they can to launch a \ncatastrophic attack on our homeland.\n  The status quo is simply unacceptable. For example, just last week, I \nchaired a subcommittee hearing on a new report from released by \nSenators Hart and Rudman.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n  Their report is chilling--and its conclusion distributing. It reads:\n\n       A year after September 11th, America remains dangerously \n     unprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic terrorist \n     attack on U.S. soil. In all likelihood, the next attack will \n     result in even greater casualties and widespread disruption \n     to American lives and the economy.\n\n  The creation of a Homeland Security Department is critical to our \nefforts to try to prevent another devastating terrorist attack against \nus.\n  Now, for the first time in our history, this Nation will have one \nFederal agency charged with the primary mission of preventing terrorist \nattacks within the United States, reducing the vulnerability of the \nU.S. to terrorism at home, and minimizing damage and assisting in the \nrecovery from any attacks that may occur.\n  The new department will have four major divisions: border \ntransportation and security, emergency preparedness and response, \nscience and technology, and information analysis and infrastructure \nprotection.\n\n  The border directorate will include a number of key homeland security \nagencies, including Customs and the Transportation Security Agency.\n  The emergency preparedness directorate will include FEMA and some \nother smaller response agencies.\n  The science directorate will include a number of programs and \nactivities of the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and \nsome agencies.\n  The information analysis directorate will synthesize and analyze \nhomeland security information from intelligence and land enforcement \nagencies throughout the government.\n  This crucial division will identify and assess terrorist threats and \nvulnerabilities, issue warnings, and act to prevent terrorist acts \nagainst critical infrastructures such as bridges, dams, and electric \npower grids.\n  Other agencies such as the Coast Guard and Secret Service will be \nmoved to the new department, and there will be an office to coordinate \nwith state and local governments. The legislation also creates a \nHomeland Security Council in the White House to coordinate the domestic \nresponse to terrorist threats.\n  I am very pleased that this legislation does not neglect State and \nlocal law enforcement and first responders. No homeland security \nsolution can be just federal. The reality is the 650,000 State and \nlocal law enforcement officers are additional eyes and ears in the war \non terrorism. They cannot operate deaf, dumb, and blind.\n  Moreover, in the event of a terrorist attack, the first people on the \nscene will be local firefighters, emergency medical technicians, \nNational Guardsman, and other people in the local community. The need \nproper information, organization, training, and equipment.\n  Thus, I am pleased that this legislation includes a measure I \nintroduced to increase state and local access to federally collected \nterrorism information.\n  This legislation directs the President to establish procedures for \nsharing homeland security information with state and local officials, \nensures that our current information sharing systems and computers are \ncapable of sharing such information, and increases communications \nbetween government officials.\n  The bill also includes a broad exemption under the Freedom of \nInformation Act for cybercrime and cyberterrorism information. This \nexemption will encourage the private companies that opoerate over 85 \npercent of our critical infrastructure to share information about \ncomputer break-ins with law enforcement--so criminals and terrorists \ncan be stopped before they strike again and severely punished. I have \nlong advocated for such an exemption, and am pleased that it ended up \nin the final bill.\n  While I strongly support the creation of a Homeland Security \nDepartment, I am disappointed that the bill we passed today includes a \nnumber of extraneous special interest provisions and lacks language to \nensure appropriate oversight and transparency.\n  In addition, there is nothing in this legislation addressing what is \nperhaps the most pressing homeland security problem we face today: the \nvulnerability of our ports to terrorism.\n  The issue of port security was left to separate legislation that was \npassed last Thursday. In my view, that legislation does not go far \nenough. I believe that Congress needs to return to this issue next year \nand pass more comprehensive legislation.\n  The Hart-Rudman Independent Terrorism Task Force, for example, \nrecently issued a report describing major holes in the security of our \nports and endorsed such a comprehensive, layered approach.\n  This new comprehensive legislation would be based on S. 2895, the \nComprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002, which I \nintroduced last summer with Senators, Kyl, Hutchinson, and Snowe.\n  The Comprehensive Seaport and Container Security Act of 2002 is the \nresult of hearings we have had in the Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nas well as my testimony two years ago to the Interagency Commission on \nCrime and Security in U.S. Seaports.\n  The main section in the bill would create a Container Profiling Plan \nthat would focus our nation's limited inspection resources on high-risk \ncargo.\n  In addition, the bill also contains provisions requiring: earlier and \nmore detailed container information; comprehensive radiation detection; \nheightened container security measures--including high-security seals; \nrestricted access to ports; increased safety for sensitive port \ninformation; enhanced inspection of cargo at foreign facilities; \nstronger penalties for incorrect cargo information; improved crime data \ncollection; upgraded Customs service facilities; and better regulation \nof ocean transport intermediaries.\n  Unfortunately, we were not able to get much of this Bill included in \nthe conference legislation that passed last week. Indeed, the \nConference Bill even omits a number of security provisions included in \nS. 1214 as it passed the Senate.\n  That is why, in my view, we will need to revisit this issue early in \nthe 108th Congress. I plan to work with my colleagues to fine-tune my \nlegislation and reintroduce it. I hope that my colleagues will support \nit.\n\n  I am also disappointed with this bill because it does not contain the \nentire ``Unaccompanied Child Protection Act,'' bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced at the beginning of this Congress and that was included as \nTitle XII of the Lieberman substitute to H.R. 5005.\n  I have spoken on this issue in some detail already, but feel \ncompelled to reiterate a few points.\n  Last year, over 5300 children came to this country unaccompanied by a \nparent or guardian and were held by the INS, many of them in detention \nfacilities. these children have no rights. Many of them can't speak \nEnglish, they can be detained for years, they have no resort to \ncounsel, and they don't understand the process.\n  We all remember the Elian Gonzalez case. Every year, there are \nthousands of Elians. But unlike Elian, these children have no family \nmembers to help them navigate the immigration process. They are \ncompletely at the mercy of a complex bureaucratic and legal system they \ncannot begin to understand.\n  The good news is that this bill transfers authority over the care and \ncustody of unaccompanied alien children from the INS to the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement within the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  The bad news is that almost all the ``help'' provisions for these \nchildren are left out. This bill is lacking because it does not provide \neither for a guardian ad litem, or pro bono legal assistance.\n  This is insufficient, and it is my full intention to reintroduce \nlegislation in the next session to redress this, and to include pro \nbono counsel and guardian ad litem provisions.\n  Protecting children, on the one hand, must not prevent us from \ndevising an immigration policy that protects us from those that would \ndo America harm.\n  We do not want to burden the Secretary of Homeland Security with \npolicy issues unrelated to the threat of terrorism. The Department will \nhave a daunting mission as it is, and must never lose that focus.\n  Two positive steps regarding immigration include the transfer of the \nvisa issuance process from the State Department to the Department of \nHomeland Security, thereby giving it the\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nregulatory and oversight authority over issuances and denials.\n  It also prohibits third-party visa processing, referred to as ``Visa \nExpress'', to ensure closer scrutiny of visa applications and to \npreserve the integrity of the visa issuance process. These reforms are \nessential.\n  Overall, while this legislation's shortcomings cause me serious \nconcern, I believe that they pale in comparison to the dangers facing \nAmerica, both immediately and in the long-term, at home and abroad.\n  The terrorist threat to the United States is far too real, and in our \nfreedom-loving country we must now do everything we can to protect our \npeople.\n  And this, after all, is the Federal Government's paramount task--\nprotecting our citizens. Further delay in creating a Department of \nHomeland Security would only leave us increasingly vulnerable--and this \nis something we simply cannot afford.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today in support of this \nbipartisan legislation creating a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Since the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11, we have acted \nto increase our efforts to counter terrorism by strengthening borders, \nimproving information sharing among agencies, and giving our law \nenforcement agencies the legal tools to investigate and prosecute \nterrorists and those that help terrorists financially.\n  Congress has considered and passed both the USA PATRIOT Act and the \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act which have both \nchanged laws to ensure that providing for our national security in \norder to prevent future terrorist attacks is a top priority. This bill \nalso ensures that the 22 agencies with a substantial role in protecting \nour homeland have the materials and resources they require.\n  This legislation is recognition that homeland security has taken on \nan entirely new meaning since 9/11. What was once a concern with \nterrorists acting against U.S. interests overseas has been realized and \nexpanded to include those same acts happening right here at home. The \nwar has been brought to the U.S. and we are now rising to the \nchallenge.\n  This was precisely the type of thinking demonstrated by President \nBush in the summer of 2001, when he instructed the intelligence \ncommunity to provide an assessment of the threat posed by al-Qaida \ndomestically rather than overseas. And President Bush did exactly the \nright thing in the wake of last year's horrific attacks when he \nestablished the Office of Homeland Security, now headed by Governor \nRidge, to coordinate counter-terrorism activities by the various U.S. \nagencies and departments as well as develop an overall strategy. This \nstrategy has culminated in the proposal of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  As the principal advisor to the President on homeland security \nissues, the service of Governor Ridge has been exemplary. The time has \ncome, however, for the perpetuity of purpose ensured by statutory \nstatus for a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  A Department responsible for safeguarding our homeland defense must \nnot be dependent solely on the relationship between a particular \nPresident and his or her Homeland Security director. Rather, it must be \nrun as efficiently and effectively as possible under the leadership of \na permanent, cabinet level official. That is the only way to achieve \nthe kind of ``continuity of urgency'' the security of our homeland \ndemands.\n  The fact of the matter is, we cannot afford a descent into \ncomplacency when it comes to this life-or-death obligation to protect \nthe American people. If ever there were a Federal responsibility, this \nis it.\n  And while my fervent hope and prayer is that we do not suffer another \nattack on or anywhere near the scale of 9/11, the reality is that, \nabsent future tragedies and absent a cabinet-level homeland security \ndepartment, we don't know what kind of attention the issue will receive \n5, 10, 20 years down the road. Because the tendency is to focus on the \nmost visible, pressing issues of the day, but we cannot allow ourselves \nto let down our guard, not for a moment, not a decade from now, not a \nquarter century from now, never.\n  So this initiative is not a knee-jerk reaction. It is not a passing \nwhim--far from it. There is no serious debate about the fact that we \nare now in a new age that will not quickly pass. The threat will be \npervasive, and enduring. The level of our vigilance must be equally so.\n  Under a new cabinet-level department, responsibility would rest with \na Secretary of Homeland Security, a position created under law, who \nwould manage the vital day-to-day functioning of the new department. \nCritically, this person would have their own budget, while they work \nclosely with the administration to develop and implement policy. It is \nvital that this budgetary authority be granted--otherwise, the \ndepartment will become a paper tiger, without the teeth that we all \nknow a separate budget provides in terms of authority as well as the \nability to get things done.\n  The bottom line is, I support the creation of the Department of \nHomeland Security--the largest re-organization of our Government since \nWWII--because it will centralize our efforts to prevent and respond to \nany future terrorist attack.\n  Currently, at least 22 agencies and departments play a direct role in \nhomeland security, encompassing over 170,000 people. This legislation \nconsolidates these various responsibilities into one Department which \nwill oversee border security, critical infrastructure protection, and \nemergency preparedness and response.\n  Overall, the new Department, with the Secretary's leadership, will \nintegrate the vast number of government agencies that formulate, \nsupport and carry out the functions critical to homeland security such \nas the border patrol, the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, \nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.\n  This new and dynamic Department will utilize all tools and resources \nof our Government to enhance our homeland security by strengthening and \naugmenting the preparation, communication, coordination and cooperation \nof not only the agencies that will be included, but the rest of the \ngovernment including States and localities.\n  First, it is important to keep in mind that the functions of many of \nthe agencies that will soon become a part of the new Homeland Security \nDepartment are integrated so that dividing them would be detrimental to \nthe purpose of that agency, many of which have non-homeland security \nfunctions.\n  For example, as a member of the Finance Committee, I shared the \nconcerns raised by other members of the committee about any division of \nthe Customs Service when it relocates to the new Department. I \nsupported the Finance Committee's position that Customs move into \nHomeland Security but that the Secretary of the Treasury maintain the \nlegal authority to issue regulations relating to the customs revenue \nfunction.\n  Defending the country's borders and facilitating legitimate trade are \nintertwined functions that should not be separated. By moving Customs \nin its entirety into the Border and Transportation Directorate, this \nlegislation recognizes that the personnel who perform trade enforcement \nand compliance activities at the border are the same personnel who \nperform inspections for security and other enforcement purposes. In \naddition, the information Customs receives from trade compliance \nexaminations and manifests is the same information used to assess \nsecurity risks for shipments. This information is the cornerstone of \nmany of Custom's counter-terrorism efforts.\n\n  This bill also maintains a cohesive and complete Border and \nTransportation Security Directorate by transferring all key border and \ntransportation security agencies to this directorate, including the \nCoast Guard, Customs, and TSA. This includes the Border Patrol and a \nrestructured INS which is not included in the Lieberman bill where it \nis part of a separate Immigration Directorate. Thus, the Directorate \nresponsible for border security is not responsible for the Border \nPatrol or inspecting aliens arriving at ports of entry.\n  The same is true for the Coast Guard. Since the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, the Coast Guard has conducted its largest port security \noperation since World War II to protect and defend our ports and \nwaterways. But this significant amount of effort is simply not enough.\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\n  The Coast Guard needs to be positioned with the other transportation \nand border security agencies if we are going to improve interagency \ncoordination, maximize the effectiveness of our resources, and ensure \nthe Coast Guard receives the intelligence it needs. I strongly believe \nthe Coast Guard is an outstanding role model for Homeland Security and \nwill serve as a cornerstone upon which this new Department will be \nbuilt.\n  At the same time, these new priorities must not diminish the Coast \nGuard's focus on its other traditional missions such as marine safety, \nsearch and rescue, aids to navigation, fisheries law enforcement, and \nmarine environmental protection which are all critically important.\n  The legislative solution I developed with Senators Stevens and \nCollins, that is included in the bill, strikes the proper balance and \nensures the Coast Guard's non-Homeland Security missions will not be \ncompromised by the transfer.\n  To the contrary, our language maintains the primacy of the Coast \nGuard's diverse missions by assuring the Coast Guard Commandant will \nreport to the new Secretary of Homeland Security, rather than to a \ndeputy secretary; assures no Coast Guard personnel or assets will be \ntransferred to another agency; and provides a mechanism to annually \naudit the Coast Guard's performance of its non-homeland security \nmissions.\n  I am pleased to see the inclusion of my amendment requiring the \nadministration to report to Congress within 90 days outlining the \nbenefits of accelerating the Coast Guard's Deepwater procurement \ntimeline from 20 years to 10. The Deepwater project, which will \nrecapitalize all of the Coast Guard assets used off of our coast, is \nalready underway. However, the Coast Guard must wait up to 20 years, in \nsome instances, to acquire already existing technology. We must \naccelerate the Deepwater acquisition project and acquire much needed \nassets for the Coast Guard now, not 20 years down the road.\n  Of course, securing our homeland requires that we figuratively ``push \nout our borders'' as far as possible, and that means we must consider \nthe issuance of visas at our overseas embassies as another vital area \nto be addressed by legislation. After all, consular officers represent \nthe first line of defense against terrorists seeking entry to the U.S. \nEntering the U.S. is a privilege, not a right, and this must be the \nattitude of those reviewing visa applications.\n  That is why I am pleased that this bill grants the Department of \nHomeland Security the authority to determine regulations for issuing \nvisas and provides Homeland Security supervision of this process \nthrough the stationing of Homeland Security Department personnel in \ndiplomatic and consular posts abroad.\n  This legislation also builds on a provision I included in the \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act establishing \nTerrorist Lookout Committees. These committees, comprised of law \nenforcement and intelligence agency personnel in our embassies, meet \nonce a month to discuss names of terrorists or potential terrorists to \nbe added to the lookout list. The inclusion of Homeland Security \npersonnel to the Terrorist Lookout Committees will ensure that our \nfirst line of defense also has the input of this new Department.\n  I introduced Terrorist Lookout Committee legislation in 1995 as part \nof my efforts to strengthen our borders and increase information \nsharing. This, and legislation I introduced to modernize the State \nDepartment's antiquated microfiche lookout system, were a result of a \ntrail of errors by our agencies with regard to Sheikh Rahman, the \nradical Egyptian cleric and mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center \nbombing.\n  In working on terrorism and embassy security issues on the House \nForeign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee, what we \ndiscovered was startling. We found that the Sheikh had entered and \nexited the country five times totally unimpeded, even after the State \nDepartment formally revoked his visa and even after the INS granted him \npermanent resident status. In fact, in March of 1992, the INS rescinded \nthat status which was granted in Newark, New Jersey about a year \nbefore.\n  But then, unbelievably, the Sheikh requested asylum in a hearing \nbefore an immigration judge in the very same city, got a second hearing \nand continued to remain in the country even after the bombing with the \nJustice Department rejecting holding Rahman in custody pending the \noutcome of deportation proceedings and the asylum application, stating \nthat ``in the absence of concrete evidence that Rahman is participating \nin or involved in planning acts of terrorism, the assumption of that \nburden, upon the U.S. government, is considered unwarranted.''\n  Securing our visa process is the reason why legislation I have \nintroduced that requires the new Department to conduct a national \nsecurity study of the use of foreign nationals in handling and \nprocessing visas has been included in this bill.\n  As was shown in Qatar this summer, foreign nationals handling visas \nare entrusted with a great responsibility and we must make sure that \ndoes not compromise our security. For instance, in July it was \ndiscovered that several foreign employees at the U.S. Embassy in Qatar \nmay have been involved in a bribery scheme that allowed 71 Middle \nEastern men, some with possible ties to al-Qaida, to obtain U.S. visas.\n  To strengthen security, my provision requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to review the specific role that foreign nationals \nplay in handling visas and determine the security impact this has at \neach overseas mission and make recommendations as to the role foreign \nnational should have with regard to visas.\n  On this same note, I am also pleased that another provision of mine \nto stop ``visa shopping'', the practice of a foreign national traveling \nto different U.S. Embassies in order to find one that will grant a \nvisa, has also been included in this bill.\n\n  Now, current State Department regulations calling on consular \nofficers to enter a visa denial into the lookout list database so it \ncan be accessed by other Embassies will be codified in law. Seeing that \na foreign national has traveled to another Embassy and been denied will \nmake the decision of a consular officer on whether to grant a visa that \nmuch simpler.\n  Ensuring that the new Department has its own capabilities to analyze \nintelligence is critical to the functioning of the Directorate of \nInformation Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. The Directorate \nwill be responsible for accessing, receiving, and analyzing information \nsuch as intelligence, law enforcement and other information from \nagencies from Federal, State and local governments to detect and \nidentify threats to homeland security. The legislation also will ensure \nthat threat analysis, vulnerability assessments, and risk assessments \nis the responsibility of one Directorate.\n  Also, the bill contains specific language authorizing the Secretary \nto provide a staff of analysts with ``appropriate expertise and \nexperience'' to assist the Directorate in reviewing and analyzing \nintelligence as well as making recommendations for improvements. \nMoreover, the legislation contains specific language I advocated \nauthorizing the Department to hire its own analysts.\n  It is vital that clear language be included to ensure that the new \nDepartment has its own people and does not rely solely on detailees \nfrom other agencies. The bill also permits the new Department to have \npersonnel detailed for analytical duties from the intelligence \ncommunity. It is clear that in the beginning, intelligence analysts \nwill have to be detailees from other agencies until additional people \ncan be fully trained. However, this must not be a permanent situation. \nThat is why I worked with Senator Gramm to ensure the new Department \nhas its own intelligence analysts.\n  Finally, one of the most challenging hurdles to overcome in passing \nthis legislation was a provision of law that has been in statute for \nalmost a quarter-century. This provision referred to as the President's \n``national security exclusion authority'' allows the President to \nexclude agencies, or smaller subdivisions within agencies, from \ncollective bargaining agreements if he determines that the agency or \nsubdivision as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, \ninvestigative or national security work.\n  During this debate, attempts to rescind the President's authority \nwhich\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nhas been in place since President Kennedy first allowed Federal \nemployees to unionize in 1962 and put into statute by President Carter \nin 1978 stalled the consideration of the entire bill. I am pleased, \nhowever, that both sides were ultimately able to come together to find \na workable solution that allows the President to maintain the national \nsecurity exclusion authority that every President has had since \nPresident Kennedy.\n  Once again, the President was right to create a new Department of \nHomeland Security and I applaud the efforts of Governor Ridge to \nformulate this proposal and present it to Congress. We need to come to \ngrips with the reality that a repeat attack could happen at any time \nand, accordingly, not only work to prevent it but also be prepared to \nrespond. The new Department of Homeland Security will bring us closer \nto bringing all of our Nation's resources to bear in securing our \nhomeland.\n  This defining time, as the President has stressed, requires constant \nvigilance as our permanent condition. Because in our war against \nterrorism, to quote Churchill, ``Now is not the end. It is not even the \nbeginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.'' \nWe have now begun a ``new normalcy'' and we can never again let down \nour guard. We owe taking this historic step to the American people and \nto future generations of Americans to ensure an enduring level of \nsecurity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, there is not a person in this Chamber \nwho questions the importance of homeland security or the need to \nimprove the Federal Government's ability to protect our people from \nterrorism. We all saw what happened on September 11th of last year: \nThere was not enough anticipation or coordination, and not enough \naccountability. We can and must do better.\n  What happened last September 11th was a tragedy on a monumental \nscale. It is a date that we will always remember. It is an anniversary \nthat we will always somberly commemorate.\n  But, as I have said before, we must learn from the tragedy of \nSeptember 11th and ensure that our Nation is never again subjected to \nsuch horror. The events of that dark day should spur us to take the \nnecessary steps to establish the instruments and institutions that will \nprovide real protection for the American people. The lessons of \nSeptember 11th will mean little if we are unable to craft a concrete \nresponse to terrorism that demonstrates our unwavering resolve to those \nwho would do us harm.\n  Since shortly after September 11, I have argued that we needed a \nCabinet-level Department to address these concerns. That is why, I have \ndecided to vote for the legislation now before the Senate.\n  We are faced with the choice of either this bill or no bill. And I \nbelieve that we must move the process forward, and send the all-\nimportant message to the people we represent that we are serious about \nprotecting them that we are serious about having better cooperation, \ncoordination, and preparation in the fight against terrorism.\n  That is not to say that I do not have reservations. This bill should \nhave been written differently. I supported an amendment proposed by \nSenator Byrd that would have made the new department less bureaucratic \nand would have provided more accountability, not less. It also would \nhave ensured that Congress played a greater role as the department got \nup and running. Unfortunately, the Byrd amendment was defeated.\n  I was also shocked to see that several special interest riders were \nadded to this bill at the last minute, in the dark of night. I am \nespecially troubled by the new provision that holds harmless any \ncompany that makes mercury-based preservatives for vaccines. One \nexample is Thimerosal, which, evidence shows, may be responsible for \ncausing autism in children.\n  What in the world does such a provision have to do with homeland \nsecurity? I believe this provision will create insecurity in our \nhomeland by sending a message to thousands and thousands of families \nthat their children's health takes a distant second place to the \ninterests of large corporations. This bill should be about homeland \nsecurity, not family insecurity.\n  With one call from the White House, these special interest additions \nto the bill could have been eliminated. But that did not happen, and \nthe Daschle amendment to strip them from the bill, which I strongly \nsupported, was defeated. As a result, this bill has been perverted from \nits original meaning and intent. I expect to work with my colleagues \nnext year to reverse these special interest riders.\n  I am troubled by this bill's treatment of the new department's \nworkers. It gives the President virtually unfettered authority to strip \neven the most minimal worker protections affecting everything from job \nclassification, pay rates, rules for labor management relations, and \nthe process for firing and demoting employees. These provisions were \nunnecessary and unfair.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the effect this legislation will have \non my State of California on matters that have nothing to do with \nhomeland security. Many existing Federal agencies will be moved lock, \nstock and barrel into this new department, with little regard to the \nservices that those agencies provide to the American people and to the \npeople of California. The Department of Homeland Security is largely \nabout protection and enforcement. When vital services for the people of \nthis country such as FEMA disaster assistance and the Coast Guard's \nsearch and rescue role are thrown into an agency whose mission and \npurpose is primarily enforcement, I fear that these much-needed \nservices will suffer.\n  However, despite these reservations, I will vote for this bill. We \nmust move forward on protecting the American people from another \npossible terrorist attack. And creating a new Cabinet-level Department \nof Homeland Security, which I have supported for the past year, is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Through my committee assignments and by enlisting the support of my \ncolleagues, I will keep a sharp eye on the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity and work to make sure we take the additional steps necessary \nto truly protect the security of the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the homeland \nsecurity bill. I believe that today we are taking definitive action to \nput the Government in a better position to prevent and respond to acts \nof terrorism. The creation of a Department to oversee homeland security \nhas been a tremendous undertaking for the White House and Congress. It \nhas forced all of us to face multiple challenges, including overcoming \nthe various agencies' desire for self-preservation and the longstanding \nturf battles we are all too familiar with. Regardless of these \ndifficulties, we have no choice but to strengthen our national \nsecurity. A Department of Homeland Security is our best answer, and I \nhave tried to do all that I could to enhance the effectiveness of the \nNew Department.\n  This new Department will have to improve and coordinate our \nintelligence analysis and sharing functions, as well as our law \nenforcement efforts. Our Nation needs to do everything possible to make \nsure the attacks of a year ago never happen on American soil again. The \ncreation of the Department will help coordinate our homeland security \nefforts and better protect the United States from terrorist attack.\n  The new Department will also identify and destroy barriers to \neffective communication and cooperation between the many entities \ninvolved in America's national security. It will identify our security \nand intelligence shortcomings and resolve them appropriately. It should \nalso guarantee that the various infrastructure protection agencies \nmoving to it have a smooth and seamless transition, and that whistle \nprotections are given to each and every employee, without exception.\n  I was glad to have an opportunity to work with the sponsors of the \nbill to secure adequate whistleblower rights for Department employees. \nBecause rights are worthless unless you have a process by which those \nrights can be addressed, I worked with the sponsors to ensure that \nwhistleblowers have procedural remedies. The bill's whistleblower \nprotection language grants the Department's employees the same \nWhistleblower Protection Act rights that are currently enjoyed by \nalmost all other Federal employees.\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\n  Another big part of (the homeland security bill includes provision to \nrestructure the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The new \nDepartment will be instrumental in securing our border, but we will \nhave to steadily implement changes to improve the agency's service and \nenforcement functions. Improvements to this agency are long overdue and \ncannot be ignored after this bill passes. Just because we have \nstreamlined their management, the INS's performance will be scrutinized \nin the years to come. The INS will be accountable to the American \npeople, and I look forward to seeing some changes in the way they do \ntheir business.\n  I am pleased that I was able to work on an immigration reform measure \nthat will strengthen the Secretary's visa issuance powers. This \nprovision authorizes the DHS Secretary to put DHS agents at consular \nposts or requires a finding that DHS agents aren't needed, and it gives \nthe DHS Secretary influence in the State Department personnel matters \nrelating to visa issuance. It also requires annual reports to the \nCongress on security issues at each consular post. These changes will \nhelp us avoid dangerous programs like visa express that let terrorists \nin without any real screening.\n  I am also pleased that the homeland security bill we are considering \ntoday incorporates a number of our recommendations to ensure that the \ninternational trade functions of the Customs Service are not subsumed \nby the need for strong law enforcement under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. In order to achieve this, we included a number of procedural \nprotections. However, even with these safeguards, I am somewhat \nconcerned that an attitude could prevail over time in which the trade \nfunction of the Customs Service become nothing more than a tool for the \nenforcement functions. I do not think this is an insignificant concern. \nToday, Customs operates under the umbrella of the Treasury Department, \nwhose core mission it is to serve as a steward of the economy. Moving \nthe 200 year old agency to Homeland Security could fundamentally alter \nthe traditional mission and culture of the U.S. Customs Service. As the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, I plan to exercise my \noversight function diligently to make sure that this does not happen.\n\n  Another provision that I worked hard to secure, along with Senator \nHerb Kohl of Wisconsin, is the transfer of ATF agents to the Justice \nDepartment. The firearms and explosives experts will work alongside the \nFBI and the DEA at Justice Department. The firearms and explosives \nexpert will work alongside the FBI and the DEA at Justice, and the \nrevenue-collection experts and auditors will stay at the Treasury \nDepartment. This move will help coordinate criminal and antiterrorism \ninvestigatives at the DOJ, but will keep the ATF's revenue-collection \nduties at Treasury where they belong. So I thank the leadership for \nmaking sure these important changes were made.\n  I also applaud the inclusion of language that I advocated requiring \nthe new Secretary to appoint a senior official to be responsible for \nensuring the adequacy of resources of drug interdiction. The smuggling, \ntransportation, and financing organizations that facilitate illegal \ndrug trafficking can just as easily smuggle terrorists or terror \nweapons into the United States. Many of the agencies being moved into \nthe new Department were previously focused on the fight against \nnarcotics. By coordinating counternarcotics policy and operations, this \nnew official will ensure that our efforts to respond to future acts of \nterrorism will not come at the price of relaxing our efforts against \nthe dehumanizing and painful effects of drug use on society and \nfamilies.\n  I was also pleased to work with Senators Lott and Bennett on FOIA \nprovisions that encourage the private sector to alert government \nofficials about risks to our critical national infrastructures. While \npublic disclosure laws such as FOIA are central to the policy of \npreserving openness in government, they sometimes serve to inhibit our \nability to receive vitally important national security-related \ninformation from information from businesses that fear unwarranted loss \nof public confidence and use by competitors, criminals, and terrorists. \nThis new language will strike the dedicate balance between ``sunshine'' \nin government and the responsibility that we have to collect and share \nsensitive information about infrastructure vulnerabilities in an \natmosphere of trust and confidence.\n  The ultimate goal here before us is to help our intelligence and law \nenforcement communities at being the best they can be at protecting our \nnation and the American people. But we can't build a new house with \nbroken blocks. If we don't fix the problems at the various agencies \nthat will make up the new Department, we won't see real homeland \nsecurity. A lot of work has been done, and I believe we are on the \nright track. I believe this plan is indeed the answer for effective \nhomeland security, now and for the future. Let's move forward from here \nand get it done.\n\n\n                           Homeland Security\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will vote for the bill before us \ntoday, but I do so with some serious reservations.\n  First, and most importantly, I do not want the American public to \nconclude that by passing this one bill we do not need to do anything \nelse in order to protect our homeland. While housing such agencies as \nFEMA, the Customs Department, and the Border Patrol under one roof will \nbe advantageous, especially in the long run, little in this bill goes \nthe heart of what went wrong leading up to September 11. Simply put, \nour country has been plagued, and we continue to be plagued, by a \nmyriad of intelligence shortcomings. We have not done an effective job \nof gathering intelligence on al Qaeda cells residing right now in our \ncountry, and, perhaps even more importantly, our intelligence agencies \nhave not been effectively sharing intelligence with each other. We hear \nstory upon story about a lack of analysts with language skills, \noutdated computer systems, and turf battles.\n  And now we hear, for the first time, that the administration is \nconsidering the need to create a new domestic intelligence agency. We \nhear that our Nation's top national security officials met for 2 hours \nthis past Veterans Day to discuss this issue. Clearly, we need a plan \nto deal with domestic terrorism surveillance and to implement systems, \nprocedures, and oversight to make sure that our intelligence agencies \nare talking to each other. Unfortunately, the current bill is largely \nsilent on these issues.\n  Second, I have serious concerns that the administration will be \nundertaking the most massive government reorganization in over 50 years \nwhile we are in the middle of our war against terrorism. Osama Bin \nLaden is still at large, and just last week he threatened new attacks. \nIndeed, the administration recently has warned us about ``spectacular'' \nattacks against our country. We must take great care that this massive \nreorganization does not compromise any of our ongoing efforts in our \ncampaign to protect our homeland.\n  Finally, I cannot stand silent about the egregious, superfluous, \nspecial-interest giveaways put into this bill at the very last minute \nby the administration acting in concert with Republican leaders in the \nHouse and Senate, everything from shutting the courtroom doors to \nfamilies injured by pharmaceutical companies to allowing offshore tax \nhaven companies to compete for homeland security contracts.\n  So while I support the bill before us today, it is certainly not a \nperfect bill. Even more importantly, our work has just begun. The \nadministration now needs to ensure that in creating this massive new \nDepartment it does so in a way that does not compromise the vital and \nongoing work of the agencies involved. It is also imperative that we \nfix the central problem with our Nation's homeland security defenses, \nthat of the lapses in our Nation's intelligence gathering and sharing \nefforts, and that we do so now. I wish we would have dealt with this \nmore gaping security hole first, but all we can do now is to redouble \nour efforts in this most vital pursuit.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the Senate today took an important step \nto combat domestic terrorism and improve safety at home. The Department \nof Homeland Security will help protect our communities by coordinating \nprevention and response efforts throughout the country.\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\n  The legislation also maintains the integrity of the Coast Guard, so \nthat the important function of search and rescue, drug interdiction, \nand environmental protection will not be degraded.\n  Throughout his tenure, I have found Governor Tom Ridge to be a \nresponsive member of this Administration, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with him in a constructive manner.\n  While much of this legislation is important and necessary, I am \nconcerned about several of the provisions.\n  First, are the special interest gifts to the pharmaceutical and \nmanufacturing industries that House Republican leaders slipped into the \nbill last week.\n  Second, are the new surveillance powers granted to the Federal \nGovernment, and the potential impact on Americans' civil liberties. The \nAdministration has assured Congress and the American people that the \nnew authority will be used judiciously, and the Administration now must \nact responsibly and prudently.\n  Third, I believe that men and women who serve their country in \nuniform are entitled to the same civil service protections as other \nfederal workers, and I am disappointed that because of this bill, some \nworkers will lost important rights.\n  I intend to work with the new Department to protect Washington \nState's interests and will continue to monitor the implementation of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, our world has changed dramatically since \nthe tragic events of September 11, and by passing this bill, we are \ntaking a momentous step forward in providing for the security of \nAmericans at home. But I am concerned we might be missing an integral \ncomponent to this secure system. We have outlined parameters for \ninformation security, privacy and authentication. But, how can we truly \nensure someone is who he/she says they are before we give them these \nhigh-tech credentials? We have gone to great lengths to ensure the \nsecurity of these counterfeit-proof credentials, but we need to also \naccount for the validity of the information used to establish identity \nin the first place. What happens if we give someone a secure document \nwith a biometric under a false name?\n  The events of September 11 were orchestrated by a group of foreign \nindividuals who used false information to receive legitimate U.S. \nidentification documents like visas, passports, driver's licenses, and \nillegally entered this country. Identity fraud is no longer just a \ncrime perpetrated by a common criminal to steal a credit card. Identity \ntheft is now a tool employed by terrorist organizations to infiltrate \nAmerica and harm our citizens. Terrorists have been able to take \nadvantage of our ineffective and antiquated systems and assume false \nidentities.\n  In this bill, we establish an Under Secretary for Border and \nTransportation Security with the charge of preventing terrorists from \nentering this country. We need to make sure he or she has the tools \nnecessary to authenticate a person's identity. Authentication of non-\nU.S. citizens entering the United States must be a top priority. We \nhave bipartisan support for such an effort and we must establish a \nsystem that ensures the identity of foreign individuals upon initial \nentrance into this country.\n  For years, identity authentication systems have been used in the U.S. \nto prevent fraud in the consumer banking industry. Following the \nterrorist attacks on September 11, these systems have been adapted for \nnational security purposes. These systems access a wide number of \nidentifiers in domestic public records and use scoring and modeling \nmethods to determine whether a particular person is who they say they \nare. These systems must be expanded to include publicly available \ninformation on individuals from foreign countries.\n  The President has said, ``This nation, in world war and in Cold War, \nhas never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's course. \nNow, as before, we will secure our nation, protect our freedom, and \nhelp others to find freedom of their own.'' Let me be clear. There are \npeople who deserve to enter this country and there are people who don't \ndeserve to enter any country. We must have the ability to verify an \nindividual is who they say they are the first time they apply for a \nvisa. As we move forward, we must establish an identity authentication \nsystem that targets the 26 nations designated by the State Department \nas state sponsors of terrorism.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to discuss the legislation before \nthe Senate to create a Department of Homeland Security. I have said \nthroughout the debate on this legislation that I support the creation \nof a homeland security department, and despite my strong reservations \nabout many of the specific provisions in the bill, I intend to support \nfinal passage today. The Senate has expressed its will through the \namendment process, and while I have been disappointed with the outcome \nof many of the votes, the bill before us has the potential to improve \nour government's ability to combat terrorism against our people. \nInsuring domestic tranquility and providing for the common defense are \namong the most sacred Constitutional duties our constituents sent us \nhere to fulfill, and on that basis alone this bill, while far from \nperfect, deserves to move forward.\n  I will discuss many of the positive aspects of this legislation \nshortly, but first I want to outline some of my concerns with the bill. \nFirst, I am deeply disappointed that the House Republican leadership \ninserted into this must-pass legislation to protect our homeland a host \nof special interest giveways. The bill creates new liability protection \nfor pharmaceutical companies by wiping out pending litigation; guts the \nWellstone amendment that prohibited contracting with corporate \nexpatriates; reverses the aviation security bill by providing special \nimmunity to the companies that provided passenger and baggage screening \nin airports--companies that may have violated numerous security \nregulations on September 11; allows the Department to hold secret \nadvisory committee meetings with hand picked industry advisors, even on \nnon-sensitive matters, waiving the Federal Advisory Committee Act; and \nprovides immunity from liability for manufacturers of products or \ntechnologies that cause harm to Americans.\n  I also have concerns about provisions in this bill that would \nundermine the basic rights of federal employees to belong to unions and \nto bargain collectively with management over working conditions.\n  Forty years ago, President Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988 \ngranting federal employees the right to organize and bargain \ncollectively. President Nixon expanded employees' rights in 1969, and \nthese rights were subsequently codified in the 1978 Civil Service \nReform Act. These fundamental rights have never interfered with the \nprovision of government services, including homeland security, and in \nfact I would argue they have strengthened our government by helping us \nto recruit and retain highly qualified employees who might otherwise \nlook elsewhere for work. Union members are among our nation's most \npatriotic, dedicated and selfless public servants. When the World Trade \nCenter was burning on September 11, the unionized firemen, police \nofficers, and emergency medical personnel in New York did not stop and \nask for a collective bargaining session. They went up the stairs, into \nthe fire, and gave their lives so that others might be saved.\n  Of the 170,000 federal employees who would likely be moved to the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security, at least 40,000 belong to unions and \npossess collective bargaining rights, including employees of the \nCustoms Service, Border Partrol, and other important agencies. Our \ngoal, as was proposed in the bill drafted by Senator Lieberman and \nreported by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, was to ensure \nthat no federal employee who currently has the right to join a union \nwould lose that right under the homeland security reorganization. \nAgencies where employees currently do not have collective bargaining \nrights, such as the Transportation Security Administration and the \nSecret Service, would not have been affected.\n\n  To maintain the existing rights of union members transferred into the \nnew Department, the Governmental Affairs Committee bill included a \nbipartisan provision that would update this formula. Under that bill, \nmanagement could deprive transferred employees of their collective \nbargaining rights if\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\ntheir work is ``materially changed'' after the transfer; their \n``primary job duty'' is ``intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative duties directly related to the investigation of \nterrorism''; and their rights would ``clearly'' have a substantial \nadverse effect on national security.'' This provision was carefully \ncrafted on a bipartisan basis to give the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity the flexibility he or she needs while preserving the rights of \ntens of thousands of employees who have possessed collective bargaining \nrights for decades and will be performing exactly the same work under a \ndifferent letterhead.\n  Unfortunately, the House drafted bill before us today does away with \nthese protections. Under this bill, the President may waive existing \nunion rights if he determines they would have a substantial adverse \nimpact on the Department's ability to protect homeland security. He \nmust send a written explanation to the House and Senate at least 10 \ndays in advance, but no Congressional approval is required. \nFurthermore, the bill allows the Administration to waive existing civil \nservice protections over union objections. Although he would be \nrequired to notify Congress and engage in a 30-day mediation \nadministered by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, if \nmediation is not successful the President could waive civil service \nprovisions notwithstanding union objections and act without \nCongressional approval.\n  I am also concerned about the provisions related to the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program, VICP. The VICP is a no-fault alternative \nto the tort system for resolving claims resulting from naturally \noccurring, adverse reactions to mandated childhood vaccines.\n  Over the years, the VICP has proven to be a successful component of \nour National Immunization Program. It has protected vaccine \nmanufacturers, who play a critical role in the protection of public \nhealth against unlimited liability while also providing injured parties \nwith an expeditious and relatively less contentious process by which to \nseek compensation.\n  However, the provisions contained in this homeland security bill \nconsist of one page of a 26-page bill introduced by Senator Frist \nearlier this year, S. 2053, the Improved Vaccine Affordability and \nAvailability Act. While it has been argued that these provisions are \nneeded to protect vaccine manufacturers, the fact is that manufacturers \nare already protected under VICP.\n  Senator Frist's bill contains a number of provisions related to \nincreasing vaccine rates among adolescents and adults, bringing greater \nstability to the vaccine market through the creation of a rigorous \nstockpile of routine childhood vaccines and reforms to the Vaccine \nInjury Compensation Program. Letters of support that have been cited on \nthe Senate floor, from the Advisory Committee on Childhood Vaccines and \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, expressed support for these \nprovisions, but only in the context of the comprehensive legislation \nset forth by Senator Frist, not on their own. The three sections that \nhave been inserted simply have no place in a homeland security bill. \nThese sections lack the thoughtful and comprehensive approach that is \nrequired to address the myriad challenges facing our childhood \nimmunization program.\n  Finally, I am concerned with the immigration provisions in this \nlegislation. There is general agreement on the proposal to transfer all \nfunctions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service into the new \nDepartment. However, rather than establishing a single, accountable \ndirector for immigration policy, the bill calls for enforcement \nfunctions to be carried out by the new Bureau of Border Security within \nthe Border and Transportation Security Directorate, while immigration \nservice functions will be in a separate Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services that reports directly to the Deputy Secretary. \nWhile the bill does call for coordination among policymakers at each of \nthe bureaus, they will ultimately establish their own immigration \npolicy and interpretation of laws. I urge the Administration to ensure \nthat policy coordination among the enforcement and services bureaus is \ncomprehensive and consistent, so that the result for the nation's \nimmigration system is real reform and not a new period of disarray.\n\n  Nothwithstanding all of the concerns I have summarized, I believe \nthat this legislation and the new department it creates have the \npotential to make the American people safer. The legislation will \nconsolidate more than two dozen disparate federal agencies, offices, \nand programs into a focused and accountable Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The bill will bring together into a single Border and \nTransportation Security Directorate our Customs Service, the border \nquarantine inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nof the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the new Transportation Security \nAdministration, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Within \nthis directorate, the bill also creates an Office of Domestic \nPreparedness to oversee our preparedness for terrorist attacks and to \nprovide equipment, exercises, and training to states. The Coast Guard \nwill also be in the new department, reporting directly to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security.\n  The Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection will enable the Department to ``connect the dots'' by \norganizing analyzing, and integrating data it collects at ports and \npoints of entry with intelligence data from other parts of the \ngovernment. The bill also provides the Department with access to \nunevaluated intelligence. It establishes separate Assistant Secretaries \nfor information analysis and infrastructure protection, and has \nlanguage making it clear that the Directorate's intelligence mandate is \nbroader than infrastructure protection and including deterring, \npreempting, and responding to terrorist attacks.\n  The Directorate for Science and Technology will conduct and promote \nlong-term homeland security research and spearhead rapid technology \ndevelopment and deployment. It will bring together scientific \ncapabilities now spread throughout the federal government to identify \nand develop countermeasures to chemical, biological, radiological, \nnuclear, and other emerging terrorist threats.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a directorate of Emergency \nPreparedness and Response, with the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA at its core, which will help to ensure the effectiveness \nof emergency response to terrorist attacks,major disasters and other \nemergencies by bringing under the Department's directorate several \nfederal programs in addition to FEMA: the Domestic Emergency Support \nTeams of the Department of Justice, and the Strategic National \nStockpile and the National Disaster Medical System of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. The Department will also have the authority \nto coordinate the response efforts of the Nuclear Incident Response \nTeam, made up of elements of the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe Department of Energy. One of most important responsibilities of \nthis directorate will be to establish comprehensive programs for \ndeveloping interoperative communications technology, and to ensure that \nemergency response providers acquire such technology.\n  These are all laudable and important goals, but because we have been \nblocked from passing the appropriations bills that would provide the \nresources the Department needs to perform its mission, our work is far \nfrom complete. Providing these resources will be our task on homeland \nsecurity in the months ahead, and I hope my colleagues and the \nPresident give this task the same attention and effort they gave to \ncreating a Department of Homeland Security.\n  Madam President, because I believe the people of Rhode Island and \nAmericans everywhere want to see the creation of a Homeland Security \nDepartment that will improve our ability to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks, I intend to support this legislation despite my \nconcerns about many of the specific provisions included in the House \ndraft of the bill before us today.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is able to pass \nlegislation to establish the Department of Homeland Security before \nCongress adjourns the 107th Congress sine die. After the terror attacks \non September 11, 2001 it has been the mission of President Bush and \nmany in Congress to create this new Department, and it\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\nis particularly pleasing to get this done now rather than waiting until \nCongress starts up the 108th Congress in January of 2003. And I know as \nwell the American people are supportive of getting this legislation \npassed now rather than later.\n  Those who oppose this legislation before us may have some legitimate \nand principled concerns as to why they do not support this bill. By all \nmeans, the bill is not entirely perfect and I think most members of \nCongress would attest to that. But neither were the original bills to \ncreate any other federal department or agency perfect on the first try. \nThat is why we have committee hearings on these issues, and I am sure \nwe will pass supplemental and technical bills over the years to \nlegislatively mold the new Department of Homeland Security so that it \nis stronger and more efficient.\n  But we needed to get this bill rolling now. Every day is vital as we \nfight this new war on terrorism. Delaying the creation of this new \ndepartment another three or four months could set America back in her \ndefenses. Every day that goes by without work being done to create and \norganize this new department simply puts us back further and further. \nWe just can't afford to let that happen. This is serious business.\n  Although this bill may not be perfect and some may disagree with a \nfew of its provisions, it is not so controversial that the bill \ndeserves nor needs to be killed outright. We can come back and revisit \nthose extraneous provisions some of my colleagues have been talking \nabout. But we need to get the ball rolling. Agencies need to be \nrealigned. We need to get rid of some of the duplicity amongst some of \nthese agencies. Communication and information channels need to be \nstreamlined. There is a lot of work to be done and every day counts.\n  Earlier in this debate I came to the floor and spoke about the need \nfor President Bush and future presidents to be able to have the \nauthority and flexibility to hire and transfer employees, and even be \nable to terminate some employees, within the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity to ensure its mission can be undertaken. For weeks we had a \nreal disagreement on this issue. Some wanted to ensure that workers \nwere protected and preserved in their employment regardless of their \nperformance or real need.\n  Fortunately, in the end we have a piece of legislation that frees the \nhands of the president by giving him the necessary management and \npersonnel flexibilities to integrate these new agencies into a more \neffective whole. While providing this flexibility, we still preserve \nthe fundamental worker protections from unfair practices such as \ndiscrimination, political coercion, and whistle-blower reprisal. This \nflexibility and authority will better serve our president, the homeland \nand Americans.\n  New provisions are also added to this bill to help protect our \nborders. We do this by moving the Coast Guard, Customs Service, \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, and border inspectors at Animal \nPlant Health Inspection Services all under the new Department of \nHomeland Security. This action is long overdue and a reminder to us \nthat the first step in defending America is to secure her borders.\n  As well, this bill helps to ensure that our communities and first \nresponders are prepared to address threats. This bill does this by \nmoving FEMA and the Secret Service under the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. By moving FEMA, we are clarifying who's in charge, and \nresponse teams will be able to communicate clearly and work with one \nanother. We will also benefit by the Department of Homeland Security \nbeing able to depend on the Secret Service's protective functions and \nsecurity expertise.\n  Some have voiced concerns that we are limiting and not protecting the \nfreedoms and privacy of Americans in this bill. I would say to my \ncolleagues that at the core, the real reason for this bill is to ensure \njust the opposite, to provide security and protect our freedoms. We \nhave in this bill specific legal protections to ensure that our freedom \nis not undermined. This bill prohibits the federal government from \nhaving the authority to nationalize drivers' licenses and other ID \ncards.\n  Also, the bill establishes a privacy officer. This is the first such \nofficer established by law in a cabinet department. Working as a close \nadvisor to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, this \nprivacy officer will ensure technology research and new regulations \nrespect the civil liberties Americans enjoy.\n  There are many other vital provisions in this bill which are needed \nto better protect our freedom and the homeland. It is a good and solid \nbill. It may not be perfect, but rarely are there any perfect pieces of \nlegislation we pass here in the Senate. I am sure we will revisit this \nlegislation and issue again, in committee hearings as well as \nconsidering technical and supplemental homeland legislation on the \nSenate floor.\n  But it is imperative we pass this legislation now. We have worked \nhard on this bill, too hard to just let it die in the 107th Congress. \nWe need to get it to President Bush's desk before we adjourn sine die. \nThe sooner we get it to him, the better it is for the protection of the \nhomeland and Americans.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to express my support for the \ncreation of a Cabinet level Department of Homeland Security that better \nenables our border security agencies to coordinate and work together. I \nbelieve that if properly implemented such a Department will better \nprotect our country from the threat of terrorism.\n  The tragedy of September 11 demonstrated that our homeland security \napparatus is dangerously disorganized, and that our vulnerabilities \nwere real; we learned that we need organizational clarity and \naccountability to face the crucial challenge of improving homeland \nsecurity.\n  On balance, the new Department of Homeland Security will reduce our \nvulnerability to the terrorist threat and minimize the damage and help \nrecover from any attacks that do occur. However, we need to recognize \nthat this is only a first step. The challenge of homeland security will \nrequire more than bureaucratic reorganization, we need to ensure that \nour efforts are bolstered with a real commitment to the attention and \nfunding necessary to implement some of the goals of this legislation.\n  Although I will ultimately support the homeland security bill, I do \nso with the recognition that no legislation is perfect. This \nlegislation is, indeed, not perfect and it will demand continued \nattention and oversight by Congress to ensure that it lives up to its \naspirations in ensuring our homeland security, while not betraying our \nprinciples of governance and freedom.\n  One area that I have particular concerns is in regards to our \ncontinued efforts to address the issue of information and information \nsharing within the careful balance of security goals and civil liberty \nprotections.\n  I am particularly concerned with provisions of the bill that fail to \nexplicitly address the broader concerns of privacy for American \ncitizens and that reduce our access to public information through the \nFOIA process. I am particularly frustrated because both of these \ntroubling provisions, provisions to enhance sharing of information \nabout suspected terrorist activity with local law enforcement, and \nprovisions to limit access to sensitive information available under the \nFreedom of Information Act, were negotiated and careful compromises \nwere arrived at in the earlier version of the Gramm-Miller Senate \nsubstitute and in Senator Schumer's bill, S. 1615, the Federal-Local \nInformation Sharing Partnership Act.\n  The timely sharing of investigative information between various \nenforcement and intelligence agencies can provide necessary \nimprovements in our nation's security. Unfortunately, the version that \nis contained in this legislation provides absolutely no limitations on \nhow this information can be used or disseminated. This is particularly \ntroubling because we have already expanded the type and amount of \npersonal information available in federal databases. To greatly expand \naccess to personal information without providing any protections on its \nuse is a dangerous erosion of our valued right to privacy and has the \npotential to eviscerate the protections that the Constitution \nguarantees Americans against unfettered government intrusion into \nprivacy. I support greater access to information, and I believe that\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\nit is primarily through appropriate use of information technology that \nwe are likely to make real improvements in our domestic security, but \ngreater access to personal information cannot come without offsetting \nprotections against its misuse.\n\n  The very broad language, inserted for the first time by the House, \noffers no procedural mechanisms to assure the government adheres to \nprotections of privacy or civil liberties. Information sharing without \ncitizen recourse or correction, without adequate procedural safeguards, \nhas the potential to undermine the privacy of every citizen. The Senate \nhas already acted on this issue and language exists that can better \nprovide access to local law enforcement while also providing real \nprotections to our citizens. This legislation has already passed the \nJudiciary Committee and I am committed to working with Senator Schumer \nto passing this legislation next year.\n  In addition, this bill previously contained carefully crafted \nlanguage that protected sensitive information from discovery through \nthe Freedom of Information act. The Freedom of Information act is a \nvaluable tool in assuring open and accountable government and I believe \nthat any effort to alter it must be carefully considered. This careful \nconsideration produced the language in the original bill, a compromise \ncrafted by Senators Bennett, Levin and Leahy. As the editorial board of \nthe Olympian wrote today ``The public is already leery of government \nand understands that public records are one means of keeping elected \nand appointed officials in check'' Unfortunately, this bill contains a \nvery broad exemption which has the potential to protect much \ninformation from public scrutiny. We must be cautious in taking steps \nthat reduce open access to government and I am concerned about the \nbroad nature of this language.\n  I am also very disappointed by how the Immigration and Naturalization \nService is reorganized within the Homeland Security Agency. By \ncompletely separating the service and enforcement functions of the INS, \nI believe that we will only be compounding the problems that already \nplague this moribund agency. Coordination between the service and \nenforcement arms of the INS is required to make the agency more \nefficient and to ensure that its dual missions of enforcing the law \nagainst those here illegally and facilitating residence and citizenship \nfor those here legally achieve the same level of support.\n  Last, a major stumbling block in passing this legislation has been \nthe concern with the rights of many talented employees already employed \nby agencies who will be moving into the Homeland Defense Department. I \ndo not believe this legislation provides adequate safeguards for these \nemployees and I believe that the Congress will need to perform a great \ndeal of oversight to make certain that abuses do not occur in this \narena.\n  As I said before, no legislation is perfect, and our job in Congress \nis not over with the passage of this bill. We need to remain dedicated \nand focused in our task of ensuring that the implementation of this \nbill is accomplished effectively and consistent with the principles and \nrights that have made this country great.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to discuss the bill before us dealing \nwith the creation of a department of Homeland Security.\n  I applaud Senator Lieberman for developing this idea of a new \ndepartment to protect our Nation against the horrible specter of \nterrorist attacks on our cities and citizens.\n  The people of Nevada look to the Federal Government to make sure that \nour State and our Nation are secure.\n  We all agree that our Federal Government can, and should, do much \nbetter at preventing attacks, defending against attacks, and mitigating \nthe consequences of attacks.\n  In Nevada, we have already begun to help. The Nevada Test Site has \nestablished itself as one of the premier centers for emergency \nresponder training. Under the new Department, this facility will only \nflourish. The new Department will also help develop the burgeoning \ncounterterrorism programs at Nevada's major research institutions, \nincluding the University of Nevada-Las Vegas and the University of \nNevada-Reno. The people of Nevada have a proud history of providing the \nnation with the necessary skills, hard work and vision to protect our \nNation. I know Nevada will do the same for the war on terrorism.\n  A new department of Homeland Security will be a good start, but this \nnew Department is by no means the finish line in the effort to defense \nour nation.\n  More important, this new Department must not be a distraction from \nthe job of protecting our Homeland. If it turns our that the \nconsolidated departments, agencies and bureaus are spending more time \nlooking for their new desks instead of hunting down Osama Bin Laden, I \nwill be the first one to work on legislation to fix it.\n  We must not believe that establishing this Department ends the need \nfor vigilant oversight, and we must not give in to the false security \nthat a new Department could provide. Protecting our Nation from the \nhorrors of terrorist attacks involves more than changing the name, \nmoving offices and shuffling desks around.\n  Protecting our Nation requires strengthening our intelligence \ngathering and analysis--it means improving the communication between \nmany Federal departments and agencies--it means providing the funding \nwe need for research and technology investments--it means tapping the \nresources of the American entrepreneur and the soul of the American \nworker.\n  The proposed Department will address many of these concerns, but not \nall of them.\n  I am voting to support this legislation, because the President claims \nthat it will be more than just a name change. I will be watching very \nclosely to make sure that it is.\n  There are several areas that I plan to keep a close eye on.\n  First, this new Department, though it has some new intelligence \nsharing responsibilities, will not fix the problems at either the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation or the Central Intelligence Agency or \nthe lack of coordination and cooperation between the two. Those \nagencies were left out of the Department of Homeland Security, even \nthough they share tremendous responsibility for the Administration's \nfailure to properly interpret the intelligence warnings before \nSeptember 11.\n  Second, this bill gives tremendous authority to the executive branch \nof the Government. With that authority comes tremendous responsibility. \nIn particular, this new strong authority presents a tremendous \npotential for abuse and misuse. I am disappointed that such an \nimportant piece of legislation would be used to weaken important \nprovisions of our law. This bill makes unnecessary attacks on the \nability of the American people to access Federal documents, and on the \nprotections afforded the people who work for the Federal Government.\n  The labor provisions of this bill still fall far short of what I'd \nlike to see. I still believe that it is entirely possible to reorganize \nour homeland defense efforts and dramatically improve the state of our \nNation's security without stripping dedicated and loyal workers of \nbasic protections in their jobs. All across the country, there are \nunion members holding jobs that require flexible deployment, immediate \nmobilization, quick response, and judicious use of sensitive \ninformation. Police and firefighters have union protections, and their \nability to bargain collectively actually improves our ability to fight \ncrime and fires. The union protections make the jobs attractive enough \nfor talented individuals to want to stay in the positions for long \nperiods of time. We as a society gain because we are able to retain \nskilled people to work on our behalf.\n  Senator Lieberman's bill was able to preserve a fair balance in this \nrespect. His legislation retained most labor rights, but in cases where \nnational security might otherwise be compromised, the President would \nhave the flexibility to do whatever was necessary to protect the \ncountry.\n  This bill, on the other hand, will drive many talented individuals to \nlook for employment elsewhere, in positions that afford at least a \nminimal level of job security and due process. I fear that over time we \nwill see a deterioration in the caliber of employees that join this \ndepartment, and I expect to revisit the labor provisions before many \nyears have passed.\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\n  I am also deeply troubled by the efforts to allow this department to \noperate in secrecy. We have seen the unfortunate impacts of secrecy in \nthe development of a national energy policy by the administration. This \nbill would continue this dangerous trend on the part of the \nadministration. The administration appears to be more concerned with \nprotecting the corporations' bottom-line than defending the citizens \nright-to-know.\n\n  I also have strong concerns about many of the provisions included in \nthis bill that do not relate directly to the creation of the department \nof security.\n  A tax loophole has allowed dozens of U.S. corporations to move their \nheadquarters, on paper only, to tax haven countries to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of U.S. taxes. Several months ago, Paul Wellstone and \nI offered an amendment to bar the Department of Homeland Security from \nawarding government contracts to these corporate tax runaways. The \nSenate adopted that amendment unanimously, but this bill guts that \nagreement. It is a sad reality that these corporate expatriations are \ntechnically legal under current law. But legal or not, there is no \nreason why the U.S. government should reward tax runaways with \nlucrative government contracts.\n  Paul and I felt that if these corporations want Federal contracts so \nbadly, they should come home. Just come back to the United States, and \nthey'd be eligible to bid on homeland security contracts. And if they \ndidn't want to do that, then they should go lobby the Bermuda \ngovernment for contracts there. It should have been a priority of this \nlegislation to guarantee that the Department of Homeland Security \nconduct its business with corporations who do their share to bear the \nburdens of protecting this country. This legislation is more concerned \nwith window-dressing on this issue.\n  Although I agree that the agency primarily responsible for the \nsecurity and safeguarding of nuclear material, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, should not be in the new Department, the bill does not \naddress the important issues of chemical and nuclear power plant \nsecurity. Protecting our energy infrastructure involves challenges \nrelated to the appropriate sharing of responsibility between the \nprivate companies who own and operate these facilities and the Federal \nGovernment. Our existing laws do not considered fully the implications \na terrorist attack would have on our ability to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks on these facilities.\n  These concerns are real. In fact, the President raised the specter of \na terrorist attack on one of our nation's nuclear power plants in his \nState of the Union address. And just a few days ago we were warned \nagain that these facilities are potential targets. The Department of \nHomeland Security should work quickly with other federal agencies to \nimprove their security, until the Congress is able to enact appropriate \nlegislation to protect them.\n  Many of my colleagues have eloquently described the outrageous \nspecial interest provisions that were included in this bill, so I won't \nrepeat many of those points. I do want to say that I am disappointed \nthat the administration chose to include these provisions. They knew \nthat this bill would pass, because it is so important to our country. \nThey knew they could try to sneak these outrageous provisions in. This \nis not the way to increase the security of our country following the \nhorrendous attacks of September 11.\n  There are several provisions I am particularly pleased will be \nenacted into law. These provisions deal primarily with the aviation \nindustry in the aftermath of September 11.\n  I am pleased that a provision to allow the Transportation Security \nAdministration flexibility to extend the baggage claim deadline for \nairports was included in the legislation. This is extremely important \nto Las Vegas McCurran and Reno/Tahoe International Airports in Nevada. \nLas Vegas is the second leading airport in the nation for origination \nand destination passengers. Only Los Angeles International airport \nhandles more. In fact, Las Vegas handles more luggage than most of the \nnation's larger airports. Allowing TSA to work with selected airports \nto implement the 100 percent baggage screening requirement over a \nreasonable time period will in the long run be the most secure course \nfor the traveling public.\n  This legislation also includes language extending the time frame and \nexpanding the scope of War Risk Insurance made available to commercial \nairlines under the FAA's War Risk Insurance program. This was a top \npriority for the airline industry, described by leading industry \nofficials as the single most important and cost effective action \nCongress could take at a time when commercial airlines are facing \nenormous financial challenges. The provision in the bill should help \nstabilize the insurance crisis resulting from the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11th. The War Risk Insurance provision of the bill mandates \nextension of coverage through August 31st, with an option to extend War \nRisk coverage through December 31, 2003. It also calls for expansion of \nthe scope of War Risk Insurance made available to airlines, adding \ncoverage for passengers and crew and loss of aircraft to the coverage \nfor third party liability currently made available by the FAA.\n  Finally, the bill reinstates a short term limitation of third party \nliability in cases of terrorist acts involving commercial aircraft. \nLast year's airline stabilization bill capped third party liability at \n$100 million where the Secretary of Transportation certifies that an \nair carrier was a victim of an act of terrorism. This short term \nlimitation of liability expired in March, however, and has now been \nreinstated through the end of 2003.\n  Today I am supporting the creation of the Department of Homeland \nsecurity. Establishing a new department is an important way to ensure \nwe have a coordinated Federal response to potential terrorist attacks.\n  This legislation may have flaws, but the principle is correct. So \ntoday I am choosing to support the legislation, but I will keep a close \neye on its implementation. If there are changes that need to be made, I \nwill work hard to fix the flaws.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, in the months following September 11, \na new reality took hold in every corner of our country. We saw the \nNational Guard standing guard at our airports and in front of \nGovernment buildings. Bioterrorism and border security were discussed \nevery day. The skies over New York and Washington, DC were patrolled by \nour military. And every American believed that these new measures made \nour Nation stronger and protected us against terrorist attacks.\n  But time has passed and that vigilance has faded. Not by our police \nofficers, firefighters, or emergency response personnel. Not by the \nbrave men and women who are serving in Afghanistan. Not by the workers \nalong our borders and in our ports. But by the Federal Government. We \nhave slipped into an almost piecemeal approach to Homeland Security and \nthat has to change, starting today.\n  ``Are we safer today than we were on the morning of September 11, \n2001?'' The answer is only marginally, because somewhere along the \nline, we lost our way.\n  Those individuals who are sacrificing and working to do their best \nand secure our country want to do more. But each day, despite some of \nour efforts, we do less and less for them. We issue warnings about new \nthreats. We expect people and cities and towns to react accordingly, \nbut we do not provide enough funding, support, or guidance for them to \ndo their jobs. We need to redefine our focus on Homeland Security, and \none way to do that is to reorganize the way our Government works.\n  The votes we cast today for the creation of a new Homeland Security \nDepartment are just that-votes for the creation of a department. Our \nNation and particularly the people I represent in New York, learned the \nhard way on September 11, 2001--the status quo is unacceptable.\n  My hope is that approval of this bill sets in motion a necessary \nreorganization process that will ultimately result in improved \ncoordination, information sharing, and a stronger and safer America. We \nneed to send a clear message that our Government is doing more than \nsimply talking about strengthening our homeland security; that we are \nonce again focused on concrete steps that will defeat the terrorists \nand protect our people.\n  But we must be clear about what we are voting on today--this bill has \nmuch\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nto do with structural reorganization and very little to do with \nenacting real steps that will protect our Nation against terrorist \nattacks. There are many things in this bill that should not be; and \nthere are many things that should be in this bill that are not.\n  I am concerned that the American people will think that simply \nbecause we have passed this bill that our Nation is safer. They need to \nknow that this measure does not increase patrols along our northern \nborders.\n  It does not give our firefighters, police officers, and emergency \npersonnel the resources, training, and equipment they need to protect \nour frontlines at home. It does not increase security measures at our \nports, along our railroads, and public transportation systems. It does \nnot increase our capabilities of detecting biological, chemical, and \nnuclear weapons. What this bill does is it falls short on many counts, \nespecially when it comes to real measures that would improve our \nsecurity.\n  We had the opportunity to do this right. We had the opportunity to do \nmore than create a department, but we missed it. The Senate's original \nbill included critical measures that would make our country safer today \nthan it was yesterday. But in the end, this Congress failed to put \nsafety first and special interests last.\n  There is a lot in this bill that secures the future for the special \ninterests and very little that secures our country. Those who are using \nthis legislation--this legislation that's about the security of our \nNation--as a vehicle for the special interests have done this country a \ngreat disservice.\n  That is why Congress must not, cannot, stop here. Our job is far from \nover. We must continue to fight to make sure that every substantive \npart of the old bill that increased our security gets passed in the \nnext Congress.\n  Let's start with the obvious-supporting our first responders. They \nare a critical part of our Homeland Security. Our firefighters, police \nofficers, and emergency personnel need direct funding, training, and \nadditional equipment to keep our Nation safe.\n  When it comes to Homeland Security, we need to listen to the \nexperts--our mayors, police commissioners, fire chiefs, and our public \nhealth workers.\n  They continue to ask for direct funding, and that is why I proposed \nlegislation that would provide direct funding to local communities, the \nHomeland Security Block Grant Act.\n  Since we began the war on terrorism, we have done everything to \nensure that our men and women in the military have the resources, \nequipment and training they need to fight the war on terrorism, and \nthat's how it should be. But we are not doing the same at home. It is \nunconscionable to me that a Homeland Security Bill such as this one \nwould not include support for our Nation's frontline defenders.\n  At the end of October, Senators Hart and Rudman released the \nTerrorism Panel's report that clearly states that we are not doing \nenough to support our first responders and keep our country safe. They \nexpressed grave concern that 650,000 local and state police officers \nstill operate without adequate US Intelligence information to combat \nterrorists. We haven't done enough to help local and State officials \ndetect and respond to a biological attack. The report expressed concern \nthat our firefighters and local law enforcement agencies still do not \nhave the proper equipment to respond to a chemical and biological \nattack. Their radios are outdated and do not allow them to communicate \nin an emergency.\n  What kind of tribute is this to the heroes who lost their lives in \nlast September? What would the firefighters, police officers, and \nemergency response workers who did not think twice about rushing to \nGround Zero to save lives say about the lack of progress that's been \nmade?\n  Additionally, the SAFER Act, a provision that allows our country to \nhire 25,000 firefighters over the next couple of years has been \neliminated from this bill. This is the time for us to do more for our \nfirst responders, not less. They are the most important link in our \nHomeland defense, and to shortchange them in these difficult times is \nincredibly shortsighted.\n  We must also act to better secure our Nation's nuclear power \ninfrastructure. While the Homeland Security Bill will create a new \ndepartment, it does not adequately address the very real threat of \nterrorists' capabilities and desire to destroy our nuclear power \nplants. Our efforts to protect our infrastructure is moving much too \nslow. Last year, Senators Jeffords, Reid, and I introduced the Nuclear \nSecurity Act. This summer, we succeeded in moving the Act through \nCommittee.\n  It is a shame that the Homeland Security Bill does not address \nnuclear security and it should. These protections should be included in \nthis discussion, and the new Congress must work together to pass the \nNuclear Security Act promptly.\n  We must also better protect ourselves against the very real threat of \nterrorists detonating a dirty bomb in our country. It is imperative \nthat we better secure our domestic radioactive materials. Every year, \nhighly active sources used in industrial, medical and research \napplications are lost or stolen in America. This is why I introduced \nthe Dirty Bomb Act to strengthen these security measures and enhance \nour security.\n  And, while we work in the Congress to pass security measures like \nthese, we will have to also work to get rid of provisions that do not \nbelong here.\n  As I described on the Senate floor and in a press conference last \nweek, this bill includes unrelated vaccine liability provisions. \nProtecting manufacturers from liability can be appropriate as part of a \ncomprehensive vaccine bill that addresses a balanced range of important \ngoals, including strengthening vaccine supply and addressing families' \ninterest in compensation. But plucking out industry liability \nprotections and addressing only that side of the issue clearly \nprioritizes manufacturers over families, and puts politics ahead of \nhomeland security.\n  The provisions protect one particular manufacturer by dismissing \nexisting lawsuits brought by parents of autistic children who believe \nthere may be some connection between the mercury-based preservative and \ntheir child's illness. There may or may not be a connection, and the \ntort system may or may not be the right solution.\n  However, enacting only provisions that help manufacturers, while \nignoring families concerns for compensation, and children's needs for a \nstrong vaccine supply not only fail to protect homeland security, they \nfail to adequately protect children from preventable disease. All they \ndo is protect vaccine manufacturers against lawsuits and undermine our \nbipartisan efforts to assure that every child is vaccinated safely.\n  While I believe the Congress should debate issues of tort reform and \nreasonable arguments have been made, I am also concerned that some of \nthe tort provisions included in this legislation have nothing to do \nwith homeland security and have not been debated by the Senate. One \nprovision is the ``Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective \nTechnologies Act of 2002,'' ironically named the ``SAFETY Act.''\n  This measure lowers standards by giving manufacturers immunity from \nliability for the products they make that our first responders will \nuse. How will this help America build a stronger homeland defense? It \ndoesn't--it just makes it easier for manufacturers to get away with \nindefensible actions.\n  There is a provision in this bill that upsets the balance between the \npublic's right to know and the Government's responsibility to protect \ncertain information so that it can better secure our country.\n  The House-passed bill contains significant loopholes that would \nprovide protections for certain information by limiting access, \nprohibiting its use in court, and even making it a crime to make such \ninformation available. It appears that the bill may even allow \ncompanies to decide for themselves what information should be afforded \nsuch protections. This means certain protections could potentially be \nextended to information that doesn't even have anything to do with \nsecurity, thereby shielding potentially damaging information from the \npublic and the courts.\n  While private entities should be encouraged to provide critical \ninfrastructure information to the Government in order to help assess \nand address vulnerabilities to future terrorist attacks, it should not \ncome at the expense of the public's right to know.\n  I am also troubled by the so-called compromise over the civil service \nand\n\n[[Page S11443]]\n\nlabor provisions in the new bill. The bill gives the President the \nauthority to waive civil service protections in six key areas including \nrules for labor-management relations and appeals to the Merit Systems \nProtection Board.\n  I am concerned that this will hinder the ability of the new \ndepartment to recruit and retain civil service employees who have \nexpertise in the agencies that will be shifted to the new Department. \nThis shortchanges the workers and shortchanges all Americans who \nbelieve we should have the most qualified individuals working in this \nnew department.\n  The bill will also allow the Administration to strip workers of their \ncollective bargaining rights through a waiver authority. I must say \nthat we have every reason to believe that this Administration will take \nadvantage of this authority. It has already taken away these rights \nfrom secretaries at the U.S. Attorney's offices. And I fully expect \nthat it will use this authority, if it is granted, to strip away the \nrights from the more than 50,000 workers who will make up the newly \nformed Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  As a Senator from New York, I have a particular interest in this new \ndepartment and have some specific concerns on behalf of my State. When \nit comes to protecting New York and New York City, I do not believe \nthat this bill goes far enough and I will work to fix these provisions \nso that they do. The bill ensures a special coordinator of homeland \nsecurity in the Capitol Region, DC, Maryland and Virginia, but does not \nestablish a similar coordinator for New York City's metropolitan \nregion.\n  Intelligence reports indicate that like Washington, DC, New York City \nis a high-risk area, still a target for terrorists and a symbol of our \nNation. Even as we recover, we are still vulnerable, and the New York \nregion needs its own coordinator.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, FEMA was able to respond to an \nunprecedented kind of disaster, precisely because it was a highly \nfunctioning, well-run agency. All of us in New York are indebted to \nDirector Allbaugh and his staff for their good work. I am concerned \nthat transferring FEMA into the new department could force a highly \ncompetent independent agency into a new bureaucracy that will have \nchallenging integration issues and thus diminish the effectiveness of \nFEMA's ability to respond to crises of all kinds.\n  I also oppose moving Plum Island from the Department of Agriculture \ninto the new Department. Also, I fear that this move could be a \nprecursor to raising the biosafety level at the Plum Island facility. \nThis would allow research on life-threatening exotic animal diseases \nand these harmful materials could be transmitted through the air. This \nwould pose too many risks to those in my State who live near the \nfacility, and I will strongly oppose any efforts to raise the biosafety \nlevel at Plum Island.\n  As I have said throughout the last fourteen months, we need this new \ndepartment to better coordinate and share information. There is no \nquestion we must change the way things work in Washington so that we \nadapt to the post 9/11 world. There are many problems with this bill, \nsome of which I have outlined here. These problems will need to be \naddressed in the months and years ahead.\n  Today, the Senate will also vote on a continuing resolution to fund \nthe Government at last year's funding levels from now through January \n11th. While it is imperative we keep the Government running, it is \nshameful, not to mention ironic, that we will depart without ensuring \nthat we fund homeland security. It is not enough to create a new \nDepartment without investing in the necessary funding to protect \nagainst bioterrorism, increase our port inspections, secure our \nNation's nuclear weapons plants, invest in technology so that our first \nresponders can communicate in a disaster.\n  At best, we are sending mixed messages to the American people about \nour priorities; even more troubling is that these actions reflect what \nactually are the Government's present priorities.\n  But at the end of the day, we must move forward with this bill. \nHopefully, it will spur us to focus once again with the same commitment \nand vigilance we had in those weeks and months after that tragic day in \nSeptember. The threats continue to come in. Attacks occurred in Bali, \nYemen, and in Kuwait. A new tape reveals that Osama Bin Laden is most \nlikely alive. And al-Qaida is plotting all the while.\n  We do not have the time or the luxury to remain in this status quo. \nThis bill is the smallest step forward we can take, but it is a step \nforward nonetheless and that is why I support it.\n  On its own, it will not make us safer but it pulls us out of this \npiecemeal approach to Homeland Security and directs our Government to \npursue one fundamental goal--to make sure that we do everything in our \npower to make America stronger and safer so that no other American life \nis taken by the hands of a murderous few.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I am voting against the legislation \nbefore the Senate to institute a new Department of Homeland Security. \nThe President says we need a Department to prevent another September \n11, but all this legislation does is produce an elephantine \nbureaucracy. It does nothing to fund the people on the front lines, who \nreally could fight terrorism; instead funds will be spent in Washington \nby bureaucrats for bureaucrats.\n  The proposed department excludes the very entities that failed on \nSeptember 11, but includes all the ones that did not. On September 11 \nthe CIA dropped the ball on intelligence it possessed. So did the FBI. \nYet they aren't included. But the Coast Guard did not mess up on \nSeptember 11th, nor did FEMA, nor did the Agriculture Department's \nAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Service yet they are all included.\n  This is a game of musical chairs. It shuffles and reorganizes 170,000 \nemployees, at 22 different agencies, involving more than 100 bureaus or \nbranches. Yet roughly 110,000 of the personnel scheduled to be moved \nare already together. Airport, seaport, rail security, and the Coast \nGuard are already part of the Transportation Department.\n  The legislation is loaded with items purporting to be helpful to our \nnational security, but which may have little effect or would even \nhinder security. It rolls back the deadline for all airports to check \nevery passenger's luggage, not just the few dozen that may need some \nadditional time. It is crazy to call for the urgency of a new Homeland \nSecurity Department, and then say to our highest profile targets, \n``take your time.''\n  It lets pilots carry guns in cockpits, but doesn't require \nimpenetrable cockpit doors, which the Senate agreed was critically \nneeded. What more proof do we need then on Sunday, when the locked door \non an El Al airplane helped prevent the hijacker from flying into \nskyscrapers in Tel Aviv?\n  The bill is full of payoffs and surprises the House leadership \nincluded at midnight, right before they left town. Suddenly, we are \nhelping Eli Lilly--why? Suddenly, we are helping American companies \nthat went to Bermuda to avoid taxes. Suddenly, we are absolving private \naviation screening companies from liabilities related to their \nSeptember 11 failures. What does any of that have to do with homeland \nsecurity?\n  This legislation is supposed to create an independent commission to \ndetermine what went wrong on September 11. Incredibly, the very \nprovisions Congress inserted to establish this Commission, freeing the \ninvestigation from political hand wringing in the Select Committee on \nIntelligence, were dropped by House leaders after the elections. The \nso-called independent commission is now anything but independent.\n  And in nearly 500 pages, the legislation fails to contain a very \nimportant item that would be immediately helpful. No where is the \nNational Security Council re-organized. September 11 was an \nintelligence failure. It was not due to lack of information. As soon as \nthe terrorists struck we knew who they were. Immediately, we rounded up \nsuspects here and moved into Afghanistan. Instead, the problem was a \nfailure on the part of the National Security Council to coordinate, \nanalyze, and deliver the intelligence to the President.\n  The President should be able to get well-analyzed reports of domestic \nthreats on a timely basis. But how can he when his own National \nSecurity Council does not even include the Attorney General or the \nDirector of the FBI? If Congress wants to re-organize, we should re-\norganize the Council to\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\ninclude law enforcement and to make certain intelligence is shared with \nCustoms, INS, the Coast Guard, and the others who need to know. Equally \nimportant, intelligence should be shared with and received from state \nand local officials, but it's not here in this bill.\n  Right to the point: this Senator has not waited for a behemoth bill \nto take action on homeland security. In the Commerce Committee, we \nmoved several concrete measures to improve our transportation security, \ninsofar as air and sea ports, and trains and buses that criss-cross the \ncountry.\n  When Americans fly this holiday, they will see huge improvements in \nthe way security is provided. Congress just passed our legislation to \nclose the gaps that exist at ports along America's coasts, for the \nfirst time creating a national system for securing our maritime \nborders.\n  Is there more this Senator wants this Congress to do for those on the \nfront-lines of homeland security? Absolutely. We should provide for the \nsecurity of Amtrak's 23 million passengers. We should improve security \non buses and freight rail. We should finish the job at our airports and \nat our seaports. We should prepare our hospitals and other first \nresponders to react to an act of bioterrorism.\n  But how can we when we are going to throw billions to shuffle \nbureaucrats from one side of Washington to the other. Designing a new \nlogo is not going to help secure our homeland. Nor is renting office \nspace, or buying more desks, and everything else like that. We will be \npaying more for nonsense redecorating than arming those on the front \nlines.\n  We have our priorities messed up. A new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is unnecessary. And the worse case is for the Department to be \nset up and our country lulled into thinking we are all safe and secure. \nA September 11 could still easily happen again.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I regret that I am unable to support \nthe Department of Homeland Security bill. While this reorganization may \nmake sense, it should not have come at the expense of unnecessarily \nundermining our privacy rights or weakening protections against \nunwarranted government intrusion into the lives of ordinary Americans.\n  We need to be better able to review and identify critical \ninformation, take more rapid steps to address terrorist threats and, \nwhen necessary, share information quickly with local law enforcement. I \nhad hoped that the proposed creation of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity would have focused on those priorities.\n  Protecting the American people is the number one responsibility of \nour government. As a result of the tragic events of September 11, we \nall recognized that a major review of our government was needed. As we \nhave debated the need for, and the details of, the new Department of \nHomeland Security, I have been guided by two principles: Will this \nreorganization make all of us safer? And will it preserve our liberties \nas Americans? Unfortunately, while there is much that is good in this \nbill, there are a number of critical areas where the bill simply goes \ntoo far, or falls short.\n  After careful review, I must conclude that this bill is not well \nthought out. The American people would benefit from the Congress paying \ncloser attention to the details of this new version of the bill. This \nproposal threatens to erode the fundamental civil liberties and privacy \nof all Americans. It does not ensure that the new Department will be \nable to effectively communicate and share information with agencies \nlike the FBI. It is weighed down with special interest provisions that \nhave nothing to do with the creation of the new department. It does not \ngive our first responders all of the tools and information necessary to \nprotect our communities. It lacks adequate civil rights oversight, and \nit needlessly undermines the employment rights of the dedicated workers \nin this new Department who will be protecting all Americans. At times, \nthe proposal reads like a dusted off copy of an earlier administration \nwish list, much of which has nothing to do with our fight against \nterrorism.\n  We need not unnecessarily sacrifice treasured civil liberties and \nprivacy in order to be secure. I fear that the bill we are voting on \ntoday will authorize the federal government to maintain extensive files \non each and every American without limitations. The data mining \nprovisions in the bill encourage retired Rear Admiral John Poindexter's \nmassive government effort to create a computer file on the private life \nof every American. The Total Information Awareness system now under \ndevelopment needs active congressional oversight, particularly in these \nearly days of the program. Rather than giving further authorization to \nthis kind of effort in this bill, we should be demanding that the \nadministration immediately suspend the Total Information Awareness \ninitiative until Congress has conducted a thorough review and refrain \nfrom implementing this program in the new Department.\n  In addition, the present proposal, in a section about cyber-security, \nactually creates a sense of insecurity for all of us. The Federal \nGovernment would have the right to obtain the contents of our private \ncomputers without adequate judicial oversight. This bill weakens \nimportant safeguards on government access to our e-mails and \ninformation about what we do on the Internet without the need for a \ncourt order. The Department should be focused on protecting us from our \nenemies, not on snooping on innocent activity.\n  While the bill does make some progress toward enhancing communication \namong many agencies that are charged with protecting Americans, it \nfalls short in ensuring that the essential work of agencies like the \nFBI will be adequately shared with and utilized by the new department. \nOverall, the proposal fails to enable the new department to be a full \nparticipant in the intelligence community.\n  While our public safety must be our highest priority, we should not \nturn a blind eye to the bottom line. And we should not aggravate our \nbudget problems by adding expensive special interest provisions that \nhave nothing to do with this new department.\n  Special interest provisions in the bill would cap liability for drug \ncompanies for vaccine additives, give the Secretary of the new \ndepartment broad authority to designate certain technologies as so-\ncalled ``qualified anti-terrorism technologies,'' thus entitling the \nseller of that technology to broad liability protection no matter how \nnegligent the seller, and apparently earmark the university-based \nhomeland security research center for Texas A\n  All of us know that local law enforcement, fire fighters, and other \nfirst responders are on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. \nThe Department of Homeland Security needs to ensure that Federal, State \nand local law enforcement agencies, fire fighters, and other first \nresponders are able to work together to adapt and respond to the \nevolving challenges of terrorism. Unfortunately, the new department is \nnot organized in a manner that provides the maximum possible help to \nthose on our front lines. A Department of Homeland Security must ensure \nthat it provides our local first responders with the necessary \ninformation, tools, and resources that are required to adapt and \nrespond to the evolving challenges facing our First Responders.\n  I am disappointed that my bill, the First Responder Support Act, \nintroduced with the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, is not part of the \npresent proposal. It had been included in the Lieberman bill, but was \nstripped out of the bill last week without any warning by the House \nleadership. The First Responder Support Act will help first responders \nget the information and training they need from the Department of \nHomeland Security, and that measure will be a top priority for me in \nthe next Congress.\n  I am also concerned with the proposal's disdain for the public's \nright to open government. The bill would undermine the protections of \nthe Freedom of Information Act and exempt the proposed department's \nadvisory committees from the open meetings requirements of the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act. Current law already provides adequate \nprotection for sensitive information. The broad language of this bill \nis far too sweeping.\n  Finally, I believe that while this bill includes some civil rights \noversight, it offers weaker protections than are found in other federal \nagencies. Steps should have been taken to strengthen\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\nthe Civil Rights Office in the new department by requiring that the \nhead of that office be subject to confirmation by the Senate and \ntherefore accountable to the Congress and the American people. The bill \nshould have designated an official in the office of the Inspector \nGeneral to fully investigate allegations of civil rights violations. \nThis bill also should have included stronger protections for the \nAmericans who will be working in this new Department and protecting our \nNation. Congress owes these Americans the same employment rights that \nother public servants enjoy.\n  We must not forget that we are having this debate because of what \nhappened on September 11. We need to learn from September 11 and ensure \nthat we do not fall victim to a similar tragedy in the future. I \nbelieve that we could have given the American people a Department of \nHomeland Security that would ensure their safety and security, and \nprotect their civil liberties. Unfortunately, this bill has too many \nprovisions that unnecessarily jeopardize our basic freedoms, and I \ncannot support it.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise tonight to strongly support the \ncreation of a Department of Homeland Security. By consolidating the \nagencies responsible for protecting our borders and infrastructure, we \ncan make significant progress in ensuring the security of the American \npeople, and this body would be remiss if we were to fail in passing \nthis critical legislation before we adjourn.\n  Just this week we've learned that Osama bin Laden is still alive and \nstill posing a threat to American interests at home and abroad. Recent \nactivity and communications by his al-Qaida terrorist network, which we \nhave seen reported in the media, suggest that the threat is as serious \ntoday as it was 14 months ago. These are glaring reminders that the War \non Terrorism is far from finished and that we must be vigilant both at \nhome and abroad to protect and defend this Nation.\n  I also want to reassure all Arkansans that the creation of this \nDepartment is not the only step in the protection of this Nation. \nHomeland security must be an ongoing process as we respond to new \nthreats and the inevitable needs to correct deficiencies in this \nlegislation--including modifications to this department over time. I \nintend to continue to seek any and all ways that we can increase the \nsecurity of our homeland.\n  As I said in remarks on the Senate floor last week, I would like to \nstate for the record my disappointment with some provisions that were \nadded by the House of Representatives in the final hours without any \nopportunity for debate.\n  Three provisions in particular give me pause: waivers that the \nadministration will be able to use to grant Federal contracts to \ncompanies that reincorporate offshore to avoid paying U.S. taxes; \nprovisions that would broaden limits on lawsuits against vaccine makers \nto manufacturers of other vaccine components, covering still-pending \nlitigation; and highly specific criteria that would be used to \ndesignate universities as part of a homeland security research system. \nA few of other provisions added by the House have merit, but they \ndeserve an open debate. For example, I believe that we need to limit \nthe liability of companies that make ``qualified anti-terrorism \ntechnology'' against claims arising from acts of terrorism, but this \nissue deserves more debate. We also ought to limit lawsuits against \ncompanies that manufacture aviation security equipment. It's \nunfortunate that these provisions, which may be perfectly worthy \nlegislative remedies, have been slipped in to the bill without full \nconsideration by Congress. I certainly hope each of these provisions \nwill be revisited and fully debated next year.\n  Again, I'm deeply disappointed by some special interest provisions \nthat were added to the homeland security bill. However, I believe that \nthe necessary creation of a Department of Homeland Security outweighs \nthe special interest provisions added to this legislation and I am \nproud to aid in its creation. I'm casting my vote in order to serve the \nhigher good of protecting the American people from present and future \nterrorist threats.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am a strong supporter of creating a new \ndepartment for homeland security, and I was glad to be able to \ncosponsor the bipartisan legislation that passed out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in July of this year. But this \nlegislation, now, falls so short of the promise of that committee-\npassed bill, that I am compelled to vote no. The legislation the Senate \nwill pass tonight has numerous unrelated and inappropriate special \ninterest provisions, omits numerous related and appropriate homeland \nsecurity provisions, and fails to address probably the most central \nquestion to our security the coordination and sharing of information \nbetween the CIA and the FBI.\n  The homeland security bill that we are debating today is a dramatic \ndeparture from the bipartisan legislation that passed out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  The new bill now has numerous provisions that no one had seen until \nthe Thompson amendment was presented to the Senate late last week, and \ntoo many of the provisions have less to do with homeland security and \nmore to do with the access of special interests.\n  One of these provisions provides liability protection for \npharmaceutical companies that make a mercury-based vaccine preservative \nthat may cause autism in children.\n  Another provision guts the Wellstone amendment, which would prohibit \nFederal agencies from contracting with corporations that have moved \noffshore to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes--taxes that are \nused for important security agencies such as the FBI, Coast Guard, \nCustoms Service, the INS, and the Border Patrol.\n  Another provision provides an earmark to Texas A University for \nresearch.\n  At the same time the Thompson amendment added weakening and special \ninterest provisions like these, it deleted important provisions that \nwould enhance our homeland security--including a grant program for \nadditional firefighters, a program to improve the security and safety \nfor the Nation's railroads, and a program to improve information flow \namongst key Federal and State agencies with responsibility for homeland \nsecurity. The bill completely removes key areas that we had come to \nbipartisan agreement on at the committee level such as important \nlanguage relative to foreign intelligence analysis and the Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA.\n  Finally, it hands the President a blank check with regard to so-\ncalled reforms of the civil service.\n  The over-reaching by the Republicans to include special interest \nprovisions and to exclude strong bipartisan provisions is nothing less \nthan shocking. The exclusion of strong bipartisan provisions addressing \nkey issues with respect to homeland security is nothing less than \ndangerous to our security.\n  Let's back up and look how we got to where we are today. Senator \nLieberman initiated legislation to create a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity last year shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks. We \nhad hearings on the proposal and the first committee markup, and at \nthat time, President Bush opposed the creation of a new Department. As \na result, the vote to report the bill we reported from Governmental \nAffairs was along party lines, with all of the Democrats, including \nmyself, voting for it and the Republicans voting against it.\n\n  In the spring, President Bush changed his mind and put forth his own \nproposal for a new department. We in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nthen worked on a compromise committee amendment, merging most of what \nthe President wanted with the committee-passed bill. We reported that \nto the floor at the end of July. A great deal of time went into \ncrafting that bill. Chairman Lieberman held 18 hearings on various \nissues dealing with homeland security. We had a two day mark-up; we \nconsidered dozens of amendments; and we passed the bill out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee by a 12-5 vote. We ultimately came up \nwith what I believe was a good bill.\n  However, the bill before us today takes some major step backwards.\n  For one, this bill muddles the issue of responsibility for foreign \nintelligence analysis at precisely the time we should be clarifying it. \nThe intelligence issues we face are some of the most important issues \nin this reorganization. Many of us on the Intelligence Committee have \nbeen taking a\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\nhard look at possible intelligence failures before 9/11. Whether or not \nthese failures, if they hadn't occurred, could have avoided 9/11 could \nbe the subject of endless speculation, and that is not the point. The \npoint is, we need to do a better job of coordinating our intelligence. \nWe need to give those who do coordinate our intelligence the resources \nthat they need, and we need to better define their roles and \nresponsibilities. The Governmental Affairs Committee passed bill \ncontains language I offered with respect to the new Department's role \nin gathering and analyzing intelligence on possible terrorist attacks \nin the United States. My language clarified the intelligence gathering \nfunctions and assigned responsibility. The language in the Thompson \namendment leaves the intelligence community without clearly defined \nroles and creates the possibility for unnecessary and costly \nduplication of efforts. We cannot afford that kind of situation post 9/\n11.\n  Let me explain. Right now we have an office at the CIA called the \nCounter Terrorist Center or CTC, where all information, regardless of \nsource, about international terrorism is sent and analyzed. Whether it \nis obtained overseas or in the U.S., the CTC is the central place for \ncounter terrorism intelligence.\n  The CTC, which has 250 analysts, receives 10,000 incoming \nintelligence reports a month about international terrorism from the \nState Department, Customs, local law enforcement, FBI, INS, and a range \nof other sources. Representatives from the FBI, Department of Defense, \nDepartment of State, Department of Justice and other agencies that are \ninvolved in collecting and receiving information about international \nterrorism, work at the CTC with CIA analysts. One of the questions we \nfaced in the Governmental Affairs Committee was how the \nresponsibilities of the new Department in terms of intelligence \ngathering and analysis related to the ongoing role of the CTC.\n  My language in the Governmental Affairs passed bill kept the \nprincipal responsibility for analyzing information about international \nterrorism at the CTC. Under my language, the CTC would receive all \nforeign intelligence, regardless of source, and would be primarily \nresponsible for its analysis. As defined by the National Security Act, \n50 U.S.C. 401(a), ``foreign intelligence'' is ``information relating to \nthe capabilities, intentions or activities of foreign governments or \nelements thereof, foreign organizations, or foreign persons, or \ninternational terrorist activities.'' My language makes it clear that \nthe principal responsibility for collecting and analyzing information \nabout international terrorism would be at the CTC.\n  Under the Committee-passed bill the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity would have a directorate of intelligence that would be \nresponsible for the receipt and analysis of all information relating to \nacts of terrorism in the United States including the foreign \nintelligence analyses from the CTC, as well as information and analyses \nrelating to terrorist activities of U.S. persons or organizations. The \nnew directorate would be responsible for linking all that information \nand analyses to an assessment of vulnerabilities to acts of terrorism \non U.S. soil.\n  Under the Governmental Affairs Committee bill, the new Department \nwould, therefore, not only be responsible for the domestic terrorism \nintelligence analyses, but it would fuse foreign intelligence analyses \nwith the domestic intelligence analyses and obtain an assessment of \nvulnerabilities to terrorism existing in the U.S. In other words, the \nnew Department would, as many have used the phrase, ``connect the \ndots''--intelligence analyses, foreign and domestic, and U.S. \nvulnerabilities.\n  By maintaining the role of the CTC in international intelligence and \nadding the role of the new Department in the overall analytical \nresponsibility with respect to terrorism in the United States, we would \navoid duplication and redundancy.\n  The Thompson amendment includes language that would appear to \nduplicate the CTC at the new Department, and I cannot support that.\n  Duplicating the responsibility of analysis of foreign intelligence \nwould only waste valuable and limited resources and undermine our \nobjective of getting the best counter terrorism intelligence we can \nget. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of \nexperienced and trained analysts ``tends to be in short supply.'' We \njust don't have the resources or the people to duplicate analyses of \nforeign intelligence. It is important not to duplicate the CTC's \ncapability, but to strengthen it and keep the primary responsibility \nfor the analysis of information about international terrorism, from \nwherever obtained, in one place.\n  Another reason that I am voting against this bill is because the \nBennett-Levin-Leahy compromise with respect to the Freedom of \nInformation Act, a compromise that the administration supported at the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee mark-up, is not in this bill.\n  One of the primary functions of the new Department will be to \nsafeguard the Nation's infrastructure, much of which is run by private \ncompanies. The Department will need to work in partnership with private \ncompanies to ensure that our critical infrastructure is secure. To do \nso, the homeland security legislation asks companies to voluntarily \nprovide the new Department with information about their own \nvulnerabilities, the hope being that one company's problems or \nsolutions to its problems will help other companies with similar \nproblems.\n  Some companies expressed concern that current law did not adequately \nprotect the confidential business information that they may be asked to \nprovide to the new Department from public disclosure under the Freedom \nof Information Act. They argued that without a specific statutory \nexemption they would be less likely to voluntarily submit information \nto the new Department about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.\n  We crafted a compromise to put into statute important protections \nestablished in case law. The resulting compromise would protect from \npublic disclosure any record furnished voluntarily and submitted to the \nnew Department that:\n  First, pertains to the vulnerability of and threats to critical \ninfrastructure, such as attacks, response and recovery efforts;\n  Second, the provider would not customarily make available to the \npublic;\n  Third, are designated and certified by the provider as confidential \nand not customarily made available to the public.\n  The Bennett-Levin-Leahy compromise made clear that records that an \nagency obtains independently of the Department are not subject to the \nprotections I just enumerated. Thus, if the records currently are \nsubject to disclosure by another agency, they would remain available \nunder FOIA even if a private company submits the same information to \nthe new Department. The language also allowed the provider of \nvoluntarily submitted information to change a designation and \ncertification and to make the record subject to disclosure under FOIA. \nThe language required that the new Department develop procedures for \nthe receipt, designation, marking, certification, care and storage of \nvoluntarily provided information as well as the protection and \nmaintenance of the confidentiality of the voluntarily provided records.\n  The Bennett-Levin-Leahy compromise is not included in the Thompson \namendment. Instead, the bill cuts back on FOIA access by the public by \nexpanding the type of information that the new department can keep from \nthe public. The language in this bill could result in the issuance of \nrules by the new Department based on information not included in the \nrule making record. It could prevent the Federal Government from using \ncritical infrastructure information in a civil suit seeking to protect \npublic safety. Finally, the language in the Thompson amendment could \nresult in a criminal penalty against a whistle blower who leaks the \nkind of information presented to the new Department on critical \ninfrastructure.\n  The principles of open government and the public's right-to-know are \ncornerstones upon which our country was built. With this bill, we are \nsacrificing them in the name of protecting them. The Bennett-Levin-\nLeahy compromise would have balanced the need between openness and \nsecurity to protect these principles.\n  I will also be voting against this bill because of the civil service \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nthat President Bush is calling ``flexibility'' but that I consider an \nunnecessary blank check. There are really two issues here, one concerns \ncollective bargaining, and the other concerns the civil service in \ngeneral.\n  Under existing law, the President can issue an executive order \nexcluding any agency or subdivision of an agency from collective \nbargaining if it is involved in a matter of ``national security.'' For \nexample, in January of this year, the President issued an executive \norder which took collective bargaining rights away from hundreds of \nDepartment of Justice employees, many of them clerical workers involved \nin civil issues under the label of ``national security.''\n  But even without the national security exception, under current law, \nin an emergency, the new Department could waive collective bargaining \nrights, because under 5 U.S.C. 7106, ``nothing, in the chapter \nestablishing collective bargaining rights, shall affect the authority \nof any management official of any agency . . . to take whatever actions \nmay be necessary to carry out the agency mission during emergencies.'' \nIn addition, current law prohibits federal employees from striking \nunder any circumstances.\n  The Thompson bill would allow the President to waive collective \nbargaining rights, whether or not there is an emergency, as long as he \ngives 10 days notice and sends a written explanation to Congress. This \nprovision does not provide a standard under which the President's \nauthority is to be exercised. So in the most extreme example, under \nthis provision, the President could remove the collective bargaining \nrights of every single employee who was transferred into the new \nDepartment. That is unacceptable. What we tried to do in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee bill was to allow workers with \ncollective bargaining rights transferred into the new Department to \nmaintain those rights if their job descriptions did not change. Given \nthe President's authority to act in an emergency under current law, I \nbelieve that protected our national security without unnecessarily \ntrampling on rights of employees.\n  The Thompson amendment also allows the Secretary of the new \nDepartment to alter civil service rules. If the Secretary does so, then \nthe employee unions would have 30 days to review the changes and make \nrecommendations to the Secretary. If the Secretary doesn't agree with \nthose suggestions, he or she could declare an impasse and send the \ndispute to federal mediators. After another 30 days, the Secretary \ncould go ahead with the changes, regardless of what the mediator \nsuggests. The President argues that this process gives the unions a say \nin any changes, but the reality is that the unions have no real \nsubstantive remedy to the Secretary's proposed changes. No matter how \nmuch the employees and unions oppose the new rules, how much they fight \nagainst them, in the end, the Secretary has unilateral power to issue \nthe rules under the Thompson amendment.\n  I supported creating a Department of Homeland Security from the \nbeginning--like many of my Democratic colleagues well before the \nPresident came on board. It's disheartening that the President and the \nRepublican leadership couldn't accept the bipartisan bill reported by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee and work with that to develop a bill \nwithout the major flaws described above. It's also distressing indeed \nthat the President and the Republican leadership chose to use the \nHomeland Security Department legislation as a vehicle for unrelated \nspecial interest legislation while leaving behind a number of very \nimportant security-related provisions.\n  I would have been happy to stay here to work out the differences in \nthis legislation and develop the strongest legislation possible. But \nwith this vote, now, that is an impossibility. So, I hope in the next \nCongress to work with my colleagues who share my views on some of these \nprovisions to make some needed changes to this legislation.\n  Let me add one more thing about how far astray we have gone with this \nlegislation. While the President has been holding out on passage of \nthis legislation in order to get the authority to waive collective \nbargaining rights for employees at the new Department, the key agencies \nin the Federal Government that are at the front lines of protecting our \nhomeland have gone underfunded in this fiscal year. According to the \nHouse Appropriations Committee Staff: while we have authorized $38 \nbillion for homeland defense, we have actually appropriated only $640 \nmillion to the new Department and other agencies; while we have \nauthorized an additional 200 immigration inspectors and 200 immigration \ninvestigators, to date we have appropriated no money for these \npositions; and while we have authorized $520 million for hospital \nemergency rooms, we have only appropriated $135 million. The Republican \nleadership in the House has failed to send us the appropriations bills \nfor fiscal year 2003 that would increase funding for the Customs \nService, the Border Patrol, the Coast Guard, the FBI, the CIA--all of \nthe agencies we need to have additional resources to stave off or \nadequately respond to a terrorist attack. That is the unfortunate final \nchapter to this story. By not taking up the appropriations bills for \nnext year, we are delaying the delivery of desperately needed dollars \nto the very agencies charged with protecting us from terrorist attacks. \nThe misdirection of priorities involved is harrowing.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, today the Senate will finally pass a \nhomeland security bill. This debate began in the Senate with Senator \nLieberman's efforts in the Government Affairs Committee last Spring, \nand it ends today with the Senate left with no choice but to pass the \nHouse of Representative's version of the bill. This is an imperfect \nbill, and it has come to this point through an imperfect process. The \ndesire to create a domestic agency capable of protecting Americans from \nterrorism is bipartisan--even universal. Unfortunately, the creation of \nthe bill to do that has been partisan and destructively political.\n  Few of us have had a chance to consider this new proposal carefully. \nAnd what we have found has not been encouraging. The House version of \nthe homeland security bill includes too many special interest \nprovisions slipped in at the last minute. The Daschle-McCain amendment, \nwhich I supported, would have eliminated the most egregious of these, \nbut the Senate narrowly rejected it. It is shameful that some used this \nvital Government reorganization legislation to pay back unrelated \npolitical debts.\n  I also must go on record strongly in opposition to the bill's \nprovisions on Federal employees and their rights to organize a union \nand exercise their rights as members of a union. The President's \nauthority to manage the Federal workforce has never been an issue \nbefore now. No one claimed that if the President had more flexibility \nover the Federal workforce that the September 11 attacks would have \nbeen avoided or that new work rules would have made it easier for the \nCIA and FBI to exchange information. Again, these unprecedented \nrestrictions on workers' rights were inserted in must-pass legislation. \nAgain, it is shameful that this vehicle was used to pursue a political \nagenda.\n  The House bill, however, at its core does take some needed steps to \nmake us all safer. The United States must better focus its counter-\nterrorism efforts if we are to avoid future attacks. Too many agencies \nand organizations inside the Government share responsibility for \nresponding to terrorism domestically. The old saying has been quoted on \nthe floor many times during this debate, but is worth doing it one more \ntime: ``When every one is in charge--no one is in charge.'' By making \none Cabinet level agency in charge of Homeland Security we will have \nonly one person in charge. The bureaucracy underneath the Secretary \nwill have only one unifying priority. The advantages of that change \ncannot be overestimated.\n  However difficult the crafting of the homeland security legislation \nhas been, it was the easy part. Now we face the difficult and \nmonumental task of actually putting the parts together into a whole \ngreater than its sum. The offices that make up the Department of \nHomeland Security cannot forget the other important missions they \nperform. Organizations like the Coast Guard and the Animal and Plant \nHealth Inspection Service have valuable missions outside of their \nhomeland security function that cannot be overlooked.\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\n  The Congress's work on homeland security should not stop here. As the \ntransfer of offices begins, there will no doubt be changes necessary. \nCongressional oversight is more important now than ever. With this bill \nCongress has decided that the Executive Branch needs to take homeland \nsecurity more seriously. But Congress needs to take it seriously, too. \nThat means giving up our short-term political games in order to work \ntogether--Republican and Democrat, White House and Congress--to build a \nbipartisan, functioning agency that will deliver all Americans the \nsecurity they deserve.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, since September 11, 2001, many in \nCongress have been assiduously working to create a Department of \nHomeland Security, and I am pleased that today we are finally \ncompleting our work. After the terrorist attacks on New York and \nWashington it became clear that to thwart future attacks on the United \nStates the Federal Government would have to do a better job gathering \nand coordinating intelligence. Since September 11 I, along with several \ncolleagues, have believed that a reorganization of the Federal \nGovernment is critical to improving the security of this country. \nThough the President and many Congressional Republicans initially \nopposed this major reorganization, there is now consensus on the need \nto create a new department.\n  It is imperative that we move quickly and urgently to reorganize the \nFederal Government. Vulnerabilities exist in our homeland security \ninfrastructure and we should not squander a single day addressing them. \nAn independent task force, chaired by former Senators Gary Hart and \nWarren Rudman, recently advised that ``America remains dangerously \nunprepared to prevent and respond to a catastrophic attack on U.S. \nsoil.'' There is also new evidence that Osama bin Laden is alive and \nrecently recorded an audio tape. We must act now to create this agency \nand to ensure that the United States Government is doing everything in \nits power to better protect its borders, coasts, cities, and towns.\n  The Transportation Security Agency continues to play a vital role in \nour domestic security policy under this legislation. At no time in our \nNation's history has increased security for our transportation \ninfrastructure been as critical, and I am confident that as part of \nthis new department the TSA will perform up to task and help ease the \nfears many Americans have concerning the safety of our airports, \ntrains, and ports.\n  The legislation also address the impending baggage screening \ndeadline. Although the Congress mandated a December 31, 2002 deadline \nfor screening all baggage at airports, deploying and installing the \nnecessary devices for the over 400 airports has proved to be a \nmonumental challenge and it is clear that many airports are unable to \nmeet this requirement. I am pleased that this legislation includes a \ncommon sense provision to extend the deadline for the major airports \nand strictly monitor their progress in screening baggage. The extension \nthrough December 31, 2003 will also give the TSA more time to properly \ntrain and deploy the 22,000 federal baggage screeners necessary to \nstaff the devices and oversee the screening process. Rushing this \nprocess in anticipation of the deadline would have seriously \ncompromised the effectiveness of the enhanced security measures.\n  Also included in this legislation is a provision that will allow \nfinancially strapped airlines to purchase ``war risk'' insurance from \nthe Government at a reasonable cost, alleviating some of the costs the \nindustry has incurred after September 11. This provision is critically \nimportant, as many airlines have been forced to spend upwards of $100 \nmillion to insure their planes against war and the continued threat of \nterrorism. Tens of thousands of aviation workers have lost their jobs \nbecause of the financial crisis in the industry. It is my hope that \nGovernment issued insurance will help expedite the recovery of this \nimportant sector of our economy.\n  As Chairman of the Oceans, Atmosphere and Fisheries Subcommittee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, I want to make a few \ncomments about the Coast Guard provisions in the legislation. The Coast \nGuard is comprised of approximately 36,000 military personnel, roughly \nthe size of the New York City Police Department. Recently passed \nlegislation will expand the Coast Guard to 45,500 military personnel by \nthe end of this fiscal year. Expansion is important to homeland \nsecurity when you consider that the Coast Guard must patrol and protect \nmore than 1,000 harbor channels, and 25,000 miles of inland, intra \ncoastal, and coastal waterways that serve more than 300 ports. The \nCoast Guard is also responsible for a number of non-homeland security \nmissions such as search and rescue, maintaining aids to navigation, \nmarine safety, marine environmental protection and fisheries law \nenforcement.\n  I am pleased that this legislation does not split up the Coast Guard. \nThe Coast Guard is a multi-mission agency with personnel and assets \nthat are capable of performing a variety of missions with little or no \nnotice. The legislation preserves this flexibility by keeping the Coast \nGuard in tact. In addition the bill ensures that the Coast Guard \nreceives the proper attention it deserves in the new Department by \nrequiring the commandant of the Coast Guard to report directly to the \nnew Secretary. The commandant has this authority within the Department \nof Transportation, clearly he should have the same authority in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Since September 11, the Coast Guard has had to divert resources from \nits non-homeland security missions in order to beef up homeland \nsecurity. I asked the General Accounting Office to document the change \nin Coast Guard missions since September 11 and to make recommendations \non how best for the Coast Guard to operate under the ``new normalcy'' \npost September 11. The GAO just released its report and they note that \nmany of the Coast Guard's core missions, including enforcement of \nfisheries and other environmental laws, are still not back to pre-\nSeptember 11 levels. The GAO recommends that the Coast Guard develop a \nlong-range strategic plan for achieving all of their missions, as well \nas a means to easily monitor progress in achieving these goals.\n  Many of us are concerned, that the traditional non-homeland security \nmissions of the Coast Guard will suffer once the agency is transferred. \nIn response to these concerns this bill contains safeguards that will \nensure that non-homeland security missions will get done. I look \nforward to working with the Coast Guard to ensure these missions are \ngetting done. Search and rescue, oil spill response and fisheries law \nenforcement are important and we cannot afford to ignore or under fund \nthese missions.\n  This bill also includes a study on accelerating the Integrated \nDeepwater System, a long overdue modernization of Coast Guard ships and \naircraft that operate off-shore in the deepwater environment. The Coast \nGuard is operating World War II-era cutters in the deepwater \nenvironment to perform environmental protection, national defense, and \nlaw enforcement missions. Coast Guard aircraft, which are operated in a \nmaintenance intensive salt water environment, are reaching the end of \ntheir useful lives as well. Besides high operating costs, these assets \nare technologically and operationally obsolete. The Integrated \nDeepwater System will not only reduce operational and maintenance \ncosts, but will significantly improve upon current command and control \ncapabilities in the deepwater environment. I support this study. I look \nforward to reviewing the results of this study next year and if \nacceleration makes sense, supporting that well.\n\n  While I support much of what this legislation does and while I \nbelieve we should quickly move forward to create the Department, I have \nserious concerns with particular provisions of the bill. First, I am \nextremely disappointed that this legislation provides the \nadministration with the authority to rewrite civil service laws without \nguaranteeing that Federal workers will receive fair treatment without \nregard to political affiliation, equal pay for equal work, and \nprotection for whistleblowers. The hallmark of civil service is \nprotection from political influence through laws designed to ensure the \nindependent hiring, promotion, and firing of employees based \nexclusively on merit. And by allowing the administration to rewrite the \ncivil service laws\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\nwithout guaranteeing these protections and without meaningful labor \nunion participation, we are putting these important protections at \nrisk.\n  I am also troubled by a provision in this legislation that gives the \nPresident essentially unfettered discretion to forbid Department of \nHomeland Security employees to belong to unions if he determines that \nis necessary not only for the interest of national security but also to \nprotect the Department's ability to protect homeland security. I do not \nobject to working to reform how government operates, to make it easier \nto manage and more effective. But what has been proposed in this \nlegislation is not an improvement in the system, it just takes rights \naway from workers.\n  One of the most troubling provisions in this legislation deals with \nprotecting critical infrastructure information that is voluntarily \nsubmitted to the Department, a worthy goal and one that I strongly \nsupport. After all, companies will be unwilling to turn over \ninformation about possible vulnerabilities if doing so would make them \nsubject to public disclosure or regulatory actions. To encourage \ncompanies to provide this valuable information to the Department, the \nlegislation would exempt the information from public disclosure under \nthe Freedom of Information Act. The reason for my concern, is that the \ndefinition of information is so broad that it could include any \ninformation that a company turns over to Department of Homeland \nSecurity. What this means is that information that is currently \navailable to the public would be barred from release if it is labeled \nby the company as critical infrastructure. One can easily imagine a \ncompany turning over incriminating documents to the Government so that \nit would not be accessible by anyone else. I am discouraged by \ninclusion of this provision, because earlier in this debate we \ndeveloped a compromise that more narrowly defined what information \ncould be exempt from FOIA, one that protected critical infrastructure \ninformation without opening up a loophole for companies to avoid \nGovernment regulation and public disclosure.\n  I am concerned by how the Immigration and Naturalization Service will \nbe treated in the new Department under this legislation. For years the \nINS has been badly in need of reform and it seemed that creating the \nDepartment of Homeland Security would provide an opportunity to make \nimprovements in enforcement and provide better visa and processing \nservices. Under the Lieberman proposal to create the Department of \nHomeland Security, there was an Under Secretary for Immigration Affairs \nwho would act as a central authority to ensure a uniform immigration \npolicy and provide effective coordination between the service and \nenforcement functions. The Republican legislation unfortunately does \nnot include an elevated immigration function headed by one under \nsecretary, and instead buries the immigration enforcement function \nwithin the ``Border and Transportation Security'' division and places \nthe immigration services function with the Deputy Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  There is no easy split between border enforcement and services. For \nexample, countering schemes for wrongful entry is not just a border \nchallenge, it requires close coordination among all units within \nimmigration responsibilities. Both functions rely on shared information \nand intelligence. I am afraid, that with two people interpreting \nimmigration law and policy there are likely to be conflicting \ninterpretations, a situation that could exacerbate the current \ncoordination and communications problems that exist within INS.\n  I am extremely concerned that this legislation includes liability \nprotections inserted by the House for manufacturers of anti-terrorism \ntechnology and childhood vaccines. The new provisions allow the \nSecretary to designate equipment and technology used by the Department \nas official ``anti-terrorism technology.'' In the event of a terrorist \nattack this designation will prevent injured parties from seeking \ncompensation against manufacturers of such technology, even if a \nmanufacturer exercised gross negligence in marketing its product. The \nsame is true for manufacturers of childhood vaccines who will be exempt \nfrom liability if a child dies or sustains injury as a result of \nnegligence stemming from the inclusion of a ``component or ingredient'' \nin any vaccine listed under the Vaccine Injury Table. This provision is \nabsolutely unconscionable. We should not give manufacturers an \nincentive to experiment with questionable formulas or risky ingredients \nfor vaccines which are intended to immunize children from disease. \nLikewise, we should not give manufacturers of anti-terrorism \ntechnologies any incentive to sell a product they know to be below par.\n  Another provision added by the House would remove Senate-approved \nlegislation to bar Government contracts with corporations that have \nmoved their headquarters offshore to avoid U.S. taxes. The Republicans \nsay that this provision will unnecessarily interfere with our national \nsecurity. Well, I believe that it also affects our national security \nwhen corporate use of tax havens and loopholes is at an all-time high. \nVarious estimates show that this sort of tax evasion is costing the \ngovernment tens of billions of dollars a year which means that tax \nburdens must be higher on law-abiding citizens and small businesses \nthat pay by the rules. To remove this sound provision at the last \nminute is not only bad policy, it also insults the memory of Senator \nWellstone, who worked so hard to ensure that this provision was passed.\n  Despite my concerns with particular provisions in this legislation, I \ndo support the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and \nbelieve it is an important element in our efforts to protect the \nAmerican people from terrorism.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, providing for homeland security and \nsecuring our Nation against the threat of terrorism must continue to be \nour foremost challenge. However, many of my Senate colleagues and I \nrecognize the budgetary strains caused by the mounting expenditures of \nour limited resources--and the potential future costs--of responding to \nthe multiple and varied threats of terrorism. Our State, county, and \nlocal agencies are struggling to fund the prevention and mitigation of \nevery imaginable attack on our citizens and our critical \ninfrastructure. Further, providing multi-million dollar allocations at \nthe Federal level to prevent or mitigate all perceived threats to \nhomeland security, or to respond to each terrorism incident, could in \nitself bankrupt our national economy.\n  The best management decisions at all levels of Government and \nindustry on allocating scarce resources to the war on terrorism need an \neffective analytical approach to help understand the risks and to help \nimprove the strategic and operational decisions to address those risks. \nMost current approaches to analyzing the ``terrorist threat'' are \nlimited to addressing the vulnerability of--or what will happen to--\ncritical infrastructure if it is attacked. These ``vulnerability \nanalyses'' generally produce long lists of security-related \ndeficiencies and equally long checklists of expensive things to do to \ncorrect the deficiencies, but they do not help communities \nappropriately allocate scarce resources, people, time, and money, in \nthe context of an organization's strategic-level goals and objectives. \nA more robust approach is needed to support decision-making, one that \ncan enable Government officials and private company executives to \ncharacterize the risks of rare, high-consequence events; to identify \nthose that pose the greatest threats; and to best evaluate mitigation \nalternatives.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would Senator Crapo yield a minute of his time?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Recognizing the need for better decision support, the \nleaders of Miami-Dade County established late last year a team \ncomprised of representatives from the departments of police, fire, \nemergency management, general services, computer and communications \nservices, seaport, aviation, and administration. They were tasked to \nwork in concert with a consultant and a national laboratory to develop \na process for defining, identifying, and evaluating physical and \ncyberterrorism threats and vulnerabilities; developing a consistent \nbasis for making meaningful comparisons among risks to county assets so \nthat the most important risks can be addressed first; using the \nstructure of the process to develop strategies and associated tactics \nfor mitigating threats and vulnerabilities; and\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nprioritizing mitigation activities so that the biggest gains for the \nresources spent are implemented first, resulting in the fastest \npossible reduction in risk for the limited resources available, \nincluding not only dollar resources, but the key resources of people \nand time. The initial work of the team, a pilot project, has been \nsuccessfully completed, and it has generated considerable interest both \nin Florida and in Washington.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would Senator Graham yield a minute of his time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Argonne National Laboratory, The DecisionWorks, Inc., \nIdaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and Miami-Dade \nCounty would like to build upon the results of the pilot project to \nfully develop and to implement a comprehensive, risk-based \nprioritization process that decision-makers could use to allocate \nscarce national, State, and local resources to the War on Terrorism. \nThe development of this risk-based prioritization process would be \nbased on the methodology and results of the successful pilot project, \nand the capability developed in the original pilot would be further \nenhanced by the physical security, cybersecurity, critical \ninfrastructure, homeland security, decision analysis, and systems \nengineering expertise resident in the project team.\n  Specifically, the purpose of the proposed risk-based prioritization \nprogram for Homeland Security would be to develop and deliver a process \nfor helping decision-makers in both the public and private sectors to \nassess the likelihood of a successful terrorist attack on critical \ninfrastructure and other assets; to understand the safety, economic, \nand other consequences of a successful attack; to formulate and \nevaluate alternatives for reducing or mitigating the risk of a \nsuccessful attack; and to select a portfolio of alternatives that \nprioritizes the allocation of scarce resources to meet the threat of \nterrorism. Using risk-based prioritization to manage non-traditional \nrisks like terrorism would have four important benefits. It would \nprovide an objective, defensible method for deciding how to allocate \nresources, people, time, and money, across all risks and organizational \nunits. It would align resource allocations with an organization's \nstrategic objectives and its willingness and capacity to accept risk. \nIt would provide a way to evaluate the costs and benefits associated \nwith various alternatives for mitigating risk, from physically removing \nthe source of risk to actively retaining the risk internally. It would \nimprove the quality and relevance of information available to managers \nat all levels of the organization.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Would Senator Durbin yield a minute of his time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. The original amendment that Senator Lieberman submitted to \nthe underlying bill, H.R. 5005, to establish the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, contained a section that would have established an Office of \nRisk Analysis and Assessment within the Directorate of Science and \nTechnology. Recognizing the successes of this Miami-Dade County pilot \nproject and the tremendous contribution that a comprehensive, risk-\nbased prioritization process that decision-makers could use to allocate \nscarce national, State, and local resources to the War on Terrorism, \nSenator Durbin and I offered an amendment that would have enhanced and \nstrengthened this risk assessment function. This amendment would have \nrequired the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \ncomprehensive, risk-based process for prioritizing and allocating the \nFederal, State, and local activities and resources necessary to combat \nterrorism and to provide for homeland security response. It also would \nhave authorized $15 million in appropriations for Fiscal Year 2003, and \nsuch sums as necessary in subsequent years, for the development of the \nrisk-based prioritization process. Unfortunately, the current version \nof the Homeland Security Act before the Senate does not contain our \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would Senator Crapo yield a minute of his time?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Although our amendment was not included, clearly the \nrisk-based prioritization process we have described has significantly \nbenefitted the local community in which it has been tested. Would \nSenator Thompson concur that a comprehensive, risk-based process for \nprioritizing and allocating the Federal, State, and local activities \nand resources necessary to combat terrorism and to provide for homeland \nsecurity response should be given serious attention by the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Would Senator Durbin yield a minute of his time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As ranking member on the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I appreciate your bringing this project to the committee's \nattention. I am confident that the Department of Homeland Security will \ngive it fair consideration when reviewing grant applications in the \ncoming years.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and I thank the Senator \nfor his consideration and support.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, it has long been obvious that homeland \nsecurity was the most critical issue facing our nation today. I am \npleased and proud to speak today on the compromise that this body has \nstruck to approve of this measure through landmark legislation. We are \nfinally in a position to give the President the tools he needs to fight \nthe war against terrorism with every resource that this great nation \ncan muster. Our country will be safer because of the enormous hard work \nand patriotism shared by members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The final bipartisan compromise is something that we can all be proud \nof. It incorporates a crucial compromise on labor rights. I always have \nbelieved that the President must be given the ability to hire and \nretain the very best people to do the work of keeping our country safe. \nWhile the final version of the bill gives the President sufficient \nflexibility to effectively manage the employees in the new Department \nof Homeland Security, it also provides sufficient procedures to protect \nthe rights of workers. This strikes, in my view, an appropriate \nbalance.\n  I also am pleased to note that the bill maximizes the new \nDepartment's ability to take advantage of the tremendous resources and \nexpertise of America's private sector. It is perfectly clear that \nAmerica's businesses will play a vital role in enhancing our nation's \nsecurity. Private businesses, after all, own and operate most of our \ninfrastructure, and provide most of the cutting edge technologies that \nwill support our nation's defense efforts. The bill helps the private \nsector help our nation by crafting some reasonable protections from \nfrivolous tort litigation, and such a measure will ultimately save \nlives.\n  This legislation incorporates my proposal to stiffen the criminal \npenalties for cyberterrorism and to provide law enforcement agencies \nwith new tools to use in emergency situations involving immediate \nthreats to our national security interests. The cyberterrorism section \nof the bill also provides statutory authorization for the Office of \nScience and Technology located within the National Institute of Justice \nof the Department of Justice. The bill strikes language, contained in \nearlier versions, that would have provided OST to be ``independent of \nthe National Institute of Justice.'' Accordingly, I understand subtitle \nD to place operational authority over OST--as authorized by the bill--\nin the NIJ Director in the same manner and to the same extent that the \nNIJ Director currently exercises over OST--as it currently exists--and \nthat the NIJ Director's authority over grants, cooperative agreements, \nand contracts for science and technology research and development, and \nthe publications that disseminate the results of that research and \ndevelopment remain unchanged by this bill. Furthermore, I wish to make \nclear that I do not understand the administrative language in the bill \nthat provides that certain publications decisions ``shall rest solely'' \nwith the Director of the Office to affect the bill's overarching--and \ncontrolling--provision that expressly places the new Office ``under the \ngeneral authority of the Assistant Attorney General.''\n  The bill likewise incorporates a drastic reorganization of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, abolishing the INS as it \ncurrently exists and separating the enforcement and service \nresponsibilities within the new Department. This new structure \nrecognizes\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nthe importance of both functions, allows for coordination, and confers \nappropriate funding and management to both enforcement and services. \nThis top-to-bottom reorganization of INS is something that numerous \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee have worked tirelessly with me to do \nand to do right. The Homeland Security Bill also includes a valuable \nprovision that will significantly reduce the availability of explosives \nto certain prohibited persons, including terrorists and felons. Senator \nKohl and I have worked hard on this provision, which will improve law \nenforcement's ability to track explosives purchases and help prevent \nthe criminal use and accidental misuse of explosives materials.\n  I want to conclude by taking a moment to discuss the ban on the TIPS \nprogram that was inserted in the final version of the Homeland Security \nBill. Let me make clear that none of us wants an Orwellian version of \nBig Brother watching over us at all times. I made my own concerns on \nthis issue very clear to Attorney General Ashcroft during an oversight \nhearing a few months ago, as did other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I was concerned, for example, that the Department would keep \na historical database of such information, but the Attorney General \nassured the Committee that this would not occur. Since then, I have \nbeen gratified to learn that the Attorney General has taken our \nconcerns to heart, implementing fundamental changes to the program that \nare designed to protect our privacies in a balanced manner. In fact, \nthe Department of Justice now has committed to not include within the \nTIPS program any workers, such as postal or utility workers, whose work \nputs them in contact with homes and private property.\n  I think all of us can agree that some type of voluntary reporting \nprogram that permits but does not require concerned citizens to report \ninformation is appropriate. This is, of course, exactly what drives the \nhighly successful results obtained by the popular TV program, \n``America's Most Wanted.'' In fact, John Walsh, the host of that \nprogram, has publicly endorsed the concept of a TIPS program. Moreover, \nI fully support the Amber Alert Program, which was created in 1996 \nafter a 9-year-old girl, Amber Hagerman, was kidnapped and murdered in \nTexas. This program is a voluntary partnership between law-enforcement \nand broadcasters to create a voluntary reporting program in child-\nabduction cases. The Amber Alert system recently led to the rescue of \ntwo teenage girls who were abducted in California; an anonymous tip \nfrom a motorist who responded to the program ultimately led to the \ngirls' safe return. I am so convinced of this program's effectiveness \nthat I recently co-sponsored legislation to create a national Amber \nAlert system.\n  In sum, we need to structure the TIPS program in a way that is \nresponsible and effective. We do not want big government to enlist \nmillions of Americans to snoop into the daily affairs of ordinary \ncitizens. But, just as importantly, we need to provide an avenue for \ncitizens to voluntarily alert law enforcement when they see things that \ncause them concern. It very well may be the case that the next 9/11 is \naverted because an accountant out walking his dog sees something \nunusual in his neighborhood park. We need to let that person know who \nhe can call to report that information. As the Chairman-designate of \nthe Judiciary Committee, I think that we will need to consider what \ntype of voluntary reporting system would be acceptable to meet the real \nconcerns posed by terrorist activity when we return for the 108th \nCongress.\n  We have debated this measure for many days now. I am delighted that \nwe have finally--and successfully--come to the end of the road. By \npassing this legislation, we are taking a big step forward in helping \nto defend our nation from terrorism. I support the final compromise \nversion of the Homeland Security Bill and hope that all of my \ncolleagues will do the same.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to support the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, but must register my disappointment with the \nscope of this bill's ban on granting Federal contracts to corporate \ninverters.\n  In October of this year, Senator Baucus and I introduced the \nReclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits, RECAP, Act to address the \nissue of inverting corporations that are awarded contracts by the \nFederal Government. Inverting corporations set up a folder in a foreign \nfiling cabinet or a mail box overseas and call that their new foreign \n``headquarters.'' This allows companies to escape millions of dollars \nof federal taxes every year. In April of this year, Senator Baucus and \nI introduced the Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore, REPO, \nAct to shut down these phony corporate inversions. Today, our REPO bill \nhas still not been enacted by the Senate.\n  You would think that the ``greed-grab'' of corporate inversions would \nsatisfy most companies, but unfortunately it is not enough. After these \ncorporations invert and save millions in taxes, they then come back \ninto the United States to obtain juicy contracts with the Federal \nGovernment. They create phony foreign headquarters to escape taxes and \nthen use other peoples' taxes to turn a profit.\n  Chairman Baucus and I offered our bipartisan RECAP bill as a \ncomplement to our earlier REPO bill on corporate inversions. For future \ncorporate inversions, our RECAP bill will bar the inverting company \nfrom receiving Federal contracts. For the inversions that have already \ngotten out before the REPO bill can be enacted, our RECAP bill will \nmake them send back their ill-gotten tax savings by forcing them to \nlower their bids in order to obtain Government contracts.\n  Unfortunately, the Government contracting ban in the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 only applies prospectively to a narrow band of \ninversions where 80 percent of the shareholders are the same before and \nafter the inversion. The homeland security ban bill does not address \nthe broader range inversion transactions involving less than 80 percent \nof the shareholders. It also does not touch inverters that have gotten \nout under the wire. This omission allows companies which have already \ninverted to avoid millions in U.S. taxes while easily reducing their \ntaxable profits from Federal contracts by creating phony deductions \nthrough their inversion structures. This failure to address inverted \ncompanies gives them an unfair cost advantage over competing Federal \ncontractors that choose to stay and pay in the U.S.A.\n  So let me be clear. The Government contracting ban in the homeland \nsecurity bill is merely a down payment on this issue, and it isn't good \nenough for me. The Homeland Security ban isn't half a loaf--it's barely \ntwo slices of bread. So to everyone developing or contemplating one of \nthese inversion deals, you proceed at your own peril. We will continue \nto pursue corporate expatriation abuse, and the abusers who seek fat \nGovernment contracts while skirting their U.S. tax obligations. I will \ncontinue this issue in the 108th Congress and beyond. I look forward to \nenlisting the support of my colleagues with the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs as we march forward to shut down this abuse in all \nits forms.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, like many important decisions in the \nSenate, we are today faced with something of a Hobson's choice. I agree \nthat the consolidation of agencies currently responsible for securing \nthe homeland will, if done right, result in greater security for the \nNation and I support establishing a Department of Homeland Security. \nBut, in my view, it would be better for us if we were implementing this \nmassive government reorganization more gradually. We are shifting close \nto 200,000 workers under the new homeland security umbrella in this \nbill, and it would make more sense to do so in stages. Here we are \ntrying to do too much at once and, if history is any guide, we will be \nback at this department many, many times in the years to come with \namendments designed to fix what we enacted in haste this year.\n  What we are left with is the choice of doing nothing, or taking the \nnext best option of passing this bill and launching a new Federal \nagency. After careful thought, I come to the conclusion that passing \nthis flawed bill is better than doing nothing. Consider our current \nstructure. Today, homeland security responsibilities are spread among \nover 100 different government agencies. The structure of the Treasury \nDepartment provides a good example of the problem. That agency houses \nthe U.S. Customs Service, an agency tasked with\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\nmonitoring the shipping containers that come into our country. Keeping \nthe Customs Service in the agency concerned primarily with fiscal \nmatters makes little sense when Customs' primary mission should know be \nsafeguarding those imports. Or consider the Coast Guard, an agency in \ncharge of patrolling our borders. The Coast Guard currently reports to \nthe Secretary of Transportation. The Immigration and Naturalization \nService is tasked with enforcing our immigration laws and securing our \nborders, yet its director reports to the Nation's chief law enforcement \nofficer, the Attorney General. These examples are just the beginning. \nThe need for reorganization is clear.\n  Modern management principles teach that the agencies and functions of \ngovernment should be grouped together based on their major purposes and \nmissions, and the bill before us accomplishes that goal. Once it is \nfully implemented, the Department of Homeland Security will be the one \nFederal agency with the responsibility of securing our borders, \nsafeguarding our transportation systems, and defending our critical \ninfrastructures. One agency will be charged with synthesizing and \nanalyzing intelligence related to homeland security. One agency will be \nresponsible for equipping and training the police officers, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical technicians who are often the first \nto respond to a terrorist incident.\n  These are constructive organizational changes, ones that I am hopeful \nwill help us better defend the country against attack. But should we be \nrushing their implementation without thoughtful consideration? During \ndebate on this measure I voted in favor of an amendment offered by \nSenator Byrd that would have required the Congress and the \nAdministration to work together to develop a staged implementation of \nthe new homeland security agency, an implementation far more deliberate \nthan the one we consider today. I am sorry Senator Byrd's amendment was \nnot adopted.\n  Without Senator Byrd's approach, I fear we are doing things in \nreverse and I predict we will have to revisit this new Department's \nstructure several times before we get it right. The government \nreorganization most similar to the one we consider today provides a \nguide. In 1947, we enacted the National Security Act and created the \nDepartment of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National \nSecurity Council. That approach still had to be revisited several more \ntimes, in 1949, 1953, 1958, and 1986, to perfect the structure.\n  Given the choice we now face, between the current state of homeland \nsecurity disorganization and this bill's approach, I am forced to vote \nin favor of the bill. I do so with the understanding that vigorous \ncongressional oversight of the new agency will be critical to insure it \nis not only accomplishing its primary mission of protecting our Nation \nbut also to guarantee that the vast new authorities we give to the \nPresident here are not abused.\n  I will be watching to see if the administration abuses its authority \nover workers in this new Department. We must be wary of the potential \npoliticization of our workforce. The employees of the new Department \nmust be highly dedicated professionals, free from political pressure. \nWe must be certain that the most expert and experienced employees are \nfree to speak their minds and to act quickly and aggressively to defend \nour national security. They must not be looking over their shoulders, \nconcerned about the ins and outs of Washington politics. They must be \nsafe from the kinds of influence that could cause them to slant their \nanalysis or trim their opinions to fit what is popular. I will be \nwatchful that the employees of the new Department are free from the \nthreat of political retaliation, and secure in their jobs so that they \ncan perform their important tasks to the highest professional \nstandards.\n  I support the creation of a Department of Homeland Security, and I \nwill vote in favor of this bill today. The increased coordination and \ncommunication that may result from the new governing structures created \nin this bill could, if properly implemented, provide the Nation with \nvastly improved security. But because of the speed with which we \nconsidered this proposal, the rapid, sweeping reorganization it \nimmediately envisions, and the prospect for abuse in several of its \nprovisions, I fear this bill will need to be revisited several times \nand its implementation will need to be closely monitored by Congress if \nwe hope to get it right. I will be closely watching the new agency's \ncreation, and I hope each of my colleagues does the same.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are finally about to vote on a bill \nto create a new Homeland Security Department. Many Senators worked long \nand hard to get us to this point. But one man was indispensable. He is \nthe chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, Joe Lieberman. \nUnder his leadership, the Government Affairs Committee held its first \nhearing on homeland security 10 days after September 11. It was at that \nhearing that former Senators Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, the co-chairs \nof a bipartisan blue-ribbon commission, shared their recommendation \nthat the Government should create a permanent, cabinet-level Department \nto protect the American people from terrorism. Three weeks later, on \nthe one-month anniversary of September 11, Senator Lieberman announced \nhis plan to create such a department. He had the vision to see what \nneeded to be done and the patience and flexibility to work through \ndisagreements and come up with workable, bipartisan alternatives. He \nalso had the courage to stand his ground for months while the President \nthreatened to veto any Homeland Security bill. I also want to thank \nDemocrats on the Governmental Affairs Committee for standing with \nChairman Lieberman.\n  There are some who would like to rewrite the history of this effort. \nThey want the American people to believe that Democratic opposition is \nthe reason it has taken this long for Congress to pass a Homeland \nSecurity bill. That is simply not so. Creating a Homeland Security \nDepartment was a Democratic idea to begin with. It was disturbing to \nsee that truth twisted in the recent campaigns. There are some who are \nthreatening publicly to try to exploit homeland security again for \npartisan political advantage in the Louisiana Senate race next month. \nFor the sake of our Nation, I hope they do not. Our war is with \nterrorism, not each other.\n  In the months since Senator Lieberman introduced his bill, we have \nheard countless chilling reasons why a Homeland Security Department is \nneeded. We have heard about dots that were not connected, intelligence \nreports that weren't shared and urgent warnings that were not heeded. I \nwill vote for this bill because I believe a Homeland Security \nDepartment is right and necessary. I have thought so for more than a \nyear. But we need to be honest with the American people about what this \nmeans.\n  I am very concerned about what I fear are false hopes and false \nassurances being given by some of those who came late to this cause.\n  Many of the same people who claimed just a few months ago that \ncreating a Department of Homeland Security would detract from the war \non terrorism now seem to want the American people to believe that \ncreating this Department will solve the war on terrorism. They seem to \nwant people to believe that, once we pass this bill, there is nothing \nelse that needs to be done--no other changes that need to be made--to \nprevent another September 11. This is worse than wishful thinking. It \nis dangerous thinking. And it is not true.\n  Reorganizing parts of our Government in order to better connect the \ndots is only part of the solution. A much greater and far more \ncomprehensive effort is still needed to protect America from terrorism. \nThat effort will be difficult, it will be complicated, it will be \ncostly. To pretend otherwise is a disservice to the American people.\n  Our public health system is still dangerously under-prepared for the \npossibility of future biological or chemical attacks. Our borders are \nstill not secure as they need to be. Neither are our seaports; we still \nsearch only 2 percent of the roughly 6 million containers that are \nunloaded every year at America's ports. The U.S. has 150,000 miles of \ntrain track plus rail yards, bridges, tunnels, and switches that are \nall still vulnerable to terrorist attacks. This bill does not provide \nthe resources to\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\nsecure them. Our food supply--domestic and imported--remains highly \nvulnerable to biological attacks. This bill does not change that fact.\n  A study last year by the Army Surgeon General warned that a terrorist \nattack on a toxic chemical plant in a densely populated area could kill \n2.4 million people. There are more than 120 such plants in America. \nEven after we pass this bill, those plants will remain vulnerable to \nterrorist attacks. The Department of Energy estimates that there are \n603 tons of weapons-grade material inside the former Soviet republics--\nenough to build 41,000 nuclear weapons. So far, only about a third of \nthis material has been properly secured. This bill alone won't keep \nthat deadly material out of the hands of terrorists who want to use it \nto build ``dirty bombs.'' Last year, the President's budget cut the \nprograms that safeguard weapons of mass destruction. Fortunately, the \nSenate reversed that decision. It is urgent that we continue to work \nwith Russia and with other nations to shut down the nuclear black \nmarket. In addition, we know that there were intelligence failures \nleading up to September 11. Yet, unlike the bill introduced by Senator \nLieberman and passed by the Governmental Affairs Committee, this bill \nleaves most critical intelligence functions outside of the Homeland \nSecurity Department. We need to do a much better job of coordinating \nintelligence efforts regarding terrorism--or critical pieces of \ninformation will continue to fall between cracks.\n  Nearly as troubling as what was left out of this bill is what was \nadded to it at the eleventh hour. The American people should know that \nthis is not the same Homeland Security bill that Congress was debating \nbefore the election. It was re-written in secret after the election. It \nhas been stripped of a number of bipartisan, workable solutions that \nhad been worked out on difficult problems. It has also been used as a \nTrojan horse for special interest giveaways that have little or nothing \nto do with making America safer from terrorism.\n  We offered an amendment to strip out seven of these last-minute \nchanges--changes that have not been debated publicly. But the White \nHouse lobbied hard to keep them, and the White House won. As a result, \nthis Homeland Security bill now rewards US companies that use Carribean \ntax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes by allowing those \ncompanies to compete for Government contracts with the Department of \nHomeland Security. It says to those companies: Even if you refuse to \nhelp pay for the war on terrorism, you can still profit from it. What \ndoes that say about this administration's commitment to corporate \nresponsibility? You tell me. Better yet, tell the American people.\n  This bill now guts a critical part of the aviation security bill the \nSenate passed last year by a vote of 100 to nothing. It does so by \nproviding special immunity for private companies that perform passenger \nand baggage screening at airports. It is likely to slow enactment of \nother new emergency transportation security rules that the \nTransportation Security Administration has said are essential to \nprotect air and rail passengers, as well.\n  In the name of protecting Americans, this bill actually eliminates \nsome legal protections for ordinary Americans. It grants legal immunity \nto countless private companies. All the Federal Government has to do is \ndesignate a company's product an ``anti-terrorism technology'' and the \ncompany can't be sued--even if it acts in ways that are grossly \nnegligent. This bill also provides special legal protections to the \nmaker of a mercury-based, vaccine additive that has been alleged to \nharm children. For parents who are involved in class-action lawsuits \nagainst the makers of that additive, this bill slams the courthouse \ndoor in their face.\n  This bill abandons the bipartisan effort to make workplace rules in \nthe new Department more flexible without trampling worker protections \nand making workers more vulnerable to partisan political pressure. \nHistory has already shown that no one--no one--sacrificed more on \nSeptember 11th than did public workers. I believe history will also \nshow that using September 11 to justify taking away public employees' \nbasic rights is a mistake. I regret deeply that it is part of this \nbill.\n  This bill also undermines the Federal Freedom of Information Act and \ncommunity right-to-know laws. It says that any information a company \noffers voluntarily to the Homeland Security Department--or any \ninformation a company gives to another government entity, which is then \nturned over to the Homeland Security Department--is classified. And it \nmakes releasing such information a criminal offense. You don't have to \nworry about shredding damaging documents anymore. If a company wants to \nhide information from the public, all it has to do is give the \ninformation to the Federal Government and releasing it becomes a \ncriminal offense. This is not necessary. The Freedom of Information Act \nalready allows exceptions for national security reasons. We will not \nmake America safer by denying people critical information or throwing \nconscientious whistle-blowers in prison.\n  Finally, this bill authorizes the creation of a university-based \nhomeland security research center. That sounds like a good idea. But \nthis bill is now written in such a way that only one university in all \nof America is eligible to compete for the research center: Texas A\n  We shouldn't have to be here, working on this bill, on November 19. \nIt has been nearly 14 months since Senator Lieberman first proposed \ncreating a Department of Homeland Security. The Senate could have \npassed a strong Homeland Security bill, and President Bush could have \nsigned it into law, long before the election. Democrats tried five \ntimes to break the Republican filibuster on homeland security. The \nreason we couldn't break the filibuster is because Republican leaders \nwanted to use homeland security as an election issue. They wanted to be \nable to blame Democrats for the impasse they created, and question the \npatriotism of good and decent people. As I said, for the sake of the \nAmerican people and their security, I hope we have seen the last of \nthose tactics.\n  I will vote for this bill because there is no doubt that we need to \ncreate a Department of Homeland Security. But we must be honest with \nthe American people. Passing this bill does not solve the problem of \nterrorism on American soil. Creating a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is only one part of the solution. A much greater and far more \ncomprehensive effort is still needed to prevent future terrorist \nattacks. That effort will be difficult, it will be complicated, it will \nbe costly. We should not pretend otherwise.\n  Last year, after September 11, this Senate put aside partisan \ndifferences and acted quickly to protect America from terrorism. It is \ndeeply regrettable that much of that unity seems to have been lost, or \nsacrificed for partisan advantage, in the closing months of this \nCongress. We are capable of better. The American people deserved \nbetter. And I hope that in the next Congress, we will give them better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Madam President, it is a happy \ntwist of fate that the Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor as I \nrise to support final passage of this legislation, which would create \nthe unified and accountable Department of Homeland Security that the \nAmerican people urgently need to protect them.\n  It is a happy twist of fate because the legislative journey that \nbrings us to the eve of adoption of this critically important \nlegislation began on October 11, 2001, more than a year ago, but \nclearly a month after September 11, 2001, when I was privileged, along \nwith Senator Specter, to introduce the first legislation that would \nauthorize the creation of this Department. I thank him for joining me \non that occasion and for working with us right through the road we have \ntraveled, which has been long and taken twists and turns we never could \nhave foreseen. We have even run into a few potholes along the way.\n  The important point is we are about to reach the destination, and we \nare going to reach it together--in a broad, bipartisan statement of \nsupport for this critically necessary new Department.\n  Giving credit where it is due, the journey actually began before \nOctober 11 and September 11, more than 18 months ago, when the \nvisionary Commission on National Security in the\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\n21st Century, led by our former colleagues Gary Hart and Warren Rudman, \nwarned us of our vulnerabilities to terrorism with a painful \nprescience, and urged the creation of exactly the kind of new \nconsolidated federal department to fight terrorism that we are about to \nadopt.\n  As I say, we have reached our destination, and that, I believe, is \ntestament to the power of the basic idea underlying this legislation. \nIt is also a reflection that our history changed on September 11, our \nvulnerabilities were exploited by our terrorist enemies, and we can \nnever let that happen again. Those vulnerabilities remain, \nnotwithstanding the improvements that have been made over the last \nyear.\n  We recognize that protecting ourselves from terrorism will take an \nunprecedented commitment of people and resources. Building this \nDepartment will involve no shortage of problems, as any massive \nundertaking of this kind would--but we, after this initial act of \ncreation, must be ready to improve, to support, and ultimately to \nprotect the American people with this Department. We have no choice.\n  Obviously, as I have said earlier today and at other times in the \ndebate on the bill, the measure before us is not perfect. No \nlegislation ever is. There are parts of the legislation before us that \nI think are not only unrelated to homeland security and unnecessary, \nbut unwise and unfair. Of course, we made an attempt to eliminate those \nprovisions with the motion to strike that came very close to passing \nearlier today. But this is the legislative process here on Earth, not a \nperfect process such as that which might exist in a heavenly location. \nWe do not always get what we want here.\n  Hopefully, though, through compromise, steadfastness, and hard work, \nthe American people will get what they need. And that, I think, is what \nis happening with the adoption of this bill, which will occur in just a \nfew hours.\n  We must remember also--to say what is clear--that this bill will be \nwritten in the law books. It is not written in stone. If we need to \nmake changes down the road, we can and we will.\n  Nonetheless, all of those caveats, conditions, and concerns about \ncertain elements of the legislation notwithstanding, we are about to be \npart of an historic accomplishment. It is the largest reorganization of \nthe Federal Government since 1947, probably the most complex Federal \nreorganization in history, but that is what our present circumstances \nrequire to sustain our security.\n  When we pass this bill, we in Congress must then not turn away but \nturn our attention toward overseeing the Department, with a clear \nvision and commitment. We must provide the necessary resources, which \nwe still have not done, not just to this Department but to all of those \nthroughout America, the Federal, county, State, and local governments \nwho will partner with us to protect the security of the American \npeople.\n\n  Early next year, we will have to confirm the Department's leaders and \nbegin to review its strategies and objectives. I look forward to \nplaying an active oversight role under the new leadership of the new \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Collins of \nMaine, and in the Senate at large. Part of that oversight role must be \ntaking great care to make sure this administration and future \nadministrations use the authorities this bill gives them in a \nconstructive and constitutional manner.\n  The important thing to say is we are ending this journey mostly \ntogether, certainly with a strong bipartisan vote. Though we have made \nthe twists and turns and had the obstacles along the way I have \nreferred to, the fact is, once we end this part of the journey, we \nbegin the next phase. On that phase, I hope and believe nonpartisanship \nwill be the rule, not the exception. I hope and believe that we will \noversee and support the historic new effort to achieve homeland \nsecurity in our new circumstances with as little partisanship as has \nbeen demonstrated by those of us who have been privileged to work as \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where there are \ndisagreements, but rarely are they partisan.\n  That, I hope and believe, will characterize our work in support of \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  I want to speak to some of the conditions this legislation will \ncorrect. As I said earlier, we have made some progress over the past 14 \nmonths in trying to close the vulnerabilities September 11 revealed. \nThe Office of Homeland Security has been created. The FBI and CIA have \nbegun the process of reform. FEMA has focused more resources on \ncountering terrorism. Smallpox vaccines are stockpiled around the \ncountry. We have begun efforts to link Federal law enforcement \nauthorities to State and local police and to give community first \nresponders some of the guidance, if not yet the resources, they so \ncritically need. But the fact is we remain fundamentally and \nunacceptably disorganized, and that is why we need to restructure in \nexactly the way this legislation will require.\n  Today, there are a lot of people and agencies in the government whose \nresponsibilities include homeland security. Their duties often overlap. \nEveryone is in charge of their own domain and, therefore, no one is in \ncharge of the overall homeland security effort.\n  A year ago, we came to understand tragically, painfully, that the \nstatus quo was untenable. We knew we had these gaps in preparedness, \nbut in the aftermath of September 11, there was no agreement on how to \nmove forward. Our Governmental Affairs Committee held 18 hearings, and \nover time we grew more convinced our weaknesses were so profound they \ncried out for fundamental reorganization.\n  We saw border patrol agencies that seemed unable to communicate with \neach other, let alone to stop dangerous goods and people from entering \nthe United States of America.\n  We saw intelligence agencies, despite strong signals about a \npotential terrorist attack of the type we sustained on September 11, \nfailing to put those pieces together.\n  We saw first responders around the country spread thinner than ever.\n  And we saw deviously creative terrorists acquiring and applying \ntechnology to advance their own ends--but an American government that \nhad not yet sought to marshal the most innovative people, our people, \nin the history of the world to meet this life-or-death challenge.\n  We did not like what we saw.\n  So we worked hard to better organize it, to make it more efficient, \nto make it more focused, to create a bill that would empower a \nSecretary with budget authority to get the agencies involved in \nhomeland security to work together. That is what led to our \nintroduction of the bill with Senator Specter and others, including \nSenator Cleland, and ultimately to report the bill out of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in May.\n  I don't think we can count the ups and downs since then. The finished \nproduct we are prepared to vote on today is, notwithstanding the \nconcerns I have expressed, a great leap forward for the security of the \nAmerican people. It is a great achievement to have reached agreement on \na governmental reorganization of this magnitude.\n  This is, after all, a very turf-conscious town, one in which we often \nspeak volumes about the need for change, but just as often, probably \nmore often, fail to deliver change. This bill will deliver change.\n  Former Senators Hart and Rudman, who ably led that commission I \nreferred to, this year were asked again to head an independent task \nforce created by the Council on Foreign Relations. The final report of \nthe task force, released October 24, 2002, was entitled titled \n``America Still Unprepared--America Still in Danger.'' I read from the \nconclusion.\n\n       Quickly mobilizing the nation to prepare for the worst is \n     an act of prudence, not fatalism. In the 21st century, \n     security and liberty are inseparable. The absence of adequate \n     security elevates the risk that laws will be passed \n     immediately in the wake of surprise terrorist attacks that \n     will be reactive, not deliberative. Predictably, the \n     consequence will be to compound the initial harm incurred by \n     a tragic event with measures that overreach in terms of \n     imposing costly new security mandates and the assumption of \n     new government authorities that may erode our freedoms. \n     Accordingly, aggressively pursuing America's homeland \n     security imperatives immediately may well be the most \n     important thing we can do to sustain our cherished freedoms \n     for future generations.\n\n  That is exactly what we will do when we adopt this legislation in a \nfew hours.\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n  And pursuing America's homeland security imperatives is not only \ncritically important for future generations of Americans; let us also \nrealize that, as we adopt and create this new Department, we set a \npowerful example for the nations of the world. Terrorists threaten \ninnocent lives everywhere. When we demonstrate that we are willing and \nable to earn both security and more freedom, we will show free nations \nthat they can preserve their way of life without living in fear of \nterror. And, equally important, we will demonstrate to those nations \nremaining in the world whose people are not free that they can embrace \nfreedom and tolerance and democracy without compromising their safety.\n  There are few more important signals we can send by our example to \nthe nations of the world.\n  In 1919, Henry Cabot Lodge said famously: ``If the United States \nfails, the best hopes of mankind fail with it.''\n  I add today, when the United States succeeds, the best hopes of \nmankind succeed with it. When we succeed in protecting our homeland \nsecurity and preserving our freedom, we will show the way to nations \nthroughout the world.\n  This evening we say to the people of America: have confidence, your \ngovernment is organizing itself to protect your security. We need not \naccept another September 11 type terrorist attack as inevitable. It is \nnot.\n\n  We are the strongest nation in the world. If we marshal our strength \nas this new Department can, no future terrorist attack such as \nSeptember 11 will ever occur again.\n  Finally, I give credit and thanks to the Members of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and to the majority staff for their \npassion, precision, and persistence. They were tireless, working day \nand night, through recesses, weekends, and holidays, and they have \nevery right to be proud of this product of their labor: a new \nDepartment that will better protect the American people for \ngenerations. The names of the staff members, from both the Committee \nand from my personal staff, are:\n  Holly Idelson, Mike Alexander, Larry Novey, Susan Propper, Kevin \nLandy, Josh Greenman, Bill Bonvillian, Michelle McMurry, Kiersten Todt \nCoon, Joyce Rechtschaffen, Laurie Rubenstein, Leslie Phillips, Fred \nDowney, Adrian Erckenbrack, Yul Kwon, Thomas Holloman, Donny Williams, \nJanet Burrell, Darla Cassell, Wendy Wang, Megan Finlayson, and Adam \nSedgewick.\n  I thank them all for their commitment.\n  I would also like to thank the numerous staff for other members who \nhave been so helpful throughout the process. On the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, so many staff played an important role in this bill. \nOn Senator Durbin's Staff, Marianne Upton and Sue Hardesty. On Senator \nAkaka's staff, Rick Kessler, Nanci Langley, Sherri Stephan and Jennifer \nTyree. On Senator Levin's staff, Laura Stuber. On Senator Cleland's \nstaff, Donni Turner. On Senator Carnahan's staff, Sandy Fried. On \nSenator Carper's staff, John Kilvington. On Senator Dayton's staff, Bob \nHall. Senator Daschle's staff also has contributed greatly to the \nenactment of this legislation; I'd like to thank in particular Andrea \nLaRue.\n  From the Office of Legislative Counsel, I'd like to thank Tony Coe \nand Matthew McGhie for their assistance and guidance.\n  I thank Senator Thompson, who is leaving the Senate soon--tonight, \npresumably--for the pleasure of his company on this journey, and the \ncontributions he made to the historical accomplishment this legislation \nrepresents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from West Virginia \nhas 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback, wishes some time.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, yes, I \nwould like 5 minutes, if that is possible, to speak on the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator gets his time from whom?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. From Senator Thompson. I believe he has some time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I seek 5 of those 7 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I promised to yield 5 minutes of my time to Mr. Jeffords, \nafter which I would yield for whatever time the Senator from Kansas \ndesires, after which, then, I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Mark Twain once said. ``Always do \nright--this will gratify some people and astonish the rest.'' I rise \ntoday to explain why I believe voting against this bill is the right \nthing to do.\n  Of the may reasons to vote against the bill, I will focus on three--\nthe bill's treatment of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nbill's treatment of the Freedom of Information Act, and the process \nused to create this new Department.\n  With the passage of this Homeland Security legislation, we will \ndestroy the Federal Emergency Management Agency, losing years of \nprogress toward a well-coordinated Federal response to disasters.\n  As it now exists, FEMA is a lean, flexible agency receiving \nbipartisan praise as one of the most effective agencies in government. \nBut it hasn't always been that way.\n  Throughout the 1980s, FEMA's focus on Cold War civil defense \npreparedness left the Agency ill-prepared to respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  The Congressional chorus of critics decried the Agency's misguided \nfocus and reached a crescendo after bungled responses to Hurricane Hugo \nin 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n  One of FEMA's leading Congressional critics, then-Representative Tom \nRidge said in 1988, ``I was convinced that somewhere along the way, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency had lost its sense of mission.''\n  Over the last decade, refocusing the agency's mission and priorities \non natural disasters has left the agency well-equipped to respond to \nall types of disasters. FEMA's stellar response to September 11th \nprovided this.\n  I cannot understand why, after years of frustration and failure, we \nwould jeopardize the Federal government's effective response to natural \ndisasters by dissolving FEMA into this monolithic Homeland Security \nDepartment.\n  I fear that FEMA will no longer be able to adequately respond to \nhurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes, begging the question, who \nwill?\n  Also of great concern to me are the new Freedom of Information Act \nexemptions contained in the latest substitute.\n  Unfortunately, the current Homeland Security proposal chokes the \npublic's access to information under the Freedom of Information Act. I \nask, are we headed toward an Orwellian society with an all-knowing, \nsecretive big brother reigning over an unknowing public?\n  The bill defines information so broadly that almost anything \ndisclosed by a company to the Department of Homeland Security could be \nconsidered secret and kept from the public. Although I believe the \ncurrent law contains an adequate national security exemption, in the \nspirit of compromise I supported the carefully crafted bipartisan \nSenate language contained in both the Lieberman substitute and the \nGramm-Miller substitute. The current bill ignores this compromise.\n\n  The process by which we received this substitute seems eerily similar \nto the way the White House sprung its original proposal on Congress \nsome time ago. Late last week we received a bill that had magically \ngrown from 35 pages to an unwieldy 484 pages. There was no compromise \nin arriving at the current substitute, only a mandate to pass the \nsubstitute or be branded as weak on homeland security or, worse yet, \nunpatriotic.\n  Still more troubling, the current bill places little emphasis on \ncorrecting what went wrong on September 11, or addressing future \nthreats. Correcting intelligence failures should be our prime concern. \nInstead, this bill recklessly reshuffles the bureaucratic deck.\n  Furthermore, as my colleague Senator Corzine stated earlier this \nweek, this bill does not address other vitally important issues such as \nsecurity at facilities that store or use dangerous chemicals. Without \nprovisions to address yet another gaping hole in our\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\nNation's security, why are we now being more deliberate in our \napproach?\n  In closing, I feel it is irresponsible to divert precious limited \nresources from our fight against terrorism to create a dysfunctional \nnew bureaucracy that will only serve to give the American people a \nfalse--false sense of security. I will vote against this bill because \nit does nothing to address the massive intelligence failure that led up \nto the September 11 attacks, it dismantles the highly effectively \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and creates dangerous new \nexemptions to the Freedom of Information Act that threaten the \nfundamental democratic principle of a well-informed citizenry.\n  I am sorry for having to take this position, but I believe so deeply \nin what I have said that I must do it.\n  I am pleased to have been able to express myself, and I thank the \nSenator from West Virginia, my faithful friend.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from West Virginia allow me to direct a \nstatement, through the Chair, to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I want to say, because the opportunity may not be right at \na subsequent time, how much I appreciate the days the Senator from West \nVirginia has spent on the floor on this issue. Because of my having \nresponsibility to help move legislation along here, sometimes I was \nconcerned it was taking so much time. But in hindsight, this \nlegislation we are going to soon pass--it will pass sometime tonight--\nis better legislation. And while it may not be--484 pages may not be \nbetter, the knowledge of the American people of this legislation is so \nmuch better than if we had passed this as people wanted on September \n11.\n  So I want to commend and applaud the Senator from West Virginia for \neducating the Senate and the American public about what is in this bill \nand what is not in this bill. As I said, this legislation will pass. \nBut as a result of what the Senator has done over these many months \nabout this legislation, everyone is going to be looking at what is \ntaking place in this new agency that would not have taken place but for \nthe persistence of the Senator from West Virginia. The American public \nowe you a tremendous debt of gratitude for your knowledge about \nlegislation and, most of all, for understanding what the Constitution \nis all about and the role, in that Constitution, of the legislative \nbranch of Government.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may just respond: First of all, I thank \nthe distinguished Senator, who is the majority whip in this body. I \ndeeply appreciate what he has said. I appreciate very much what he has \nsaid.\n  May I say, in turn, that the American people don't owe me anything. \nBut I will say this, that the American people are listening. And with \nrespect to the resolution dealing with a war with Iraq, the American \npeople were listening. The American people heard what we said. As a \nresult of speeches--I made two or three speeches in that instance--as a \nresult of those two or three speeches that I made, my office received \n21,000 telephone calls, and my office received over 50,000 e-mails.\n  That is an indication that there is somebody out there listening, \nsomebody cares, somebody is paying attention. That is gratifying to me. \nSo somebody heard. And I don't pay all that much attention to the \npolls. I don't think they ask the right questions. What are the right \nquestions? I don't know what the right questions are. But those polls \nreflect responses to questions. And whether they are the right \nquestions or the questions that ought to be asked, I cannot say.\n  But I can say the American people do listen. And somebody has to \nfulfill the duty Woodrow Wilson was speaking about when he said the \ninforming function of the legislative branch is as important, if not \nmore so, than the legislative function.\n  I thank the Senator. I am well paid.\n  When Plato was about to pass away from this earthly sphere, he said:\n\n       I thank the Gods that I was born a man.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I thank the Gods that I was born a Greek.\n\n  And he said:\n\n       I am grateful to the Gods for the fact that I live--I live \n     in the same era in which Sophocles lived.\n\n  So, I am thankful to God, and to my angel mother and my father, and \nto the people of West Virginia, for the fact that I have had this great \nprivilege to work in this body, now, for 44 years and I have been able \nto contribute. God gives me my faculties almost as they were 50 years \nago, except for my feet. I was always told the first place will be your \nfeet; your feet and legs will give way. I am finding that to be pretty \ntrue. But I thank heaven that I was able to be here, to say what I have \nbeen able to say about the resolution dealing with Iraq and the \nhomeland security legislation.\n  I think we have performed a service. I said what I thought. I am on \nno man's payroll. I am on the people's payroll. And I wear no man's \ncollar but my own. That may be kind of a small collar.\n  But, anyhow, I do what I think. I could leave here any moment and get \njust as big a check as I get as being a Senator because I have paid in \nthe system, now, 50 years this coming January 3.\n  I am doing what I want to do. I don't have to do this. I probably \nought to be home with my wife. We will be married, in another 6 months, \n66 years, if the Good Lord lets me live.\n  But I do think the Senator from Nevada, has made a tremendous \ncontribution himself. He has listened to what we had to say, to what \nPaul Sarbanes and I and the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords, and others have said. We have warned about this measure. We \nhave not been in agreement with the administration in connection with \nthis homeland security agency. We think we have legislated too fast. We \nthink we have been in too big a hurry. We think we have paid too much \nattention to the polls, and that we ought to have taken more time in \nthis body.\n  It is said to be the greatest deliberative body in the history of the \nworld. It hasn't been very deliberative in this case. But I am glad \nthat, although the intent was to pass this bill in a hurry--I was told \ndown at White House, I say to the distinguished Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Sarbanes--I went down there at the invitation of the President. I \nam not invited very often down there. But on this occasion the \nPresident invited me down. He said:\n\n       I have got to go to St. Louis. I can only be here a few \n     minutes. So we had a picture taken. All the cameras came in \nand took pictures. Then he sat down and said: I have this package here. \nI thank the congressional leaders for their input into this package.\n\n  I scratched my head. What input is he talking about? I knew the \ncongressional leaders had not had one ounce of input into it--not one.\n  This thing was patched together down in the bowels of the White House \nby four eminent public servants--not quite perhaps up to the caliber of \nThomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Who else was on that committee \nthat wrote the Declaration of Independence? Robert Livingston. And who \nelse? There was John Adams, and one more: Roger Sherman. So they \nweren't quite up to that caliber.\n  But this bill was the egg that was hatched down at the White House. I \ncan just picture them walking around there with their shadows on the \nwalls of the subterranean caverns, walking around with lanterns or \ncandles. And they hatched this great idea down there all of a sudden to \nget ahead of this Mack truck that was coming down upon them fast in the \nappropriations bills which provided that the Director of Homeland \nSecurity would have to be confirmed by the Senate. The purpose of that \nwas, as Senator Stevens and I intended, Mr. Director, when the Senate \nconfirms you, you will come before the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  So much for that.\n  The thing that is being missed probably most in this deliberation is \nthe fact that the Appropriations Committee and the Senate and the \nCongress have appropriated moneys for homeland security that will make \nthe country far more safe than will this piece of legislation. It is \ngoing to take a year or 2 years for this legislation to be implemented \nand to get this thing going. In the meantime, the people who are now \nout there on the borders, who are protecting the nuclear facilities of\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nthe country, the food lines, and the clean water are the same people \nwho will be here a year or two from now when this agency is supposed to \nbe full blown.\n  But the President has a year in which to send up his plan as to how \nthis organization is to be implemented. Imagine that--a year. He has a \nyear. In the meantime, I am afraid that the people who are out there \nnow at midday and midnight working to secure the safety of the American \npeople will be distracted. They are going to be worrying about where \ntheir offices are going to be; What is going to be the label over my \noffice? Where will my typewriter be? Where is the telephone going to \nbe? What is going to be the vision and the objective of this new \nagency?\n  These people are going to be distracted. I am afraid that is what \ngives the terrorist a good opportunity to work havoc in some way.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada for his kind words. I \nalso thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont who summed up in a \nfew words, in 5 minutes, what I could say in 30 minutes, the very good \nreasons that we should oppose this bill. I admire him for that. I \nadmire him for his courage, his pluck, and for his good sense. He has \nmade my speech for me. I can just sit down. I thank the Senator from \nVermont.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Kansas for his unlimited \npatience and for his consideration and always for his good humor.\n  I yield while he speaks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for allowing me to take time previously \nallocated on the floor to speak.\n  I want to make a couple of comments about homeland security, and in \nparticular about the INS.\n  I have been privileged to serve for the last couple of years as \nranking member on the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee. Immigration is a subject on which we have focused.\n  We passed two major pieces of legislation already in this Congress \ndealing with immigration issues--trying to strengthen our borders and \ntrying to give the enforcement agencies some better information, and \nalso better information for the INS and the State Department about \nterrorists abroad before they get here. There are two good pieces of \nlegislation that we passed.\n  What we are attempting to do in this bill is to restructure the INS. \nThe reason I want to talk about the INS is that it is a troubled \nagency, by anybody's definition--whether you are pro-immigration or \nanti-immigration. I hear everybody complaining about the INS. It just \ndoes not function well from any perspective that you look at. It may be \nan impossible task. Some people may look at it as just impossible. We \nhave too many people seeking entry into the country each year. The \nnumber varies. There are over 250 million entries into the country each \nyear by people who are legally seeking entry into the country. And 1 \nperson may come in and out 10 times. That is 10 entries. But still, you \nare talking about a large number of entries by people, who are not U.S. \ncitizens, into this country each year, making this a difficult job. It \nis a troubled agency. It is not functioning well. We need to change it. \nA lot of that is put in the bill.\n  I am pleased about some of the ideas that I and several others put \nforward that are incorporated into the INS restructuring that is in the \nhomeland security bill. There is a clear distinction between the \nenforcement and services functions at the INS. We recognize the \nimportance of keeping immigration enforcement and services in the same \ndepartment. Some people wanted to split them. I think that would work \npoorly. I think you need to have the same functions together. They are \nthere. There are clear distinctions between the enforcement and \nservices functions, which clearly need to be delineated, but they need \nto work together. Those are two positive features of this \nreorganization.\n  I must be frank as well. I think there is some failing that we want \ncorrected in the INS restructuring portion of this homeland security \nbill. I am concerned that the new Department be true and coordinated \nwell--both in the enforcement and services functions. It looks to me as \nif some of the restructuring may not have good lines of clear \ndistinction in organization and functioning in the enforcement services \nfunctions the way it is set up.\n  I am concerned about the services component of the Department of \nHomeland Security being effectively coordinated with the enforcement. I \nam troubled about how this is set up. I have communicated those \nconcerns to Governor Ridge, and I am hopeful that those concerns are \ngoing to be taken seriously.\n  I think we need strong leadership at the head of the immigration \nservices office. It has to be a strong leader. That is a function of \nwho is picked--not a function of how it is structured. But if we weaken \nthat services component of it, and if we don't have somebody who has \nknowledge, stature, and ability to communicate this going forward, I \nthink we are going to be left with a continuing troubled agency.\n\n  I think the leadership has to have the ear of the Secretary of the \nnew Department. Part of my concern is this is built to the side--not \nbuilt into the positive agency--to the side of the Secretary. If you do \nnot have a strong voice there, if they do not have the ear of the \nSecretary, I think we are going to have some real problems in this \nimmigration portion.\n  We want strong and effective immigration enforcement. We don't want \nthe invaluable services of citizenship, family, and business petitions, \nasylum, and the many public service components of immigration to be \nforgotten. We don't want that. We want a strong enforcement, and we \nwant to provide homeland security. But we also are a nation of \nimmigrants. We need to take people who are legally here and build this \nsociety.\n  We want strong security. We should never compromise our values or \nlose sight of the immigration benefits to our culture or to our \neconomy. It is critical that we monitor the development of this new \nDepartment to ensure the immigration services component receive the \nattention and resources it deserves.\n  I have shared these concerns with Governor Ridge. I am comforted by \nthe fact that he is aware of those facts.\n  One of the other aspects I want to make note of is the issue of the \nimmigration courts. I want to quickly commend this legislation for \nkeeping the Executive Office for Immigration Review within the \nDepartment of Justice. It didn't move over homeland security. I think \npermitting the Attorney General to retain control of the immigration \ncourt system is going to be positive.\n  I think those are some problems we need to revisit. We should do so \nin the future.\n  It is time we pass the homeland security legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we have come to the end of a long, long \nroad. For nearly 5 months, this Chamber has engaged in discussions \nabout homeland security. But for nearly as long a time as that, this \nCongress has not engaged in seeing to it that there is actual funding \nto make our people any safer from the threat of another horrific \nterrorist attack. It has been over 4 months--over 4 months--since the \nHouse of Representatives has seen fit to pass a single regular \nappropriations bill.\n  Now, God created all of creation. He created the universe. He created \nthe Earth. He created man in 7 days, in the Book of Genesis. The \ngreatest scientific treatise that has ever been written can be found in \nthat first chapter of Genesis. Go to it. Those of you who are \nscientists, look over that one, the first chapter of Genesis. Do you \nhave any problem with the chronological order in which the creation was \nmade possible, as set forth in that chapter? No. The scientists won't \nhave any objection to that chronological order, not any. I have four \nphysicists in my own family, and they agree with that, that \nchronological order.\n  So 6 days, and God rested on the Sabbath.\n  How long has it taken for us to pass a regular appropriations bill? \nThe last regular appropriations bill came out of the House 4 months \nago. It has been over 4 months since the House of Representatives has \nseen fit to pass a single regular appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\n  Now, God would not have gotten very far in the creation of this \nuniverse, would He, if it had taken Him that long at that pace?\n  We have talked a lot about homeland security. We have plenty of talk. \nWe just open our mouths, and it just rolls out--rolls out. So talk is \ncheap.\n  But we have done very little. We have not given the cities and \nmunicipalities, the police, the firemen, the hospital workers, the \nfirst responders who are on the front line, we have not given these \npeople one red cent--I will say, one copper cent--not one, to help them \nkeep us safer from the madmen within our midst--in 4 months. Now, get \nthat.\n  Nothing was said about that during the campaign. The President went \nall over this country--from the Pacific to the Atlantic, to the \nCanadian border, to the Gulf of Mexico--talking about this great bill \nhere, this magnificent product of human genius in the bowels of the \nWhite House. Not one word was said about these appropriations that have \nbeen passed by the Senate and the House that have been on the \nPresident's desk--$5.1 billion, in one instance, made available to the \nPresident for homeland security. All that was needed was the President \nto flourish the pen, attach his signature, and designate that money as \nan emergency. The Congress has already done it. He said no.\n  So homeland security has gone wanting. That money has been there--\n$2.5 billion for homeland security. That is two and a half dollars for \nevery minute since Jesus Christ was born, two and a half dollars for \nevery minute.\n  So it has been a little over a year and 2 months now since America \nwas jolted from its tranquility by the noise, the smoke, the flames of \ntwo exploding commercial airlines as they smashed into the Twin Towers \nin New York City. Yet in these intervening months--except for the \ninitial help that we provided to New York and to Washington to aid in \nclosing the hemorrhaging wounds of economic disruption and human \ndevastation caused by the terrorist attacks--not enough has changed \nhere at home.\n\n  It is true that we have chased bin Laden across the landscape of \nAfghanistan. We have spent over $20 billion chasing him around in \nAfghanistan. And now we don't actually know where he has been chased \nto. We have chased bin Laden across the landscape of Afghanistan and \nprobably cleansed that nation of the training camps for terrorists, for \nnow.\n  We have made some progress, I am sure, in some disruption of the al-\nQaida network worldwide, but no one in this Chamber, and no one in this \ncity, can look the American people in the eye and say to them: ``Today \nyou are much safer here at home than you were 14 months ago.'' I can't \ndo it.\n  This Government continues to send out first one alert and then \nanother. Practically the whole litany of top people in this \nadministration has been out there at one time or another saying: \nSomething may happen here tomorrow. Something may happen here within \nthe next week. So the Nation has been put on alert after alert. So I \nask the question: Are you better off than you were a year ago?\n  Because of reckless disregard for the reality of the threat to our \ndomestic security, this administration and many in this Congress have \ntaken part in an irresponsible exercise in political chicanery.\n  The White House has pressured its Republican colleagues in the \nCongress--and some of the Democrats as well--to reject billions of \ndollars in money which could have added to the tangible safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  This White House has stopped--stopped--this year's normal funding \nprocess in its tracks. I have never seen such action before. This White \nHouse has stopped this year's normal funding process in its tracks. \nThis year--since 1976, when the beginning of the fiscal year was \nchanged from July 1 to October 1--only two appropriations bills have \npassed the Congress and been sent to the White House--only two. That is \nthe most dismal record since 1976; the most dismal record, only two \nbills. What a lousy record.\n  But this Senate Appropriations Committee reported out all 13 \nappropriations bills to the Senate no later than July--the best record \nin years. And yet only two bills have been signed by the President. \nWhy? Because this administration, down there in the White House--we all \nknow who is in the White House--has told the Republican leadership in \nthe other body: Don't let any more appropriations bills pass.\n  This White House has stopped this year's normal funding process in \nits tracks and even turned back funds for homeland security in \nemergency spending bills that could have shored up existing mechanisms \nto prevent or respond to another devastating blow by fanatics who hate \nthe United States.\n  They do not hate the United States because of its freedoms. The \nPresident says they hate us because of our freedoms. I do not believe \nthat. I think they hate us because of our arrogance.\n  They have done this plain disservice to the people. They have done \nthis plain disservice to the people in order to gain some perceived \npolitical advantage in a congressional election year, and in order to \nbe able to say that they were holding down spending.\n  So they kept 11 of the appropriations bills from coming down to the \nWhite House. But you watch this administration after the turn of the \nnew year. You will never see such fast operating on appropriations \nbills as we will see then. We have done our work on these bills. But \nfor the most part they have not been sent to the White House because \nthe administration said: We don't want them.\n  The administration told the Republican leadership in the other body: \nWe don't want them. Hold them up.\n  But once this new leadership takes over in January, you watch how \nquickly they will say: Now send those bills on down. We want to show \nthe American people how fast we can appropriate money, how fast we can \nmove appropriations bills--when all the while the ``we'' they are \nthinking about is the ``we'' that has held up those appropriations \nbills and not let them come to the White House.\n  In order to avoid criticism of the too meager dollars for homeland \nsecurity, this White House suddenly did an about-face and embraced the \nconcept of a Department of Homeland Security. Don't send us your \nappropriations for homeland security. Send that bill up there because \nthat is a great political hat trick. Send us the bill on homeland \nsecurity. Make the people think they are going to have more security in \ntheir schools and their homes and their businesses and on their farms.\n  So the people are being offered a bureaucratic behemoth complete with \nfancy top-heavy directorates, officious new titles, and noble sounding \nmissions instead of real tools to help protect them from death and \ndestruction. How utterly irresponsible. How utterly callous. How \ncavalier.\n  With this debate about homeland security, politics in Washington has \nreached the apogee of utter cynicism and the perigee of candor. No one \nis telling our people the plain, unvarnished truth. It is simply this: \nThis Department is a bureaucratic behemoth cooked up by political \nadvisors to the President to satisfy several inside Washington agendas.\n  One, it is intended to protect the President from criticism and fault \nshould another attack occur.\n  Two, it is intended to eliminate large numbers of dedicated, trained, \nexperienced, loyal, patriotic Federal workers so that lucrative \ncontracts for their services may be awarded to favored private \nentities. Watch. Watch and see.\n  Three, it would be used to channel Federal research moneys and grants \nto big corporate contributors without the usual Federal procurement \nstandards that ensure fair competition and best value for the tax \ndollar.\n  Four, it will foster easier spying and information gathering on \nordinary citizens which may be used in ways which could have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with homeland security. And now with this new bill, \nwith the blue ribbon that will be tied around it, the fancy trimmings \nthat will be around that bill when it goes down to the White House and \nthen to be invited--how wonderful, how glorious that will be, to be \ninvited. I haven't been down there in so long. It is called the Rose \nGarden--into that Rose Garden, just to be there in the presence of the \nchief executive, the Commander in Chief, when he signs this bill into \nlaw, this new bill which showed up only last week on the doorstep of \nthe Senate, how wonderful that will be, how utterly wonderful that will \nbe.\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\n  Insult has been added to injury by provisions that further exploit \nthe already shamefully exploited issue of homeland security with pork \nfor certain States and certain businesses. My, my, my, how low we have \nsunk.\n  Senators seem to be unaware or unconcerned about the transfer of \npower that will take place under this bill. Some of the Senators who \nhave walked down to that table and who have voted aye on this bill and \nwho voted no on amendments that have been offered to improve it, they \nwill have room, they will have time to remember. They will have time to \nremember how they were stampeded into voting without asking questions.\n  The most glaring example can be found in title XV of the bill which \nrequires the President to submit a reorganization plan to the Congress \nwhich would outline how he plans to transfer to the new Department 28 \nagencies and offices authorized by the Congress. The authority granted \nto the President under this title is very broad. The President can \nreorganize, streamline, or consolidate the 28 agencies and offices \nbeing transferred.\n  The President can determine which functions of the agencies being \ntransferred will be moved to the new Department and which will be left \nbehind. The President can determine how the functions transferred to \nthe new Department will be delegated among the officers within the new \nDepartment. The President can set any effective date he wants for \ntransferring these agencies within a 12-month transition period. The \nPresident can change his plan at any time before the plan takes effect.\n  The only requirement placed on the President is that heavy charter, \nthat great burdensome charge; namely, that he inform the Congress of \nhis plans before those plans take effect. My, what a heavy burden. The \nCongress does not have the opportunity to approve or disapprove of the \nPresident's plan. We have no mechanism by which to object to the \nPresident's plan. The Congress is locked out by our own doing, forced \nto watch from the sidelines as the administration implements this new \nDepartment.\n  What a great Senate this is, in this hour of God. The Senate, I have \nto say, has let the people down. The Senate has grown timid. It has \nlost its nerve. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Congress \nwould cut itself out of the loop like that. Congress is authorizing the \nPresident to reorganize, consolidate, or streamline any one of the 28 \nagencies and offices being moved to the new Department and to delegate \nfunctions among the officers however he wishes. And the only \nrequirement placed on the President, as I say, is that he humble \nhimself enough just to let the Congress know what he plans to do.\n  After we pass this bill, the Congress will have abdicated its role in \nthe implementation of the new Department. We might as well just dive \nunder the bed and say: Here goes nothing.\n  I find this to be unacceptable and unwise. Other Senators should \nagree.\n  Last September I offered an amendment that would have allowed the \nCongress to stay involved and to help provide for a more orderly, \nefficient, effective transition of agencies to this new Department. The \nCongress would have had a mechanism in place to guard against abuses of \nthis authority that we are granting to the President, if my amendment \nhad been adopted.\n  The distinguished Senator from Minnesota, presently sitting in the \nchair, voted for my amendment. But the Senate rejected my amendment--\nincidentally, the Senator who sits in the chair had, I will say, a \nkinsman who signed the Constitution of the United States. How many \nsigners were there? Thirty-nine. He was one of the signers; his name \nwas Jonathan Dayton. How old was he? He was the youngest member of the \nconvention, the youngest, younger than Charles Pinckney. I believe \nCharles Pinckney was the next youngest. Dayton was the youngest, 24 \nyears old, I believe, 25 or 26--24, I believe--choosing instead to \ntrust the administration to handle the implementation of the new \nDepartment without congressional input.\n  That decision, in my view, was a disservice to our States and the \npeople who sent us here to look out for them. With passage of the new \nHouse bill, we have in effect washed our hands of any further ability \nto affect decisions regarding the way the Department is organized or \nthe functions that it will perform.\n  The Nation will have this unfortunate creature, this behemoth \nbureaucratic bag of tricks, this huge Department of Homeland Security, \nand it will hulk across the landscape of this city, touting its noble \nmission, shining up its new seal, and eagerly gobbling up tax dollars \nfor all manner of things, some of which will have very little to do \nwith protecting or saving the lives of the American people.\n  Maybe in 5 years or so it will sort out its mission and shift around \nits desks enough to actually make some real contribution to the safety \nof our people. I sincerely hope so. But if the latest tape from bin \nLaden is to be believed, we won't have time for all of that.\n  If the latest threat assessment from the FBI can be believed, we will \nexperience something catastrophic before that new Department even \nfinishes firing all of the Federal workers it wants to get rid of.\n  What does it take to wake us up? What does it take to make the \ngamesmanship cease? When will we stop the political mud wrestling and \nbegin to wrestle with the most potentially destructive force ever to \nchallenge this Nation?\n  Let us hope that when the gavel bangs to close down this session of \nCongress, it will awaken us to all of the dreadful consequences of \ncontinued posturing and inaction.\n  I know that this administration, with its newfound majorities in both \nHouses of Congress, will quickly pass the remaining 2003 bills, which \nwill provide at least some modicum of real security for our people as \nsoon as Congress reconvenes in January of the new year. They will want \nto claim that they can get things done.\n  Although I deplore the motivation and the gamesmanship behind such \ntactics, I wish them well and pledge my help. It is long past time for \nus to finally do our best to prevent another deadly strike by those who \nhate us and wish us ill. Terrorism is no plaything. Political service \nis no game. Political office is no place for warring children.\n  The oath of office which we take is no empty pledge to be subjugated \nto the tactics of election year chicanery perpetrated on a good and \ntrusting people.\n  Yesterday, a Federal appeals court upheld broad, new powers given to \nthe Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people suspected of \nterrorism. The ruling of the special appeals court, which was created \nby Congress to oversee secret Government actions involving national \nsecurity, will make it easier for the Justice Department to spy on U.S. \ncitizens by circumventing traditional constitutional protections. This \ncourt decision gives the executive branch a green light to run \nroughshod over the civil liberties of innocent Americans in the name of \nnational security.\n  The Justice Department argued that the expanded authority it is \nclaiming is nothing more than what Congress authorized in last year's \nUSA Patriot Act, in which Congress tore down the protective walls that \nhad previously separated foreign intelligence and domestic law \nenforcement activities. A three-judge appeals panel agreed with the \nJustice Department, concluding that the new antiterrorism law did have \nthe effect of weakening procedures that safeguard our civil liberties.\n  The Justice Department now wields dangerous, new power to conduct \nsecret surveillance on American citizens for potential criminal \nprosecutions. This expanded power is a license for abuse, and Senators \nshould be concerned about the consequences for our constitutional \nsystem.\n  But any of us who wants to point his finger at the administration for \noverreaching its authority should also place that blame squarely on \nhimself or herself, because it was the actions of this Senate that set \nthe wheels in motion.\n  As the Washington Post points out in an editorial entitled ``Chipping \nAway at Liberty'' from this morning's paper:\n\n       The fault for the problem . . . lies not with the court, \n     but with Congress, for the carelessness and haste with which \n     it passed the USA Patriot Act in the wake of the September 11 \n     attacks, and for its unwillingness to push back against Bush \n     administration excesses.\n\n  The editorial goes on to explain that this new authority grants the \nGovernment one more sphere in which it gets\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\nto unilaterally choose the rules under which it will pursue the war on \nterrorism. . . .Which parts of this system need to be reigned in is a \nprofoundly difficult question, one that Congress seems depressingly \nuninterested in asking. This is a war, the administration has said, \nwithout a foreseeable end, so the legal regime that handles these cases \nmay become a permanent feature of American justice. Such a regime \nshould be enacted deliberately, after careful inquiry by legislators--\nan inquiry that has so far scarcely begun.\n\n  Mr. President, this Senate passed the USA Patriot Act in October of \n2001 by a vote of 98 to 1. I voted for it. Ninety-eight Senators, \nincluding myself, this Senator from West Virginia, voted for the bill. \nPerhaps many of us now realize that we may indeed have acted too \nhastily to hand over this unchecked power to the executive branch.\n  During the debate on that bill, one Senator stood up and pleaded with \nus to take the time to consider the legislation more carefully before \nwe unleashed such a dangerous and uncontrolled threat to our civil \nliberties. Senator Feingold stood alone in the path of that Mack truck \nthat was barreling through the Senate, warning that many of us would \ncome to regret our decision to stand out of the way and cheer on the \nrumbling big rig.\n  I believe that Senator Feingold was right to caution the Senate \nduring that debate. I believe we did pass the Patriot Act too hastily. \nAs the media continue to uncover more stories about the lengths to \nwhich this administration will go to shroud its actions in secrecy, I \nhope other Senators will also come to the conclusion that these issues \ndeserve more attention from this Congress.\n  During this debate on homeland security, I have tried to convince the \nSenate to slow down and look closely at this legislation before giving \nthe executive branch such a broad grant of virtually unchecked \nauthority. I have tried to draw attention to some of the problems in \nthis bill in the short time that we have had to examine it. I have \ntried to persuade Senators not to give into the political pressures \nthat have loomed over our consideration of this bill before and after \nthis year's election.\n  So I hope that Senators will heed the warnings and vote against this \nbill, although I do not really believe that will happen. I have seen \nthe handwriting on the wall, and I know that this bill has the votes to \npass. But I hope that those Senators who worry that we are acting too \nhastily will have the courage to vote against the bill.\n  There will be a lot of work to be done in the next Congress to clean \nup the mess we will make by enacting this homeland security \nlegislation. Congress will have already cut itself out of the loop with \nregard to the implementation of this new Department. It will be \nincumbent upon individual Members of the Senate to attempt to shed \nlight on the administration's actions whenever possible. It will be the \nresponsibility of individual Members to fight to defend the \nconstitutional powers of Congress and the constitutional protections of \nour personal privacy and civil liberties.\n  There will be a lot left to do in the name of homeland security \nduring the next Congress. I hope each Senator will remember that when \nhe or she votes on this bill, and I hope the Senators do not treat this \nvote as something to put behind them. When Senators cast their votes on \nfinal passage of this homeland security legislation, I hope that they \nwill understand and think about what that vote will mean a year from \nnow when their voters ask them: Where were you when the Senate approved \nthis bill?\n  I urge those Senators who are troubled by this legislation, as I am, \nto vote with me against the bill. I know where I will be when the \nSenate votes to hand over this power, and my people will know that I \ndid what I could to put the brakes on this process. I hope that other \nSenators will also send a message to the people they represent about \nwhere they stand by voting against the final passage of the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). There are 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I reserve that time.\n\n\n                   Farewell To Senator Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. President, with the closing of the 107th Congress, the Senate \nwill be saying farewell to a very talented and successful and effective \ncolleague, a Senator who in a relatively short period of time has made \nimportant contributions to this Chamber and to our country.\n  Senator Fred Thompson has accomplished so much that it is difficult \nto realize he has only been here since 1995. As a Senator, he has \nserved on the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, and the National Security Working Group. In 1997, he \nbecame chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs where he \nconducted a number of important and controversial investigations.\n  As a national lawmaker, Senator Fred Thompson has played an important \nrole in developing this Nation's trade policies, including pushing for \nan export control policy to protect our country's national security and \nproposing legislation to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. He has been an active and important advocate for campaign \nfinance reform. He has authored legislation to protect Government \ncomputers from outside infiltration. He has been a major force for \nregulatory reform.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, he helped lead the \nfight to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in Government, and along with \nSenator Frist, Senator Thompson secured funding to establish a School \nof Government at the University of Tennessee named in honor of \nUniversity of Tennessee graduate and one of my favorite Senators of all \ntime, Senator Howard Baker.\n  He is one of my favorite Senators of all time. He is a statesman. He \nis not just a politician. He is a statesman. If it had not been for \nHoward Baker, for his statesmanship, the Senate would never have \napproved the Panama Canal treaties. It would never have done it. It \nrequired a two-thirds vote, and all the polls showed the Senate was \nswimming upstream. The majority of the people were against those \ntreaties. But Howard Baker stepped to the plate, at a political \nsacrifice to himself, and stood for those treaties.\n  I was majority leader of the Senate at that time. Howard Baker was \nthe minority leader. I could not have gotten those treaties approved \nbut for the strong support of Howard Baker. It was kind of the same way \nfor Howard Baker as his father-in-law, Everett Dirksen. If Everett \nDirksen had not stepped to the plate, the Senate would never have \npassed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It was Everett Dirksen who joined \nwith Mike Mansfield and that legislation was passed.\n  I should point out that Senator Thompson has not always been \nsuccessful in his efforts. At times, his has been a lonely voice and a \nlonely vote against popular measures that went against his sense of \nfederalism and his concern that the National Government was encroaching \nupon the rights of the States. Even when I opposed him on some of these \nissues, I admired the strength of his convictions.\n  I will miss him and his courage, and so will the people of Tennessee. \nIn 1996, the people of Tennessee cast more votes for him than for any \nprevious candidate for any office in the history of the State. Now how \nabout that? That is pretty remarkable.\n  In addition to his many legislative accomplishments, perhaps the \nreason Senator Thompson seems to have been with us for a longer period \nof time than is reflected by his actual years as Senator is that he is \nso associated in the public mind with politics.\n\n  In 1973, when I was the majority whip in the Senate, Fred Thompson \nserved as minority counsel on the Senate Select Committee on \nPresidential Campaign Activities, known as the Watergate Committee. He \nwas a very effective staff person. I can remember his work.\n  Many people have also seen him on the silver screen portraying a CIA \nchief, an FBI Director, a White House Chief of Staff. I am not about to \nask which of these roles best prepared him for his real-life role as a \nSenator.\n  This has truly been a remarkable career for the son of a used car \nsalesman who worked his way through law school while raising a family. \nI applaud Fred Thompson, and I congratulate him. We will miss Senator \nThompson.\n  I have watched him during this short time when he has been in the \nSenate. I\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\nhave admired him. I admire his bearing, his manner of talking, moving \nabout the Senate and doing his work. He is not a show horse here in the \nSenate, but he has been a workhorse. I do not know of any enemies he \nhas made in this Senate on either side of the aisle.\n  We will miss him. I understand he will be resuming an acting career. \nI can only say that the Senate's loss is Hollywood's gain. All of us \nlook forward to seeing him as he resumes his earlier career as a fine \nactor. I do not watch TV much, and I have not been to a movie in the 50 \nyears I have been in Congress. I have not been to a movie, not one. I \nhave watched some good movies on television. Alistair Cooke, for \nexample, used to have good movies. If I know Fred Thompson is going to \nplay, I will make a point to go and see him.\n\n\n                    Retirement Of Senator Phil Gramm\n\n  Mr. President, seldom in all my years in the Senate have I \nencountered a Senator for whom my feelings and attitudes have covered \nsuch a wide spectrum as they have for Senator Phil Gramm. They have \nranged from intense opposition, as they did in our battles over the \nGramm-Rudman legislation, to close cooperation as we worked together \nduring his 6 years on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Always prepared, always thoughtful, he was always ready to speak on \nany subject at the drop of a hat. Phil Gramm was always ready to talk \nand, oh, was he ready to talk. I quickly learned he can talk about \nanything, everything, and do so intelligently, and always with a good \nhumor, in the best of good humor.\n  It was during our years together on the Appropriations Committee that \nI learned of his respect for the Senate and its role in our democratic \nRepublic. He once referred to his work in the Senate as doing the \nLord's work. He has often referred to it as doing the Lord's work. I \nliked that. I wish I had said that first.\n  He has also demonstrated an understanding that fundamental power of \nCongress is the power of the purse. For that, I applaud Senator Gramm, \nand I thank him.\n  In addition to our work together on the Appropriations Committee, we \nhave worked together on important national legislation, including the \nhighway reauthorization bill, TEA-21. I saw that he has a remarkable \ntalent for grassroots organizing.\n  I watched him here today as he moved around the Chamber. I knew what \nhe was doing. He was talking with some of these Democratic Senators. I \nknew what he was talking with them about. Someone said: That Senator, \nyou see Senator Gramm, that Democratic Senator will vote against the \namendment by Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lieberman. I knew what he was doing, \nbut I respected that.\n  During a difficult struggle on that highway bill, TEA-21, Phil and I \nmet with representatives from a number of organizations interested in \nhighway construction. I believe my friend from New Mexico was in on \nsome of those meetings.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was opposed.\n  Mr. BYRD. He was opposed. When the Senator from New Mexico is \nopposed, I pay even more attention to him. Anyhow, after each meeting, \nour friends would walk away with plans for spreading the good word in \nfavor of our plan, charged up with a pep talk by Phil Gramm. He also \nhas a talent, a great talent, for negotiating. Even when he wins a \nnegotiation and you have lost everything, he can make you feel like you \nprevailed and he lost everything. Suddenly, on the way home you will \npinch yourself and say, wait a minute, that is not quite the way it \nwas.\n  So this is Phil Gramm, a biting, partisan bulldog one minute, and a \ngentle, cuddly puppy the next. At times, it is difficult to decide if \nyou should jump back in fright or reach out and pet him.\n  He is one of those rare Members of Congress who has had a powerful \nimpact not only upon this institution but on our country and its \npolicies. Just last year, the National Review pointed out that no \nMember of Congress--not Jack Kemp, not Newt Gingrich, not Bob Dole--\nplayed a more decisive role in launching the Reagan agenda.\n  Phil Gramm is perhaps this country's most consistent and strongest \npromoter of smaller taxes and smaller government. The legislation he \nhas authored, sponsored and promoted, from Gramm-Latta to Gramm-Rudman, \nto the Bush tax cuts, give the lie to Emerson's observation that a \n``foolish consistency is the hobgoblin'' of little minds. It is also \nthe hobgoblin of big minds.\n  Phil Gramm definitely has a big mind. I have learned so much from \nhim. I certainly learned a lot about his ``mamma.'' Among other things, \nI learned she receives Social Security, that she carries a gun, and she \nknows how to use it. That is what Phil says.\n  I certainly learned more than I ever wanted to know about Dicky \nFlatt, the hard-working print shop owner in Mexia, TX, and how the \nGovernment keeps taking away his money to spend on someone else.\n  I learned do not mess with Phil Gramm. He has an intellect second to \nnone. He has a tenaciousness and he has a razor tongue second to none. \nBut throughout it all, let me assure my colleagues that my \ndisagreements have never lessened my respect and my admiration for the \nman and Senator. He was always straightforward and fair and always \nsincerely dedicated to the cause he was espousing or supporting, and \nthat no doubt was because his positions on the most important issues \nfacing our Nation were always deeply thought out and heartfelt \nconvictions; not simply political calculations. That is why I came to \nrespect his integrity, his wisdom, and his courage.\n  In his book, ``Profiles in Courage,'' Senator John F. Kennedy wrote:\n\n       Surely in the United States of America, where brother once \n     fought brother, we did not judge a man's bravery under fire \n     by examining the banner under which he fought.\n\n  Senator Gramm and I have fought under different banners, but we have \nalways fought under and for the same flag. Whatever he did, whatever he \nsaid, whatever he promoted, it came from his deep, undeviating love of \nthe United States of America. While he is always ready to tell you what \nis wrong with our country, he will never hesitate to tell you what is \nright with it. We will miss him.\n  There he is. I did not realize that while I was talking about the \nman, he was sitting here listening, but I can say to the Senate that on \nmore than one occasion, Senator Phil Gramm has come to my office on \ndifficult matters, in which I may have had some interest, as in \nmountaintop mining or the highway bill, whatever it was, and in many \ninstances he has proposed a compromise which enabled us to get over a \nmountain, get over a hump, and get on with the business.\n\n  I appreciate the contributions he has made to legislation in this \nbody. I do not know of any Senator who has been a more knowledgeable \nand able legislator. The Senator has exemplified reverence for the \nConstitution, respect for the Senate, and an unbounded love for his \ncountry.\n  While he will no longer be my colleague, Phil Gramm will always be my \nfriend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has 5 minutes. The \nminority retains 2 minutes of time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will have more to say about our \ndeparting colleagues tomorrow, but let me share as well my admiration \nfor our colleague Senator Gramm. He is a hardened legislative \nadversary, but I have a great deal of respect for his ability and the \nmanner with which he conducts himself on the floor. I have fond \nmemories of the many years we have served together.\n  I recall so vividly our first days together riding a bus as freshmen \nCongressman in 1979. So we wish him well. As I said, I will have much \nmore to say about him and about our colleagues tomorrow.\n  I wanted to come to the floor simply to express what I have said on \nseveral occasions. It is with some misgivings that I will cast my vote \ntonight in favor of the creation of this Department. I do so, fearful \nwe have not done the kind of work on this legislation I wish we could \nhave. I do so even though language has been inserted in the bill I \nthink we are going to regret, but I do so recognizing we have to start \nrebuilding our infrastructure, reorganizing our Government, recognizing\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\nmore consequentially the threat that is now posed by terrorism within \nour borders as well as without. I intend to support this legislation \nwith every expectation that this is the first in a long series of steps \nwhich must be taken to better prepare our country and our Government. I \nhave no doubt we will be back next year addressing many of the \nshortcomings we will be incorporating in this legislation tonight.\n  This bill still needs work. This Department needs work. But as much \nwork as it needs, not to have done anything in recognition of the \ntremendous challenges we face as a country is something I could not \naccept either. So I will support it, recognizing as well that it is \ncritical for us to provide the funding--and there is no funding. In \nfact, if I have any regret about what we are doing tonight, it is that \nwe are not passing the requisite resources needed to get started in an \nearnest and successful way. We are going to have to wait until next \nyear. The more we wait, the harder it will be. The more we wait, the \nmore complicated our mission. The more we wait, the more underfunded \nwill be our effort in so many other ways.\n  I regret we are not willing to commit the resources that match the \ninfrastructure we will be authorizing tonight.\n  Finally, let me say there are many people who deserve recognition and \nthanks. I acknowledge especially the leadership of Senator Joe \nLieberman, the chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee. He and \nothers on the committee have done an outstanding job getting us to this \npoint, whether or not you agree with all of the components of the bill. \nI congratulate Senator Thompson as the ranking member. They worked \noftentimes together, and where they could not work together, they \nworked in a way that was not disagreeable.\n  I thank the whole Governmental Affairs Committee for the work they \ndid in getting us to this point over the many months they have been \ninvolved.\n  Let me say I also thank Senator Byrd. He and I may come down on \ndifferent sides tonight, but he has done the Senate and the country a \nreal service. I have admired him for many reasons for many years. But \nhis powerful advocacy of his position, the extraordinary effort he has \nmade to enlighten us, to educate us, to sensitize us, and to ensure \nthat we are fully aware of all of the concerns he has about the \ncreation of this Department is something for which we all ought to \nexpress our deep indebtedness to him. I thank him for what he has done \nin adding to the debate, acknowledging as he has the inevitability of \nour consideration and ultimately the passage of this legislation \ntonight. There are many others, including Senator Harry Reid, our \nextraordinary deputy Democratic leader, all the work he has done to \nallow this opportunity to complete our work tonight.\n\n  As I said, we will be in session tomorrow and we will have much more \nto say about many of these issues, reflecting back, but I close simply \nby thanking our colleagues for the work they have done. I hope we can \ncomplete our work and pass this legislation tonight.\n  I also ask, following the first vote, all subsequent votes be limited \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I could hardly say what I feel in my heart in 2 minutes. \nToo often, as people leave the Senate, they talk about things they are \nunhappy about. I want people to know I am not discouraged; I am not \ndisillusioned; I am not disappointed. I am proud and I am honored. I am \nproud to have had an opportunity to serve the greatest country in the \nhistory of the world. I am proud to have served with extraordinary men \nand women. I think we are so close to them and what they have done here \nthat it is hard to put it all in perspective. But someday when I am \nsitting in a nursing home talking to my grandchildren, I think I will \nhave that perspective right and there will be names such as Senator \nByrd, Senator Domenici, and others that will flow from my lips as men I \nwas honored to know and to love.\n  I thank the people of Texas for giving me an opportunity to serve. I \nconclude by reading a remark by, of all people, Aaron Burr. Senator \nByrd is familiar with it. It is wonderful and I want to conclude by \nreading it. Aaron Burr was leaving the Senate, and he concluded with \nthese remarks:\n\n       . . . this house is a sanctuary and a citadel of law, of \n     order, of liberty--and it is here--it is here--in this \n     exalted--refuge, here, if anywhere will resistance be made to \n     the storms of popular phrenzy and the silent arts of \n     corruption:--And if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue of the \n     Usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.\n\n  I am honored to have served here. I am honored to have served with \nthose who will be sure, in their efforts, in their work, that the \nConstitution never expires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nengrossment of the amendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The substantive law for \n     decision in any such action shall be derived from the law, \n     including choice of law principles, of the State in which \n     such acts of terrorism occurred, unless such law is \n     inconsistent with or preempted by Federal law. Such Federal \n     cause of action shall be brought only for claims for injuries \n     that are proximately caused by sellers that provide qualified \n     anti-terrorism technology to Federal and non-Federal \n     government customers.\n       (2) Jurisdiction.--Such appropriate district court of the \n     United States shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction \n     over all actions for any claim for loss of property, personal \n     injury, or death arising out of, relating to, or resulting \n     from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism \n     technologies have been deployed in defense against or \n     response or recovery from such act and such claims result or \n     may result in loss to the Seller.\n       (b) Special Rules.--In an action brought under this section \n     for damages the following provisions apply:\n       (1) Punitive damages.--No punitive damages intended to \n     punish or deter, exemplary damages, or other damages not \n     intended to compensate a plaintiff for actual losses may be \n     awarded, nor shall any party be liable for interest prior to \n     the judgment.\n       (2) Noneconomic damages.--\n       (A) In general.--Noneconomic damages may be awarded against \n     a defendant only in an amount directly proportional to the \n     percentage of responsibility of such defendant for the harm \n     to the plaintiff, and no plaintiff may recover noneconomic \n     damages unless the plaintiff suffered physical harm.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term \n     ``noneconomic damages'' means damages for losses for physical \n     and emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical \n     impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, loss of enjoyment \n     of life, loss of society and companionship, loss of \n     consortium, hedonic damages, injury to reputation, and any \n     other nonpecuniary losses.\n       (c) Collateral Sources.--Any recovery by a plaintiff in an \n     action under this section shall be reduced by the amount of \n     collateral source compensation, if any, that the plaintiff \n     has received or is entitled to receive as a result of such \n     acts of terrorism that result or may result in loss to the \n     Seller.\n       (d) Government Contractor Defense.--\n       (1) In general.--Should a product liability or other \n     lawsuit be filed for claims arising out of, relating to, or \n     resulting from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-\n     terrorism technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided \n     in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, have been \n     deployed in defense against or response or recovery from such \n     act and such claims result or may result in loss to the \n     Seller, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the \n     government contractor defense applies in such lawsuit. This \n     presumption shall only be overcome by evidence showing that \n     the Seller acted fraudulently or with willful misconduct in \n     submitting information to the Secretary during the course of \n     the Secretary's consideration of such technology under this \n     subsection. This presumption of the government contractor \n     defense shall apply regardless of whether the claim against \n     the Seller arises from a sale of the product to Federal \n     Government or non-Federal Government customers.\n       (2) Exclusive responsibility.--The Secretary will be \n     exclusively responsible for the review and approval of anti-\n     terrorism technology for purposes of establishing a \n     government contractor defense in any product liability \n     lawsuit for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting \n     from an act of terrorism when qualified anti-terrorism \n     technologies approved by the Secretary, as provided in this \n     paragraph and paragraph (3), have been deployed in defense \n     against or response or recovery from such act and such claims \n     result or may result in loss to the Seller. Upon the Seller's \n     submission to the Secretary for approval of anti-terrorism \n     technology, the Secretary will conduct a comprehensive review \n     of the design of such technology and determine whether it \n     will perform as intended, conforms to the Seller's \n     specifications, and is safe for use as intended. The Seller \n     will conduct safety and hazard analyses on such technology \n     and will supply the Secretary with all such information.\n       (3) Certificate.--For anti-terrorism technology reviewed \n     and approved by the Secretary, the Secretary will issue a \n     certificate of conformance to the Seller and place the anti-\n     terrorism technology on an Approved Product List for Homeland \n     Security.\n       (e) Exclusion.--Nothing in this section shall in any way \n     limit the ability of any person to seek any form of recovery \n     from any person, government, or other entity that--\n       (1) attempts to commit, knowingly participates in, aids and \n     abets, or commits any act of terrorism, or any criminal act \n     related to or resulting from such act of terrorism; or\n       (2) participates in a conspiracy to commit any such act of \n     terrorism or any such criminal act.\n\n     SEC. 864.

FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER.\n\n       (a) In General.--The transfer of an authority or an agency \n     under this Act to the Department of Homeland Security does \n     not affect training agreements already entered into with the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center with respect to the \n     training of personnel to carry out that authority or the \n     duties of that transferred agency.\n       (b) Continuity of Operations.--All activities of the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center transferred to the \n     Department of Homeland Security under this Act shall continue \n     to be carried out at the locations such activities were \n     carried out before such transfer.\n\n     SEC. 885.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING THE CONTINUED \n                   IMPORTANCE AND APPLICABILITY OF THE POSSE \n                   COMITATUS ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Section 1385 of title 18, United States Code (commonly \n     known as the ``Posse Comitatus Act''), prohibits the use of \n     the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus to execute the laws \n     except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized \n     by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\n       (2) Enacted in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was expressly \n     intended to prevent United States Marshals, on their own \n     initiative, from calling on the Army for assistance in \n     enforcing Federal law.\n       (3) The Posse Comitatus Act has served the Nation well in \n     limiting the use of the Armed Forces to enforce the law.\n       (4) Nevertheless, by its express terms, the Posse Comitatus \n     Act is not a complete barrier to the use of the Armed Forces \n     for a range of domestic purposes, including law enforcement \n     functions, when the use of the Armed Forces is authorized by \n     Act of Congress or the President determines that the use of \n     the Armed Forces is required to fulfill the President's \n     obligations under the Constitution to respond promptly in \n     time of war, insurrection, or other serious emergency.\n       (5) Existing laws, including chapter 15 of title 10, United \n     States Code (commonly known as the ``Insurrection Act''), and \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.), grant the President \n     broad powers that may be invoked in the event\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\n     of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the \n     Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws \n     specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces \n     to help restore public order.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress reaffirms the continued \n     importance of section 1385 of title 18, United States Code, \n     and it is the sense of Congress that nothing in this Act \n     should be construed to alter the applicability of such \n     section to any use of the Armed Forces as a posse comitatus \n     to execute the laws.\n\n     SEC. 887.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the \n     ``Homeland Security Information Sharing Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution \n     to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist \n     attack.\n       (2) The Federal Government relies on State and local \n     personnel to protect against terrorist attack.\n\n[[Page S11494]]\n\n       (3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and \n     protects classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information to enhance homeland security.\n       (4) Some homeland security information is needed by the \n     State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for \n     terrorist attack.\n       (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access \n     to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism \n     must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected \n     status of such information and to protect the sources and \n     methods used to acquire such information.\n       (6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local \n     personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information \n     regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, \n     and local levels of government.\n       (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt \n     classified information so it may be shared with State and \n     local personnel without the need for granting additional \n     security clearances.\n       (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and \n     opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities \n     and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.\n       (9) The Federal Government and State and local governments \n     and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such \n     information.\n       (10) Federal, State, and local governments and \n     intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency \n     preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to \n     maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis \n     to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\n       (11) Information systems, including the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist \n     Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid \n     sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information among Federal, State, and local entities.\n       (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security \n     information should avoid duplicating existing information \n     systems.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland \n     security information to the maximum extent practicable, with \n     special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural \n     communities.\n\n     SEC. 892. FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SHARING \n                   PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Procedures for Determining Extent of Sharing of \n     Homeland Security Information.--\n       (1) The President shall prescribe and implement procedures \n     under which relevant Federal agencies--\n       (A) share relevant and appropriate homeland security \n     information with other Federal agencies, including the \n     Department, and appropriate State and local personnel;\n       (B) identify and safeguard homeland security information \n     that is sensitive but unclassified; and\n       (C) to the extent such information is in classified form, \n     determine whether, how, and to what extent to remove \n     classified information, as appropriate, and with which such \n     personnel it may be shared after such information is removed.\n       (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply \n     to all agencies of the Federal Government.\n       (3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive \n     requirements for the classification and safeguarding of \n     classified information.\n       (4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and \n     authorities to protect sources and methods.\n       (b) Procedures for Sharing of Homeland Security \n     Information.--\n       (1) Under procedures prescribed by the President, all \n     appropriate agencies, including the intelligence community, \n     shall, through information sharing systems, share homeland \n     security information with Federal agencies and appropriate \n     State and local personnel to the extent such information may \n     be shared, as determined in accordance with subsection (a), \n     together with assessments of the credibility of such \n     information.\n       (2) Each information sharing system through which \n     information is shared under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or \n     classified information, though the procedures and recipients \n     for each capability may differ;\n       (B) have the capability to restrict delivery of information \n     to specified subgroups by geographic location, type of \n     organization, position of a recipient within an organization, \n     or a recipient's need to know such information;\n       (C) be configured to allow the efficient and effective \n     sharing of information;

SHEDD, OF SOUTH CAROLINA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to vote on the Shedd nomination.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the \nvotes from here on out will be 10 minutes in length. And I intend to \ncut off the votes at 10 minutes. I hope everybody will stay on the \nfloor and cast their votes so we can complete our work at a reasonable \nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Dennis W. \nShedd, of South Carolina, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFourth Circuit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the confirmation of Judge Shedd \nto the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His nomination is also \nopposed by a large number of individuals, law professors, bar \nassociation and civil rights groups across the country, because he has \nnot shown the commitment to the protection and vindication of Federal \nrights that is essential for this high position in the judiciary.\n  Judge Shedd has an unacceptable record in cases involving race and \ngender discrimination. In race discrimination cases, for example, he \nconsistently grants summary judgment against African-American civil \nrights plaintiffs, preventing even close cases from reaching a jury, \nand he often does so with little or analysis. In one case, he granted \nsummary judgment for the defendant after the EEOC determined there was \na reasonable cause to find that the plaintiff was denied promotion and \nthe denial was based on race. In another case, the plaintiff was denied \na pay increase despite the recommendation of his immediate supervisor, \nwhere the employer was found by the State to have been discriminating \nagainst African-Americans on pay increases.\n  Judge Shedd has a similar record in gender discrimination cases. He \ngranted summary judgment for an employer in a sexual harassment case in \nwhich the male supervisor's conduct was so inappropriate that Judge \nShedd himself stated that the supervisor's conduct was ``sufficiently \nsevere and pervasive to constituent a hostile work environment.'' \nNonetheless, Judge Shedd granted summary judgment for the employer, \nfinding no evidence that the plaintiff herself thought the work \nenvironment had been hostile. This ruling is impossible to reconcile \nwith the facts of the case--the plaintiff had told her supervisor that \nhis comments were offensive, she had reported the conduct to her \nsupervisor, she had taken concrete steps to pursue the complaint, and \nshe eventually quit her position.\n  In another case, Judge Shedd reversed a magistrate judge's decision \nto deny summary judgment for an employer. In this case, the plaintiff's \nsupervisor had harassed both the plaintiff and a number of other female \nemployees. Yet Judge Shedd dismissed this case, against the \nrecommendation of the magistrate, because the plaintiff had complained \nto two different people, a supervisor and the company's chief financial \nofficer, but did not complain to the president of the company, as \nrequired by company policy. Judge Shedd ignored the fact that the \ncompany's policy also called for the supervisor and the CFO themselves \nto report the plaintiff's complaints to the president, which they \nfailed to do. Judge Shedd also relied on the fact that the plaintiff's \ncomplaint referred to ``harassment,'' instead of ``sexual harassment.''\n  These were not merely cases in which Judge Shedd ultimately decided \non the facts that discrimination had not taken place. These are cases \nin which he determined that the jury should not even be permitted to \nhear the plaintiff's claim. Judge Shedd dismissed the vast majority of \nrace discrimination cases brought by African-Americans, before those \ncases could reach the jury. By contrast, in the five discrimination \ncases brought by white males, Judge Shedd allowed four to go to a \ntrial. This pattern is very disturbing. The people of the Fourth \nCircuit deserve better from their Federal judges.\n  In addition, Judge Shedd has often reached out from the bench to \naffect the litigation of the cases before him. In discrimination cases, \nhe is known to raise arguments on behalf of the defense from the bench, \neven arguments not raised by the defendants themselves. He has gone so \nfar as to dismiss cases on grounds not raised by the defendant. In one \ncase, he initiated an inquiry into finances of an unemployed woman who \nhad been granted pauper status by another Federal judge; Judge Shedd \nruled that she did not deserve such status, in large part because of \nthe money she had spent pursuing her claim, and recommended that the \nFourth Circuit dismiss an appeal the woman had pending in a different \nsuit. He published his conclusions, he said, because other judges may \nwant to know of his personal findings shout this woman.\n  The States of the Fourth Circuit have a large minority population, \nthe highest percentage of African-Africans of any circuit in the \ncountry, and they deserve a fair judiciary, committed to protecting \nbasic rights.\n  For all of these reasons, I oppose this nomination. the \nadministration can, and must, do better for the people of the Fourth \nCircuit.\n\n\n                      u.s. circuit court nominees\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nconfirmation of Judge Dennis Shedd to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit, and the confirmation of Professor \nMichael McConnell to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth \nCircuit.\n  At every level of the Federal court system, federal judges have a \ntremendous impact on the rights and protections of all Americans. The \nfederal judiciary effectively ended segregation and ensured a woman's \nright to reproductive choice. Every day we count on federal judges to \nprotect our civil rights and liberties.\n  The Senate serves as the only effective check on the Federal \njudiciary. The Constitution gives the Senate the power to advise and \nconsent to the President's judicial appointments. These are lifetime \nappointments. Furthermore, because the U.S. Supreme Court hears only a \nfew cases, the Circuit Courts of Appeals are often the courts of last \nresort for citizens seeking justice from the federal bench. As \nSenators, we have a constitutional responsibility to evaluate these \ncandidates.\n  I believe judicial candidates should be experienced, even-handed, \npossess a fair judicial temperament, and be committed to upholding the \nrights and liberties of all Americans.\n  Dennis Shedd does not meet that standard. He has failed to show this \nSenator that he possesses the characteristics necessary to receive a \nlifetime appointment to the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  As a Federal District Court Judge, Shedd's rulings and actions on the \nbench indicate he lacks the even-handedness we expect from our federal \njudges. He has consistently sided with employers in workplace \ndiscrimination suits on issues ranging from sexual harassment to race \nand age discrimination. In fact, in his 11 years on the Federal bench \nnot a single plaintiff in a civil rights or employment discrimination \ncase has prevailed in his courtroom.\n  His willingness to inject his own personal bias about the rights of \nindividuals shows he also lacks the requisite judicial temperament we \nshould require in a Federal judge. He has shown hostility to those \nseeking justice from the bench by assisting the defense and granting \nsummary judgment for the defense in a disproportionate number of cases.\n  Aside from employee rights and discrimination cases, he has also \nshown an unwillingness to uphold the basic civil liberties and rights \nof all Americans. He has favored a state government's ability to \nviolate an individual's right of privacy by selling their personal \ninformation despite a federal law to the contrary. He also struck down \npart of the Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, by arguing a State \ncannot be sued under FMLA due to sovereign immunity.\n  He has further shown a disregard for protecting the rights of voters, \nand has displayed an insensitivity on issues concerning race.\n  Considering his history of narrowly interpreting the rights of \nindividuals\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\nand his hostility toward civil liberty protections, we can only assume \nhe would not uphold the civil liberty of privacy, including honoring \nthe Roe v. Wade decision. In fact, at his confirmation hearing he \nrefused to commit to upholding the fundamental right of reproductive \nfreedom.\n  Dennis Shedd's record clearly illustrates he is not even-handed, that \nhe lacks the right temperament for the appeals bench, and that he has \nconsistently failed to protect the rights and liberties of our people. \nHe should not be confirmed for the Federal appeals court. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this nomination.\n  I would also like to express my opposition to Professor Michael \nMcConnell's recent confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit.\n  Professor McConnell has consistently expressed strong opposition to \nprotecting civil rights and liberties, going so far as to call the Roe \ncase ``a gross misinterpretation of the Constitution.'' He has also \nargued, contrary to existing law, that abortion protestors have a \n``constitutional right to protect against abortion--forcefully and \nface-to-face.''\n  He holds extreme opinions on the separation of church and state and \nother key civil rights protections. Professor McConnell has severely \ncriticized the Supreme Court's 8 to 1 decision in Bob Jones University \nv. United States. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the IRS may \ndeny tax-exempt status to a religious school with racially \ndiscriminatory policies. Professor McConnell wrote that the racial \ndiscriminatory practices at Bob Jones University should be tolerated \nbecause they were religious in nature. He has also argued for giving \nreligious institutions preferential treatment and has advocated direct \nfederal funding of religious institutions. Clearly, Professor \nMcConnell's opinion on the separation of church and state strays far \nfrom the mainstream and far from generally recognized conservative \nlegal analysis.\n  Finally, Professor McConnell has argued for weakening both statutory \nand constitutional protections against discrimination based on race, \ngender, and sexual orientation through exemptions for private entities.\n  Like Judge Shedd, I believe Professor McConnell lacks the basic \nqualities needed to serve on the Federal appellate bench.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote against the confirmation of \nDennis Shedd to be a United States Judge for the 4th Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Judge Shedd's record as a judge on the United States District \nCourt raises a number of concerns about both his approach on the bench \nand his commitment to equal justice--leading me to the conclusion that \nhe should not be promoted to the second highest court in the land.\n  Of particular concern to me are Judge Shedd's extreme view on the \nlimits of Congressional authority and his record of hostility to \nplaintiffs in civil rights and employment discrimination cases. This \ncombination is extremely dangerous given the critical role that \nCongress plays in passing laws to ensure that Constitutional \nprotections are afforded to all Americans. Further, I am troubled by \nwhat appears to be a lack of thorough consideration in Judge Shedd's \napproach. This is particularly unsettling given the significant \nConstitutional issues that have been at stake in his courtroom.\n  With respect to Judge Shedd's view of the Constitutional role of the \nCongress, two cases stand out, Condon v. Reno and Crosby v. South \nCarolina.\n  I voted for, and Congress enacted, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act \nin 1994 to limit the availability of personal information--such as \nphotographs, social security numbers, addresses and telephone numbers, \nand even some medical information--contained in motor vehicle records. \nIn Condon v. Reno, the state of South Carolina challenged the law, \nclaiming that it was an unconstitutional infringement on the state's \nrights because it restricted South Carolina from setting its own \nstandards for releasing State motor vehicle records. In Condon v. Reno, \nJudge Shedd ruled that the law was unconstitutional and in the process \nendorsed a view that--if permitted to stand--would have severely \nlimited Congress ability to legislate under the Commerce clause of the \nConstitution. Judge Shedd's decision endorsed a view of congressional \nauthority so far out of the mainstream that the Supreme Court ruled \nunanimously to overturn him in a decision written by Chief Justice \nRehnquist.\n  Judge Shedd's decision in Crosby v. South Carolina Department of \nHealth and Environmental Control also deeply troubles me. In Crosby, \nJudge Shedd adopted a magistrate's recommendation granting defendant's \nsummary judgement--agreeing with the magistrate that the 11th Amendment \ndoctrine of state sovereign immunity should prevent the plaintiff from \nsuing the state for violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act \nbecause he believed that Act was an improper exercise of Congress's \nenforcement power under the 14th amendment. Despite the obvious and \nprofound implications of this decision for Congress's authority, Judge \nShedd offered virtually no analysis to support his decision. This is \ndespite the absence of directly controlling precedent and the presence \nof a split among other Federal district courts on the issue. Acts of \nCongress are entitled to a presumption of Constitutionality. Ruling to \noverturn a Federal law should not be taken lightly. In a case of this \nimport, Judge Shedd's failure to articulate a rationale for his \ndecision is deeply disturbing. The fact that other judges may have \nreached the same conclusion as Judge Shedd is not the point here. \nParties before the court on an issues of this magnitude are entitled to \na judge's reasoning. Judge Shedd offered none.\n\n  The Crosby decision is not the only example of Judge Shedd's tendency \nto accept magistrate recommendations with little or no comment on \nimportant matters. In South Carolina, all cases under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 are automatically referred to magistrates for \npretrial matters. In important employment discrimination cases, Judge \nShedd has often adopted magistrates' recommendations in favor of \nsummary judgement. And he has done so without comment in many instances \nwhere it appears to me that comment was warranted. In fact, Judge Shedd \nhas done so in cases where a party has raised an objection to one of \nthe magistrate's recommendations and he was required to conduct a de \nnovo review. In a number of these cases, Judge Shedd's rulings do not \naddress the objections at all. Instead, his decisions simply adopt the \nmagistrate's recommendations and pay lip service to his obligation by \nincluding a statement that he has conducted the required de novo \nreview. Given the concerns I have about this approach in the Crosby \ncase, this practice deeply concerns me.\n  Mr. President, nothing is more important for a judge than a \ncommitment to equal justice. A review of Judge Shedd's record also \nraises the question whether this ideal is being upheld.\n  In a number of civil rights cases, Judge Shedd appears to have \nintervened in a manner that has tilted toward defendants. He has \ngranted summary judgement for defendants on grounds not even raised by \nthe defendants. He has ordered a defendant to file a motion to dismiss \na case and later granted the motion. And Judge Shedd even granted \nsummary judgment against a petitioner even though it appears that the \ndefendant never filed a motion for summary judgement. These decisions \nraise serious questions about whether plaintiffs are getting a fair \nhearing in Judge Shedd's courtroom.\n  I was particularly struck by the Judge's answer to a question from \nSenator Edwards in his Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this year. \nSenator Edwards asked Judge Shedd whether he had ever granted relief to \na plaintiff in an employment discrimination case. Judge Shedd could not \nrecall a single instance where a plaintiff alleging employment \ndiscrimination was granted relief in his courtroom. Judge Shedd's \ninability to recall such a case is actually not surprising as a review \nof his published opinions failed to reveal even one such instance. \nEleven years on the bench and not one of his published opinions \nreflects a favorable ruling for an employee in a discrimination case.\n  Mr. President, I'm afraid Judge Shedd's record simply does not \nsupport his promotion to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition \nto\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\nthe nomination of Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nAlthough the President has pledged to nominate qualified individuals \nwith outstanding judicial records to the Federal Court System, he has, \ntime and time again, failed to make good on that pledge. Judge Shedd is \nno exception. During his tenure as a trial judge, Judge Shedd has \nexhibited extreme, even radical views on an array of important issues. \nJudge Shedd's record demonstrates that in cases involving civil rights, \nprivacy, discrimination and federalism, he is willing to cross the \nboundaries of established case law and rule in a manner that is out of \ntouch with mainstream thinking.\n  A few cases in particular merit the attention of this body. In a case \ndemonstrating Judge Shedd's extreme stance on federalism, he struck \ndown as unconstitutional the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which we \npassed to ensure that states keep drivers' license information \nconfidential. This legislation, designed as ``antistalking'' \nlegislation, was drafted in part because antiabortion activists have \nused accessible drivers' license information to obtain the addresses of \ndoctors who performed abortions in order to post that information on \nwebsites. Mr. President, this case was reversed unanimously by the \nSupreme Court, with Chief Justice Rehnquist authoring the opinion.\n  Judge Shedd also has a record of condoning serious civil liberties \nviolations by law enforcement. In one particularly disturbing case, \nJudge Shedd dismissed a lawsuit brought against a corrections officer \nwho had stripped an inmate naked and left him without bedding for 48 \nhours after the inmate confessed to not knowing the prison's rules \nconcerning lights out. In dismissing the case, Judge Shedd merely \nstated that he did not think the inmate had been punished. In another \ninstance, he imposed an inconsequential $250 fine in a case where a \nsheriff and a prosecutor secretly videotaped a jailhouse conversation \nbetween a defendant and his lawyer. Judge Shedd defended the penalty \nstating that he did not think the pair committed any civil rights \nviolation. I am deeply troubled that we might appoint a judge who does \nnot recognize the blatant civil rights violation in this circumstance.\n  Perhaps most troubling is Judge Shedd's overwhelming tendency to \ngrant summary judgement against plaintiffs in race and gender \nemployment discrimination cases, preventing the vast majority of such \ncases from going to trial. In a case involving sexual harassment in the \nworkplace, Judge Shedd reversed the recommendation of a magistrate that \nthe plaintiff be allowed to present her case to a jury, granting \nsummary judgment for the employer even though Judge Shedd himself \nconcluded that the supervisor's conduct ``clearly was, from an \nobjective standpoint, sufficiently severe and pervasive to constitute a \nhostile work environment.'' He relied, therefore, on a tortured \ninterpretation of both the facts and the law to rule against the \nplaintiff in that case. This is one of many instances that demonstrate \na clear pattern in which Judge Shedd has prevented cases brought by \npeople of color and women from ever reaching a jury.\n  We routinely put aside our partisan differences to send qualified men \nand women to the federal bench because it is in the best interests of \nour country to fill seats with those individuals who have pledged to \ninterpret the law objectively and without bias, whether or not they \nhappen to be liberal or conservative in temperament. We place a great \ndeal of trust in these men and women, as their appointments are \nguaranteed for life. Unfortunately, based on the records and statements \nI have reviewed, I do not believe we can place our trust in Judge Shedd \nto protect the civil liberties Americans of all races and beliefs have \nfought so hard to win. It is because of this that I will vote against \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, every judicial nomination that comes \nbefore this body is critically important. However, I take a particular \ninterest in appointments to the Fourth Circuit, which includes my home \nState of North Carolina. The Fourth Circuit needs qualified, fair-\nminded judges who will put aside their personal views and follow the \nlaw. After reviewing his record carefully, I have concluded that Judge \nDennis Shedd is not such a judge.\n  While Judge Shedd's record provides numerous reasons to oppose his \nconfirmation, I am most troubled by his poor record on civil rights, \nwhere he has demonstrated an alarming propensity for putting his \npersonal views above the law. Judge Shedd has repeatedly overstepped \nthe bounds of judicial restraint and engaged in judicial activism on \nbehalf of defendants in discrimination cases.\n  I raised this concern with Judge Shedd earlier this year during his \nconfirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Judge Shedd could \nnot point to one instance in his eleven years on the bench in which an \nindividual alleging discrimination--based on race, sex, age or \ndisability--has ever won a case in his court. In the same period, there \nhave been over 20 verdicts in favor of plaintiffs in other Federal \ncourts in the State. In written questions, I asked Judge Shedd to say \nwhether a victim of employment discrimination had ever prevailed in his \ncourtroom. He could name no such case.\n  On the other hand, there is considerable and disturbing evidence of \nJudge Shedd's conduct in civil rights cases to benefit the defendant. \nTo name only one example: in a sexual harassment matter, Judge Shedd \noverruled a magistrate's ruling allowing a case to go to trial, even \nthough the plaintiff had offered sworn evidence that her supervisor had \ncommented on her breasts, asked her graphic sexual questions, bought \nher panty-less pantyhose, and frequently stood behind her, rubbed her \nshoulders while trying to look down her shirt, and so on.\n  Finally, in a major case involving the Federal Government's power to \nprotect the privacy of individuals' personal records, Judge Shedd sided \nagainst individual rights, and was reversed by a unanimous Supreme \nCourt. There is no other case since 1995 in which a lower court has \nlimited Congress's power and the Supreme Court has reversed.\n  Federal judges have no responsibility more important than enforcing \nour laws equally. Because Judge Shedd has proven his willingness to put \nhis personal views above the law, especially in civil rights cases, I \nmust vote against his confirmation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from a group of 16 \nNorth Carolina law professors addressing these and several other of \nJudge Shedd's decisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. John R. Edwards,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Edwards: We are writing to you--as individual \n     members of the faculties of the School of Law of the \n     University of North Carolina, Duke Law School, and North \n     Carolina Central University School of Law--concerned that the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee may be poised to act without \n     conducting a full investigation of President Bush's recent \n     nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \n     Circuit, United States District Judge Dennis W. Shedd. We \n     suggest that to act precipitously on this important \n     nomination would be a serious mistake.\n       As you know, the Fourth Circuit is one of the region's most \n     influential governmental bodies; its impact on \n     constitutional, statutory, and regulatory issues in the \n     Southeast has no equal apart from the Supreme Court itself. \n     Moreover, a wide range of responsible observers concur that \n     during the past decade the Fourth Circuit has become the most \n     activist federal court in the nation. In certain crucial \n     areas, including federal judicial efforts to confine Congress \n     in the exercise of its traditionally broad national powers, \n     the Fourth Circuit has no peer. It has led the way in \n     attempting to narrow the Congress's Commerce Clause powers, \n     see, e.g., Condon v. Reno, 155 F.3d 453 (4th Cir. 1998), \n     rev'd, 528 U.S. 141 (2000) (challenging Congress's authority \n     under the Commerce Clause to enact the Driver's Privacy \n     Protection Act); Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Inst., 169 \n     F.3d 820 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc), aff'd United States v. \n     Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000) (challenging Congress's \n     authority under the Commerce Clause to enact the Violence \n     Against Women Act), its Section 5 powers under the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, see, e.g., Brzonkala, 169 F.3d 820 (4th Cir. 1999) \n     (en banc) (challenging Congress's authority under Section 5), \n     and in promulgating aggressive conceptions of the Tenth and \n     Eleventh Amendments. See South Carolina State Ports Authority \n     v. Federal Maritime Comm'n 243 F.3d 165 (4th Cir. 2001), \n     aff'd 122 S. Ct. 1864 (2002) (invalidating the FMC's \n     authority over state port entities, previously \n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\n     granted by Congress under the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1701 et seq., on Eleventh Amendment \n     grounds).\n       As a federal district judge during the past eleven years, \n     Judge Shedd has been a sympathetic participant in this \n     judicial campaign to disempower Congress. He authored the \n     original decision in Condon v. Reno, 972 F. Supp. 977 (D. \n     S.C. 1997), and struck down the Driver's Privacy Protection \n     Act of 1994, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2721-25, a decision later \n     overturned in a 9-to-0 decision of the Supreme Court authored \n     by Chief Justice Rehnquist. Judge Shedd also acted to \n     invalidate the application of the Family and Medical Leave \n     Act to state agencies, holding that ``Congress did not \n     properly enact the FMLA under Sec. 5 of the fourteenth \n     amendment, and therefore, has not abrogated [the State \n     defendant's] eleventh amendment immunity from suit.'' Crosby \n     v. South Carolina Dep't of Health & Environmental Control, \n     C.A. No. 3-97-3588119BD, at 1 (D. S.C. Oct. 14, 1999).\n       Were Judge Shedd's highly protective views of state \n     sovereignty, his skepticism about Congressional power, and \n     his aggressive use of judicial authority the only issues \n     presented by his nomination, they would suffice to require \n     careful Senate consideration. However, we are concerned by \n     three other features of his record: (1) an apparent \n     skepticism of federal civil rights claims; (2) a marked \n     sympathy for employers in employment disputes; and (3) an \n     unusually vigorous use of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules (the \n     summary judgment provision) and similar procedural provisions \n     to wrest lawsuits from trial juries and end them by judicial \n     fiat.\n       We are not prepared to say, at this point, that Judge Shedd \n     has acted with bias in these areas, since so many of his \n     decisions are unreported (and we have not been able to review \n     the briefs in these cases) and since an unusual number of his \n     reported decisions are merely brief orders that accept and \n     adopt relatively summary reports from United States \n     Magistrates. However, in some sixty-six cases that presently \n     appear in the LEXIS online system, we note the following \n     patterns. Judge Shedd appears never to have granted relief to \n     a plaintiff in an employment discrimination case, although he \n     has granted numerous summary judgment motions in favor of \n     employers. See, e.g., Roberts v. Defender Services, Inc., \n     C.A. No. 0:00-1536-19BC (D.S.C., Sept 27, 2001) (rejecting a \n     female employee's sexual harassment and hostile work \n     environment claims); Austin v. FN Manufacturing, Inc., C.A. \n     No. 3:98-3605-19BC (D.S.C., March 23, 2000) (rejecting an \n     African American employee's racial discrimination, hostile \n     environment, and constructive discharge claims); Taylor v. \n     Cummings Atlantic, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 1279 (D.S.C. 1994) \n     (rejecting an older employee's age discrimination, fraud, and \n     breach of contract claims); (Bailey v. South Carolina Dep't \n     of Social Services, 851 F. Supp. 219 (D.S.C. 1993) (rejecting \n     an African American employee's non-promotion claim, although \n     backed by EEOC Determination of reasonable cause that \n     plaintiff was not promoted because of his race); White v. \n     Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., 807 F. Supp. 1212 \n     (D.S.C. 1992) (rejecting an employee's breach of contract and \n     promissory estoppel claims).\n       In the Roberts case, for example, Judge Shedd granted \n     summary judgment to an employer in a sexual harassment \n     lawsuit, even after he noted that ``the alleged conduct [of \n     Ms. Robert's supervisor] clearly was, from an objective \n     standpoint, sufficiently severe and pervasive to constitute a \n     hostile and abusive work environment.'' Roberts, supra, at 2. \n     Judge Shedd concluded, nonetheless, that plaintiff Rogers \n     raised no genuine issue of fact about whether she herself \n     ``subjectively perceived the environment to be abusive,'' \n     id., although it was undisputed that she had joined in making \n     a formal complaint about her supervisor's abusive behavior to \n     corporate headquarters, and then met with a corporate \n     investigator to detail and protest the supervisor's sexually \n     suggestive behavior.\n       We have also obtained a list of unpublished fifty-three \n     federal race, gender, age, and disability cases in which \n     Judge Shedd has dealt with cases on summary judgment. In \n     most, he has granted defendants' motions and dismissed the \n     cases, denying all relief to the plaintiffs. Since these \n     cases are not reported, we have not yet been able to review \n     them to discern whether they manifest bias, but the overall \n     anti-plaintiff pattern is troubling.\n       The tendency by Judge Shedd to resolve cases on his own, \n     short of trial, is also manifest in his use of Rule 56 \n     summary judgment in other, non-employment contexts, see, \n     e.g., Alston v. Ruston, C.A. No.: 9-99-244-19RB, 2000 U.S. \n     Dist. LEXIS 11939 (D.S.C. March 9, 2000) (prisoner's Section \n     1983 and Eighth Amendment claim); Joye v. Richland County \n     Sheriff's Dep't, 47 F. Supp. 2d 663 (D.S.C. 1999) (Section \n     1983 and Fourth Amendment, false arrest claim); Cianbro Corp. \n     v. Jeffcoat & Martin, 804 F. Supp. 784 (D.S.C. 1992) \n     (attorney malpractice action), and by the use of other \n     procedural devices, such as Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, \n     see, e.g., Gray v. Petoseed Co., 985 F. Supp. 625 (D.S.C. \n     1996) (fraud in sale of contaminated watermelon seeds), as \n     well as by use of Rule 50 motions to grant judgment \n     notwithstanding the verdict, see, e.g., Storms v. Goodyear \n     Tire & Rubber Co., 775 F. Supp. 862 (D.S.C. 1991) (wrongful \n     discharge and breach of implied contract); Wilds v. Slater, \n     C.A. No. 3:97-1608-19BD, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20771 (D.S.C. \n     March 7, 2000) (National Environmental Policy Act action for \n     failure to file environmental impact statement).\n       In Alston, for example, Judge Shedd granted summary \n     judgment on a Section 1983 complaint after somehow \n     concluding, as a matter of law, that a prison guard had not \n     used excessive force--despite an affidavit and a well-pleaded \n     complaint from the plaintiff alleging that the officer had \n     sprayed him in the face with tear gas without justification, \n     advanced toward him ``swinging his fists and punching \n     [plaintiff] in the mouth,'' and wielded a broomstick until \n     other officers intervened. We do not, of course, know whether \n     the plaintiff's version of these facts is correct or, \n     instead, whether the correctional officer's version should be \n     credited; we do believe it is impossible fairly to conclude \n     that the conflicting evidence of record about what happened \n     that evening raised no ``genuine issue of material fact.''\n       In another such case, Joye v. Richland Co. Sheriff's Dep't, \n     Judge Shedd dismissed a Section 1983 claim brought by a \n     person wrongfully arrested by sheriff's deputies under a \n     bench warrant issued for his son. Despite the fact that \n     the arrest warrant described a man aged 31, standing \n     5'11'' (while the plaintiff was 61 years old and stood \n     only 5'8''), despite plaintiff's allegations that the \n     arresting officers ``refused to inform him of the basis \n     for his arrest or provide him with a copy of the \n     warrant,'' despite the fact that ``the warrant . . . \n     listed the driver's license of [the proper suspect]'' \n     which ``differ[ed] from plaintiff's driver's license \n     number,'' Judge Shedd granted summary judgment on the \n     grounds that the defendants had ``a reasonable, good faith \n     belief that they were arresting the correct person'' He \n     thereby rejected, as a matter of law, the contrary \n     conclusion of a United States magistrate that the officers \n     were not entitled to a ``good faith'' defense on these \n     facts since ``[a] simple check of the bench warrant should \n     have revealed that Joye was not the person wanted.'' Joye, \n     47 F. Supp. 2d at 665-66.\n       Judge Shedd also appears to be willing to interject himself \n     in unusual ways into ongoing judicial proceedings. In one \n     case, Maytag Corp. v. Clarkson, 875 F. Supp. 324 (D.S.C. \n     1995), he went out of his way to draft and publish an opinion \n     castigating a lawyer for making a closing argument urging the \n     jury to decide a case on its notion of ``what is right and . \n     . . what is moral and . . . what is just.'' Judge Shedd had \n     submitted the case to the jury on a special verdict--limited \n     to the question whether the defendant was liable to the \n     plaintiff under a written guarantee--and although plaintiff's \n     attorneys made no objection to the defendant's closing \n     argument (and although the jury subsequently returned a \n     verdict for the plaintiff), Judge Shedd felt the need to \n     publish an opinion declaring that the defendant's appeal to \n     morality, decency, and justice--what the Court termed the \n     sympathy of the jury--was inappropriate: ``Therefore, while \n     this matter is now closed, this Order should serve as a \n     reminder to all counsel that arguments of the type addressed \n     herein are improper and will not be tolerated in this \n     Court.'' 875 F. Supp. at 330.\n       In yet another such example, Judge Shedd initiated, sua \n     sponte, an inquiry into the finances of an unemployed party, \n     living with her mother, who had been granted in forma \n     pauperis status by another federal judge and whose case was \n     already pending on appeal in the Fourth Circuit. Assaad-\n     Faltas v. University of South Carolina, 971 F. Supp. 985 \n     (D.S.C. 1997). Based on ``the prolific litigiousness in which \n     she has engaged,'' id. at 986--specifically citing her use of \n     a telephone to make long-distance telephone calls to the \n     Fourth Circuit and her use of her mother's automobile ``to \n     travel to the courthouse on a regular basis,'' as well as her \n     practice of ``flood[ing] the Court and opposing counsel with \n     numerous legal filings, many of which contain multiple pages \n     and/or exhibits''--Judge Shedd revoked her in forma pauperis \n     status and recommended that the Fourth Circuit dismiss her \n     pending appeal, concluding that these acts were ``certainly \n     indicative of the fact that she has financial resources \n     available to her to fund this litigation.'' Id. at 988.\n       In our considered judgment, these cases suffice to raise \n     red flags that should require the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     to proceed only after the most careful review of Judge \n     Shedd's full judicial record--most of which has only become \n     available for consideration in the past few days. The Fourth \n     Circuit does not, in our view, need another federal appellate \n     judge who would constrain the authority of Congress in the \n     21st century by resort to outdated and reactionary views \n     of federal power. It does not need a federal judge who \n     would be hostile to African Americans, to women, to the \n     aged, or to the disabled who bring serious claims of \n     employment discrimination or other forms of discrimination \n     prohibited by federal laws or the Constitution. It does \n     not need a federal judge who would reflexively side with \n     management against labor, with employers against \n     employees. Nor does it need a federal judge who is \n     dismissive of the precious right to trial by jury, cutting \n     short legitimate factual disputes that, under the Seventh \n     Amendment, properly belong to federal juries.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Charles Boger, Lissa L.

The Fourth Circuit, as you know, presently \n     is comprised of eleven judges, and there are four pending \n     vacancies. Although North Carolina is the largest State \n     within the Circuit, it has no current representation on the \n     Circuit at all, and has had none since 1999, despite a \n     federal statute that requires that ``in each circuit, there \n     shall be at least one circuit judge in regular active service \n     appointed from the residents of each state in the circuit.'' \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 44.\n       South Carolina, the state in which Judge Shedd currently \n     sits, has three judges currently on the Fourth Circuit. Judge \n     Shedd's elevation would constitute the fourth. We respect our \n     sister state, of course, yet we do not understand why, with a \n     population less than half of North Carolina's, it should \n     receive its fourth active judge while North Carolina \n     languishes without a single sitting representative, and with \n     only two seats even authorized.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed 99 judicial \nnominees during the 107th Congress--all of which have occurred since \nDemocrats assumed the majority. Democrats have also confirmed more \ncircuit court nominees than Republicans did any of their prior six \nyears of control. Today we are considering the nomination of Judge \nShedd for the Fourth Circuit.\n  There has been much discussion over Judge Shedd's nomination, and I \nunderstand the Judiciary Committee has received hundreds of letters \nfrom individuals and organizations expressing concern over elevating \nJudge Shedd. While his nomination was reported out of the committee \nlast week, there was considerable debate and many members raised \nserious concerns. I am troubled by allegations that Judge Shedd has a \npattern of injecting his personal opinions into the proceedings before \nhim, including--ordering defendants to make motions for summary \njudgment, and deciding on issues before they are raised.\n  I am also concerned about allegations that individuals raising \nemployment discrimination claims before him are unable to receive a \nfair and impartial forum. I understand that through questioning by the \nJudiciary Committee, it was uncovered that Judge Shedd could not think \nof a single plaintiff in a civil rights or employment discrimination \ncase who had prevailed in his courtroom--in fact, Judge Shedd has never \ngranted substantive relief to a plaintiff in an employment \ndiscrimination case.\n  I am also concerned about his extreme views of the constitutional \nallocation of powers between the States and the federal government--\nviews that are not shared even by the current conservative Rehnquist \nCourt. In a 1997 case challenging the constitutionality of the Driver's \nPrivacy Protection Act (DPPA), Judge Shedd held that the federal \ngovernment did not have the power to require states to protect the \nconfidentiality of state driver's license records. In a 9-0 reversal of \nJudge Shedd's ruling, the Supreme Court made clear that he had gone too \nfar. The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to evaluate the \nPresident's nominees, offer advice, and grant--or withhold--its \nconsent. I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  Unfortunately, in Judge Shedd's case I believe enough concerns have \nbeen raised about his judicial temperament to lead me to the conclusion \nthat he should not be elevated to the Fourth Circuit. So, on this vote \nI plan to vote against Judge Shedd's nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto the vote.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Judge Shedd is a man of great character who will make \nan outstanding addition to the Federal appellate bench. He possesses \nthe highest sense of integrity, a thorough knowledge of the law, and a \ngood judicial temperament.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that Judge Shedd is committed to \nupholding the rights of all people under the Constitution. This fine \nman is truly deserving of such high honor, and he will serve the people \nof the Fourth Circuit with distinction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for \nJudge Shedd be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     To: United States Senators.\n     From: Luonne Abram Rouse.\n     Re: Dennis Shedd.\n\n       Dennis Shedd is an outstanding American citizen, and a \n     friend of high integrity and godliness. The United States of \n     America will benefit greatly from his service in the 4th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       The Honorable Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina \n     introduced me to Dennis in 1983. Putting history behind, we \n     came together in the 80s, while I served as president of a \n     local NAACP chapter in South Carolina. We established a \n     friendship and respectful sharing that has been mutually \n     beneficial for our work in America and beyond. Since that \n     time, I have found Dennis Shedd to be the type of person that \n     I trust to weigh the issues with dignity and legal focus.\n       In 1982, Senator Thurmond was a guest in our home following \n     a time when he and I had written communication concerning the \n     Civil Rights Act. The Senator visited my home to personally \n     thank me for the communication, and state that he had changed \n     his mind and agreed to support the Civil Rights Act after \n     dialogue with several African American leaders. During the \n     same visit, he extended an invitation for me to be a guest \n     chaplain at the United States Senate in Washington, DC. I \n     responded with my presence in April of 1983, at which time I \n     met Dennis Shedd.\n       Dennis and I have kept up with one another's growth and \n     experiences. He has prayerfully supported my appointments in \n     United Methodist Churches across racial lines in South \n     Carolina, since 1986. The support he has shown for racial \n     inclusiveness in churches, during a time in which leading \n     sociologists claimed that there are no truly desegregated \n     churches in South Carolina, has been encouraging to my \n     ministry of intentionality and reconciliation in this period \n     of church desegregation.\n       I am confident that persons will be able to communicate \n     with this experienced Judge, and find him seeking to maintain \n     peace with justice based soundly on the law. When this matter \n     is concluded, I would like to have Hillary Shelton, another \n     outstanding man and long time activist who has been an \n     overnight guest in our home, to dinner and discover the real \n     essence of Dennis Shedd as a judge of fairness and justice \n     regarding issues of human rights.\n       Many people have sought to block Dennis Shedd's appointment \n     to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, and some have led me to \n     study his decisions closely. I respectfully ask those who \n     would oppose him to consider that there is more to a decision \n     than a final report reveals, and much more to the person \n     having to issue the judgment regarding the same. I have known \n     Dennis as a man of his word, who reaches decisions weighing \n     the evidence with matters of law. I have been a long time \n     advocate for women's rights and civil rights, and would never \n     support someone whom I believed had personal issues \n     outweighing legal judgment on matters concerning the same. \n     Even is disagreement, his listening ear would grant the same \n     respect offered to him by those with opposing views. And the \n     respect he provides for one, I trust him to provide to \n     others. As a political leader Senator Thurmond has been most \n     respectful in communicating with me, and as a legal \n     representative Dennis has been most receptive and \n     respectful of my calls.\n       In conclusion, my wife and I have two daughters; our hopes \n     and dreams for the future are in them. I believe Dennis will \n     represent equality and justice for women and all ethnicities \n     in America with devotion to oath he has taken. I do not \n     believe that he will forsake the law with favoritism for \n     economic giants or big business. I sincerely view Dennis as \n     one who will grant persons of every socioeconomic level the \n     same psycho-social respect within the law.\n       Therefore, I strongly favor the nomination of Dennis Shedd \n     to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, because Dennis stands \n     firm on his convictions, but is open to intelligent and \n     informed opinions of law. He is open to change, but I do not \n     expect him to change just for political correctness. He will, \n     however, hear the ethical and moral points. I support him \n     because of his listening ear and desire for justice.\n       I appreciate your prayerful action and reception of this \n     letter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Law Offices of Jack B. Swerling,\n\n                                   Columbia, SC, January 26, 2001.\n     Re the Honorable Dennis W. Shedd.\n\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Columbia, SC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am writing you in support of the \n     nomination of the Honorable Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. I believe that you could not find \n     from our great state a more able or deserving jurist to sit \n     on the Fourth Circuit.\n       I have been in practice for almost 28 years and a \n     significant part of my practice is dedicated to the \n     representation of defendants in criminal cases in the \n     District of South Carolina. Since Judge Shedd was appointed \n     to serve as a District Judge, I have had the opportunity to \n     appear before him on many occasions, in both hearings and in \n     trials.\n       Judge Shedd presides over the proceedings before him in a \n     fair and impartial manner.\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\n     All litigants, whether they be private individuals, \n     corporations, or governmental entities, enjoy the opportunity \n     to be fully heard in the presentation of their case. I have \n     always felt that while one side or another must ultimately \n     prevail, each litigant as well as their counsel have been \n     treated with the utmost respect and dignity in Judge Shedd's \n     courtroom. He is known among the federal bar to be \n     intellectually gifted. He has a complete command of not only \n     the federal rules of evidence and procedure, but also the \n     federal case law throughout the country. His orders and trial \n     rulings are based upon a sound and insightful perspective of \n     the applicable federal rules and law. In order to reach a \n     just result in a recent case, Judge Shedd and his very able \n     law clerks worked long into the night and started again early \n     the next morning to study the transcripts and research all of \n     the applicable federal law before ruling on my motion for a \n     judgment of acquittal. His Order, with underlying factual and \n     legal support, is a model for any jurist.\n       It has been an honor and a privilege to practice before the \n     Judge over these years. He is a man of integrity with the \n     highest ethical standards; a highly energetic and motivated \n     jurist; and one with the demeanor and intellectual ability to \n     serve with distinction on the Fourth Circuit just as he has \n     served in our District over these past years. On behalf of \n     this lawyer, I would urge you to support his nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Jack B. Swerling.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Jan S.

Charles Schumer,\n     U.S. Senator, Leo O'Brien Bldg.,\n     Albany, NY.\n       Dear Senator Schumer: By way of introduction, I introduced \n     myself to you in the Tetons last summer when you and your \n     family were hiking in cascade canyon.\n       I am writing you in support of Judge Dennis Shedd's \n     confirmation as Judge of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     I practice criminal law and can understand that a great deal \n     of the outcry against Judge Shedd comes from the results of \n     the criminal cases. From my viewpoint, Judge Shedd makes \n     decisions which follow the law notwithstanding their \n     popularity.\n       I have practiced criminal law for over thirty years and \n     have had a substantial number of cases before Judge Shedd \n     since he began as a District Judge. He has always been \n     courteous to me and my clients and cognizant of the rights of \n     all parties.\n       I think that he has been a judge who has been fair to all \n     litigants and that he would continue in that manner in the \n     Circuit Court.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jan S. Strifling.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             The ``Quattlebaum Case'': What the Lawyers Say\n\n   E. Bart Daniel, the criminal defense attorney who represented the \nlawyer who pled guilty and was sentenced to jail for perjury (letter to \n                 Senator Hatch dated November 18, 2002)\n\n       I have been a practicing attorney in South Carolina for \n     over 22 years. During my career, I have served as an \n     Assistant State Attorney General, and Assistant U.S. \n     Attorney, a United States Attorney under the previous \n     President Bush and an active federal trial attorney. My \n     practice over the years has developed into primarily a \n     ``white collar'' criminal defense practice. I have appeared \n     many times in court before Judge Shedd and found him to be \n     courteous and fair. He has exhibited great integrity and a \n     strong character while on the bench.\n       One of the most difficult cases in which I appeared before \n     Judge Shedd was in United States v. John Earl Duncan. Mr. \n     Duncan was a practicing attorney who was convicted of \n     perjury. Judge Shedd sentenced him to four months in a \n     federal penitentiary and four months in a community \n     confinement center (halfway house). He fined him $33,386.92. \n     Judge Shedd's decision was a difficult one, but fair. As his \n     counsel, we recognized that Judge Shedd would be compelled to \n     sentence Mr. Duncan to an active term of incarceration since \n     he was a practicing attorney who had been convicted of lying \n     to a federal grand jury.\n       During the sentencing phase of the Duncan case, Judge Shedd \n     was courteous and patient and listened intently to the many \n     people who spoke on our client's behalf including my co-\n     counsel Dale L. DuTremble and me.\n       I know of no judge more qualified for the position than \n     Judge Shedd. If you have any questions or I can be of any \n     further support, please do not hesitate to call.\n\nJack Swerling, the criminal defense attorney who represented the Deputy \n   Solicitor who was tried for perjury before Judge Shedd (letter to \n                Senator Hollings dated January 26, 2001)\n\n       I am writing you in support of the nomination of the \n     Honorable Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. I believe that you could not find from our great \n     state a more able or deserving jurist to sit on the Fourth \n     Circuit.\n       I have been in practice for almost 28 years and a \n     significant part of my practice is dedicated to the \n     representation of defendants in criminal cases in the \n     District of South Carolina. Since Judge Shedd was appointed \n     to serve as a District Judge, I have had the opportunity to \n     appear before him on many occasions, in both hearings and \n     trials.\n       Judge Shedd presides over the proceedings before him in a \n     fair and impartial manner. All litigants, whether they be \n     private individuals, corporations, or governmental entities, \n     enjoy the opportunity to be fully heard in the presentation \n     of their case. I have always felt that while one side or \n     another must ultimately prevail, each litigant as well as \n     their counsel have been treated with the utmost respect and \n     dignity in Judge Shedd's courtroom. He is known among the \n     federal bar to be intellectually gifted. He has a complete \n     command of not only the federal rules of evidence and \n     procedure, but also the federal case law throughout the \n     country. His orders and trial rulings are based upon a sound \n     and insightful perspective of the applicable federal rules \n     and law.\n       It has been an honor and a privilege to practice before the \n     Judge over these years. He is a man of integrity with the \n     highest ethical standards; a highly energetic and motivated \n     jurist; and one with the demeanor and intellectual ability to \n     serve with distinction on the Fourth Circuit just as he has \n     served over these past years. On behalf of this lawyer, I \n     urge you to support his nomination.\n       Joseph M. McCullough, Jr., the criminal defense attorney \n     who intervened on behalf of Quattlebaum in the federal \n     prosecution to have the videotape suppressed at trial (letter \n     to Senator Hollings dated January 29, 2001)\n       Having practiced law in South Carolina for more than 20 \n     years, and as past President of the South Carolina Criminal \n     Defense Lawyers Association, I have had occasion to be in \n     Judge Shedd's courtroom frequently and have tried several \n     cases before him. I have always been impressed with Judge \n     Shedd's factual familiarity and legal preparation in every \n     matter before him. I have found him to be extremely \n     intelligent and a firm hand in the courtroom. I have always \n     been impressed with his understanding of the law, and believe \n     that he would be a strong addition to the Fourth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   District of South Carolina,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     In re Dennis W. Shedd, Nominee to Fourth Circuit Court of \n         Appeals.\n\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Republican Member, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This in response to your request that I \n     provide information regarding Dennis W. Shedd, a judge on our \n     court, who has been nominated for a position on the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. I have served \n     as a United States District Judge for 16 years, the last two \n     as Chief Judge for our district. I knew Judge Shedd prior to \n     his appointment as U.S. District Judge, and, subsequent to \n     his appointment, he and I have served as suite mates in the \n     courthouse here in Columbia. I, therefore, feel that I am \n     qualified to comment on his abilities, qualifications, and \n     reputation.\n       In response to your specific inquiries, I can say without \n     hesitation that Judge Shedd has a reputation for fairness, \n     both in his community and on our court. As Chief Judge, I \n     have received no complaints about his courtroom demeanor, his \n     decisions, or his procedures. It is my considered opinion \n     that all people who appear in his court receive a fair \n     hearing, regardless of the type of cases involved, or the \n     status of the parties in the case (plaintiff or defendant).\n       Judge Shedd is scrupulous in his dealings on the court. If \n     there is any remote suggestion of the appearance of \n     impropriety, he will not hesitate, and has not hesitated, to \n     rescuse himself and he is very consistent about this.\n       I regularly review the advance sheets of the United States \n     Court of Appeal for the Fourth Circuit, and it would appear \n     to me that Judge Shedd has an extremely good affirmance rate \n     in that court.\n       In regard to the issue of granting summary judgment or \n     otherwise dismissing cases short of trial, it appears to me \n     that Judge Shedd's record is no different from any other \n     judge in this district. That is to say, some of his cases are \n     ended by a ruling on summary judgment. Those that are not are \n     then set for trial and a great number of those eventually \n     settle before the trial can be conducted. In regard to \n     summary judgment decisions, settlements, and actual trials, \n     Judge Shedd's statistics are not significantly different from \n     any other judge in this district.\n       I hope this letter is responsive to your inquiry and if you \n     need any additional information, please do not hesitate to \n     let me know.\n       With kind personal regards.\n                                          Joseph F. Anderson, Jr.,\n     Chief United States District Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       The Senate,\n\n\n                                            State of Arkansas,\n\n                                                 October 11, 2002.\n     Re confirmation for Federal Judge Dennis Shedd (South \n         Carolina) to the US Court of Appeals.\n\n      Hon. Blanche Lincoln,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: I am writing this letter to provide \n     my strongest possible recommendation for the Hon. Dennis \n     Shedd, of\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\n     Columbia, South Carolina, who has been nominated by President \n     Bush to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond.\n       Yesterday, I read the story in the A Section of the \n     Arkansas Democrat-Gazette regarding the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee's decision to delay confirmation of Judge Shedd \n     until after the recess, after which Senator Strom Thurmond \n     (R-SC) will have retired from the Senate.\n       I understand that you are not a member of the Judiciary \n     Committee. However, I am writing this letter as one of your \n     loyal supporters and good friends, and as a good Democrat as \n     well. I want you to know that I cannot think of many people \n     who would make a better Appeals Court Judge than Dennis \n     Shedd.\n       Dennis and I are good friends from the days when we both \n     worked in Washington, he for Senator Thurmond and I for \n     Senator Bumpers. In addition, he was my landlord for over \n     four years at the townhouse where I lived. We have kept in \n     touch over the years as we got both got married and built \n     families. I have also visited Dennis and his wonderful wife, \n     Elaine, in South Carolina during the occasions my family \n     vacations there.\n       However, taking friendship and political philosophies \n     aside, I can honestly say that he has one of the finest minds \n     I have ever encountered, including President Clinton and many \n     others with whom I have had the good fortune to become well \n     acquainted. Furthermore, his sense of personal and \n     professional integrity is unrivaled, as is his knowledge and \n     understanding of the law. He was one of the lawyers involved \n     in the dissolution of the Heritage USA Bankruptcy (Jim \n     Baker), and he gave half of his legal fees to victims. On one \n     visit to South Carolina, I had the opportunity to sit in on a \n     high profile case, and was very impressed with the way he \n     dispensed justice in that proceeding, and with the \n     relationship he had with the then Democratic US Attorney's \n     Office. He has a wonderful family and is someone I would say \n     is a true patriot.\n       In short, I believe Dennis Shedd has proven to be a good \n     and valued officer of the court, and would make an excellent \n     Appeals Court Justice. I believe the problem with the \n     confirmation has more to do with the politics of having been \n     chief of staff to the Senate Judiciary Committee when \n     President Reagan was in office, and several Democrats see an \n     opportunity for partisan retribution for some of the judicial \n     politics of that era. I want you to know that I saw Dennis \n     Shedd almost every day during that period, and there is no \n     one who would deny his professionalism in handling these \n     matters. The politics of that era had more to do with who was \n     in power than it did with the staff. The US Senate, including \n     Democrats, should move his confirmation forward.\n       Dennis is a self-made person who came from a small South \n     Carolina town and worked his way through law school while a \n     member of Senator Thurmond's staff, and who did such a good \n     job was ultimately promoted. You know that I am a good and \n     loyal Democrat. However, the fact of his political \n     affiliation should not prevent or detract from all of these \n     qualifications, and I sincerely plead with you to bring this \n     up in the Senate Democratic Caucus with a request that the \n     Judiciary Committee honor its word to Senator Thurmond, and \n     move Judge Shedd's nomination forward and out of the Senate.\n       I think this is one of only a handful of letters I have \n     ever written you. Thank you for your time, and please forgive \n     the length of this letter. However, I do hope you will take \n     this request seriously, and pass it on to your colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kevin A.

Hollings,\n      Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the confirmation of Dennis W. Shedd to the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I have practiced law for over twenty years in Columbia, \n     South Carolina. I handle primarily personal injury and \n     criminal cases. My practice is a Plaintiff's practice. I have \n     been a member of the South Carolina Trial Lawyers Association \n     since graduating from law school and appreciate your strong \n     support for that organization.\n       I have appeared before Judge Shedd in a certain number of \n     cases. Some cases have been won and some were lost. In one \n     case, my client was African American. That case involved a \n     lawsuit in which the Federal Government fought to deny my \n     client life insurance benefits after the death of his wife. \n     Judge Shedd ruled favorably and properly for my client on the \n     law. My client received a verdict for the full amount of the \n     benefits. During the trial, Judge Shedd was fair, extremely \n     knowledgeable on the law, and showed absolute integrity.\n       I am confident that Judge Shedd will be fair to all and \n     show complete integrity if confirmed for a position on the \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       With the kindest regards, I am.\n           Sincerely,\n     Garry L. Wooten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Gregory P.

Hollings,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: This is the second letter that I \n     have written to you in support of the confirmation of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \n     believe that it is necessary to write another letter in light \n     of recent accusations that I have read concerning Judge Shedd \n     fairness and temperament on the district court bench.\n       I was the Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division in the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office when Judge Shedd took the bench in 1992. As \n     a federal prosecutor, I tried three cases in front of Judge \n     Shedd. He was tough, but fair. In 1993, I entered private \n     practice specializing primarily in federal criminal defense. \n     Since entering private practice, I have tried seven cases in \n     Judge Shedd's court and appeared on other matters on numerous \n     occasions. During each of these trials, Judge Shedd was \n     similarly tough and fair. It has been my experience as a \n     federal prosecutor and a private attorney that Judge Shedd \n     feeds everyone out of the same spoon.\n       As to his temperament, on occasion when he and I have \n     disagreed over the admittance of evidence, the admission of a \n     statement, or any other matter of law, he has been \n     professional, courteous, and usually right. Nevertheless, \n     even after these disagreements, he has never left the court \n     room at the end of the day without a smile and a kind word to \n     the lawyers.\n       It seems to me that those leveling the accusations at Judge \n     Shedd have never even seen him in court, much less appeared \n     before him. Almost all of us who have, strongly support his \n     confirmation to the Fourth Circuit. If have any questions, \n     please do not hesitate to contact me regarding my \n     professional and personal feelings about Judge Shedd.\n           Regards,\n     Gregory P. Harris.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Nathaniel Roberson,\n\n\n                                              Attorney at Law,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     Re nomination for the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n     Senator Earnest F. Hollings,\n     Senator Orrin Hatch.\n       Gentlemen: This is on behalf of Dennis Shedd and his \n     nomination for the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       I have tried many cases, argued motions, and have done may \n     guilty pleas before Judge Shedd since he became a District \n     Court Judge in South Carolina.\n       I have found him to be open and honest with litigant \n     members of the bar and witnesses relevant to the issues \n     before him. He has at all times demonstrated the kind of \n     judicial temperament that has made him a credit to our \n     judiciary.\n       He has been accused by groups and organizations of being \n     biased either for against certain issues that has not \n     endeared him for the reasons expressed by those organizations \n     that oppose him.\n       My experience with Judge Shedd has been professional, \n     judicial, and he has never blocked or interfered with my \n     representation of clients and those issues that I was \n     required to make on behalf of the people I represented. I \n     urge you and your colleagues to vote in favor of Judge Shedd \n     being elevated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Thanks for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nathaniel Robertson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Young and Sullivan, L.L.P.,\n\n\n                              Attorneys and Counselors at Law,\n\n                                Charleston, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     Re Judge Dennis W. Shedd, nomination, Fourth Circuit.\n\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been in an eight week (8) long \n     jury trial before Judge Dennis W. Shedd and many other jury \n     trials, motion hearings, and sentencing hearings and appeals \n     to the Fourth Circuit. I have appeared before Judge Shedd as \n     much or more than any defense lawyer in South Carolina.\n       I am not a political crony of Judge Shedd, I am a trial \n     lawyer. I was Chief Public Defender in Columbia, SC (1972-87) \n     Adjunct Professor of Law, USC School of Law (1974-89), \n     President SC Public Defenders Association (1972-88), Founder, \n     SC Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Served by \n     election ABA Criminal Justice Council, and was awarded the \n     Bronze Star in Vietnam (1969-70).\n       Judge Shedd is a competent, fair, even-handed jurist and I \n     urge your support for him to be a Judge on U.S. Court of \n     Appeals--Fourth Circuit.\n       Tell any U.S. Senator opposed to Judge Shedd's nomination \n     to call me, I am in my office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               John McMahon Young,\n                                                  Attorney At Law.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the chair.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are so proud of our senior Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the confirmation of Judge \nDennis Shedd and to congratulate the President on getting his 100th \njudicial nominee confirmed. Yesterday, I made much more detailed \nremarks in Judge's Shedd's favor.\n  I am also glad for Senator Strom Thurmond. He is much loved in the \nSenate, he is much loved in South Carolina and throughout this country, \nand I know that he wanted to see his former Chief Counsel confirmed \nbefore the end of his long career in the Senate.\n  In the recent election, as far as I see it, the President took three \nissues to the American people: his Iraq policy, Homeland Security and \nhis judicial nominees. The election showed that Americans trust this \nPresident including in his selection of judicial nominees.\n  The election indicated that voters rejected obstruction in the \nSenate, including on judicial nominees, and voters especially rejected \nthe distortions of reputations that they read and heard about in \nhundreds of news stories, scores of editorials, and dozens of op-eds . \n. . and that they saw on TV.\n  Voters sent us a clear message, it seems to me, that we should end \nthe obstruction and maltreatment of judicial nominees. We need to \nevaluate judges or potential judges as unbiased umpires who call the \nballs and the strikes as they are, not as they alone see them and not \nas they want them to be. We must end the practice of projecting \nideology to see if an umpire is pro-bat or pro-ball, pro-batter or pro-\npitcher.\n  Our job is to determine the character and temperament of a nominee to \nthe judiciary. Period. This is true of the trial bench, the appellate \ncourt, and the Supreme Court.\n  Again, I express my great satisfaction that the Judiciary Committee \nhas favorably recommended the nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd of South \nCarolina for a vote of the full Senate.\n  When Judge Shedd was nominated to the federal trial bench, Chairman \nBiden had this to say to him: ``I have worked with you for so long that \nI believe I am fully qualified to make an independent judgment about \nyour working habits, your integrity, your honesty, and your \ntemperament. On all these scores, I have found you to be beyond \nreproach.''\n  This is high praise, indeed, and from a colleague from the other side \nof the aisle for whom we all have the greatest respect.\n  Judge Sheed has strong bipartisan support in his home state as well, \nand not only from Senators Thurmond and Hollings. He is also strongly \nsupported by Dick Harpootlian, South Carolina State Chairman of the \nDemocratic Party, and himself a trial lawyer.\n  Dennis Shedd has served as a federal jurist for more than a decade \nfollowing nearly twenty years of public service and legal practice. \nWhile serving the Judiciary Committee, Judge Shedd worked, among many \nother matters, on the extension of the Voting Rights Act, RICO reform, \nthe Ethics in Post-Employment Act, and the 1984 and 1986 crime bills.\n  As Senator Biden put it: ``His hard work and intelligence helped the \nCongress find areas of agreement and reach compromises.''\n  Judge Shedd will add diversity to the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The last five Fourth Circuit confirmations have all been \nDemocrats. When Judge Shedd joins the other members of the Fourth \nCircuit, he will not only have unmatched legislative experience, he \nwill also have the longest trial bench experience on the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  The American people should be grateful that President Bush has \nnominated Dennis Shedd to serve this country further. He has already \nserved for nearly 25 years.\n  Judge Dennis Shedd has heard more than 5,000 civil cases, reviewed \nmore than 1,400 reports and recommendations of magistrates, and has had \nbefore him nearly 1000 criminal defendants. He has been reversed fewer \nthan 40 times, less than one percent.\n  In employment cases, he has only twice been reversed in his \ndecisions. Remarkbly, in criminal cases, Judge Shedd has never been \nreversed on any ruling considered before or during trial, or on the \ntaking of guilty pleas.\n  Now, detractors have made much of the fact that he has a relative few \ndecisions that he has chosen to publish. But, in fact, he falls in the \nmiddle of the average for published opinions in the Fourth Circuit. One \nCarter appointee has published all of 7 cases, one Clinton appointee \nhas published only 3, and another Carter appointee has published 51, \nonly one more than Judge Shedd, despite being on the court for 10 years \nlonger.\n  Notably, on cases involving the Voting Rights Acts, Judge Shedd has \nruled for plaintiffs in each instance, an Act, I might add that he \nworked to extend in the Senate.\n  From his service in the Senate to his role on the South Carolina \nAdvisory Committee of the United States Civil Rights Commission, Judge \nShedd has been a leader on civil rights. He led efforts to appoint the \nfirst African American woman ever to serve as a magistrate judge in \nSouth Carolina and has sought the Selection Committee to conduct \noutreach to women and people of color in filling such positions. He \npushed for an African American woman to be Chief of Pretrial Services. \nHe has actively recruited persons of color to be his law clerks.\n  And because of Judge Shedd's work in an award-winning drug program \nthat aims to reverse stereotypes among 4,000 to 5,000 school children, \nhe was chosen as the United Way's School Volunteer of the Year.\n  This record stands in contrast to the distortions we have heard about \nJudge Shedd's sensitivity on civil rights.\n  The Judiciary Committee received a very touching letter from one of \nJudge Shedd's former law clerks, Thomas Jones and I placed in the \nrecord yesterday.\n  Now this young man,--this young lawyer happens to be a person of \ncolor--an African American. He says:\n\n       It is apparent to me that the allegations regarding Judge \n     Shedd's alleged biases have been propagated by individuals \n     without the benefit of any real, meaningful interaction with \n     Judge Shedd . . . I trust the allegations are given the short \n     shrift they are due.\n\n  I would like to read from a letter I received from Niger Innis who \nhas inherited his father's mantle and is the national spokesman for the \nCongress of Racial Equality. We all know his father, of course, Roy \nInnis, who was a great leader of the civil rights movement in the \n1960's together with Dr. King.\n  I received this letter even while I was on the floor of the Senate \nyesterday.\n  Mr. Innis writes:\n\n       This is an open letter in the interest of justice. The \n     Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) enthusiastically endorses \n     Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Despite a Democratic filibuster against Judge Shedd, it is \n     the strong opinion of CORE that Judge Shedd is a more than \n     worthy candidate for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Judge Shedd's character has been under attack without merit \n     and without fair scrutiny of his service to the American \n     legal system.\n       Prior to serving the bench, Judge Shedd served faithfully \n     from 1988-1990 as Chairman of the South Carolina Advisory \n     Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A fair and \n     honest review of Judge Shedd's unpublished opinions would \n     show that he has sided numerous times with plaintiffs in \n     cases of race, gender and disability rights without falter or \n     hesitation. In each case, his decisions have allowed \n     employment discrimination lawsuits to go forward in the \n     interest of fairness and truth.\n       Judge Shedd has shown his commitment to employment rights \n     for minorities and women, particularly within the court. . .\n       We hope that you would join CORE in our support of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd and urge Senate Democrats to end the unfair \n     smear against his name. Let Judge Shedd have his day on the \n     Senate floor.\n\n  Another letter I received while I was on the floor yesterday came \nfrom Phyllis Berry Myers, President of the Centre for New Black \nLeadership; another great name in the African American community.\n  Ms. Myers writes:\n\n       The Senate can restore itself, at least a modicum, a sense \n     of fair play, honor, and trust in its own policies and \n     procedures, a commitment to guarding the civil rights of all, \n     as well as advancing the rule of law by swiftly confirming \n     Judge Shedd.\n\n  And at 2:32 pm yesterday, while I was on the floor, we also received \na letter from the former Chairman of the NAACP of South Carolina. The \nRev Dr. Luonne Abram Rouse writes:\n\n       Dennis Shedd is an outstanding American citizen, and a \n     friend of high integrity and godliness. The United States of \n     America will benefit greatly from his service in the 4th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\n       The Honorable Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina \n     introduced me to Dennis in 1983. Putting history behind, we \n     came together in the 80s, while I served as president of a \n     local NAACP chapter in South Carolina. We established a \n     friendship and respectful sharing that has been mutually \n     beneficial for our work in America and beyond. Since that \n     time, I have found Dennis Shedd to be the type of person that \n     I trust I trust to weigh the issues with dignity and legal \n     focus. . .\n\n  Reverend Rouse wrote a remarkable letter and ends this way:\n\n       In conclusion, my wife and I have two daughters; our hopes \n     and dreams for the future are in time. I believe Dennis will \n     represent equality and justice for women and all ethnicities \n     in America with devotion to oath he has taken. I do not \n     believe that he will forsake the law with favoritism for \n     economic giants or big business. I sincerely view Dennis as \n     one who will grant persons of every socioeconomic level the \n     same psycho-social respect within the law.\n       Therefore, I strongly favor the nomination of Dennis Shedd \n     to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, because Dennis stands \n     firm on his convictions, but is open to intelligent and \n     informed opinions of law. He is open to change, but I do not \n     expect him to change just for political correctness. He will, \n     however, hear the ethical and moral points. I support him \n     because of his listening ear and desire for justice.\n\n  But these are not unique letters. We have received letters from the \npeople who know Judge Shedd. They are the ones that matter.\n  I want to take a moment to read a few excerpts from some of the \nletters we've received in support of Judge Shedd. Keep in mind that the \nletters are from lawyers who know Judge Shedd, who have practiced \nbefore him, and who are in the best position to assess his \nqualifications for the appellate bench.\n  The first letter is from J. Preston Strom, Jr. Mr. Strom writes:\n\n       I write to support Judge Shedd's confirmation to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. As a former \n     United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina \n     appointed by President Clinton, my office had daily dealings \n     with Judge Shedd. Judge Shedd is a fair and efficient jurist \n     who even-handedly applied substantive and procedural rules. \n     On occasions when my office disagreed with Judge Shedd's \n     rulings, I found that he always provided well-reasoned \n     analyses for his decisions. Further, when the rules provided \n     for discretion in sentencing for cooperation with federal \n     agents in the prosecution of crime, Judge Shedd deliberated \n     and provided substantial sentence reductions when warranted.\n       Following my tenure as United States Attorney, I have \n     practiced before Judge Shedd representing criminal defendants \n     and civil plaintiffs. In my criminal defense practice, I have \n     represented many African-Americans before Judge Shedd, and \n     found Judge Shedd to be fair and consistent to each of my \n     clients, regardless of race.\n       As a member of the Board of Governors of the South Carolina \n     Trial Lawyers Association and a member of the Association of \n     Trial Lawyers of America, I appreciate a judge who pushes \n     civil cases towards resolution and does not permit parties to \n     engage in unwarranted delay tactics. Judge Shedd is such a \n     judge.\n\n  Here is another letter. This one is from attorney Garry Wooten. He \nwrites:\n\n       I have practiced law for over twenty years in Columbia. I \n     handle primarily personal injury and criminal cases . . .\n       I have appeared before Judge Shedd in a certain number of \n     cases. Some cases have been won and some were lost. In one \n     case, my client was African-American. That case involved a \n     lawsuit in which the Federal Government fought to deny my \n     client life insurance benefits after the death of his wife. \n     Judge Shedd ruled favorably and properly for my client on the \n     law. My client received a verdict for the full amount of the \n     benefits. During the trial, Judge Shedd was fair, extremely \n     knowledgeable on the law, and showed absolute integrity.\n       I am confident that Judge Shedd will be fair to all and \n     show complete integrity if confirmed for a position on the \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  Another letter, this one from Jonathan Harvey, states:\n\n       I am the current treasurer of the South Carolina \n     Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and a member of its \n     board as well as past representative to its Board of \n     Directors from the Fifth Judicial Circuit. . . . I have had \n     many opportunities to appear in front of Judge Shedd. I have \n     left each proceeding convinced that my clients irrespective \n     of social status, creed, gender, or race were treated fairly \n     and with a proper application of the law.\n       I trust this letter will enable you to inform your \n     colleagues that there exists a significant history of Judge \n     Shedd exercising his discretion objectively and fairly toward \n     those parties who have appeared before him.\n\n  In another letter, lawyer John Simmons writes:\n\n       In all of my litigation before Judge Shedd, I have found \n     him to be fair and impartial. He possesses the highest \n     integrity and intellect and always treats the attorneys and \n     litigants with the utmost respect.\n       In one particular civil matter, I represented an individual \n     non-party who was alleged to have donated blood contaminated \n     with the HIV virus. Judge Shedd handled this sensitive and \n     difficult matter with patience and care, protecting my \n     client's identity while affording all litigants their \n     adequate discovery rights. I was extremely impressed with the \n     thoughtful diligence Judge Shedd pursued in ensuring my \n     client's confidentiality while balancing the rights of the \n     parties.\n\n  Finally, here is a letter from Howard Hammer. Mr. Hammer writes:\n\n       I have been a practicing South Carolina attorney for over \n     thirty (30) years. My practice primarily involves \n     representation of plaintiffs in civil litigation, including \n     representation of numerous individuals in employment \n     disputes. . . .\n       I have found Judge Shedd to be firm, just and deliberate in \n     all my dealings with him. He is a man of highest integrity \n     and I would respectfully urge your support of his \n     confirmation.\n\n  I could go on and on reading testimonials from lawyers in South \nCarolina who have regularly appeared before Judge Shedd and who \nstrongly support his confirmation on the Fourth Circuit. Yesterday I \nentered other letters into the record.\n  Mr. President, Dennis Shedd is well qualified to serve on the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I think so and the American Bar Association, \nhardly a bastion of conservative politics, has said so as well. In \nsupporting his confirmation I for one express my gratitude on behalf of \nthe American people for an entire life in public service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for \nthe confirmation of Judge Shedd be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Congress of Racial Equality,\n\n                                  New York, NY, November 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This is an open letter in the interest \n     of justice. The Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) \n     enthusiastically endorses Judge Dennis Shedd for the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite a Democratic filibuster \n     against Judge Shedd, it is the strong opinion of CORE that \n     Judge Shedd is a more than worthy candidate for the Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Judge Shedd's character has been under attack without merit \n     and without fair scrutiny of his service to the American \n     legal system.\n       Prior to serving the bench, Judge Shedd served faithfully \n     from 1988-1990 as Chairman of the South Carolina Advisory \n     Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. A fair and \n     honest review of Judge Shedd's unpublished opinions would \n     show that he has sided numerous times with plaintiffs in \n     cases of race, gender and disability rights without falter or \n     hesitation. In each case, his decisions have allowed \n     employment discrimination lawsuits to go forward in the \n     interest of fairness and truth.\n       Judge Shedd has shown his commitment to employment rights \n     for minorities and women, particularly within the court. His \n     efforts have championed the efforts to recruit and elect the \n     first African-American U.S. Magistrate Judge in the South \n     Carolina District, Margaret Seymour. He has actively sought \n     minority and female candidates for other Magistrate Judge \n     positions, and has directed the Selection Commission in South \n     Carolina to bear in mind diversity in the selection of \n     candidates for these positions.\n       Judge Dennis Shedd's accomplishments and service have \n     transcended bi-partisan support even from his home state \n     Senators, notably, Senators Strom Thurmond and Senator Ernest \n     Hollings who wholly support his nomination.\n       In the interest of fairness, balance we ask you to look \n     past the unfounded partisan attacks of propaganda against \n     Judge Shedd and fairly examine his work for yourselves. We \n     strongly believe Judge Shedd's accomplishments and \n     contributions to justice and civil rights speaks for itself.\n       We hope that you would join CORE in our support of Judge \n     Dennis Shedd and urge Senate Democrats to end the unfair \n     smear against his name. Let Judge Shedd have his day on the \n     Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Niger Innis, National Spokesman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Centre for New Black Leadership,\n\n                                                November 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Centre for New Black Leadership \n     (CNBL) believes the Senate's judicial nomination system is \n     broken and needs repairing.\n       We have watched with great trepidation as the Senate's role \n     of ``advise and consent'' for Presidential nominations, \n     especially judicial nominations, has become increasingly, \n     ``search and destroy,'' ``slander and defame.'' It is a \n     wonder that reasonable, decent people\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\n     agree to go through the confirmation process at all.\n       The confirmation process has become particularly brutal if \n     the nominee is labeled ``conservative.'' Traditional civil \n     rights groups mass to castigate and intimidate, as they do \n     now, attempting to thwart the confirmation of Judge Dennis W. \n     Shedd to the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Once again, we are witnessing the new depth to which public \n     discourse and debate has sunk when fabrications, statements \n     taken out of context, misinformation and disinformation can \n     pass as serious political deliberation and debate. The \n     vitally needed discussion about continued civil rights \n     progress in a 21st Century world gets lost in the cacophony. \n     Our nation and true civil rights advocates are poorer because \n     of this.\n       The Senate can restore to itself, at least a modicum, a \n     sense of fair play, honor, and trust in its own policies and \n     procedures, a commitment to guarding the civil rights of all, \n     as well as advancing the rule of law by swiftly confirming \n     Judge Shedd.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Phyllis Berry Myers,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Rosenberg Proutt Funk &\n\n\n                                               Greenberg, LLP,\n\n                                     Baltimore, MD, June 25, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: My name is Thomas W. Jones, Jr. I am an \n     African-American attorney currently practicing as a \n     litigation associate in Baltimore, Maryland.\n       Upon my graduation from the University of Maryland School \n     of Law, I had the distinct pleasure of serving as a judicial \n     clerk for the Honorable Dennis W. Shedd (``Judge Shedd'') on \n     the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. \n     During my eighteen months of working with Judge Shedd, I \n     never encountered a hint of bias, in any form or fashion, \n     regarding any aspect of Judge Shedd's jurisprudence or daily \n     activities.\n       It is apparent to me that the allegations regarding Judge \n     Shedd's alleged biases have been propagated by individuals \n     without the benefit of any real, meaningful interaction with \n     Judge Shedd, his friends or family members. I trust the \n     accusations of bias levied against Judge Shedd will be given \n     the short shrift they are due, and trust further that this \n     honorable Committee will act favorably upon the pending \n     nomination of Judge Shedd for the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your attention regarding this matter.\n           Respectfully,\n     Thomas W.

Orrin Hatch,\n     104 Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Re Nomination of Dennis W. Shedd to Fourth Circuit Court of \n         Appeals.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been a practicing attorney in \n     South Carolina for over 22 years. During my career, I have \n     served as an Assistant State Attorney General, and Assistant \n     U.S. Attorney, United States Attorney under the previous \n     President Bush and an active federal trial attorney. My \n     practice over the years has developed into primarily a \n     ``white collar'' criminal defense practice.I have appeared \n     many times in court before Judge Shedd and found him to be \n     courtcous and fair. He has exhibited great integrity and a \n     strong character while on the bench.\n       One of the most difficult cases in which I appeared before \n     Judge Shedd was in United States v. John Earl Duncan (3:99-\n     638-001). Dr. Duncan was a practicing attorney who was \n     convicted for perjury. Judge Shedd sentenced him to four \n     months in a federal penitentiary and four months in a \n     community confinement center (halfway house). He fined him \n     $33.386.92. Judge Shedd's decision was a difficult one, but \n     fair. As his counsel, we recognized that Judge shedd would be \n     compelled to sentence Mr. Duncan to an active term of \n     incarceration since he was a practicing attorney who had been \n     convicted of lying to a federal grand jury.\n       During the sentencing phase of the Duncan case, judge Shedd \n     was courtrous and patient and listened intently to the many \n     people who spoke on our client's behalf including co-counsel \n     Dale L. DuTremble and me.\n       I know of no judge more qualified for the position than \n     Judge Shedd. If you have any questions or if I can be of any \n     further support, please do not hesitate to call.\n           Yours very truly,\n     E. Bart Daniel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             J. Kershaw Spong,\n\n                                   Columbia, SC, November 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: Please allow this letter to voice my \n     strong support for the nomination of Dennis Shedd to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Your \n     support for Judge Shedd's nomination is appreciated, and, as \n     a fellow South Carolinian, I hope you will continue to \n     support him throughout this process.\n       Having worked with Judge Shedd in the U.S. Senate, and as a \n     practicing lawyer in South Carolina, I know him to be a \n     person of the highest integrity, professional competence, and \n     judicial temperament. As you may be aware, the ABA, which \n     reviews the nominees, has given Judge Shedd a majority rating \n     of ``well qualified,'' its highest rating.\n       I am also concerned about the nominating process. I think \n     many things have been unfairly said about Judge Shedd by \n     outside special interest groups which have little basis in \n     fact. It will become increasingly more difficult to get good \n     and competent attorneys to step forward to serve in the \n     judiciary if they have to go through this highly charged \n     partisan atmosphere.\n       I hope for your continued support for this exceptional \n     nominee and ask that you urge the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     to bring this nomination to a vote before the end of \n     Congress. After having to wait well over a year since his \n     nomination, and more than several months since his hearing at \n     the Committee, it is time for Judge Shedd to be confirmed to \n     the Fourth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my views.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Kershaw Spong.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Tompkins and McMaster, LLP,\n\n                                   Columbia, SC, October 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I was extremely disappointed in your \n     recent action denying Judge Dennis Shedd, nominee to the \n     Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, a vote on the Committee's \n     October 8th markup. Despite your promises to Senator Strom \n     Thurmond and other members of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee--and in contravention of Committee rules--you \n     refused to schedule a vote to allow his nomination to proceed \n     to the full Senate.\n       It would appear that you are bowing to the demands of \n     outside interest groups who have unfairly characterized Judge \n     Shedd's ruling on the district court. The facts are that he \n     has been reversed in fewer than 1% of the more than 5,000 \n     cases he has heard in his twelve years on the district court. \n     After reviewing his record, the ABA rated Judge Shedd ``well-\n     qualified,'' its highest rating. You once referred to the ABA \n     rating system as the ``gold standard.'' In addition, Judge \n     Shedd is well-represented by the members of the bench and bar \n     in South Carolina, and has the bipartisan support of Senators \n     Thurmond and Hollings--his home state senators.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee has had nearly a year and a \n     half to review Judge Shedd's record. I urge you to stop \n     delaying a vote on his nomination. Judge Shedd, an \n     exceptional nominee with the bipartisan support, deserves to \n     be confirmed to the Fourth Circuit before the end of this \n     Congress.\n       Thank you.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Henry Dargan McMaster.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        STROM LAW FIRM L.L.C.,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senator-South Carolina,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re confirmation of the Honorable Dennis Shedd to the United \n         States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I write to support Judge Shedd's \n     confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit. As a former United States Attorney for the \n     District of South Carolina appointed by President Clinton, my \n     office had daily dealings with Judge Shedd. Judge Shedd is a \n     fair and efficient jurist who even-handedly applied \n     substantive and procedural rules. On occasions when my office \n     disagreed with Judge Shedd's rulings, I found that he always \n     provided well-reasoned analysis for his decisions. Further, \n     when the rules provided for discretion in sentencing for \n     cooperation with federal agents in the prosecution of crime, \n     Judge Shedd deliberated and provided substantial sentence \n     reductions when warranted.\n       Following my tenure as United States Attorney, I have \n     practiced before Judge Shedd representing criminal defendants \n     and civil plaintiffs. In my criminal defense practice, I have \n     represented many African-Americans before Judge Shedd, and \n     found Judge Shedd to be fair and consistent to each of my \n     clients, regardless of race.\n       As a member of the Board of Governors of the South Carolina \n     Trial Lawyers Association and a member of the Association of \n     Trial Lawyers of America, I appreciate a judge who pushes \n     civil cases towards resolution and does not permit parties to \n     engage in unwarranted delay tactics. Judge Shedd is such a \n     judge.\n       From my many years of practice before Judge Shedd, I can \n     say that one admirable characteristic stands above all. \n     Diligence. Each time I have appeared before Judge Shedd, it \n     is clear that Judge Shedd has examined the entire case file \n     and performed the requisite research necessary to frame the \n     issues. For attorneys who vigorously represent their clients \n     at every stage of the criminal and civil processes, a hard \n     working judge is much appreciated. It is Judge Shedd's \n     diligence in examining each case on its facts and the \n     supporting law that makes him an excellent candidate for \n     appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit.\n       If you or anyone on your staff has questions, please \n     contact me.\n       With regards, I am\n           Very truly yours,\n                                             J.

Ernest F. Hollings,\n     U.S. Senator, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: I am taking the liberty of \n     contacting your office on behalf of Judge Shedd.\n       I had heretofore been grateful for the bipartisan support \n     of our senators and until recently thought that protocol \n     would suffice to ensure his nomination.\n       However, recent developments concerning his nomination have \n     compelled me to contact you to provide a recommendation based \n     upon a hands on perspective.\n       I am writing to express my support for his nomination. I am \n     the current treasurer of the South Carolina Association of \n     Criminal Defense Lawyers and a member of its board as well as \n     past representative to its Board of Directors from the Fifth \n     Judicial Circuit. As I am sure you know, the Fifth Judicial \n     Circuit encompasses Richland County and Columbia. My practice \n     is focused in the Midlands. I have had many opportunities to \n     appear in front of Judge Shedd. I have left each proceeding \n     convinced that my clients irrespective of social status, \n     creed, gender, or race were treated fairly and with a proper \n     application of the law.\n       I trust this letter will enable you to inform your \n     colleagues that there exists a significant history of Judge \n     Shedd exercising his discretion objectively and fairly toward \n     those parties who have appeared before him.\n       I am grateful and appreciative of the support you have \n     shown for his nomination and hope that my comments and \n     insight will prove to be beneficial on his behalf.\n       Our State is fortunate to have been able to count on you as \n     a steward for its interests and I thank you for your tireless \n     efforts on behalf of our Country and State.\n           Yours truly,\n     Jonathan Harvey.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Simmons & Griffin, L.L.C.,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     Re Judge Dennis W. Shedd.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am a former United States Attorney \n     who now practices law in Columbia, South Carolina. Prior to \n     entering government service and private practice, I served as \n     a law clerk on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       Over the past twelve years, I have had the opportunity to \n     appear before Judge Dennis Shedd in criminal cases as both a \n     prosecutor and defense attorney. In addition, I have handled \n     numerous civil cases before Judge Shedd as a representative \n     of the plaintiff and defense.\n       In all of my litigation before Judge Shedd, I have found \n     him to be fair and impartial. He possesses the highest \n     integrity and intellect and always treats the attorneys and \n     litigants with the utmost respect.\n       In one particular civil matter, I represented an individual \n     non-party who was alleged to have donated blood contaminated \n     with the HIV virus. Judge Shedd handled this sensitive and \n     difficult matter with patience and care, protecting my \n     client's identity while affording all litigants their \n     adequate discovery rights. I was extremely impressed with the \n     thoughtful diligence Judge Shedd pursued in ensuring my \n     client's confidentiality while balancing the rights of the \n     parties.\n       I respectfully write in support of Judge Shedd's \n     confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fourth Circuit.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n       With kind regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n     John S. Simmons.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Hammer Hammer & Potterfield,\n\n                                  Columbia, SC, November 18, 2002.\n     Hon. Ernest Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Buildings,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings I am writing regarding consideration \n     of United States District Judge Dennis Shedd for a position \n     on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. As you know, I have \n     been a practicing South Carolina attorney for over thirty \n     (30) years. My practice primarily involves representation of \n     plaintiffs in civil litigation, including representation of \n     numerous individuals in employment disputes.\n       I have known Judge Shedd for over twelve (12) years. I have \n     found Judge Shedd to be firm, just and deliberate in all of \n     my dealings with him. He is a man of highest integrity and I \n     would respectfully urge your support of his confirmation.\n       With kind regards, I remain,\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              HOWARD HAMMER, P.A.,\n                                     HAMMER, HAMMER & POTTERFIELD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the 107th Congress concludes, it is time \nto reflect on the important work we have performed for the American \npeople. In the past few days, the full Senate voted on 20 of the \nnominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee in addition to \nthe 80 judicial nominations previously confirmed. Since the change in \nmajority 16 months ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee has voted on 102 \nof President George W. Bush's judicial nominees and has held hearings \non 103 judicial nominations, some of whom have proven to be quite \ncontroversial and divisive. We voted on 102 of them, reported 100 of \nthem favorably and this week the full Senate took the final step of \nconfirming the last of these 100 nominees. This remarkable record \ncompares most favorably to the 38 judicial confirmations averaged per \nyear during the 6\\1/2\\ years when the Republican majority was in \ncontrol of the Senate.\n  Last week, on the Senate floor, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed \nmore judges in just 1 day than the Republican majority allowed to be \nconfirmed in the entire 1996 session. In that year, the Republican \nmajority allowed only 17 district court judges to be confirmed all year \nand would not confirm any circuit court nominees, not one. In contrast, \nlast Thursday the Senate acted to confirm 17 district court nominations \nand, in addition, another circuit court nominee. In all, the Senate has \nconfirmed 17 circuit court nominees and 83 district court nominees in \njust 16 months. That should put our historic demonstration of \nbipartisanship toward this President's judicial nominees in \nperspective.\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\n  The hard, thankless, but steady work of the Democratic members of the \nJudiciary Committee have served to reduce judicial vacancies \nsubstantially during these last 16 months. We inherited 110 vacancies. \nToday, after 100 district and circuit court confirmations, those \nvacancies number only 58 and that takes into account the additional 47 \nvacancies that have arisen since the shift in majority. Without those \nadditional vacancies, we would have reduced our inherited judicial \nvacancies to 10.\n  When Senator Hatch was chairman of the committee and a Democratic \nPresident occupied the White House, Senator Hatch denied that even 100 \nvacancies was a vacancies crisis, according to a column he wrote for \nthe September 5, 1997, edition of USA Today. When a Democrat was in the \nWhite House, Senator Hatch repeatedly stated that 67 vacancies was the \nequivalent of ``full employment'' in the Federal judiciary. As of \ntoday, there are only 58 district and circuit vacancies total. By \nSenator Hatch's standards, we have reached well beyond ``full \nemployment'' on the Federal bench in just 16 months.\n  Since the summer of 2001, when they allowed the Judiciary Committee \nto reorganize following the change in majority, we have moved more \nquickly and more fairly. Democrats have worked hard to confirm on \naverage six district and circuit court nominees per month. The \nRepublican rate of confirmation was half that during their prior years \nof control of the Senate, 3.2 confirmed per month in the 104th \nCongress, 4.25 in the 105th, and 3.04 per month in the 106th Congress. \nWe have moved nearly twice as fast as they did.\n  Partisans on the other side of aisle interested in trying to create \ncampaign issues have proclaimed their disappointment that a few \nnominees have not yet received votes in committee, despite our votes on \n102 judicial nominees and our having attained results in 16 months that \nthey did not come close to in twice the time during their last 30 \nmonths in the majority. I am concerned that the tone and language of \nhurtful remarks against the Democrats have been destructive. In truth, \nonly 11 of the remaining nominees who have not yet had hearings have \nhome State consent and peer review ratings, and some of those peer \nreview ratings have come in only in the last few weeks. We have thus \ngiven hearings to 90 percent of the nominees eligible for a hearing.\n  The vitriolic rhetoric regarding committee consideration of the most \ncontroversial and ideologically chosen judicial nominees is troubling \nto me as a Senator and as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I have \nworked diligently to hold a record number of 26 hearings for 103 of \nthis President's circuit and district court nominees in the past 16 \nmonths and to bring as many as we could to a vote, given all of the \ncompeting responsibilities of the committee and the Senate in these \ntimes of great challenges to our Nation. We have transcended the \ninaction of the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. For example, \nduring the 6\\1/2\\ years the Republicans chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee, in 34 of those months there were no confirmation hearings \nfor judicial nominations at all. In the past 16 months, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has held 26 hearings for 103 judicial nominees, in \naddition to a second hearing for one of the more controversial \nnominees. I think Democrats deserve some credit for our diligence, \nfairness, and bipartisanship especially in contrast to the prior period \nof Republican control of the Senate.\n  In particular, we have held hearings for 20 circuit court nominees, \nconfirmed 17 of them in this period, and reduced the circuit court \nvacancies from those we inherited. By contrast, circuit court vacancies \nmore than doubled during Republican control, from 16 in January 1995 to \n33 by the summer of 2001 when they allowed the Judiciary Committee to \nreorganize following the change in majority.\n  While the opposition party continues to inflame the public with \nskewed statistics, the reality is that we have approved far more \njudicial nominees for this President than past Senates did for other \nPresidents. This Democratic-led Senate has confirmed 100 district court \nand circuit court judges, including 17 circuit court nominees. In \nPresident George H.W. Bush's first 2 years in office, 71 judicial \nnominees were confirmed by the Democratic-led Senate. When a Republican \nmajority was considering Senator Clinton's nominees in their first 2 \nyears working together, 75 judicial nominees were confirmed. Even when \na Republican majority was considering President Reagan's judicial \nnominations in his first 2 years, only 89 judicial nominees were \nconfirmed. Thus, we have not only exceeded the confirmation achieved \nwhen the Senate and White House were divided by political party but the \nnumber of confirmations when Republicans controlled both branches. In \nless than 2 years, just 16 months, we have evaluated, held hearings \nfor, reported out, and confirmed 100 judicial nominees of President \nGeorge W. bush.\n  While Republicans continue to play base politics and inflame certain \nquarters of the public with their skewed statistics, the reality is \nthat the Democratic-led Senate has acted far more fairly toward this \nPresident's judicial nominees than Republicans acted toward President \nClinton's.\n  The raw numbers, not percentages, reveal the true workload of the \nSenate on nominations and everyone knows that. Anyone who pays \nattention to the Federal judiciary and who does not have a partisan \nagenda must know that. Democrats have moved more quickly in voting on \njudicial nominees of a President of a different party than in any time \nin recent history. This should be beyond dispute, but I believe that \npartisan advisers told this President and the Republicans that it is a \ngreat election issue for them to complain that not every nominee has \nbeen confirmed. We have given hearings to 103 of the 114 judicial \nnominees now eligible for a hearing 90 percent, as of today, for those \nfocused on percentages. The remaining 16 without a hearing either lack \nhome State consent or peer reviews or both. Many of those were \nnominated only recently and are being used by Republicans to skew the \npercentages further because they know that the ABA is taking about 60 \ndays to submit ratings from the date of nomination and some would not \nreceive ratings in time for hearings this session. The committee has \nvoted on 102 of the 103 judicial nominees eligible for a vote, 99 \npercent. And with the vote on Judge Dennis Sheed, we have cleared the \nSenate calendar of all judicial nominations rather than adopt the \nrecent Republican practice of holding nominees over without a final \nvote and forcing them to be renominated and have second hearings in a \nsucceeding Congress.\n  I ask fair-minded people to contrast what we have achieved in the \npast 16 months with the most recent period of Republican control of the \ncommittee. In all of 2000 and the first several months of 2001 before \nthe change in Senate majority, the Senate confirmed only 39 judicial \nnominees, including eight to the circuits. Even if you look at the last \n30 months of Republican control, they confirmed only 72 judges. In much \nless time, we have confirmed 100.\n  If you consider the first 24-months of Republican control instead of \ntheir last 30 months we have accomplished far more: more hearings, 26 \nversus 18, far more judicial nominees, 103 versus 87, and had more \nconfirmations, 100, including 17 to the circuit courts, versus 73 with \n11 to the circuit courts. We have reached the 100 mark for committee \nvotes in less than half the time it took Republicans to vote on 100 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees. It took them 33 months to reach \nthat mark, while we reached that mark in just 15 months.\n  With these confirmations, the Democratic-led Senate has addressed a \nnumber of long standing vacancies. For example, we held the first \nhearing for a nominee to the Fifth Circuit in 7 years and confirmed \nher, even though Republicans refused to allow hearings for 3 of \nPresident Clinton's nominees to this court. We held the first hearing \nfor a nominee to the Tenth Circuit in 6 years, and confirmed 3 nominees \nto that circuit in less than 1 year, even though two of President \nClinton's nominees to that circuit were never allowed hearings by \nRepublicans. We confirmed the first nominee to the Sixth Circuit in \nalmost 5 years and have now confirmed two judges to that court, even \nthough three of President Clinton's nominees to that court were never \nallowed hearings or votes. We held the first hearing for a nominee to\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\nthe fourth Circuit in 3 years, and confirmed the first African American \nappointed to that court in American history, even though that nominee \nand 6 other nominees of President Clinton to the Fourth Circuit, for a \ntotal of 7 in that circuit alone, never received hearings during \nRepublican control of the Senate. Today, another of President Bush's \nnominees was confirmed to that circuit. These are just a few of the \nfirsts we have achieved in just 16 months.\n  There were many other firsts in courts across the Nation. For \nexample, we held hearings for and confirmed the first judges appointed \nto the Federal courts in the Western District of Pennsylvania in almost \n7 years, even though several of President Clinton's nominees to the \ncourts in that district were blocked by Republicans. They allowed none \nof President Clinton's nominees to be confirmed to that court during \nthe entire period of Republican control. They also blocked the \nconfirmation of a Pennsylvania nominee to the Third Circuit, among \nothers. Democrats confirmed the first nominees to the Third Circuit and \nNinth Circuit in 2 years, even though the last nominees to those seats \nnever received hearings during Republican control of the Senate.\n  We have had hearings for a number of controversial judicial nominees \nand brought many of them to votes this year just as I said we would \nwhen I spoke to the Senate at the beginning of the year. Of course, it \nwould have been irresponsible to ignore the number of vacancies we \ninherited and concentrate solely on the most controversial, time \nconsuming nominees to the detriment of our Federal courts. The \nPresident has made a number of divisive choices for lifetime seats on \nthe courts and they take time to bring to a hearing and a vote. None of \nhis nominees, however, have waited as long for a hearing or a vote as \nsome of President Clinton's judicial nominees, such as Judge Richard \nPaez who waited 1,500 days to be confirmed and 1,237 days to get a \nfinal vote by the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee or \nJudge Helene White whose nomination languished for more than 1,500 \nwithout ever getting a hearing or a committee vote.\n  As frustrated as Democrats were with the lengthy delays and \nobstruction of scores of judicial nominees in the prior 6\\1/2\\ years of \nRepublican control, we never attacked the chairman of the committee in \nthe manner as was done in recent weeks. Similarly, as disappointed as \nDemocrats were with the refusal of Chairman Hatch to include Allen \nSnyder, Bonnie Campbell, Clarence Sundram, Fred Woocher, and other \nnominees on an agenda for a vote by the committee following their \nhearings, we never resorted to the tactics and tone used by Republican \nmembers of this committee in committee statements, in hallway \ndiscussions, in press conferences, or in Senate floor statements. As \nfrustrated and disappointed as we were that the Republican majority \nrefused to proceed with hearings or votes on scores of judicial \nnominees, we never sought to override Senator Hatch's judgments and \nauthority as chairman of the committee.\n  The President and partisan Republicans have spared no efforts in \nmaking judicial nominations a political issue, without acknowledging \nthe progress made in these past months when 102 of this President's \njudicial choices have been given committee votes. One indication of the \nfairness with which we have proceeded is my willingness to proceed on \nnominations that I do not support. We have perhaps moved too quickly on \nsome, relaxing the standards for personal behavior and lifestyle for \nRepublican nominees, being more expeditious and generous than \nRepublicans were to our nominees, and trying to take some of them at \ntheir word that they will follow the law and the ethical rules for \njudges.\n  For example, as I noted on October 2, 2002, we confirmed a personal \nfriend of the President's, Ron Clark, to an emergency vacancy in the \nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Clark's \ncommission was not signed and issued promptly. We learned later that \nClark was quoted as saying that he asked the White House, and the White \nHouse agreed, to delay signing his commission while he ran as a \nRepublican for reelection to a seat in the Texas legislature so that he \ncould help Republicans keep a majority in the Texas State House until \nthe end of the session in mid-2003. The White House was apparently \ncomplicit in these unethical partisan actions by a person confirmed to \na lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. Clark, who was confirmed \nto a seat on the Federal district court in Texas, was actively \ncampaigning for election despite his confirmation.\n\n  These actions bring discredit to the court to which Judge Clark was \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and calls into \nquestion Judge Clark's ability to put aside his partisan roots and be \nan impartial adjudicator of cases. Even in his answers under oath to \nthis committee, he swore that if he were ``confirmed'' he would follow \nthe ethnical rules. Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges explicitly provides that the code applies to ``judges and \nnominees for judicial office'' and Canon 7 provides quite clearly that \npartisan political activity is contrary to ethical rules. In his \nanswers to me, the chairman of this committee, Clark promised \n``[s]hould I be confirmed as a judge, my role will be different than \nthat of a legislator.'' As the Commentary to the Code of Conduct for \nUnited States Judges, (which applies to judges and nominees), states, \n``Deference to the judgments and rulings of courts depends upon public \nconfidence in the integrity and independence of judges [which] depend \nin turn upon their acting without fear or favor. Although judges should \nbe independent, they should comply with the law as well as the \nprovisions of this Code.'' The code sets standards intended to help \nensure that the public has access to Federal courts staffed with judges \nwho not only appear to be fair but are actually so.\n  Yet he was flouting the standards set by the code and the promises he \nmade to me personally and to the Senate Judiciary Committee and, by \nproxy, to the Senate as a whole. That the White House was prepared to \ngo along with these shenanigans reveals quite clearly the political way \nthey approach judicial nominations. Only after the New York Times \nreported these unseemly actions, did the President sign Judge Clark's \nappointment papers. As Judge Clark hoped, he ``won'' the election and \nso the Republican Governor of Texas may be able to name a Republican to \nreplace him in the state legislature.\n  With a White House that is politicizing the Federal courts and making \nso many divisive nominations, especially to the circuit courts, to \nappease the far-right wing of the Republican party, it would be \nirresponsible for us to turn a blind eye to this and simply rubber-\nstamp such appointees to lifetime seats. Advice and consent does not \nmean giving the President carte blanche to pack the courts with \nideologues from the right or left. The system of checks and balances in \nour Constitution does not give the power to make lifetime appointments \nto one person alone to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream and whose decisions would further divide our \nnation.\n  I have worked hard to bring to a vote the overwhelming majority of \nthis President's judicial nominees, but we cannot afford to make errors \nin these lifetime appointments out of haste or sentimental \nconsiderations, however well intentioned. To help smooth the \nconfirmation process, I have gone out of my way to encourage the White \nHouse to work in a bipartisan way with the Senate, like past \nPresidents, but, in all too many instances, they have chosen to bypass \nbipartisanship cooperation in favor of partisanship and a campaign \nissue. Arbitrary deadlines will not ensure that nominees will be \nfairminded judges who are not activists or ideologues. The American \npeople have a right to expect the Federal courts to be fair forums and \nnot bastions of favoritism on the right or the left. These are the only \nlifetime appointments in our whole government, and they matter a great \ndeal to our future. I will continue to work hard to ensure the \nindependence of our Federal judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11524-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11524-S11530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the ayes are 85, the nays are \n12. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on final passage of \nH.R. 3210, the conference report to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of \n2002. Most of us agree that something needs to be done in this area. \nThis legislation is important to our economy and the many jobs and \nconstruction projects that have been in limbo due to the uncertainty \nfollowing the tragic events of September 11th. My constituents have \ncome to me on multiple occasions, imploring that the Senate act on this \nissue. They are genuinely concerned about the negative impact lack of \ncoverage has had on their businesses and their employees. Without \ninsurance, our economic growth is in jeopardy, businesses will fail and \njobs will be lost. For that reason, I will support final passage.\n  However, I am concerned that we have not addressed the issue in a \nprudent and responsible manner that provides the appropriate stability \nto our economy without exposing our taxpayers to an unreasonable \nfinancial burden. In this legislation, we have failed to provide \nelements that are necessary to the businesses that are themselves the \nvictims of the terrorist attacks, those very same businesses that \nprovide the thousands of jobs in this country that we are seeking to \npreserve. Moreover, I have concerns about implementing a program such \nas this without ensuring that the hardworking taxpayers in this county \nare not forced to pick up the tab for the overzealous and unrestrained \ntrial bar. With the type of litigation that would likely result from \nmassive losses, even just from one attack, it defies common sense that \nsome would oppose implementing principles of litigation management to \nensure that all victims get treated fairly and jury awards, based more \non emotion rather than actual legal culpability, do not dry up the \nresources of defendant businesses, which in turn hurts victims, \nemployees and taxpayers.\n  In a letter dated June 10, 2000, from the Treasury Department and \nsigned by not only the Secretary of the Treasury, but the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget, the Director of the National \nEconomic Council and the Director of Economic Advisers really \nunderscores the serious ramifications to our economy that have resulted \nfrom a lack of coverage for terrorist acts and supports Congressional \naction in this area. But it also emphasizes that we must do so in a \nresponsible manner.\n\n       One important issue for the availability of terrorism \n     insurance is the risk of unfair or excessive litigation \n     against American companies following an attack. Many for-\n     profit and charitable companies have been unable to obtain \n     affordable and adequate insurance, in part because of the \n     risk that they will be unfairly sued for the acts of \n     international terrorists . . . It makes little economic sense \n     to pass a terrorism insurance bill that leaves our economy \n     exposed to such inappropriate and needless legal uncertainty. \n     [emphasis added]\n\n  In seeking to provide stability to our economy we must not act \nirresponsibly. The conference report on H.R. 3210, while providing a \nnecessary backstop to our economy, includes some weaknesses that \nconcern me. While I believe this measure is necessary and should be \nenacted as soon as possible, I sincerely hope this body will address my \nconcerns in the next Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the \nconference report to H.R. 3210, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. When \nthe Senate first considered this bill in June, I expressed the hope \nthat Congress would send the President a bill that was fair and \nbalanced with respect to basic liability protections for all victims of \nterrorism. However, I believe that the conference report before us \nfails to provide reasonable restrictions on lawsuit liability, and \ninstead exposes the American taxpayer to potentially excessive costs of \nunmitigated litigation as a result of terrorist attacks beyond anyone's \ncontrol. Consequently, I am reluctant to vote for final passage of this \nconference report.\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n  I am glad that the final version of the terrorism reinsurance \nlegislation is only a temporary fix. As a general matter, the \nGovernment should not be in the business of writing claims.\n  Some have implied that we wrongly predicted an insurance crisis \nfollowing the events of September 11, 2001, which was the reason for \nthis temporary backstop. The insurance companies have survived without \ngovernment support thus far, and banks are still lending where there is \nuncovered risks. According to the Wall Street Journal, ``the economy \nhas continued to grow, albeit slowly, and some companies have started \noffering insurance again, albeit at very high premiums.'' The article \nstates that a short-term solution would be nice, but the bill is ``a \nbonanza for the trial lawyers, an entitlement for insurers.''\n  Again, I do not believe that this legislation contains adequate \nliability protections. While some restrictions were negotiated in \nconference, I don't believe that they go far enough. Basically, \nAmerican companies that are themselves victims of terrorists acts \nshould not be subject to predatory lawsuits or unfair and excessive \npunitive damages. If that happens, not only will Americans be the \nvictims of another attack, but the taxpayers will be the victims of \ntrial lawyers who will seek the deepest pocket and rush to the \ncourthouse to sue anyone regardless of fault. There needs to be careful \nrestrictions on lawsuit liability to protect taxpayer funds from being \nexposed to opportunistic, predatory assaults on the United States \nTreasury.\n  In fact, I agree with an editorial in the Washington Post: the other \nside of the aisle should be ``embarrassed by their efforts to defend \ntrial lawyers at the expense of the American economy.'' Rather, we \nshould be working to enforce the long-standing Federal policies behind \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act: namely, that lawyers should not be making \nhandsome profits when they are paid from the U.S. Treasury. I agree \nwith a statement made by House Judiciary Chairman Sensenbrenner, that \n``especially today, in a time of war, excessive lawyer fees drawn from \nthe U.S. Treasury should not be allowed to result in egregious war \nprofiteering at the expense of victims, jobs and businesses.''\n  Many say we can come back and revisit these provisions later. I say \nwe get it right the first time we sign it into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the Wall Street Journal article to \nwhich I referred in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 6, 2002]\n\n                      A Terrifying Insurance Deal\n\n\n      A bonanza for the trial lawyers, an entitlement for insurers\n\n       After the elections the 107th Congress is threatening to \n     return to pass some unfinished business, including a \n     compromise on terrorism insurance. Having looked at the \n     details of the insurance deal, we can only hope they'll all \n     stay home.\n       The two parties have been battling for a year over this \n     bill, especially the extent to which trial lawyers could \n     profit from acts of terror. Republicans and some Democrats \n     want to ban punitive damages against property owners. But Tom \n     Daschle, carrying his usual two oceans of water for the \n     plaintiff's bar, resisted any erosion in the right to sue the \n     owner should a plane crash into his or her building.\n       And it looks like Mr. Daschle has prevailed. The compromise \n     permits such suits, albeit before a single federal court as \n     opposed to the more accommodating state courts. In other \n     words, the White House appears to have caved, and after \n     months of arguing the opposite now says terror insurance is \n     about ``jobs, not tort reform.''\n       Well, we're not sure it's still about jobs either. The bill \n     makes insurance companies liable for claims amounting to a \n     certain percentage of their premiums, puts the government on \n     the hook for 90% of losses over that deductible, and allows \n     the government to recover some portion of its payment by \n     levying a surcharge on all policy owners. The best news is \n     that government help sunsets in 2005, or at least that's the \n     promise.\n       Unfortunately, the bill ignores the crucial problem of \n     risk. Risk-based premiums--which reward the careful and \n     punish the careless--are a superb tool for reducing risk. \n     Consider: There are lots of things property owners can do to \n     reduce the damage from terrorism--retrofitting air-filtration \n     systems to guard against biological agents, redesigning \n     underground parking garages to prevent bomb attacks, \n     fireproofing steel girders to minimize fire damage. And \n     insurance companies can discipline them to take these \n     measures by charging risk-based premiums.\n       If insurers were required to pay premiums to the government \n     based on the premiums they receive, market incentives to \n     reduce risk would improve markedly. If, on the other hand, \n     terror insurance is essentially free, as it would be under \n     the current bill, insurers have less incentive to charge the \n     full cost of risk; instead they have every incentive to \n     underprice it.\n       An alternative has been suggested by David Moss, an \n     economist at Harvard Business School: Let the federal \n     government pay 80% of losses from a terrorist attack, as long \n     as insurers also pass along 80% of the premiums they collect. \n     This way, says Mr. Moss, insurers would price risk near or at \n     its full cost, exerting discipline against the careless, and \n     prices would be set in the private market.\n       We mention Mr. Moss's idea because, despite heavy breathing \n     by the insurance industry, it isn't at all clear that there's \n     an immediate economic need for this legislation. It's true \n     that right after 9/11 the property insurance market seized \n     up. Insurers didn't know how to price for the risk of another \n     attack, and so rent their garments that the economy would \n     collapse without government reinsurance. We were also open to \n     the idea, but it turns out they were wrong. The economy has \n     continued to grow, albeit slowly, and some companies have \n     started offering insurance again, albeit at very high \n     premiums.\n       We aren't arguing that a federal backstop might not perk up \n     business in the short term, or that some sort of insurance \n     wouldn't be nice to have in place before another attack. But \n     the assertion that billions of dollars of projects have been \n     shelved and 300,000 jobs lost is bogus. Despite efforts to \n     quantify a slowdown, including a survey by the Fed, evidence \n     of suffering is scattered and anecdotal--and mostly confined \n     to trophy properties.\n       The bigger point here is that any legislation is likely to \n     be permanent, since no entitlement of this size has ever been \n     allowed to ride quietly into the sunset. That argues for \n     doing it right, and waiting until the next Congress if need \n     be. Many Republicans are privately unhappy with the deal the \n     White House has cut with Mr. Daschle. We hope they'll urge \n     President Bush to insist on something better.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this conference \nreport includes bipartisan legislation that I authored with my \ncolleague, Senator Allen of Virginia, which will make state sponsors of \nterrorism and their agents literally pay for the dastardly attacks they \nperpetrate on innocent Americans.\n  Last June, the Senate approved our amendment to the terrorism \ninsurance bill on an 81 to 3 vote to mandate that at least $3.7 billion \nin blocked assets of foreign state sponsors of terrorism and their \nagents, at the current disposal of the U.S. Treasury Department, be \nused--first and foremost--to compensate American victims of their \nterrorist attacks. That lop-sided vote made it very clear that most \nAmericans and their elected representatives understand the importance \nof making the rogue governments who sponsor international terrorism pay \nliterally, instead of blithely dunning the American taxpayer to \ncompensate the victims of their outrageous attacks or doing nothing.\n  Our global struggle against terrorism must be fought and won on \nmultiple fronts. In so doing, we cannot forget that terrorist attacks \nare ultimately stories of human tragedy. The young woman from Waverly, \nIA--Kathryn Koob--seeking to build cross-cultural ties between the \nIranian people and the American people only to be held captive for 444 \ndays in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The teenage boy from LeClaire, \nIowa--Taleb Subh--who was visiting family in Kuwait in 1990, and who \nwas terrorized by Saddam Hussein and Iraqi troops in the early stages \nof the invasion of Kuwait. The U.S. aid worker from Virginia--Charles \nHegna--who was tortured and killed in 1984 by Iranian-backed hijackers \nin order ``to punish'' the United States. These are only a few of the \nAmerican families victimized by terrorist attacks abroad I have come to \nknow. There is not a Senator in this body who cannot count additional \nAmerican victims of state-sponsored terrorism among his or her \nconstituents.\n  What do we say to these families, the wives, mothers and fathers, \nsons and daughters? More importantly, what can we do, as legislators \nand policymakers, to mitigate their suffering and to answer their cries \nfor justice?\n  Those who sponsor as well as those who commit these inhumane acts \nmust pay a price. That is why I sponsored the Terrorism Victim's Access \nto Compensation Act, whose key provisions are included in this \nconference agreement.\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n  In 1996, the Congress passed an important law--the Anti-Terrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act--with bipartisan support and with the \nsupport of the U.S. State Department. That statute allows American \nvictims of state-sponsored terrorism to seek redress and pursue justice \nin our Federal courts. A central purpose of that law is to make the \ninternational terrorists and their sponsors pay an immediate price for \ntheir attacks on innocent Americans abroad. For the first time starting \nin 1996, the money of foreign sponsors of terrorism and their agents \nthat is frozen bank accounts in the United States and under the direct \ncontrol of the U.S. Treasury was to have become available to compensate \nAmerican victims of state-sponsored terrorism who bring lawsuits in \nfederal court and win judgments on the merits against the perpetrators \nof such attacks.\n  The law enacted in 1996 only applies to seven foreign governments \nofficially designated by the U.S. State Department as state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism. They are the governments of Iran, Iraq, Libya, \nSyria, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba. It is these state sponsors of \ninternational terrorism, not the American taxpayer, who must be \ncompelled first and foremost to compensate the American victims of \ntheir inhumane attacks.\n\n  The U.S. Treasury Department currently and lawfully controls at least \n$3.7 billion in blocked or frozen assets of these seven state sponsors \nof terrorism. But some officials of the U.S. Treasury and State \nDepartments who think they know better, until now, have been flaunting \nthe law, ignoring the clear intent of the Congress, and opposing the \nuse of these blocked assets of Saddam Hussein, the ruling mullahs in \nIran, and other state sponsors of terrorism to compensate American \nvictims of terrorist attacks. In fact, in the on-going case involving \nthe 53 Americans taken hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979 and \nheld in captivity for 444 days and their families, U.S. Justice \nDepartment and State Department attorneys have intervened in federal \ncourt to have their lawsuit dismissed in its entirety, thus de facto \nsiding with the Government of Iran.\n  Incredibly, since 1996 American victims of state-sponsored terrorism \nhave been actively encouraged to seek redress and compensation in our \nfederal courts. These long-suffering American families have complied \nwith all requirements of existing U.S. law and many have actually won \ncourt-ordered judgments, only to be denied any compensation and what \nlittle justice they seek in a court of law. The opponents of this \nlegislation apparently want American taxpayers to foot the bill for \nwhat could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars instead of making \nthe terrorists and their sponsors pay.\n  With the passage of this new legislation, the Congress is requiring \nthat this misguided policy be abandoned. Holding the blocked assets of \nstate sponsors of terrorism in perpetuity might make sense in the \npristine world of high diplomacy, but not in the real world after the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks on America.\n  First, paying American victims of terrorism from the blocked and \nfrozen assets of these rogue governments and their agents will really \npunish and impose a heavy cost on those aiding and abetting the \nterrorists. This tougher U.S. policy will provide a new, powerful \ndisincentive for any foreign government to continue sponsoring \nterrorist attacks on Americans, while also discouraging any regimes \ntempted to get into the ugly business of sponsoring future terrorist \nattacks.\n  Second, making the state sponsors actually lose billions of dollars \nwill more effectively deter future acts of terrorism than keeping their \nassets blocked or frozen in perpetuity in pursuit of the delusion that \nlong-standing, undemocratic, brutish governments like those in Iran and \nIraq can be moderated.\n  Third, American victims of state-sponsored terrorism and their \nfamilies will finally be able to secure some measure of justice and \ncompensation. Public condemnation by the U.S. Government of state-\nsponsored terrorism only goes so far. This new legislation enables \nAmerican victims to fight back, to hold the terrorists who are \nresponsible accountable to the rule of law, and to make the \nperpetrators and their sponsors pay a heavy price.\n  In his last days in office, former President Clinton signed a law \nendorsing a policy of paying American victims of terrorism from blocked \nassets, while simultaneously signing a waiver of the means to make this \npolicy work. The Bush administration has not changed this mistaken \npolicy as yet. That is why Senator Allen joined me in pushing this \nbipartisan legislation to establish two new policy cornerstones for our \nNation's struggle against international terrorism. First, the U.S. will \nfirst require that compensation be paid from the blocked and frozen \nassets of the state sponsors of terrorism in cases where American \nvictims of terrorism secure a final judgment in our Federal courts and \nare awarded compensation. Second, the U.S. Government will provide a \nlevel playing field for all American victims of state-sponsored \nterrorism who are pursuing redress by providing equal access to our \nfederal courts.\n  American victims of state-sponsored terrorism deserve and want to be \ncompensated for their losses from those who perpetrated the attacks \nupon them, including our former hostages in Iran and their families. \nThe Congress should clear the way for them to get some satisfaction of \ncourt-ordered judgments and, in so doing, help deter future acts of \nstate-sponsored terrorism against innocent Americans.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \nconference report on H.R. 3210, the terrorism insurance bill.\n  I had hoped that Congress would approve legislation that encouraged \nbuilding construction, gave business owners limited liability \nprotection in the event of a terrorist attack, and protected taxpayers \nfrom exorbitant costs. These goals were all enunciated by President \nBush when he pressed Congress to act on this issue after months of \ndelay.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation in its current form fails to meet any \nof those objectives.\n  First, the conference report subjects victims of terrorism to \npotentially unlimited liability by placing no restrictions on court \nawards of punitive damages or non-economic damages. This has the \npotential of encouraging a slew of frivolous lawsuits against business \nowners whose business may be destroyed in terrorist attacks. Certainly \nno business that was located in the World Trade Center, for example, \nshould be held at fault for the unforeseeable tragedy that took place \non September 11.\n  As several of the President's economic advisors noted in a June 10, \n2002 letter to Senate Minority Leader Lott, ``the victims of terrorism \nshould not have to pay punitive damages. Punitive damages are designed \nto punish criminal or near-criminal wrongdoing.'' The letter goes on to \nsay ``the availability of punitive damages in terrorism cases would \nresult in inequitable relief for injured parties, threaten bankruptcies \nfor American companies and a loss of jobs for American workers.''\n  I strongly agree with that position and am troubled that the \nconferees did not take these concerns into account before bringing this \nlegislation to the Senate floor.\n  Additionally, I am concerned that this legislation leaves taxpayers \nopen to liability for terrorist attacks. One of the original goals of \nthis bill was to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to sign off on \nout-of-court settlements to protect the taxpayers from exorbitant \ncosts. Without such a provision, taxpayers, who are liable for as much \nas 90 percent of property and casualty costs after a terrorist attack, \ncould be gouged by trial attorneys. That is primarily because insurers, \nwith only a ten percent stake in the outcome of litigation, will favor \nfaster, rather than fairer, settlements--at the taxpayers' expense.\n  Of additional concern, the low per-company deductibles will impede \nthe development of a private reinsurance market and will increase the \nlikelihood that this temporary federal program becomes permanent. Since \nthe Federal Government limits each company's liability, rather than \nthat of the entire industry, insurance companies have less incentive to \nspread their risk.\n  I am also troubled by certain provisions in Title II of this \nlegislation covering victim compensation through\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nseized assets from terrorists and terrorist-sponsoring states. As the \nconference report stands now, this provision would create a race to the \ncourthouse benefiting a small group of Americans over a far larger \ngroup of victims just as deserving of compensation.\n  Economic sanctions against terrorist states have kept the economic \nactivity of those states to a minimum. Yet this limited pool of frozen \nassets and diplomatic property would be exhausted quickly as large, and \noften uncontested, compensatory and punitive damage awards are \nsatisfied, leaving most victims with nothing. For example, the special \nprovisions for terrorism victims of Iran expands the number of judgment \nholders eligible for payment under the 2000 Act (to approximately \neight), but metes out all of the approximately $30 million remaining in \nthe fund to satisfy judgments in only two cases. And there are a number \nof ongoing lawsuits by terrorism victims and their families against \nIran that will be foreclosed under this agreement.\n  This section would also disproportionately benefit trial lawyers, \nsince plaintiff's lawyers whose fees are contingent upon satisfying \ntheir clients' judgments stand to gain the lion's share of the \ncompensation, not the victims.\n  Overall, this legislation is far from what President Bush wanted. It \nis a major disappointment that literally benefits trial lawyers at the \nexpense of the taxpayers.\n  I realize that many of my colleagues want to support this bill, \ndespite its flaws. And I understand that. It is regrettable that \nspecial-interest groups exerted so much influence in the drafting of \nthis legislation, leaving the President with a bill that amounts to \nlittle more than the best he could get from this Congress.\n  But as it stands today, I cannot ask Arizona taxpayers to absorb the \npotential losses they might incur because of the self-serving and \nunjustified lawsuits that are the all but inevitable outcome of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to address a portion of this \nconference agreement relating to enforcement of judgments obtained by \nvictims of terrorism against state sponsors of terrorism. These \nprovisions strike an important blow in our global struggle against \nterrorism.\n  The purpose of title II is to deal comprehensively with the problem \nof enforcement of judgments issued to victims of terrorism in any U.S. \ncourt by enabling them to satisfy such judgments from the frozen assets \nof terrorist parties. As the conference committee stated, this title \nestablishes, once and for all, that such judgments are to be enforced \nagainst any assets available in the U.S., and that the executive branch \nhas no statutory authority to defeat such enforcement under standard \njudicial processes, except as expressly provided in this act.\n  Title II expressly addresses three particular issues which have vexed \nvictims of terrorism in this context. First, there has been a dispute \nover the availability of ``agency and instrumentality'' assets to \nsatisfy judgments against a terrorist state itself. Let there be no \ndoubt on this point. Title II operates to strip a terrorist state of \nits immunity from execution or attachment in aid of execution by making \nthe blocked assets of that terrorist state, including the blocked \nassets of any of its agencies or instrumentalities, available for \nattachment and/or execution of a judgment issued against that terrorist \nstate. Thus, for purposes of enforcing a judgment against a terrorist \nstate, title II does not recognize any juridical distinction between a \nterrorist state and its agencies or instrumentalities.\n  Second, title II amends Section 2002 of the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2000 to address a miscarriage of justice in the \ndrafting and implementation of that act. In that provision, Congress \nhad directed that specified claimants against Iran receive payment in \nsatisfaction of judgments from two specified accounts, namely Iran's \nForeign Military Sales, ``FMS'', Trust Account and the proceeds of \nrental of certain Iranian government properties. Contrary to \nCongressional intent, the legislative language has been construed by \nthe Departments of State and Treasury to exclude unspecified claimants \nand to allow the executive branch to bar enforcement of their awards \nagainst other blocked assets. As one United States District Court has \nnoted, the result is a gross injustice that demands immediate \ncorrection.\n  To address this injustice, we are adding to the list of those to be \ncompensated, all persons who meet two criteria--either, 1, they had a \nclaim filed when Section 2002 was enacted and have already received a \nfinal judgment on that claim as of the date of enactment, or 2 were \nadded to the list by the State Department Reauthorization Bill enacted \nlast month. In accordance with amended Section 2002(b)(2)(B), each of \nthese claimants are to be treated as if they were originally included \nin Section 2002, and are to be paid an amount determined by the \nSecretary of the Treasury to have been available for payment of their \njudgment on the date their judgment was issued. Once these amounts are \npaid, any remaining amounts in these accounts are to be paid to \nremaining claimants under the formula specified in amended Section \n2002(d).\n\n  Moreover, to address this injustice, this amendment will treat all of \nthese victims--those originally included in Section 2002 and those now \nbeing added--equally to the maximum extent possible. No priority is \ngiven to one group or the other. Those in each group which have filed \ntimely lawsuits and received a final judgment by the enactment of this \nAct are to be paid within the strict deadlines set in the Act, i.e., \nwithin 60 days, without delay. Those not included within this time \nframe may pursue satisfaction from blocked assets. This will \nnecessarily include some who, for whatever reason, have failed to \nobtain a judgment in their lawsuit by the date of enactment of this \nact.\n  Third, the term ``blocked asset'' has been broadly defined to include \nany asset of a terrorist party that has been seized or frozen by the \nUnited States in accordance with law. This definition includes any \nasset with respect to which financial transactions are prohibited or \nregulated by the U.S. Treasury under any blocking order under the \nTrading With the Enemy Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct, or any proclamation, order, regulation, or license. Moreover, by \nincluding the phrase ``seized by the United States'' in this section, \nit is our intent to include within the definition of ``blocked asset'' \nany asset of a terrorist party that is held by the United States. This \nis intended as an explicit waiver of any principle of law under which \nthe United States might not be subject to service and enforcement of \nany judicial order or process relating to execution of judgments, or \nattachments in aid of such execution, in connection with terrorist \nparty assets that happen to be held by the United States. In this \nrespect, the United States is to be treated the same as any private \nparty or bank which holds assets of a terrorist party, and such \nterrorist party assets held by the United States are not immunized from \ncourt procedures to execute against such assets. However, any assets as \nto which the United States claims ownership are not included in the \ndefinition of ``blocked assets'' and are not subject to execution or \nattachment under this provision.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank all of the \nconferees for the long hours and late nights they here worked to \ncomplete this bill. I know this has been a difficult process and a long \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, now I kind myself in a very difficult position. I find \nmyself forced to oppose this legislation even though it is a \nPresidential priority and even though I support the underlying goals.\n  It was a little over a year ago that Senators Sarbanes, Gramm, Dodd, \nand I announced an agreement for terrorism risk insurance legislation. \nThat agreement outlined the parameters that we thought were a \nreasonable response to disruptions occurring in the marketplace as a \nresult of the lack of reinsurance. This agreement outlined very limited \nand specific liability protections that would protect both the \ntaxpayer's pocketbook and businesses which may themselves be victim's \nof terrorism from frivolous lawsuits after future terrorist attack.\n  These limited protections were: First, suits filed as a result of a \nterrorist attack would be consolidated\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\ninto a Federal district court; second, punitive damages would not be \nallowed; and third, the Secretary of the Treasury was given the ability \nto agree to out-of-court settlements.\n  Now, in this new conference report, two out of these three \nprotections have been eliminated. The new program in this conference \nreport will allow frivolous lawsuits to be filed against businesses \nthat may be victims of the terrorist act themselves. Think about a \nbusiness located in the World Trade Center on 9/11. This business was \ndestroyed and likely lost a number of its employees. The next thing \nthat happens is while attempting to rebuild, the business gets slapped \nwith a frivolous lawsuit by a greedy trial lawyer. It is ridiculous to \nbelieve that a business could have prevented an attack of this kind. \nYet this legislation will subject them to the will of the trial bar.\n  This conference report keeps America's businesses and the taxpayer \nsubject to punitive damages. I have a Statement of Administration \nPolicy from the executive Office of the President's Office of \nManagement and Budget. In the second paragraph of the letter dated June \n13, 2002, it states ``the Administration cannot support enactment of \nany terrorism insurance bill that leaves the Nation's economy and \nvictims of terrorist acts subject to predatory lawsuits and punitive \ndamages.'''\n  Also from the administration, I have a letter signed by Treasury \nSecretary O'Neill, OMB Director Daniels, Director of the National \nEconomic Council Lindsey, and Director of the Council of Economic \nAdvisors Glenn Hubbard dated June 10, 2002. This letter states ``the \nvictims of terrorism should not have to pay punitive damages. Punitive \ndamages are designed to punish criminal or near-criminal worngdoing.'' \nIt goes on the say ``the availability of punitive damages in terrorism \ncases would in inequitable relief for injured parties, threaten \nbankruptcies for American companies and a loss of jobs for American \nworkers.'' I could not agree more with the administration's position \nfrom just a few months ago that this legislation could lead to the \nbankruptcies of American companies who were victims of terrorist acts \nthemselves.\n  In addition, this conference report does not include a provision \nwhich allows the Secretary of the treasury to agree to out-of-court \nsettlements. This legislation has the American taxpayer pay potentially \n90 percent of property and casualty costs after a terrorist attack. I \ncan think of no other instance where the group liable for paying 90 \npercent of a lawsuit is unable to agree to an out-of-court settlement. \nIf another catastrophic terrorist attack occurs, every trial lawyer in \nAmerica will file a lawsuit because they know that the insurance \ncompany, which only pays 10 percent of the settlement, will agree \nimmediately. The mansions of the trial lawyers will be built with the \ndollars of the American taxpayer.\n  I do not consider the inclusion of these protections to be extreme \nmeasures and I do not think that most of the members of this chamber \nbelieve them to be unreasonable. They are very simple and reasonable \nprotections that basically say the trial bar should not take advantage \nof tragedies caused by terrorists.\n  The President invited Senate Republican conferees to the White House \na few weeks ago where concerns were raised regarding the lack of these \nspecific taxpayer protections. Unfortunately, these protections were \nnot reintroduced into the legislation and now this conference report \ncomes to the floor of the Senate without a single Senate Republican \nconferee's signature.\n  For these reasons, I am unable to support passage of this \nlegislation. I support the program and understand the possible economic \nproblems by not passing the legislation. I cannot in good faith subject \nthe hard-working taxpayers of Wyoming to the potential losses they \nmight incur because of the self-serving and unjustified lawsuits which \nmay result.\n  However, even though I cannot support this bill because of the lack \nof taxpayer protections, I would like to commend those who have worked \nso diligently on the legislation for over a year now. Senator Dodd, in \nparticular, has given more time and effort to this project than \nprobably anyone. He and his staff, Alex Sternhell, have remained \ncommitted to seeing the passage of this legislation and have done \nremarkable work to bring the issues that relate to the structure of the \nprogram to a compromise. I have to say that I agree with Senator Dodd's \nposition on the structure of the program and always felt confident in \nthe manner which he negotiated these provisions.\n  Mr. President, my position on this legislation has not changed since \nthe very beginning. I believe we need a Federal backstop and I believe \nat one point we had a bill that did just that. I am sorry the trial bar \nwas able to derail the bill for over a year now. I can only hope that \nthe trial lawyers of America will stop to realize that subjecting \nAmericans to lawsuits to line their pockets after the devastation of a \nterrorist attack is simply the wrong thing to do .\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this conference \nreport to provide a federal backstop for terrorism insurance. I believe \nthis bipartisan bill will boost our economy by providing extra \nprotection against terrorist attacks for buildings and construction \nprojects with resulting new jobs in Vermont and across the nation. I \nagree with President Bush that this legislation is essential for our \nfuture economic growth.\n  I worked with the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Sarbanes, Senator Schumer and others to craft a balanced \ncompromise in the conference report on legal procedures for civil \nactions involving acts of terrorism covered by the legislation. The \nconference report protects the rights of future terrorism victims and \ntheir families while providing federal court jurisdiction of civil \nactions related to acts of terrorism, consolidating of such cases on a \npre-trial and trial basis, and excluding punitive damages from \ngovernment-backed insurance coverage under the bill. These provisions \ndo not limit the accountability of a private party for its actions in \nany way.\n  Further, the conference report, identical to the Senate-passed bill, \nfully protects federal taxpayers from paying for punitive damage \nawards. Under the conference report only corporate wrongdoers pay \npunitive damages, not U.S. taxpayers as some incorrectly claimed on the \nSenate floor during consideration of the Senate-passed bill.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has declared that the conference report \n``will improve the legal rights of plaintiffs and defendants and, \nimportantly, will help American workers and the economy.'' I agree.\n  I thank the conferees for rejecting the special legal protections in \nthe House-passed bill. The liability limits for future terrorist \nattacks in the House-passed bill were irresponsible because they \nrestricted the legal rights of victims and their families and \ndiscouraged private industry from taking appropriate precautions to \npromote public safety. Restricting damages against a wrongdoer in \nterrorism-related civil actions involving personal injury or death, for \nexample, could discourage corporations from taking the necessary \nprecautions to prevent loss of life or limb in a future terrorist \nattack. There is no need to enact these special legal protections and \ntake away the legal rights of victims of terrorism and their families.\n  For example, the House-passed bill would have permitted a security \nfirm to be protected from punitive damages if the private firm hired \nincompetent employees or deliberately failed to check for weapons and a \nterrorist act resulted.\n  The threat of punitive damages is a major deterrent to wrongdoing. \nEliminating punitive damages under the House-passed bill would have \nseverely undercut this deterrent and permitted reckless or malicious \ndefendants to find it more cost effective to continue their wanton \nconduct without the risk of paying punitive damages. Without the threat \nof punitive damages, callous corporations could have decided it is more \ncost-effective to cut corners that put American lives at risk. This \napproach failed to protect public safety, and the conferees rightly \nrejected it.\n  In addition, I thank the managers for including language in the \nconference report to help captive insurance companies participate in \nthe federal backstop program. Many captives deal in\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nproperty and casualty lines, but some do not. Senator Jeffords and I \nstrongly support language in the conference report to allow those \ncaptives in property and casualty the option of participating in the \nprogram while not requiring other captives to start offering terrorism \nrisk insurance.\n  The state of Vermont is the premier U.S. domicile for captive \ninsurance companies. Vermont's captive owners represent a wide range of \nindustries including multinational corporations, associations, banks, \nmunicipalities, transportation and airline companies, power producers, \npublic housing authorities, higher education institutions, \ntelecommunications suppliers, shipping companies, insurance companies \nand manufacturers, among others. Since 1981, Vermont has averaged \napproximately 25 captives licensed annually, and those numbers are on \nthe rise. Vermont closed 2001 with 38 new captives, 37 pure and I \nsponsored, for a total of 527 at year-end. The first half of 2002 saw \n26 new captives licensed in Vermont setting a record pace, according to \nthe Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance and Health Care \nAdministration.\n  At a time when the American people are looking for Congress to take \nmeasured actions to protect them from acts of terror and jump-start our \neconomy, this conference report is a shining example of bipartisan \nprogress. I applaud Senator Daschle, Senator Dodd, Senator Sarbanes, \nSenator Schumer and the other Senate and House conferees on their good \nwork on this bipartisan conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have consulted with the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. As I think our \ncolleagues know, the next order of business is a debate and then a vote \non the continuing resolution. I am told they will need no more than 40 \nminutes. So Senators should be prepared to vote on final passage on the \ncontinuing resolution at about 9:10 to 9:15 p.m. Please return to the \nChamber if you are not going to stay. That will be the final vote of \nthe evening. We will vote at approximately 9:10 to 9:15 p.m., following \nthis vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on a 6 year term \nin the Senate which has been simultaneously the most challenging, yet \nmost rewarding, experience of my life. I have had the chance to realize \na lifelong dream by following in the footsteps of one of my personal my \nheroes, Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. I have been able to \nrepresent the state I love in an institution I revere. And I have been \nable to add my voice to the others that have risen before me in this \nchamber, from William Fulbright to Harry Truman to John Kennedy to \nEverett Dirksen to so many other outstanding men and women of history.\n  In my Senate office, I have surrounded myself with small reminders of \nthe men I most admire. I sit at Richard Russell's desk. On my walls, I \nhave photographs of just two people. President Franklin Roosevelt and \nPrime Minister Winston Churchill. Theirs were no ordinary times, and we \ncan safely say now, neither are ours. After the Pentagon was attacked \non September 11th, I looked at FDR's picture and finally understood the \ngravity of his day of infamy, because this generation now had one of \nits own. I have used Churchill's and Roosevelt's examples of strength \nand courage to make it through every day in this town. Some days have \nbeen better than others, but every one has been a gift because this has \nbeen the life of my dreams.\n  When I came to the Senate, I came to do the best job I could for the \npeople of Georgia and the people of the United States, particularly our \nmen and women in uniform. I am proud of what we've accomplished since \nthen. Today, over 60% of our service members are married, and their \nbenefits have finally begun to reflect that fact in order to retain \nthose talented professionals. We knew that the decision to stay in the \nmilitary is made at the dinner table, not the conference table, so \nwe've increased pay for service members by nearly 20% since I came to \nthe Senate. We've modernized the G.I. bill so that service members can \ntransfer their benefits to start a college fund for their children. We \nset a schedule to eliminate out of pocket housing expenses and we even \nadded a measure to help families take their pets with them when serving \nin Hawaii. Keeping the family dog may not be the highest priority for \nsome lawmakers, but it's the whole world to a child moving around the \nglobe as their mother or father serves our country. The family matters \nto the military member, so the family has mattered to me in my time \nhere.\n  Beyond these individual personnel matters, I became deeply concerned \nabout the shrinking numbers of our U.S. military, and this year was \nable to raise the ceiling of our force strength. In our new war on what \nSam Nunn calls ``catastrophic terrorism,'' we must continue to go on \nthe strategic offensive. Our military may be winning the battle, but we \nwill lose the war if we continue to ignore the fact that our forces are \ncritically over-deployed and being asked to do too much with too \nlittle. We are out of balance. Our commitments are far outpacing our \ntroop levels, and the situation is only getting worse.\n  Since the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the armed forces \nhave downsized by more than half a million personnel, but our \ncommitments have increased by nearly 300%, including new deployments to \nAfghanistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Georgia, and Pakistan. Today, a \nDesert Storm-size deployment to Iraq would require 86% of the Army's \ndeployable end strength, including all stateside deployable personnel, \nall overseas-deployed personnel, and most forward-stationed personnel.\n  To make the war on terrorism possible, we have activated more than \n80,000 guard and reserve troops and instituted stop-loss for certain \nspecialties. This is no way to fight a war when our strategic national \ninterests are at stake. The President has rightly told the country to \nbe prepared for a long commitment. But the Pentagon has not requested \nan increase in end\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\nstrength for services other than the Marines. Our military is on a \ncollision course with reality of families they don't see, training they \naren't receiving and divisions borrowing from each other to meet the \nbare minimum in staffing. We can prevent a loss tomorrow, but we have \nto act today by increasing our numbers, and I hope that we will.\n  Just as we must go on the strategic offensive overseas, we have to be \non the strategic defensive here at home. The Senate has just passed the \nbill to create a new Department of Homeland Security, which was long \noverdue. For my own part, I am pleased to see passage of several \nmeasures I have worked on that I believe will significantly improve our \nsense of security here at home. The homeland security bill itself \ncontains provisions to coordinate law enforcement and public health \nemergencies and to move the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \ninto the new department. The Port Security bill will help the ports of \nBrunswick and Savannah cut off options for terrorists who want to \nattack the U.S. on our own shores. The Bus Security bill will ensure \nthat bus passengers are finally accorded some of the same security \nmeasures that the flying public receives.\n  I look ahead now, and see our nation facing perilous challenges. Iraq \nand Saddam Hussein are back on our radar screen. We are right to insist \non disarmament, and I leave the Senate confident that my vote to give \nthe President the authority to use force to that end was the right one. \nI also believe my vote to go after Osama bin Laden was the right one, \nbut we have miles to go before we sleep on that front.\n  As all of these issues continue, I hope that the Senate and the \ncountry will continue to vigorously debate the proper course for our \nnation's foreign policy. A policy unchallenged is a policy unproven. \nWhy would we wait to prove our theories to ourselves and our allies \nuntil our troops are in the field proving our policies for us?\n  When he was in Vietnam, Colin Powell swore to his men, as I swore to \nmine, that when we were the generals instead of the captains, when we \nwere the senators instead of the sergeants, we would not send our boys \ninto a fight willy-nilly. And we haven't. And we shouldn't. In \nretrospect it seems to me that the real failure of Congress in Vietnam \nwas not so much passage of the open-ended Gulf of Tonkin resolution, \nbut its subsequent failure to exercise its Constitutional \nresponsibilities after the resolution passed.\n  Likewise, Congress' vote on the Iraq resolution provided a tangible, \nmilitarily achievable objective, but it did not discharge the Congress \nof all future responsibility with respect to our policy on Iraq. After \nthe 1990-91 Gulf War, Powell put forth six questions which he believed \nmust be addressed before future military interventions:\n\n       Is the political objective important, clearly defined, and \n     well understood?\n       Have all non-violent means been tried and failed?\n       Will military force achieve the objective?\n       What will be the cost?\n       Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed?\n       After the intervention, how will the situation likely \n     evolve and what will the consequences be?\n\n  The first three questions have been addressed thus far, but when we \nturn to the final three of General Powell's questions, we see the need \nfor some serious and sustained attention not only by the \nAdministration, but by the Congress as well. What will be the cost, not \nonly the cost of the immediate military operation, but also the costs \nof what could be a very long-term occupation and nation-building phase? \nWhat about the cost for our economy? The mere threat of war has sent \noil prices upward and caused shudders on Wall Street. What will a full \nblown war do? Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed? And \nafter the intervention, how will the situation likely evolve and what \nwill the consequences be?\n  Powell has said that the purpose of the American military is to \nprevent war. But if war cannot be prevented, we should go in, win and \nwin quickly. I am grateful to have Colin Powell's voice in this debate \ntoday. And I am hopeful we will have his and others like his in the \ndebates of tomorrow. I hope the members of the 108th Congress will ask \nthese questions and these are the ones I will be asking from whatever \nvantage point I move to after January 2.\n  In his farewell speech to Congress, General Douglas McArthur said \nthat old soldiers never die, they just fade away. This old soldier is \nnot going to fade away, but I will take my battles to another front. \nThe people of Georgia have given me a chance to live the life of my \ndreams here in the Senate, but now I may have the chance to live a life \nthat exceeds my dreams, and I am grateful for that.\n  As much as Richard Russell achieved for Georgia and for America, he \nsaid his greatest regret in his life was that he never married. I am \nhappy to say that this old soldier has learned a thing or two from \nRussell, and I will be married to my fiancee, Miss Nancy Ross, after I \nretire. There is life after the Senate, and it will be a wonderful \nlife. FDR said that the purpose of politics is to generate hope, but \nfor me, the purpose of life is to generate hope. I will continue to try \nto live up to FDR's example every day.\n  Before I leave, I want to thank several people. Senator Robert Byrd, \nfor teaching me so much about this institution. Senators Reid and \nDaschle for your constant help and support, as well as Senator Zell \nMiller. Senators John McCain, John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, who reminded \nme that nothing is stronger than brotherhood, and some things are more \nimportant than politics. I thank my staff for letting me lean on them, \nand I thank the entire Senate family, from our Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie \nto the reporters who cover the Senate, from the wonderful elevator \noperators to the staff in the Senate dining room and the barber shop \nand everyone in between--you've been my friends and my family and I \nwill always remember your kindness. Finally, to my colleagues and the \npeople of Georgia, a song from one of my favorite old westerns comes to \nmind. Happy trails to you, 'til we meet again. God bless you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of this bill, the President \npro tempore of the Senate and the soon to be President pro tempore of \nthe Senate, are both here managing this bill. It is my understanding \nthey are not going to take a long period of time. As soon as they \nfinish, it is my understanding we would have final passage.\n  The majority leader has come upon the floor. Senator Byrd said he is \nready to begin the debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11531-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11531-S11536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 124) making further \n     continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2003, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall be brief and my colleague, Mr. \nStevens----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. Please remove \nconversations from the floor.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I do not intend to speak more than 15 minutes, if that much. And my \ncolleague has indicated he will speak about the same amount of time. So \nI would say to Senators we ought to be voting within 30 minutes.\n  Last July, almost 4 months ago, the Senate Appropriations Committee \ncompleted action on all 13 of our appropriations bills, each on a \nbipartisan unanimous vote. These bills restored essential funding for \nprograms that the administration proposed to cut.\n  We provided $1.1 billion more than the President requested for \nveterans medical care.\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\n  We restored the $8.6 billion cut proposed by the President in highway \nfunding.\n  The President proposed only a 1-percent increase for education \nprograms. He would turn the No Child Left Behind bill into another \nunfunded mandate. Our bill would have provided a 6-percent increase for \neducation, including key funding to reduce class size.\n  We included sufficient funding to keep Amtrak operating.\n  We restored over $1 billion of cuts that the President proposed for \nState and local law enforcement programs.\n  We fully funded the President's proposed increases for homeland \nsecurity programs, but we provided the funds through existing programs \nthat our nation's fire and police organizations support.\n  We provided a significant increase for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in order to investigate corporate fraud.\n  We provided $400 million for election reform.\n  Sadly, the President believes that these increases represent wasteful \nand unnecessary spending. He worked with the House Republican \nleadership to shut the appropriations process down. The House has not \npassed a regular appropriations bill in nearly 17 weeks. By contrast, \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee reported all thirteen bills by July \n25th, the earliest date that this was accomplished since 1988. However, \nwithout the House-passed bills, our process stalled.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, on a bipartisan basis, believes \nin making responsible choices. It believes in governing. The President, \nsadly, appears to believe more in rhetoric and political posturing.\n  This year, only two of the thirteen appropriations bills have been \nsigned into law. The House has voted for and the President has \nsupported a fifth continuing resolution that would extend \nappropriations for the domestic side of the government until January \n11. This is the worst performance of the Congress in attending to one \nof its most basic responsibilities, the funding of the government, \nsince 1976 when the beginning of the fiscal year was moved to October \n1.\n  Why did the President precipitate this unprecedented failure? Despite \nthe fact that Congress approved the President's 13 percent, $45 \nbillion, increase for defense programs and his 25 percent, $5 billion, \nincrease for homeland defense programs, the President believes that the \n3.5 percent increase for domestic programs that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee approved, was excessive. The President \nproposed to virtually freeze domestic programs that were not for \nhomeland defense. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $13 \nbillion more for domestic programs, barely enough to cover inflation.\n  The President has forced the entire domestic side of the government \nto operate on automatic pilot at fiscal year 2002 levels for over one \nquarter of the fiscal year. In a bit of pre-election posturing, the \nPresident's Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said on October 20th, ``For \nthe first time in probably a decade, Congress has left town before an \nelection without going on a spending spree using taxpayers' money. \nThere's a new sheriff in town, and he's dedicated to fiscal discipline. \nAnd Congress for the first time in a decade has listened to the new \nsheriff.''\n  That new sheriff is shooting the country in the foot with his \nAdministration's shortsighted political games. But, were the items that \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee funded with the $13 billion \nincrease a spending spree?\n  No.\n  With great fanfare, the President signed numerous authorization bills \nthis year that authorize increase spending on important programs. Last \nJanuary, he signed the No Child Left Behind Act in order to invest \nadditional resources in important education programs for our children. \nLast May, he signed a border security bill to strengthen glaring \nweaknesses in our border security. Last July, he signed the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act authored by Senators Kennedy and Frist in \norder to provide critical resources to State and local governments to \nimprove the capacity of hospitals, clinics and emergency medical \npersonnel to respond to biological or chemical attacks. Last July, he \nsigned the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to combat corporate fraud. In October, he \nsigned the election reform bill in order to help State governments \noverhaul the nation's electoral system.\n  Yet, when it came time to actually fund these important initiatives, \nthe President worked to postpone action on the FY 2003 spending bills. \nHe worked with the House Republican leadership to force the funding of \nthe entire domestic side of our government onto a continuing \nresolution. Instead of making careful choices, the President has forced \nthe government to operate on automatic pilot, leaving the legislation \nthat he signed with such fanfare, to operate without the increased \nresources authorized by those laws.\n  The Senate is now considering a fifth continuing resolution to extend \nfunding for the eleven bills that fund domestic agencies through \nJanuary 11, 2003. This puts the entire domestic side of the government, \nincluding homeland security programs, on automatic pilot at the levels \napproved for FY 2002.\n  You must watch what this President does, not what he says. What he \nhas done, is to force the government to operate on automatic pilot. \nWhat he has said bears very little resemblance to what he has done.\n  The U.S. Senate is reputed to be the world's greatest deliberative \nbody. In ``Democracy in America,'' French visitor Alexis de Tocqueville \ndescribed this body as an institution ``composed of eloquent advocates, \ndistinguished generals, wise magistrates, and statesmen of note, whose \narguments would do honor to the most remarkable parliamentary debates \nof Europe.''\n  That was the Senate of 1831--an institution that prided itself on its \ndeliberate, careful, judicious debates; an institution that possessed, \nas once the Senate of ancient Rome possessed, a great firmness, \nanchored by oratory that was as brilliant as the immense gold eagle \natop the dais of the old Senate Chamber. But the Senate that de \nTocqueville watched in 1831, I am sad to say, is a far, far cry from \nthe institution that the American people have observed over the past \nfew months.\n  Instead, the American people have seen a body more concerned about \npolitics than substance; more concerned about party than about the \npeople; more concerned about the state of the midterm elections than \nthe state of the union.\n  President Bush came to Washington in 2001 and promised to change the \ntone in Washington. Instead, the President has sent an unambiguous \nmessage to Congress on virtually every major policy issue. His \nmessage--my way, or the highway. No room for debate. No room for \ndeliberation. The nation needs to pursue energy independence, but the \nPresident has said my way or the highway. Our elderly need a \nprescription drug benefit, the President has said my way or the \nhighway. The Director of Homeland Security says our nation is facing an \nimminent risk of a terrorist attack, but when it comes to homeland \nsecurity legislation, the President said my way or the highway.\n  Similarly, the Congress has been manacled by the President and the \nHouse Republican leadership in its efforts to fund the operations of \ngovernment.\n  On September 17, I came to the floor and I warned Members that the \nWhite House was leading an effort to stall the appropriations process. \nAt that time, the House had not taken up an appropriations bill for \neight weeks. I complained that the Administration seemed to believe \nthat the federal government is nothing more than a ``Monopoly'' board, \nwith the President living on Park Place, while the rest of the country \nrelegated to Mediterranean Avenue.\n  In those remarks, I noted that Lawrence Lindsay, the President's \nprincipal economic advisor, had estimated that the costs of the war in \nIraq would be $100 to $200 billion but that spending at that level \nwould have no impact on the economy. I stressed my concern that the \nWhite House is willing to put the entire domestic side of the \ngovernment on automatic pilot in a long-term continuing resolution over \ntheir insistence that the $13 billion difference between the House \ntopline for discretionary spending and the Senate topline is, in their \nview, excessive spending. I noted that the House Republican leadership, \nat the bidding of\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nthe White House, is willing to force all of the domestic agencies to \noperate at current rates over their objection to the Senate's wanting \nto provide a 3-percent increase for domestic health, education, \nenvironmental, law enforcement and other programs, barely enough to \ncover inflation.\n  On September 24, I came to the Senate floor and I warned Members \nabout the dire consequences of forcing veterans health care programs, \neducation programs, transportation programs to operate at last year's \nspending levels.\n  On October 2, I returned to the floor and I asked the White House why \nthey had turned a deaf ear to the needs of the American people; and why \nthe fundamental duties of the President and the Congress to make \ncareful and responsible choices about how to spend the taxpayers' hard-\nearned dollars had been put on automatic pilot.\n  For months, the President called on Congress to send him the Defense \nAppropriations bill. The Congress fully cooperated with the President \nin this regard. Congress sent the President the Defense and Military \nConstruction bills at levels $800 million above the original House \nbills.\n  There is no doubt that the Congress and the President can work \ntogether. When the President asked for the necessary Defense funding, \nthe Congress cooperated. But it's a far different story when it comes \nto the domestic programs of the United States Government.\n  The rest of the appropriations bills remain on hold, stuck in the mud \nof election-year politics. The President has sent the message that he \nwill be satisfied to put the entire domestic side of the government on \nautomatic pilot. He has already signed four continuing resolutions that \nfund the government at the levels in last year's laws.\n  Many members of Congress, myself included, are proud to wear the \nlabel of ``defense hawk.'' But, in this new age of terrorism, being a \ndefense hawk must also mean being a ``hawk'' on domestic defense. It \nmust mean defending and funding domestic initiatives that will make \nAmericans safer and more secure in their own backyards just as \nvociferously as defending and funding the production of military \naircraft, and missiles, and tanks.\n  The White House stall on the remaining appropriations bills means \nthat one front of our two-front war on terrorism will be provided with \nfunds to do battle, but the other front will be shortchanged. If we \nfail to pass the rest of our appropriations bills, all of our efforts \nhere, on American soil, to make more secure our states, cities and \nneighborhoods, will be getting short shrift.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle have claimed that this fiscal \ntrain wreck is the result of the Senate's not passing a budget \nresolution. That may make for good campaign rhetoric, but every Senator \nknows that a budget resolution is not necessary to pass appropriations \nbills. Congress was able to pass appropriations bills for nearly 200 \nyears without a budget resolution.\n  The Budget Act specifically provides authority for the House to move \nforward on the appropriations bills in the absence of a budget \nresolution. Sadly, the House Republilcan leadership, at the prodding of \nour ``my-way-or-the-highway President'', chose instead to shut the \nappropriations process down.\n  The President insisted on a topline of $749 billion for the thirteen \ndiscretionary bills and has not budged. He seems satisfied to put the \ngovernment on automatic pilot. No choices. No judgment. No opportunity \nfor the Congress to reflect the needs of the American people in its \nconsideration of the thirteen bills. No, let's just put the government \non automatic pilot. Government by formula, rather than government by \nchoice.\n  According to news reports, the President considers himself to be an \neducation President. He speaks before Veterans groups. He speaks about \ncombating the war on terrorism by strengthening the FBI's investigative \ncapabilities and shoring up security at the Nation's airports, ports, \nand borders. But talk is cheap. The necessary funding for these \npriority programs is not. Where is the White House cooperation when it \ncomes to priority domestic funding, especially those relating to \nhomeland security and the plight of our veterans and the state of our \neducation programs? Remember, watch what he does, not what he says.\n  Mr. President, as the days and weeks slip by and the domestic \nprograms of the Federal Government limp along on autopilot under the \nprovisions of the continuing resolutions, the four-million veterans who \nrely on the Veterans Administration for their health care are having to \nworry about whether that care will be available to them. Maybe they are \nnot sleeping too well. While the weeks slip away, the 11,420 FBI agents \nwho are supposed to be combating the war on terrorism are having to \nwonder whether they have the necessary resources to fight that war. \nMaybe we all ought not to sleep too well. While the weeks slip away, \nthe government's effort to root out corporate fraud is being put on \nhold. Watch what they do, not what they say. While the weeks slip away, \nthe President appears to be satisfied to forget his No Child Left \nBehind promise and turn the commitment to educating America's children \ninto another unfunded mandate, another unfulfilled promise.\n  The President is quick to champion homeland security, but his budget \npriorities reflect a different agenda. The administration's adamant \nrefusal to move off of the dime in these appropriations discussions \ncould jeopardize homeland security, no matter when or how any new \nDepartment of Homeland Security is created.\n  Recently, former Senators Rudman and Hart released a report that \nconcluded that the American transportation, water, food, power, \ncommunications, and banking systems remain easy targets for terrorist \nattacks. According to the report, ``A year after \n9/11, America remains dangerously unprepared to prevent and respond to \na catastrophic terrorist attack on U.S. soil. In all likelihood, the \nnext attack will result in even greter casualties and widespread \ndisruption to our lives and economy.''\n  The report highlighted the vulnerabilities created by: the minuscule \nfraction of trains, ships, trucks and containers that are searched for \nweapons of mass destruction; poor radio communications and equipment \nand training for police, fire and emergency medical personnel; \ninadequate coordination and focus on threats to food safety; lack of \nlab capacity to test for biological or chemical contaminants; and \ninsufficient sharing of intelligence information with State and local \ngovernments on potential terrorist threats.\n\n  Not only has President Bush failed to lead the nation in addressing \nthis vulnerability, he has, in fact, actively opposed efforts to \nprovide the resources necessary to address these significant \nweaknesses. When it comes to homeland defense, the President talks a \ngood game, but puts no points on the board for our needs. Under \npressure from the White House, since September 11, 2001, critical \nfunding to address the specific concerns identified in the Rudman/Hart \nreport have been squeezed out of spending bills considered by the \nCongress.\n  The Congress has succeeded in approving $15 billion for homeland \ndefense programs in December of 2001 and July of 2002, $5.3 billion \nabove the President's request. However, on several occasions in \nNovember, December and July, the President threatened to veto \nlegislation that would have provided nearly $24 billion more for \ncritical homeland security programs, including $15 billion from the \nstimulus bill and $8.9 billion from Fiscal Year 2002 bills reported by \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  In August of 2002, the President chose to terminate $2.5 billion of \nfunding that Congress approved for homeland security programs in the \nFiscal Year 2002 supplemental. He turned his back to funds that would \nhave helped to save lives.\n  In October of 2002, the White House took credit for forcing the \nentire domestic side of the government to operate by automatic pilot \nunder a continuing resolution of last year's funding levels. That means \nthat agencies like the FBI, the Customs Service, the new Transportation \nSecurity Administration, the Coast Guard, FEMA and the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, agencies that are critical participants in \nsecuring our homeland, have no new resources to address known homeland \nsecurity vulnerabilities. This postponed over $5\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\nbillion of increases approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee \nfor homeland security programs.\n  When the President called on Congress to send him the Defense bills, \nCongress responded. But, how about the other eleven bills? We hear no \ncall from the President to send him the remaining bills. The silence is \npalpable.\n  Under the long term continuing resolution, the veterans health care \nsystem will be funded at a level that is $2.4 billion short of the \nlevel proposed in the Senate passed FY2003 VA-HUD bill. There are \ncurrently over 280,000 veterans on waiting lists for VA medical care. \nUnder a long-term continuing resolution, the waiting lists will more \nthan double. VA will schedule 2.5 million fewer outpatient clinic \nappointments for veterans, and 235,000 fewer veterans will be treated \nin VA hospitals.\n  Thousands of FEMA fire grants, grants to resolve the interoperable \nemergency communications equipment problem, grants to upgrade emergency \noperations centers, grants to upgrade search and rescue teams, grants \nfor emergency responder training and grants to improve state and local \nplanning would be funded under the Senate's appropriations bills. But \nthe Administration insists on operating the domestic programs of the \nFederal Government under the autopilot provisions of the continuing \nresolution which are mindless, formulaic, and without any trace of \nhuman judgment.\n  Has the President asked the Congress to send him the VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill that funds these critical veterans and homeland \ndefense programs? No.\n  Many of the requirements of the Transportation Security Act require \nlarge expenditures in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2003. Local \nairports are required to purchase explosive detection equipment to keep \nbombs from being placed on our airliners. To do that, they need help. \nOur highway program is facing a $4.1 billion cut in spending that could \nreduce jobs by over 160,000. Could our economy use those jobs? Amtrak \ncould go bankrupt, throwing 23,000 people out of work and eliminating \ntrain service to 1.7 million citizens per month. Merry Christmas Amtrak \nworkers from the White House. The Senate Transportation bill addresses \nthese concerns. Has the President asked Congress to send him the \nTransportation bill to fund these programs? No.\n  Federal funds also are needed to hire new federal screeners and to \nmake our nation's seaports more secure. But this cannot be accomplished \nunder a continuing resolution. The INS is at a critical juncture in \ndeveloping a comprehensive Entry/Exit system to protect our nation's \nborders. The Senate bill provides $362 million for this initiative. But \nthe Administration's inflexibility means that this program is frozen \nunder the provisions of a continuing resolution just like our progress \non protecting our borders--frozen! The President signed an \nauthorization bill to help root out corporate fraud, but the continuing \nresolution would deprive the Securities and Exchange Commission of $300 \nmillion contained in the Senate bill to investigate corporate fraud. \nLet the fraud flourish for just a little while longer. Has the \nPresident asked the Congress to send him the Commerce/Justice/State \nbill that funds those programs? No.\n\n  The Customs Service is scheduled to hire more than 620 agents and \ninspectors to serve at the nation's high-risk land and sea points of \nentry. The Senate provides the funding for the Customs Service. But, \nagain, the Administration seems to be satisfied with government by \nautopilot. A continuing resolution does not fund new agents for our \nborder. Has the President asked the Congress to send him the Treasury/\nGeneral Government bill to fund that border security program? No.\n  Without additional funding for security at our nuclear facilities, \nthe Department of Energy will have to lay off 240 security guards at \nnuclear facilities in Tennessee and Texas. These 240 guards are the \nfirst line of defense between our enemies and a significant portion of \nour nation's nuclear material. Has the President asked us to send him \nthe Energy and Water bill? No.\n  By forcing the government to operate on autopilot, the Administration \nwants the nation to fight terrorism with a wink and a nod.\n  Last month, Congress passed landmark election reform legislation. \n$3.8 billion is authorized for grants to state and local governments to \nimprove our election systems. Yet, there is no funding for this \ninitiative under a continuing resolution. Has the President asked the \nCongress to send him legislation to actually fund these new election \nreform grants? No.\n  Last year, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act with \nbipartisan support. But, this law becomes nothing but an unfunded \nmandate on our local governments if the federal funding is not there \nfor states to implement the new act. It takes money to reduce class \nsize, to provide teacher training, to invest in new technology and to \ndevelop meaningful assessment tools. The No Child Left Behind Act \nrequires States to ensure that all teachers teaching in core academic \nsubjects are ``highly qualified'' by the end of the 2005-2006 school \nyear. But, the President's budget included no new money for teacher \ntraining. The Senate bill would increase funding for Teacher Quality \nState Grants by $250 million, for a total of $3.1 billion. The \nPresident's budget would increase funds for education by just $367 \nmillion--less than a 1% increase. That level gets an ``F'' in my grade \nbook. The bill passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nmeanwhile, would increase education funds by $3.2 billion, or 6.5%. Has \nthe President asked Congress to send him the Labor/HHS/Education bill? \nNo.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator Stevens and I sat down and worked out a \ntopline for discretionary spending that reflected our views of the \nlevel of spending that would be required to produce thirteen \nbipartisan, fiscally responsible bills. We then followed through and \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee produced all thirteen bills by the \nend of July consistent with that allocation. All thirteen annual \nappropriations bills cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee with \nfifteen Democratic members and fourteen Republican members voting aye. \nThere is nothing partisan about these Appropriations bills. I worked \nwith my Republican colleagues, led by that very able Senior Senator \nfrom Alaska, Ted Stevens, to make sure that these bills represented a \nconsensus of our members, both Democratic and Republican. There are no \ngimmicks. The bills have been available for all Members to see for over \nsixteen weeks. Yet, the lack of action in the House has shut down \nprogress in the Senate as well.\n  Senators should know that frustration with the lack of progress on \nthe FY 2003 appropriations bills is bipartisan and bicameral. In a \nrecent, widely distributed memorandum to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young \nsaid, ``A long-term continuing resolution that funds government \noperations at FY 2002 levels would have disastrous impacts on the war \non terror, homeland security, and other important government \nresponsibilities. It would also be fiscally irresponsible.''\n  All it would have taken to move the FY 2003 bills was some degree of \ncooperation between the House and Senate leadership, but the White \nHouse thwarted any chance of a compromise being reached. That's right. \nThe White House--the Bush White House--the one that promised to change \nthe tone in Washington, thwarted any chance of a compromise being \nreached. They did not want the work to be done. The White House \nspinners wanted to spin and weave their tangled web.\n  We ought to be more concerned about how our actions will affect the \ncourse of the country than we are about how our actions or inactions \nwill affect the direction of our polls. We ought to be more concerned \nabout the price the people will pay for our actions or inactions than \nwe are about the price our parties will pay at the voting booth. We \nought to be more concerned about raising public awareness than we are \nabout raising campaign funding. We ought to be more concerned about \ndoing our jobs than we are about keeping our jobs.\n\n  Now, because of the White House's unwillingness to put what is best \nfor the American people ahead of what is best for our political \nparties, the Congress is forced to pass a continuing resolution to fund \nthe operations of government until the 108th Congress. The Congress \nwill forsake one of its most\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\nimportant functions--to ensure funding for the operations of the \nfederal government--because is could not reason with this partisan, \npartisan White House.\n  Call me old-fashioned, but I remember a time when compromises were \ncrafted by individuals who had differing views on an issue. But with \nthis President, it is my way or the highway.\n  The Senate must not blindly follow, in the name of party unity or \nunder the yoke of political pressure, a short-sighted path that \nultimately undermines our Constitutional processes. He could not stay \noff of the campaign trail long enough to negotiate and help us pass \nthese bills.\n  Why isn't the Administration up here working in a bipartisan and \nflexible fashion with the leadership of the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees to facilitate the processing of the \nappropriations bills that fund domestic programs so that the necessary \nfunding can be provided to the veterans, the FBI, the education \nprograms, the homeland security programs at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels?\n  Why the giant stall, the big freeze, the cold shoulder? This \nAdministration is setting quite a track record. Unfortunately for the \nAmerican people, it is not a record on which to look back with pride. \nIt is a record that rejects reasonableness in favor of stubbornness. It \nis a record that rejects progress in favor of partisanship. It is a \nrecord that puts politics ahead of the American people.\n  I, for one, can not forget what is important to America. I recognize, \nas do many members of this body, the critical nature of these \nappropriations bills to the future progress and security of this \nnation. I recognize the importance of these appropriations bills to the \nfarmers, to the teachers and their students, and to the veterans. I \nrecognize the importance of these bills to future breakthroughs in \nmedical research and cancer treatments. I recognize the importance of \nthese bills to our nation's energy independence and to our \ntransportation network.\n  I can only pray that the Creator will see fit to protect us from the \nplots of twisted souls who lurk in the shadows, and I can only hope \nthat in January, either our shame or our fear or both will compel us to \nact.\n  I have very strong feelings of gratitude for my colleague, Senator \nStevens, the ranking member, who has worked so closely with me. And I \nam especially appreciative for all of the cooperation and \nbipartisanship that has been shown by the members of this committee.\n  We have a committee of 29 members--15 Democrats, 14 Republicans. On \nall of these measures, we have reported the bills on a bipartisan basis \nwithout any partisan differences within the committee.\n  So I have many reasons to thank the ranking member, Mr. Ted Stevens, \nformer chairman of the committee. I want to take this opportunity to \nthank him, and to also thank the other members of the committee.\n  I also want to thank staff on both sides of the committee. We have \nexcellent staff that works with the Members. And I can only express my \nvery deepest appreciation to the staff and to the membership.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to vote as they see fit on this \ncontinuing resolution. I shall support it, although I am not entirely \npleased that we have been forced to engage in this exercise in passing \ncontinuing resolutions. But be that as it may, we do have to fund the \noperations of the Government. So I shall vote for the continuing \nresolution.\n  The House has not taken up an appropriations bill for 8 weeks. When I \ncame to the floor on September 17 and warned Members that the White \nHouse was leading an effort to stall the appropriations process, that \nprocess has been stalled. We sent two appropriations bills to the \nPresident. That is it. Eleven appropriations bill out of the 13 have \nnot be sent to the President's desk. This is because the House \nRepublican leadership has put the brakes on and has simply refused to \nlet the Appropriations Committee in the House move the bills forward. \nThe leadership on the House side has simply refused to have that body \nact on the appropriations bills that had been reported by the \nAppropriations Committee in the House.\n  That is most unfortunate.\n  I yield the floor in the event that my distinguished counterpart, Mr. \nStevens, wishes to say whatever he wishes. He may have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank you. I thank the distinguished \nchairman of our committee.\n  The pendulum of politics is swinging. When we return in January, I \nwill become, once again, the chairman of our committee, and I look \nforward to working with my great friend from West Virginia in the \nmanner I have tried to work with him as he has been chairman.\n  During the recent days, I have had the privilege of meeting with the \nPresident of the United States and the Office of Management and Budget \nDirector, and with Congressman Bill Young. We discussed the process by \nwhich we might try to finish with the appropriations for fiscal year \n2003 so that we might be ready to handle the 2004 requests when they \ncome following the State of the Union message that the President will \ndeliver to us on January 20.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Byrd in that regard. This \ncontinuing resolution is absolutely necessary to give us the \nopportunity to move forward, and sometime in the first week that we are \nback in January we can decide how quickly we want to finish this \nappropriations process.\n  For myself, I am sure Senator Byrd and I will do our best to work in \nthe Senate's best interest and to see to it that we finish these bills \nso that we can turn to the new task of dealing with the new budget \nrequests which this time will include a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It will be a most interesting transition. And it is going to \nbe a difficult problem for us in reorganizing the appropriations \nprocess to handle this new Department--whether or not we will create a \nnew subcommittee or divide the work of the existing subcommittees to \nhandle the new Homeland Security Department, that will have to be \ndetermined in the future.\n  I will certainly consult with Senator Byrd on all of those details.\n  For now, I urge Members to approve this continuing resolution and to \nunderstand the process. This is something the Senate is compelled to do \nin order to take us into a new Congress so that we can finish the work \non the fiscal year appropriations for 2003. I hope everyone will \nunderstand the process and will give us their understanding even \nfurther when they return in January.\n  If the Senator is willing to yield back his time, I will be glad to \nyield back. We have no request for time on this side.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Bill Young, the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee. I enjoy working with Chairman Young. He has always been very \ncooperative and very gracious. He is a very courteous Member of that \nbody, and is always very kind and considerate of me as I have labored \nto act as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the Senate \nupon more than one occasion.\n  I also thank Dave Obey, the ranking member on the House \nAppropriations Committee. Dave Obey brings a great deal of experience \nand knowledge and is a very articulate and forceful member of the House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I enjoy working with Dave Obey, as I enjoy working with Bill Young.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with the other members of the House \nAppropriations Committee on both sides--Republicans and Democrats. They \nhave always been very nice to me.\n  This year I will relinquish my responsibilities as chairman and will \nbegin work with my former chairman, Mr. Stevens, and the other members \nof the committee as we go forward into the new year.\n  I believe we will have difficult times ahead. But I have always been \nable to work with Senator Stevens. He has always been very nice to me, \nand very considerate, as has been his staff.\n  While I hesitate to feel that we must probably look forward to a more \ndifficult year in the future than we have in the past, I can only say \nthat I hope Senator Stevens and our colleagues on\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle in that committee enjoy a wonderful \nThanksgiving, a lovely Christmas, and a Happy New Year.\n  And may God look down upon us and help us in our struggles, as we \nwill continue to do our best, with limited resources, in the \nforthcoming year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time has been yielded back, the clerk \nwill read the joint resolution for the third time.\n  The joint resolution was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was unable to be on the floor the day \nthat we paid tribute to our colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone. I would \nlike to take just a few moments this evening.\n  Like my colleagues, I was deeply saddened over the tragic death in a \nplane crash of our colleague, Paul Wellstone, his wife Sheila, his \ndaughter, several members of his staff, and the plane's pilots. His \ndeath is a grievous loss to those members of his family who survived, \nto the people of Minnesota, whom he served so faithfully and honorably, \nto his colleagues in the Senate, and to the Nation.\n  Paul Wellstone lived the American dream. His parents came to this \ncountry as immigrants. He excelled in school. He earned both his B.A. \nand his doctorate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nHe went straight from the University of North Carolina to Carleton \nCollege in Northfield, MN, as a young professor, where he taught for \nmore than two decades. Minnesota became home to him and his family.\n  In 1990, the people of his State sent him to the Senate; and in 1996, \nthey voted to send him back for another term.\n  Paul Wellstone was a person of deeply held convictions, a dedicated \nfighter for working families. He fought with passion for his principles \nbut was also deeply respectful of those who disagreed with him. He was \nprofoundly committed to the democratic political institutions that he \nhad studied in his youth, that he taught to so many students over the \nyears, and that, by his own direct engagement in our Nation's politics, \nhe brought to life.\n  We feel a great loss in the death of this courageous fighter for a \njust and decent America, and we will seek to honor his memory by \ncarrying forward in the spirit in which he lived and gave his life.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SARBANES). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I too rise to pay tribute to Paul Wellstone \nand send condolences and prayers to the Wellstone family, to all of his \nhardworking and dedicated staff, and to the other families involved.\n  Paul Wellstone was a passionate, courageous, never wavering fighter \nfor his ideals. He fought vigorously for what he believed in. He fought \nvigorously for Minnesotans, Americans, and people around the world. And \nhe did so side by side with his wife Sheila, herself and eloquent and \nforceful advocate for domestic abuse victims and so many others.\n  He was committed to economic and social justice.\n  He was indignant about the lives faced by the poor, the downtrodden, \nthe battered, and all the ``little guys.''\n  He envisioned a better world for everyone, and strove every day to \nhelp secure that better world. He was tireless, but never humorless, in \nthis struggle.\n  He challenged Members of the Senate, the President, and all Americans \nto envision this better world and to join him in the struggle for that \nbetter world.\n  He fought for all of us, but most especially for our children, for \nbattered women, for working families, for individuals with \ndisabilities, for seniors, for family farmers, for veterans, for Native \nAmericans, and for new immigrants.\n  He fought to improve education, health care, and the environment. He \nwas a leading voice, a champion, a fighter for these and other \nimportant needs of our Nation.\n  As he said:\n\n       If we don't fight hard enough for the things we stand for, \n     at some point we have to recognize that we don't really stand \n     for them.\n\n  His view of politics was insightful and straightforward, just like \nthe way he lived his life. He said:\n\n       Politics is what we create by what we do, what we hope for, \n     and what we dare to imagine.\n  He believed with all of his heart and soul in the American promise of \nequal opportunity, that ``every child in America should have the same \nopportunity to reach his or her full potential regardless of the color \nof skin, gender or the income level of the child's parents.''\n  To make that happen, we need to provide every child with the same \ntools for success. I can still hear him say: ``We cannot realize the \ngoal of leaving no child behind on a tin cup budget.'' He would make \nthis pitch during hearing held by the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, on which I was honored to serve with him, on the \nFloor, education funding rallies, and anywhere and everywhere.\n  He believed that education funding should come before tax cuts for \nthe wealthy. In the education reform law, that he voted against because \nhe believed that it didn't provide enough resources and that the tests \nit demanded\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nwould be ``educationally deadening,'' he worked to ensure the highest \nquality tests possible and to recruit and retain highly qualified \nteachers, among other important provisions.\n  He was also a leader in the fight for full funding of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. He also long worked to give welfare \nrecipients the chance to get off the rolls and into good paying jobs by \nallowing them access to postsecondary education.\n  His legislative efforts to provide mental health parity were born in \nlarge part out of his brother Stephen's struggle with mental illness \nand his family's struggle with the problems of lack of insurance \ncoverage of mental illness treatment.\n  In an editorial in the Saint Paul Pioneer Press, he said:\n\n       Think of what fairness in treatment for mental illness \n     would mean. Think of the lives saved, the suffering eased. \n     Suicide is linked to untreated mental illness in 90 percent \n     of cases. Americans with mental illness, who are homeless or \n     warehoused in jails, would instead get the humane care they \n     need. Workplace productivity would improve, with \n     less absenteeism and a higher quality of work. Other \n     medical costs would go down. There would be fewer broken \n     families, broken lives and broken dreams.\n\n  Paul Wellstone could not have been more right. We must pass mental \nhealth parity in his name, and we must pass it as a first order of \nbusiness in the next Congress of the United States.\n  He also championed improved health care for children and adolescents, \nparticularly substance abuse and mental health treatment and suicide \nprevention, included in the Children's Health Act of 2000. He \ncoauthored the law that provides funding for Parkinson's Disease \nresearch. He also worked for a real Patients' Bill of Rights and a \nprescription drug benefit for our seniors.\n  With his wife Sheila, he led the fight to end domestic violence. He \nworked for passage of the Violence Against Women Act in both 1994 and \n2000, a landmark law that provides help, protection, and improved \nservices to victims of domestic violence.\n  He long worked to address the needs of children who witness domestic \nviolence. Children who live in homes where domestic violence occurs are \nat a higher risk of anxiety and depression, and exhibit more \naggressive, antisocial, inhibited, and fearful behaviors than other \nchildren. They also are at risk for recreating the abusive \nrelationships they have observed, and many, as a consequence, are \njuvenile offenders.\n  His legislation on this issue is pending in the Senate version of the \nChild Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act reauthorization bill.\n  He fought for passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and was \nworking to expand it.\n  He was a leader in the fight to raise the minimum wage and to extend \nunemployment insurance.\n  He believed in equal pay, worker protections, and secure pensions.\n  He fought to ensure veterans get the benefits and support they \ndeserve.\n  He worked for cleaner air and water, reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions, and renewable energy. He led the fight to stop the oil \ncompanies from drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  He once again spoke for people with no voice, by championing \nnaturalization for Hmong citizens who aided the U.S. war efforts in \nVietnam, as well as by joining me as a cosponsor of the Liberian \nImmigration Fairness Act.\n  Paul's efforts were not limited to improving the lives of Americans. \nAs a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, he championed human \nrights around the globe. He worked with Senator Brownback to enact \nlegislation to address international trafficking in women and children \nfor prostitution and forced labor.\n  He also coauthored the Torture Victim Protection Act to help \nrehabilitate tortured survivors in the U.S. and abroad.\n  And he was a leading advocate and voice for sensible multinational-\ninternational approach to foreign policy.\n  Paul Wellstone demanded bold action to right the wrongs of this \nworld. He fought for many valiant causes, and in doing so, he improved \nmillions of lives. However, his fight is not finished. There is still \nmuch to be done. It is a fight we all must continue.\n  As Paul Wellstone once said, after the 1994 election:\n\n       We don't have time for despair. The fight doesn't change. \n     It just gets harder. But it's the same fight.\n\n  In his spirit and the spirit that is the most noble part of this \nNation, let us carry on this noble fight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). There is nothing pending. The \nSenator can ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11537-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11537-S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRATULATING FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER ON RECEIVING 2002 NOBEL \n                              PEACE PRIZE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have had this Senate resolution cleared \nwith the majority and the minority sides. It is a resolution commending \nformer President Carter on his upcoming receipt of the Nobel Peace \nPrize.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 360 submitted earlier today by myself and \nothers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 360) congratulating former President \n     Jimmy Carter for being awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, \n     and commending him for his lifetime dedication to peace.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a minute or two to explain the \npurpose in offering this resolution. I think it is rather self-\nexplanatory. I want to thank Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, our \nrespective leaders, along with both the Members of the minority and the \nmajority, for their support of this resolution recognizing former \nPresident Jimmy Carter for many things, not the least of which is the \nrecognition by the Nobel Committee in awarding him the Nobel Peace \nPrize.\n  Over the past 25 years, few have been as dedicated to improving our \ncountry and our world than Jimmy Carter. Throughout his life, former \nPresident Carter has tirelessly devoted himself to promoting human \nrights, relieving human suffering, and promoting peaceful resolutions \nto a wide array of international conflicts.\n  Jimmy Carter's herculean efforts for peace during his term as \nPresident culminated with the signing of the Camp David accords, and \nindeed, his leadership and determination played a vital role in helping \nto achieve what once was considered impossible peace between Israel and \nEgypt. Although his efforts and dedication to peace did not earn him a \nnomination for the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize, which was subsequently \nawarded to then President of Egypt Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime \nMinister Menachem Begin, former President Carter's indispensable role \nin this lasting peace is and will always be a matter of historical \nrecord.\n  Although many public servants retire from the public eye after their \nterms are completed, since leaving public office, President Carter has \nused his status and abundant talents honorably and effectively for the \nbenefit of humanity. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, a highly-\nrespected research organization that seeks to cultivate peace, \ndemocracy, and human rights, and helps fight famine and disease. In \n1984, he began his affiliation with Habitat for Humanity by leading \nefforts to restore a residential building in New York, and his annual \nparticipation with Habitat ever since further demonstrates his strong \ncommitment to all manners of public service and to the betterment of \nsociety. He has been an inspiration to all who want to find ways to \nserve this country and humanity generally.\n  In 1999, Jimmy Carter was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nthe highest award a United States civilian can receive. In 2002, at the \ninvitation of Fidel Castro, he made a historic visit to Cuba in order \nto encourage the free exchange of ideas between Americans and Cubans. I \nbelieve his visit, the first by an American President since 1928, will \nhelp to encourage democracy and build bridges between our citizens and \nour nations.\n  Indeed, whether he is working to promote strategic arms reduction or \nhelping resolve inner-city social problems,\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\nwhether he is brokering a peace between warring factions in Ethiopia or \npromoting peace, democracy and human rights in countries such as North \nKorea, East Timor, and Haiti, whether he is negotiating a cease-fire in \nBosnia or working to ensure free and fair elections in countries \nthroughout the world, Jimmy Carter is one of the pre-eminent figures of \nthe last 50 years and a wonderful embodiment of the best of American \nideals.\n  Prior to this year, Jimmy Carter had been nominated 10 times for the \nNobel Peace Prize. I am extremely pleased that in October of this year \nhe finally received this well-deserved and long-overdue tribute to his \nlifelong efforts. There is nobody more deserving of this highest of \nhonors. I salute the decision of the Nobel Committee.\n  I again express my gratitude to all of our colleagues in the closing \nhours of this 107th Congress. This resolution recognizes the \ncontributions of Jimmy Carter, and I join with others in congratulating \nhim on this well-deserved, long overdue honor of the Nobel Peace Prize. \nOur congratulations to his beloved wife Rosalynn and his family for all \nthey have contributed to the well-being of our Nation and to the world \nin which we live.\n  I inquire of the Chair as to whether or not the fourth whereas clause \non page 2 has been stricken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since 1994, Senator Thompson has \nrepresented the people of Tennessee in this body. During that time, I \nhave been fortunate to call him both a colleague and a friend.\n  In the last 8 years, Senator Thompson has fought hard for issues that \nare vital to Tennessee. He has made sure that his State has the \ninfrastructure it needs and the resources it deserves. He has protected \nTennessee's farmers and its workers.\n  Three years ago Senator Thompson founded the Smoky Mountains National \nPark Congressional Caucus. My own State of Alaska has many national \nparks so I understand the challenges that Senator Thompson faced. His \ncommitment to eliminating the National Parks Service backlog has been \nadmirable.\n  Senator Thompson has also served the best interests of our Nation. \nOur work on the governmental affairs committee reflects his dedication. \nAs chairman of that committee he has worked to make the government \nsmaller, more efficient, and more accountable. It has been a pleasure \nto work with him as we worked to create the department of homeland \nsecurity.\n  The Senate and the people of Tennessee will miss Senator Thompson's \ncommitment and dedication. I am grateful for his service and wish him \nfuture success.\n\n\n                               phil gramm\n\n  Mr. President, for 24 years the people of Texas have had an \nimpassioned advocate and dedicated public servant in Phil Gramm.\n  Over the course of his career, Senator Gramm has established an \nimpressive legislative legacy. He played a role in the fight to cut \nfederal taxes, institute international free-trade incentives, reform \nthe welfare system, set mandatory federal prison sentences for drug \ncrimes, and support our armed forces. The Gramm-Leach Bliley Financial \nServices Modernization Act and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act were ground-breaking \nlegislative achievements. Through these and other efforts, Senator \nGramm has helped lay the foundation for a new era of national \nprosperity.\n  Senator Gramm has been called a man of ``frank opinions and \nunwavering convictions.'' Since he came to the Senate in 1984 I have \nbeen honored to call him my friend and colleague. We will miss his \nleadership and his voice in the Senate. I am grateful for his years of \nservice and I wish him success in his future endeavors.\n\n\n                             Tim Hutchinson\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Hutchinson has been a committed advocate for \nthe people of Arkansas and an important voice in the Senate. His strong \nleadership led me to personnally support his candidacy and I will \ngreatly miss his presence here in Washington.\n  I believe Senator Hutchinson leaves behind an important legacy. As a \nveteran of World War II, I am particularly grateful for Senator \nHutchinson's work on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. As chairman of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on hospitals and Health Care, \nSenator Hutchinson really watched over the VA's 173 medical centers. \nOur Nations's Veterans gave so much to ensure our liberty and freedom. \nI thank Senator Hutchinson for making sure that we fulfill our promises \nto them and reward their service. It has been said that: ``The final \ntest of a leader is that he leaves behind in other people the \nconvictions and the will to carry on.''\n  We are thankful for Senator Hutchinson's service and convictions. I \nwish him much success.\n\n\n                            FRANK MURKOWSKI\n\n  Mr. President, Alaska's recent elections have changed our state's \ncongressional delegation for the first time in 22 years. As my Senate \ncolleague of 22 years prepares to be sworn in as Alaska's tenth \ngovernor, I recall the battles we have fought together on behalf of our \nstate, and I welcome the opportunity to work with him on tomorrow's \nchallenges.\n  Senator Murkowski has established an impressive record of achievement \nduring his time in the Senate. Since 1981, he has represented the \ncitizens of Alaska and served the nation admirably.\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\n  Throughout his career, Senator Murkowski has been a staunch defender \nof Alaska's miners, loggers, and fishermen. In 1995, he authored and \nhelped pass through both Houses of Congress legislation that would have \nopened ANWR to oil and gas exploration. He has helped broker an \nagreement among major gas transmission companies that could result in \nthe construction of the natural gas pipeline; that pipeline would bring \nvaluable energy resources to the lower 48.\n  Senator Murkowski was a driving force behind the passage of an \nomnibus parks bill that created or improved more than 100 natural \nparks, forests, preserves and historic sites nationwide. He fought to \nincrease funding for Alaska's Medicare recipients. In 2001, he helped \nwin passage of major education reform, bringing us closer to the \nnation's goal of providing every child with a quality education.\n  Senator Murkowski's wife Nancy has been an integral part of this \nsuccess.\n  When Frank and Nancy first arrived in Washington, Nancy worked hard \nto balance their family life with their new Senate responsibilities.\n  In addition to being a committed partner, Nancy has been a devoted \npublic servant. She has been active in our Alaska State Society and has \ntraveled extensively with Frank. She has also been a leader in women's \nhealth issues. Through the private charity she runs with Frank, Nancy \nhas raised more than $2.3 million for breast and cervical cancer \ntreatment. She cofounded the breast cancer detection center in \nFairbanks. Annually she organizes and runs events at Waterfall, near \nKetchikan and at Chilkoot Charlie's in Anchorage to raise funds for \nbreast cancer clinics and mobile detection units for rural areas \nthroughout Alaska. Our state is fortunate to have Nancy Murkowski as \nits next first lady.\n  Those of us in the Senate will miss the Murkowskis. We will miss \nFrank's daily leadership on important issues and his commitment to \npublic service. We take comfort in knowing that Alaska will have his \nproven leadership in the governor's office.\n  Alaska and the Nation face unique challenges and opportunities in the \ncoming months and years. In the future, the vision and leadership \nSenator Murkowski has demonstrated during his tenure in the Senate will \nenable Alaska to meet those challenges and leverage those \nopportunities.\n  Congressman Young and I look forward to working with Governor \nMurkowski; we know he will support our work in the Nation's capital. We \nwill work together in the future as we have in the past.\n  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Murkowski. For 22 years we \nhave worked closely on issues that are of vital importance to Alaska \nand the Nation. His career has been one of distinguished service. I \nlook forward to working with my dear friend and colleague in the \nfuture.\n\n\n                           Robert Torricelli\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will miss my friend and colleague Robert \nTorricelli, the senior Senator from the State of New Jersey when he \nleaves the Senate at the end of the 107th Congress.\n  Bob Torricelli first served from 1982-1996 in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. In 1996, he joined us in the U.S. Senate, and since \ngetting here, has been a committed advocate for the people of New \nJersey. He has worked tirelessly to protect New Jersey's natural \nresources, to improve air quality, and to protect drinking water. He \nhas also worked hard to provide a comprehensive prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors, and make college more affordable for parents and \nstudents alike.\n  I have worked with Senator Torricelli in his tireless and ongoing \nefforts to close the gun show loophole and to pass commonsense gun \nsafety legislation. That is a battle that I want to assure him many of \nus that he leaves behind in the Senate will continue to wage.\n  Bob Torricelli served as an effective chairman of the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee and has earned a reputation as one of the \nmost eloquent orators in the U.S. Senate. His books, ``In Our Own \nWords: Extraordinary Speeches of the American Century'' and \n``Quotations for Public Speakers: A Historical, Literary, and Political \nAnthology'' have become valuable resources for all of his colleagues in \npublic life.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in thanking Senator Robert \nTorricelli for his years of service in the Congress and wish him the \nbest.\n\n\n                              Jesse Helms\n\n  Mr. President, I recognize the service of Jesse Helms.\n  Before coming to the Senate, Jesse Helms served his country in the \nU.S. Navy during World War II. He was a Senate staffer, broadcast \nexecutive, radio personality, and banking executive.\n  Senator Helms, throughout his career, has been a tireless voice for \nhis conservative beliefs. Whether one agrees with Senator Helms' views \nor not, no one can deny the imprint he has made on the deliberations \nand actions of the United States Senate. Jesse Helms has always had the \nknack for carefully crafting legislative language which would put his \nsupporters and opponents clearly on the record on the most difficult \nissues of conscience.\n  In his capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nJesse Helms was a powerful force in reorganizing the Department of \nState.\n  In the United States Senate we are called upon to work with \ncolleagues of many differing points of view. While a fierce battler for \nhis conservative convictions, Jesse Helms was often willing to reach \nacross party lines to work with Democrats on issues like adoption and \nincreased funding for AIDS research.\n  While Jesse Helms and I have frequently disagreed, I respect the \nstraight forwardness which he brought to the public policy debate. And, \nJesse Helms was always a gracious gentleman. As this Congress comes to \nan end, I know that I am joined by my Senate colleagues in wishing \nJesse Helms and his wife, Dorothy , and their three children, the very \nbest in the years ahead.\n\n\n                               Phil Gramm\n\n  Mr. President, at the end of this session of Congress, Senator Phil \nGramm, the senior Senator from Texas will leave the Senate. For 18 \nyears, Senator Gramm has been a leader among the Republicans and a \nstrong voice in the Senate.\n  Phil Gramm is a hard worker and effective advocate. Before coming to \nthe Senate, Senator Gramm was an economics professor at Texas A \nUniversity and member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1978 \nuntil 1984. After being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, Senator \nGramm quickly became recognized as one of its most articulate members. \nAs a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Finance \nCommittee, and the Budget Committee, he has applied his boundless \nenergies and extensive knowledge of the Senate rules and precedents to \nhis efforts to reduce federal taxes.\n  While Phil Gramm and I disagree on many issues, I deeply respect his \nwillingness to stand up and fight for his convictions and the good \nhumor with which he approaches those battles. For example, on the issue \nof federal prisoner industries reform, Senator Gramm and I have locked \nhorns on several occasions, but he has always been a worthy and \nagreeable adversary.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in wishing him every success \nas the vice chairman of UBS Warburg and in wishing our best to Wendy, \nhis wife, and their two children.\n\n\n                             Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in paying tribute \nto Senator Fred Thompson.\n  Senator Thompson joined the U.S. Senate in 1994 after a successful \ncareer in law and even some starring roles on the silver screen. But he \nwas no stranger to this body, even then, having previously served as \nMinority Counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1973 and 1974 at \nthe age of 30. Once he joined as a Senator, he rolled up his sleeves \nand got to work on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee seeking to \nmake our government more sensible, more responsive, and more cost \neffective.\n  In 1997, he became the Chairman of the Committee and has served in \nthat capacity during the 105th, 106th and 107th Congresses. Over the \nyears, Senator Thompson helped oversee some dramatic investigations, \nincluding the campaign finance investigation in the 105th Congress and \nthe Enron investigation this past year. He also worked\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\non many less well known issues, including one close to my heart the \neffort to improve the way the Federal Government issues regulations.\n  For several Congresses, Senator Thompson and I teamed together on \nregulatory reform issues, including a major regulatory reform bill. \nThis legislation would have required federal agencies to consider cost-\nbenefit analysis when issuing major regulations and state publicly \nwhether the agency found that the benefits of a regulation justified \nthe costs. If they did not, then the agency would have to explain why \nit was issuing the regulation despite that finding. We also required \nfederal agencies to conduct risk assessments where appropriate. We had \na heck of a battle on that legislation, and in the end we failed to \npass it. But the fight was worth it; I believe we were right; and it \nwas great to have Senator Thompson fighting with me at my side to bring \ncommon sense to our regulatory process.\n  During his years at the Senate, Senator Thompson has made his mark as \na legislator by supporting bipartisan efforts to enact reforms in the \nareas of campaign finance, sensible government regulation, and \ncorporate accountability.\n  While he will no longer be ``In the Line of Fire,'' Senator \nThompson's legacy in the Senate will ``Die Hard.'' I hope his future \nroles will be as lively as those he played here for the last eight \nyears. It is a pleasure to join all of my colleagues today in honoring \nand thanking him for his years of public service to his country.\n\n\n                              Jesse Helms\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican, a fellow Senator, a fellow conservative, and friend--Senator \nJesse Helms.\n  I speak today with mixed emotions. I am happy to see that after a \nlong and distinguished career he will have more time to spend with his \nbeloved wife of 60 years, Dot . . . as well as enjoying time with his \nchildren and grandchildren. But I also know that this kind of man is \nimpossible to replace.\n  In the words of The Weekly Standard executive editor Fred Barnes:\n\n       Helms is an ideologue, and his unflinching devotion to \n     conservative principles has made him a powerful figure. He's \n     oblivious to the buzz, the chatter, and gossip of the press, \n     polls and the permanent establishment. He's totally inner \n     directed. He cares little for details or process. But when \n     something clashes with his conservative views . . . he steps \n     up, no matter how unpopular that makes him. He wins some, \n     loses some, but is always a player to be reckoned with, even \n     when he's acting alone.\n\n  I recall one such occasion where Senator Helms acted alone in his \noutspoken criticism of the United Nations. He refused to approve \npayment of U.N. dues until this lavish, bloated, and unwieldy \nbureaucracy was reformed. He was highly criticized by almost every \nmember of the mainstream media, chastised by activists, and mocked by \nothers. He knew there were great problems at the United Nations and \nwould not give until it was improved and it should be told that, in the \nend, the United Nations gave in. Reforms that will make the United \nNations a better, more honest and viable organization, were passed.\n  It seems to be one of the seldom mentioned side notes of Senator \nHelms' career in public service he often wins even when he seems to \nhave lost. For instance, even though he was unable to block the \nChemical Weapons Convention, he did win 28 of the 33 concessions he \nsought.\n  Senator Helms' legislative career will not only be remembered as that \nof a foreign policy figure though. I, for one, as an Eagle Scout, will \nalways remember his fights to defend the independence of the Boy \nScouts.\n  Some of the best insight into Jesse Helms as a person comes from his \ndomestic policy stands. One of the most telling stories of the real \npersonality of Jesse Helms and one of the most moving as well was \nshared by Senator Nickles. In the midst of a debate on a 5-cent-per-\ngallon Federal gas tax hike, in which they were vastly outnumbered, \nthey were seeking guidance. Senator Helms suggested that they pray \ntogether, and he called the Reverend Billy Graham and asked that he \npray with them for guidance.\n  That to me speaks volumes as to what truly guides Senator Helms as a \nperson. He was not using his faith for a photo op, a quick sound-bite, \na political tag line, or other earthly gains. This was simply a man who \ninstinctively turns to the God for guidance.\n  In the article I mentioned earlier, Fred Barnes concludes by asking \nif Jesse Helms can be replaced. His conclusion is similar to mine. That \nis a task that is ``probably more than can be hoped for''. A person as \nunique as Jesse Helms does not come along often. His presence will \ntruly be missed both on and off the Senate Floor.\n  Senator Helms is a provincial patriot. He has never been a part of \nthe urbane crowd, the radical chic crowd. He knows it and they know it. \nIt galled them that he could not be intimidated by an editorial in the \nNew York Times or some such organization. He is a man of faith, a \nBaptist. He comes from the soil of North Carolina and is proud of it. \nHe prefers the affection and commendation of those in his province over \nthose in the great salons where the ``masters of the universe'' \noperate. In fact, he respects the people of his beloved state and \ndeeply shares their values. That's what he fought for every day. The \ncynical, rootless left, the politically correct, those without \nprinciples, those who do not comprehend the greatness of America, were \nnot for him.\n  Indeed, he saw them as the problem. And, at their core, these folks \nunderstood. They knew his disagreement with their actions was deep and \nhonest. Try as they might, his opposition would not go away. Many hated \nhim because of it.\n  But, Jesse Helms does not hate. He absolutely does not. He only wants \nto do the right thing for America. Because he values America over \npolitics, and because he is courageous in his stand for principle, he \noften could not be moved. The left has never understood this. Some \nthought he hated them personally. He does not. He loves them and he \nwants a better life for all Americans.\n  The truth is that Senator Jesse Helms is a most kind and considerate \nperson. His soft spoken ways are known by all. His modesty and an \nassuming manner are plain for all to see. His wonderful wife, Dot, \nshares those same qualities and is loved by all who know her.\n  He is a true Christian gentleman in the Southern style. Courtly, \ngracious, quick of wit and firm in friendships, he is a most remarkable \nperson. Widely read, highly literate and a master of the language, few \ncould turn a phrase better than Jesse. When he has been wrong or slow \nto understand, he has admitted it. His conversion to advocacy for a \nmuch stronger fight against AIDS in Africa is a very recent example.\n  Finally, the career of Senator Helms cannot be discussed without \nremarking on the critical role he played in enabling the focus of \ndemocracy, free enterprise, and faith to triumph over the godless, \ntotalitarian forces of communism. He was a constant cold warrior. He \nsaw the evil in the evil empire, and his drive to overcome it never \nslacked. He was relentless, even when undergoing attacks from the so-\ncalled opinion leaders of America. It certainly was not those opinion \nleaders and pundits who won the war. They blew hot and cold mostly cold \non American policies. But the people in the provinces knew, they knew \nthere could be no compromise with communism, and fortunately those \npeople had a strong, able and true voice in Jesse Helms. He stayed the \ncourse, the Soviet Union collapsed. There were many close calls and \nmany highlights in that Cold War. One of those critical moments came \nwhen Senator Helms came to believe in Ronald Reagan's view of the role \nof the United States in this struggle. Jesse worked hard and produced a \ngreat victory in North Carolina that gave him the Republican \nnomination. Together they persevered and the evil empire collapsed and \nthe victory was won.\n  Senator Helms, you played a critical role in this struggle for \nfreedom and you deserve great credit for your courage and constancy.\n  America and freedom are in your debt. We are much obliged for your \nservice.\n\n\n                             Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the retirement of the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee (Mr. Thompson) will leave a major void in the \nheart and soul of this body. Rarely have we seen\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\nthe quality of the work product of a new Senator approach the level of \nexcellence and importance as we have in the performance and \ncontributions of Fred Thompson.\n  He has stood head and shoulders above the crowd, literally and \nfiguratively. It was a rare and most enjoyable privilege for me to \nserve on the Governmental Affairs Committee when he was the chairman.\n  He assumed the awesome responsibility of leading the committee in its \ninvestigation of the election law abuses of the 1996 Presidential \nelection. He was a superb chairman, fair to all, but thorough and \ndiligent in his quest for the truth. He expended an enormous amount of \ntime and energy in that undertaking, and he made every effort to keep \nto the subject and learn the facts. During it all, he endured \ncriticism, skepticism and sometimes ostracism as he labored to \ndischarge the duties of his chairmanship.\n  I have no greater respect for any Senator than I have for the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. He has served well and reflected great credit on the \nUnited States Senate and the State of Tennessee. We will miss him \ngreatly.\n\n\n                               bob smith\n\n  Mr. President, I have enjoyed serving with Bob Smith in the U.S. \nSenate. For the last 2 years, we have sat side by side in the Senate. \nHe has occupied the desk that was used in the Senate by Daniel Webster, \nwho was born in his State of New Hampshire, although he represented \nMassachusetts as a Senator.\n  During votes and deliberations of the Senate we have had \nopportunities to discuss a wide range of subjects from fishing in the \ndeep south to experiences in the U.S. Navy, as well as the issues under \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  I have grown to know and appreciate Bob Smith. I like him, and I \nrespect him. He is a person who has strongly held views, and he is not \nafraid to express then, and to fight for them.\n  He has been admired on both sides of the aisle for his efforts to \nprotect the environment. He has been a dutiful and diligent Chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he has been an effective \nsupporter of a strong national defense. His leadership has been deeply \nappreciated by me on the issue of missile defense. He worked \neffectively to help garner the votes to pass the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999 which I authored. He was a cosponsor of that bill \nand a very enthusiastic proponent of its passage, and its \nimplementation by the administration. We met regularly with Defense \nDepartment officials to urge cooperation in the effort to develop and \ndeploy, as soon as possible, a system, or systems, to defend the \ncitizens of our country against ballistic missile attack. He mastered \nthe esoteric subject matter associated with this issue and was an \nimportant force in the shaping and carrying out of this new national \npolicy.\n  I will miss Bob Smith. I wish for him and his family much happiness \nin the years ahead.\n\n\n                               phil gramm\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute today to \nmy dear fried and colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, Phil Gramm. \nPerhaps more than anyone in the Senate, I will miss Phil's leadership. \nIn the Senate there are three kinds of relationships between Senators \nfrom the same State: One, they do not like each other. Two, a \nprofessional relationship: they get along OK, work hard together for \ntheir State, but are not really close. Three, they are good friends who \nhave a great partnership for their State.\n  Phil and I have No. 3. I recently noted that his retirement is like \nsending an older sibling off to college: Your best friend will not be \nupstairs anymore, and there is nobody to stick up for you when you get \nin a fight. But then again, you'll get the big room, and you will not \nhave to share the spotlight anymore.\n  When I first came to the Senate after a special election, I walked \ninto an office with no staff, but Phil had sent his own staff to start \nanswering the phones, and detailed one of his senior staff to help set \nup my office. That support was invaluable in those early days.\n  Phil's story is one of those ``only in America'' success stories. \nBorn at Ft. Benning, GA, the son of a soldier, his father died when \nPhil was a young teenager. He and his two brothers were raised by their \nmother in a modest neighborhood in Columbus, Georgia.\n  His mother worked at two jobs to take care of the family, as a \npractical nurse and also in a cotton mill for $28 a week. Phil has \noften said his mother had decided before he was born that he would go \nto college.\n  But after failing the 3rd, 7th and 9th grades, his mother recognized \nit was time for drastic action for her dream to be realized. She pooled \nthe family's limited resources and sent Phil off to the Georgia \nMilitary Academy near Atlanta. Mrs. Gramm knew Phil had a good mind but \nneeded encouragement and direction\n  His life has been a testament to his mother's sacrifice ever since. A \nPhD in Economics from the University of Georgia led him to another \nlife-changing experience when he accepted a teaching position at Texas \nA If the Georgia Military Academy gave him the academic foundation \nto achieve, Texas A nurtured his natural talent to teach and to \nentertain. He was a sensation at A Phil managed to make even the \nmost complex economics courses exciting. It was also at A that Phil \nmet and married a fellow economics professor, Wendy, who has been a \npartner and inspiration to Phil throughout his career.\n  While it is one thing to test your economic principles and \nconvictions in the classroom, it is quite another to have the courage \nto place your views in front of the voters. After a losing campaign for \nthe Senate in 1976, he ran for Congress 2 years later and won. His \ncampaign theme--``common sense; uncommon courage''--described him \nperfectly. Particularly after he decided to switch parties, from \nDemocrat to Republican. He resigned from his seat, to give his \nconstituents a choice to vote on his switch. He won back his seat, \nbecoming the only member of Congress in the 20th century to do this. \nAnd after serving three terms in the House, Phil set his sights on the \nSenate again, and won this time in 1984.\n  He has one of the sharpest minds in Congress. His Southern drawl and \neasy-going nature may fool some, but we know behind that accent is a \nrazor-sharp mind. Phil has become one of the Senate's most important \nleaders. He has mastered the Senate, and is one of our body's \nintellectual and philosophical giants. He is a man of great character. \nHe does not stand on ceremony; he stands on conviction. He is never \nbeen swayed by popular opinion, in fact, he has often stood his ground \ndespite popular opinion. His tenacity and his passion are unrivaled. \nAnd even in his last days in the Senate, he's not taking a rest from \nthe trenches, he has been leading the debate on the Department of \nHomeland Security, perhaps one of the most important decisions of our \ntime. If there is a tough fight to be had, you can be sure Phil Gramm \nwill lead the charge. If there is something difficult that needs to be \ndone, you can be sure Phil will find a way to do it.\n\n  Of course, in addition to his brilliant mind, Phil will be remembered \nfor his colorful sense of humor and witty anecdotes. For example, who \ncould get away with saying things like: During Gramm's bid for the \nPresidency, Larry King asked Phil if he would ever run with a woman? \n``Sophia Loren is not a U.S. citizen,'' answered Gramm. ``People of New \nHampshire talk funny and therefore they think I talk funny.'' On \ncampaign reform, ``Our problem is not bad money corrupting good men; \nour problem is bad men corrupting good money.'' ``It's always dangerous \nto send your wife ahead in your place, because then no one cares if you \nshow up.''\n  While he will certainly be remembered for his originality and humor, \nhe is second to none as an effective legislator. Phil has always \nmaintained his focus on fiscal responsibility, helping us get back to a \nbalanced budget. He is the first person to actually do something to \neliminate the national debt, so that our children and grandchildren \nwill not be saddled with our bills. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Budget \nAct was a masterpiece. Phil thought of it and engineered its passage, \nproving it is possible to be both smart and effective. As chairman of \nthe Senate Banking Committee, Phil crafted the Financial Services \nModernization Act, one of the most important pieces of financial \nlegislation in modern years.\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\n  When you are in a fight for survival, the most important decision you \nmake is who you want in the foxhole with you. When I have ever had a \ntough fight, Phil was my first call. For two reasons: I want him on my \nside, and I sure do not want him on the other side. I can say without \nreservation that Phil Gramm is truly irreplaceable. What I admire most \nabout him is his courage. Phil and Wendy have been good friends to Ray \nand me. We are friends in the Senate, and friends at home. Phil, I will \nmiss you. I wish you well and look forward to having you as a \nconstituent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11542-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CHAPLAIN OGILVIE ON HIS SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, for his 8 years of service as the U.S. \nSenate Chaplain.\n  Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie was born in Kenosha, WI, and graduated from \nthe Garrett Theological Seminary and the University of Edinburgh, \nScotland. After serving at churches in Illinois and Pennsylvania, he \nwas a pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Hollywood, CA, for \nover 20 years. Since 1995, Chaplain Ogilvie has served as the 61st \nChaplain of the Senate.\n  This great Nation was founded on faith in God and has been supported \nthroughout its history by the faith and prayers of its citizens. \nChaplain Ogilvie has taken part in this great tradition by his undying \ndevotion to the Senate. Over the past 8 years, Chaplain Ogilvie has \nprovided the Senate family with kind words and open arms. From his \nweekly prayer groups to his moving opening prayers, Chaplain Ogilvie \nhas been a consistent source of inspiration and strength for the Senate \nfamily.\n  As our Nation faced the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, \nChaplain Ogilvie helped our Senate leaders come together to help heal a \nwounded Nation. Today, as we continue to face possible attacks on our \nland, Chaplain Ogilvie provides us with the strength to continue \nworking to uphold the ideals of this great Nation. On a more personal \nlevel, I thank Chaplain Ogilvie for the support he offered my staff and \nI when we lost our beloved Holly Richardson. His comforting sentiments \nand lending ear certainly offered us hope and a renewal of our faith. \nWe are all thankful for his tremendous service, and he will be greatly \nmissed by all those in the Senate.\n  On behalf of myself, my colleagues, and our Nation, I express my \nsincere gratitude to Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie for his service to the \nSenate. I wish his wife Mary Jane the best for a speedy return to good \nhealth, and the best of luck to his children and grandchildren. I thank \nDr. Ogilvie for all his good works and for bringing the word of the \nLord to so many people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11542-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

This award is given to professors who demonstrate a high \nlevel of dedication to teaching and a commitment to students, and who \nuse innovative instructional methods. Dr. Jacobs' dedication to early \nchildhood education and academic accomplishments make her an \noutstanding recipient of this award.\n  Since 1995, Dr. Jacobs has been a professor at the University of \nSouth Dakota. In addition to her teaching responsibilities as an \nAssociate Professor of Early Childhood Education in the School of \nEducation, she serves as President of the South Dakota Association for \nthe Education of Young Children and is active in several professional, \ncampus and community organizations. She co-produced a CD ROM, \n``Inclusion: Celebrating Children's Successes,'' that provides \nresources for teachers working with children with special needs and she \noften leads workshops and classes for teachers in South Dakota. Dr. \nJacobs brings 16 years of experience working with school-age children \nto her college classrooms.\n  Through her tireless efforts at the University of South Dakota and in \nmany area communities, Dr. Jacobs has an invaluable impact on many \nteachers and their students.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding staff member and friend, Eric Womble. For \nthe past 7 years, Eric has served as my national security adviser and \nmilitary legislative assistant, and as one of my most able counselors. \nAs Eric moves on to new challenges in the private sector, it is my \nprivilege to commend him for his service.\n  The son of Thurston and Olive Womble, Eric was born at Bethesda Naval \nHospital in Maryland and was raised in Mobile, AL. He received his \nundergraduate degree in 1979 from the United States Naval Academy and \nwas designated a Naval Flight Officer in 1980. Before retiring from the \nUnited States Navy in 1997, he served in many assignments, including: \nPatrol Squadron Twenty-Four, VP-24; the Joint Chiefs of Staff Intern \nProgram in Washington, D.C.; the Program Resource Appraisal Division in \nthe Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, OP-81; Flag Secretary to \nCommander Seventh Fleet in Yokosuka, Japan; Fleet Replacement \nInstructor in Patrol Squadron Thirty, VP-30; Operations Officer in \nPatrol Squadron Forty-Nine, VP-49; Executive Assistant to the Chief of \nNaval Research; and in the Department of Defense's Congressional \nFellows Program.\n  During his military career, Eric was awarded the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Services Medal with a gold star, Navy Commendation Medal \nwith three gold stars, Joint Service Achievement Medal, and Meritorious \nUnit Commendation with bronze star. He also earned an MBA from \nMarymount University of Virginia and served as a White House Social Aid \nfor President Ronald Reagan.\n  When Eric came to work for me seven years ago, I assigned him the \ntask of helping me implement an innovative plan to create new jobs in \nMississippi by growing the research and technology base at our \nuniversities and in our industrial community. Eric's efforts helped \nMississippi universities and businesses grow their research and \ntechnology programs by approximately 200 percent from 1996 to 2002. \nThis growth in research and technology was a major factor in attracting \nseveral Fortune 500 companies, including Nissan Motor Company, Lockheed \nMartin Corporation, The Boeing Company and Alliant TechSystems. \nMississippi also has become home to several new military commands \nincluding Special Boat Unit Twenty-Two, the Navy's Southeast Region \nHuman Resource Office, and the Air National Guard's first C-17 \nsquadron. This prescription for growth, which Eric helped me pursue for \nseven years, also helped several existing entities in Mississippi, \nincluding Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Raytheon Aerospace Company, \nand the Meteorology and Oceanography command to prosper and create more \njobs.\n  When our military was suffering from extremely low retention and \nrecruiting in the mid-1990's, Eric helped me craft legislation that \nhelped reverse these troubling trends. During his tenure on my staff, \nthe Congress passed the largest pay raise for our military men and \nwomen since 1981, repealed the REDUX retirement system, reset the \nfuture pay raise formula to Employment Compensation Index plus one-half \npercent, implemented dual compensation exemption for military officers, \nreset the pay caps for our Flag and General officers, created the \nTRICARE For Life military health care system, and targeted millions of \ndollars in pay raises to our mid-career enlisted military personnel and \nofficers. Eric also assisted me in improving the quality of medical \ncare to our military veterans by helping me craft legislation to \nestablish a Medicare Subvention Demonstration program and a \nprescription drug program.\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\n  During the Clinton administration, Eric was instrumental in my \nefforts to bolster our Nation's armed forces by getting $48 billion in \nadditional funds for our military through supplemental and \ncongressionally added funds. He also helped me gain $823 million in \nmilitary construction funding from 1996 to 2003 to revitalize \nMississippi's most critical military bases.\n  In particular, I should note that Eric's naval experience was \nsignificant in helping me bolster the naval shipbuilding industry on \nthe Mississippi Gulf Coast. He was instrumental in bringing together \nthe Navy, the Office of Secretary of Defense, industry, and the \nCongress to ensure a robust naval shipbuilding program. His work was \nreflected in the development of the LHD, LHA(R), LPD-17, DD(X), DDG-51, \nand the Littoral Combat Ship programs.\n  I know that the citizens of Mississippi benefited from Eric's \nrelentless pursuit of military and economic development projects that \nwill impact the State for years to come. The country, too, should be \nproud to have had such a champion of strong military ideals fighting to \npreserve our nation's military power and to properly support our men \nand women in uniform. As a result of his outstanding performance, Eric \nwas recently awarded the Mississippi Distinguished Civilian Service \nMedal and the Department of the Navy's Superior Public Service Award.\n  As Eric moves onto a new and exciting position as Vice President for \nPrograms at Northrop Grumman Corporation, I wish him, his wife Wendy, \nand their children, Melissa and Matthew, every success. Eric has served \nour country for more than 27 years, and as he embarks upon his new \njourney, I wish to take this opportunity to thank him for his service \nand to wish him nothing but the best in his new career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11543-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH VINCENT TREBAT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the adjournment of the 107th Congress means \nwe shall soon be bidding goodbye to the year 2002. The weeks ahead will \nbe filled with reviews of the headlines and history of 2002. \nUnfortunately, 2002 marks the passing of an even greater number of \nindividuals who made up what some refer to as the ``Greatest \nGeneration.'' The men and women who sacrificed much and rose to meet \nthe awesome challenges confronting our great nation in the aftermath of \nWorld War II are dying off in greater numbers each year.\n  Today, I wish to recognize the life of one such individual who \nembodied the self sacrifice, uniquely American optimism, and genuine \ngoodness of this generation--Joseph Vincent Trebat of Mount Prospect, \nIL. Joseph Trebat passed on to eternal life on August 14th but left \nbehind a legion of family and friends whose lives have been infinitely \nenriched because of his life.\n  Joseph Trebat, ``Dad'' to his six children, ``Papa'' to his twenty-\none grandchildren and two great grandchildren and ``Joe'' to his \nbeautiful bride of 66 years, Lauretta, will be sorely missed. It is \noften said of men like Joe that he lived a good life. For Joe, however, \nit is more important to add that his was a life well led.\n  Joe's life was truly an American life. The son of Slovak immigrants, \nJoe grew up in Chicago and was by all accounts a self-made man. He \nworked his way through college and spent 50 years at the same company. \nHe brought the same dedication to his family. His priorities never \nchanged--work hard, enjoy life and provide a better future for his wife \nand children. The lives led by his six children: Mary Ann, Tom, Patty, \nDottie, Joe and Kathy, evidence Joe's greatest success in life. To meet \nLauretta, or ``Stella'' as Joe lovingly referred to her, is to \nunderstand what it means to be in the company of a kind and happy \nperson. Joe may have been born Slovak but his marriage to Lauretta \ndemonstrated he was blessed with the luck of the Irish.\n  Joe's naturally twinkling eyes could bring cheer to anyone. Those who \nenjoyed his company, whether joining Joe on the back porch of his house \non Wa Pella, playing golf in one of the Trebat Golf Opens or cheering \non his beloved Notre Dame, knew they could count on no shortage of \nlaughter and fun. With its number one fan rooting for them from heaven \nit is no wonder that Notre Dame is experiencing such a winning football \nseason in 2002.\n  Joe was a gentle giant who will be missed by all. A man for others \nwho's strong faith and love of family was always steadfast and never \nwavering. When we talk of the ``Greatest Generation'' it is men like \nJoe who come to mind. While he will always be missed, he will forever \nbe a model for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11543-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11543-S11545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WE NEED A PLAN TO STOP AIDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, several months ago the Appropriations \nCommittee reported out the fiscal year 2003 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill, and the Senate passed the Homeland Security \nSupplemental Conference Report.\n  Those two bills contain a total of $950 million for international \nprograms to combat AIDS, including $300 million for the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, TB and Malaria. We provided $250 million for the Global \nFund last year, although $50 million has not yet been disbursed.\n  That sounds like a lot of money. It is far more than what we were \nspending on international AIDS programs just two or three years ago. \nBut think about it another way. The amount we expect to provide in 2002 \nand 2003 to combat AIDS, which threatens the lives of each of the \nworld's 6 billion people--is less than what my own State of Vermont, \nwith a population of only 600,000 people, will spend on health care \nduring that same period.\n  So while the United States is doing more than ever to combat AIDS, \nand we can point to successes in several countries--Uganda, Thailand \nand Brazil, for example, the reality is that the AIDS pandemic is out \nof control.\n  It is spreading faster, not slower. 40 million people are infected. \nAlmost nobody is receiving treatment. 25 million people have died from \nAIDS-related causes, and at the current rate that number is expected to \nexceed 65 million by the year 2020.\n  By any measure, AIDS is a plague of biblical proportions. Over 6 \ncenturies ago, the Bubonic Plague started at a small trading post in \nthe Crimea and quickly spread from port to port. By the time it ran its \ncourse, a third of Europe was dead.\n  It is still remembered as the worst epidemic in the history of the \nworld. No longer. AIDS is making the Bubonic Plague look like a mild \ncase of the flu.\n  The reality is that despite everything we have done and are doing, we \nare failing miserably to control this pandemic. Until we develop a \nstrategy that matches the challenge, and until we start thinking in \nterms of billions, not millions, of dollars, we will continue to fail.\n  The alternative is unthinkable, but it is by no means impossible--100 \nmillion deaths. 200 million. 400 million. This virus spreads \nexponentially, and so does the cost of controlling it.\n  When I think about AIDS, I think back to 1990, when Ryan White was \nalive, and Magic Johnson didn't know he was HIV positive. Even though \nhundreds of thousands of Americans had already died of the disease, we \nhad gone a decade with two Presidents who refused even to speak the \nword ``AIDS'' in public.\n  In the spring of 1990, we learned that in some African villages, one \nof every 10 people was infected.\n  That year, my wife Marcelle and I traveled to Kenya, Uganda and South \nAfrica to see the impact of AIDS first hand. During one visit to \nKampala, we met people infected with HIV who were teaching others to \nprotect themselves from the virus.\n  Those brave people were HIV-positive and knew their time was short. \nYet they devoted the time they had left to helping others to live.\n  When I came home, I gave a speech and said that if we failed to act, \nby the year 2000 ten million people would die of AIDS.\n  I was wrong. The number of people who died from this disease during \nthe next 10 years was not 10 million, it was 22 million, and now it is \n25 million.\n  Imagine waking up tomorrow morning and learning that every single \nman, woman, and child--every single person--in Miami, Minneapolis, \nAtlanta, Denver, Boston, Seattle, Washington, D.C., New York City, Los \nAngeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, San Diego, Detroit, and Dallas \ncombined had a virus for which there was no cure.\n  That is the reality in Africa today. Every hour, AIDS buries another \n250 Africans.\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\n  Within the next decade, at the current rate, more than 40 million \nchildren in Africa will lose one or both parents to AIDS.\n  Many of these children will end up on the streets, turning to crime, \ndrugs or prostitution, driving the rates of HIV even higher, \nperpetuating this vicious cycle.\n  Progress that has taken decades to achieve is being wiped out. In \nmany African communities, AIDS is doubling infant mortality, tripling \nchild mortality, and slashing life expectancy by as much as a third or \na half.\n  We have always known that improving public health makes it easier to \nmeet other needs--whether it is better education, stronger economies, \nor more stable societies. The converse is also true. AIDS will defeat \nthese efforts for social and economic development in Africa unless we \ndefeat AIDS first.\n  This is an enormous challenge for Africa, but it is an even greater \nchallenge for the world.\n  Every day, another 12,000 people are infected, and millions more \ncontinue to suffer needlessly.\n  In the Caribbean, AIDS is now the leading cause of death among people \nbetween the ages of 15 and 44.\n  In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the number of new infections has \nrisen faster than anywhere.\n  In India, the infection rate is skyrocketing. In China, only 4 \npercent of the Chinese population knows how AIDS is transmitted, and \naccording to public health experts it is spreading far faster than the \ngovernment has acknowledged.\n  It is a grim picture, but there is a great deal we can do. We do not \nhave a cure for AIDS and there is no vaccine in sight, but we know how \nto protect ourselves from the HIV virus. We can provide basic care to \nthe sick, and mobilize communities to support the growing number of \nAIDS orphans.\n  We know how, for pennies a day, to treat the half of all AIDS \npatients who will otherwise die from the pneumonia, tuberculosis, or \nmeningitis that prey upon weak immune systems. We have to get these \ndrugs, as well as retro-viral drugs which have been available in \nwealthy countries for years, to people in poor countries who need them.\n  We know how to reduce the transmission of AIDS from mothers to \nchildren.\n  We know all these things, but even so, we are failing. The disease is \nspreading out of control. What we lack, even after all these years, is \na global plan.\n  This administration, like the one before it and the one before that, \nhas no plan for how to mount a global campaign to effectively combat \nthe most deadly virus the world has ever faced. There is no strategy \nfor dealing with 40 million AIDS orphans, no strategy for getting \ntreatment to the 40 million people infected today, or the 50 million \nwho will be infected in another 3 years, no strategy for expanding \neducation and prevention programs on the scale that is called for.\n  It is not enough to point to a few success stories, as important as \nthey are. We have to look at the big picture. Despite everything we \nhave done and are doing, we have failed miserably. This deadly pandemic \nis out of control, and the amount of money being spent is a pittance of \nwhat is needed.\n  If we are going to conquer--or at least control--this disease, we \nneed to think differently about it. It sounds cliche and it has \nprobably been said many times before, but we need the health equivalent \nof the Manhattan Project, or putting a man on the moon. We need to \nincrease our investment not linearly, but exponentially. Where we are \nspending millions, we need to spend billions.\n  According to public health experts, the world must increase funding \non AIDS by at least a factor of five to at least $10 billion per year.\n  And $10 billion is a lot of money, but put it in perspective: It is \nabout the same amount as the U.S. Government spends each year on office \nsupplies. It is less than 1 percent of our Federal budget.\n  Unless we start treating AIDS as a global health catastrophe, not \njust someone else's problem, we will face a far worse, and far more \ncostly, crisis in the future.\n\n  How do we begin?\n  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is the funding \nmechanism the world has created, with strong support from the United \nStates. It is not a substitute for other effective international health \nprograms, like those run by USAID, but we know that USAID cannot do \nthis alone. We need a multilateral approach, and the Global Fund is \nthat approach.\n  Congress has appropriated $250 million for the Fund so far. Some have \nargued that we should wait to see how the Fund performs, before we do \nmore. I understand that caution. We have seen how other global funds \nfailed to meet expectations. It would make sense to wait, if we were \nnot talking about the worst health crisis in human history.\n  We simply cannot wait to see if the Global Fund is going to succeed, \nbecause we cannot afford to let it fail. We must do whatever is \nnecessary to make sure it does not fail. That means spending a lot more \nthan $250 million. The Administration needs to approach the Global Fund \nas it has al-Qaida failure is not an option.\n  That said, money is not the only issue. The Fund must not allow \nitself to be turned into a tool controlled by the governments of AIDS-\naffected countries. Unless there are reasonable checks and balances on \nthe proposed and actual uses of these funds, there will be a high risk \nthat the fund will turn into a major source of patronage and income-\nsupplementation for the elites.\n  To assure this, nongovernmental organizations and other civil society \ngroups must have a strong and clear voice in the global governance, \nnational oversight, and local implementation of Fund-sponsored \nactivities. To date, this has been respected more in rhetoric than in \nreality, and many local groups have been deeply disappointed with the \nnearly total government control of access to Fund resources and even \nthe proposal process in many countries.\n  The Fund would probably respond that this is being addressed, but the \nmessage I am hearing from the field is that this is a closed and \ntightly controlled resource pool in most places. To its credit, the \nBush administration has been one of the strongest supporters of a \nlarger role and voice for NGOs, and some of the developing country \ngovernments represented on the fund's Board have been the most \nresistant.\n  The fund is one important vehicle for getting critical programs going \nin highly affected countries, but we should not confuse this with a \ncomprehensive global approach. There are still critical needs for \ndirect bilateral assistance, particularly when that assistance is often \nchanneled, as it is with USAID funds, to service NGOs, as well as an \noverall coordination and policy role for UNAIDS, and a technical role \nfor the World Health Organization. Responding to AIDS and the Global \nFund are not fully synonymous.\n  The world faces immense challenges from global warming, to the threat \nof nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, to poverty on a vast \nscale. We cannot ignore any of these challenges, because they all bear \non the security of future generations of Americans.\n  But when those same future generations look back at this time and \nplace, I believe they will judge us, more than anything, on how we \nresponded to AIDS. It is the most urgent, the most compelling, moral \nissue of our time.\n  I urge the President, who has shown real leadership in focusing our \ncountry and the world on combating terrorism, to think differently \nabout AIDS. It cannot be just another problem we deal with in the \nnormal course of business. As serious a threat as international \nterrorism is and we are spending many billions of dollars to protect \nourselves from terrorists, measured by the number of victims it pales \ncompared to AIDS.\n  The administration needs to get serious. Earlier this year, the White \nHouse opposed efforts by the Congress, including by some Republicans, \nto provide $500 million in emergency funding to combat AIDS. Because of \nthe White House's objection, Senator Durbin's amendment was defeated.\n  Subsequently, the President refused to designate $200 million for \nHIV/AIDS, in the Homeland Security Supplemental, including $100 million \nfor the Global Fund, as an emergency. As a result, those funds are not \navailable.\n  If AIDS is not an emergency, nothing is. Over two decades have passed \nsince AIDS was first identified, yet we still\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\ndo not have a plan. A hundred million dollars here or there isn't a \nstrategy. Even $10 billion isn't a strategy. The Administration needs \nto spell out in clear terms a plan for dealing with each component of \nthe AIDS crisis care for orphans, treatment for the infected, and \nprevention. It needs to do this on a country scale and a global scale, \nand it needs to commit our share of the funds to implement it.\n  It won't be cheap. The Manhattan Project wasn't cheap either, but \nthat is what we need. It will cost far, far more if we waste another \nten years.\n  The Congress has showed over and over that it is ready. The \nadministration needs to lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11545-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11545-S11546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONTINUING THE FIGHT AGAINST THE HIV/AIDS PANDEMIC\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I rise to \nspeak on the HIV/AIDS bill that the Senate passed by unanimous consent \ntonight. This is the second time this year that the Senate passed a \nbill to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS overseas. As you recall, in July \nwe unanimously passed a comprehensive bill to fight the deadly disease. \nThe bill contained new authorities for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, authorized money for a contribution to the Global Fund \nfor AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, authorized the Secretary of the \nTreasury to enter into negotiations to improve the Heavily Indebted \nPoor Countries Initiative, and authorized funds for our bilateral \nassistance programs at the Agency for International Development.\n  The funding levels and authorities provided in the bill the Senate \npassed in July reflected an understanding of the enormity of the \nproblem, what it will take to address it, and the Senate's dedication \nto doing so. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives had neither the understanding nor the will to consider \nall of the provisions in the bill.\n  Instead, the Republican led House slow rolled conversations and \nnegotiations on the bill for so long that four months later we were \nstill unable to come to an agreement on the original provisions in the \nSenate passed bill. What we are left with is a stripped down version of \nwhat the Senate passed. Our original bill authorized $2.172 billion in \nfiscal year 2003 and $2.576 billion in fiscal year 2004. The House \ninsisted that we slash the title containing Health and Human Services \nauthorities. The only version of the bill they would agree to \nauthorizes a billion dollars less in fiscal year 2003 to fight HIV/AIDS \noverseas.\n  The Senate provided $1 billion for the Global Fund to Combat AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria this fiscal year, giving a clear indication \nthat we believe that the Fund is an important mechanism through which \nto meet the resource needs of countries highly affected by the disease. \nThe compromise with the House authorizes $250 million less in fiscal \nyear 2003.\n  The Senate legislation included a bill I introduced in April which \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to move forward with \nnegotiations for deeper debt relief for poor countries--especially \nthose facing a health crisis like HIV/AIDS. More debt relief provides \npoor countries more resources to devote to healthcare. The House \ninsisted that we eliminate even Sense of Congress language about debt \nrelief from the bill despite the fact that it is now clear--and the \nWorld Bank itself has recently announced--that unless the current debt \nrelief program is enhanced, the debt levels of those poor countries \nwill remain too high. How can we expect to developing nations \nstruggling under crippling debt to adequately meet the needs engendered \nby a severe health emergency such as HIV/AIDS? We cannot.\n  I am bitterly disappointed in the decisions made by our House \ncolleagues on the issues I have outlined above. Time and time again we \nhave been given information about the human consequences of the spread \nof the disease. Three million people died of AIDS in 2001, according to \nthe Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. Over half a million of \nthem were children. Over a million of them were women, who are the \nprimary care givers in any society. There are currently over 40 million \npeople living with AIDS.\n  Time and time again, we have been alerted to the security \nimplications of the spread of HIV. In January of 2000 the National \nIntelligence Council issued an estimate entitled the Global Infectious \nDisease Threat and Its Implications for the United States in which it \nstates:\n\n       The persistent infectious disease burden is likely to \n     aggravate and in some cases, may even provoke economic decay, \n     social fragmentation, and political destablization in the \n     hardest hit countries in the developing and former communist \n     worlds. . . . Some of the hardest hit countries in Sub-\n     Saharan Africa--and possibly later in South and Southeast \n     Asia--will face a demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and \n     associated diseases reduce human life expectancy by as much \n     as 30 years and kill as many as a quarter of their \n     populations over a decade or less, producing a huge orphan \n     cohort.\n\n  That same month the United Nations Security Council convened the \nfirst ever session on a health issue to discuss the security \nimplications of HIV/AIDS.\n\n  On October 1 of this year, the National Intelligence Council released \nanother report, The Next Wave of HIV/AIDS: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, \nIndia and China, which details the impact that HIV/AIDS is expected to \nhave on those countries through the year 2010. The findings in the \nreport were grim:\n  International efforts to combat HIV/AIDS to date have not checked the \nspread of the disease in these countries.\n  None of these five countries will be able to halt rising infection \nrates unless they channel more resources into education and health \nservices--resources that these countries do not have.\n  Vaccines are currently being developed and tested, however even if a \nvaccine is developed soon it will be ineffective against the HIV/sub-\ntypes common in Ethiopia, Russia, China, India and Nigeria.\n  A vaccine that is 75 percent effective would have to be given to 50 \npercent of the population in order stop the spread of HIV, according to \nsome experts.\n  Given the security threat and humanitarian concerns that HIV/AIDS \nposes throughout the world, I wish that my House colleagues had dealt \nwith all of the provisions in the Senate passed bill in a serious and \nconstructive way. We need to use all of the resources at our disposal \nto deal with this threat because make no mistake, the threat is very \nreal.\n  There is no question that we are left with a bill that is \nsignificantly more parochial. However, I will say that there are some \nvery good things in the legislation. First, we are able to keep the \nfiscal year 2004 authorization levels that were in the original Senate \nbill. $1.2 billion for the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis \nand Malaria in fiscal year 2004 is a much more realistic contribution, \nthan the 2003 level.\n  Second, the bill contains a provision which requires the \nadministration to produce a report which outlines a comprehensive \nintegrated strategy to combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. A \nscattershot approach will not stop the disease from spreading. In \naddition to being well funded, our programs must be well thought out.\n  This bill establishes the position of Special Coordinator for HIV/\nAIDS at the State Department, which I think is critical. As there are \nseveral agencies involved in providing assistance to fight the spread \nof HIV/AIDS overseas. In order to avoid duplication and omissions, it \nis imperative that there be an office which coordinates and oversees \nall the activities being carried out.\n  Finally, the bill contains a section which asks the Agency for \nInternational Development to develop a plan to empower women to prevent \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. The plan is to include education for women and \ngirls, and to provide access to programs which focus on economic \nindependence for women such as micro-finance loans. In addition, this \nsection authorizes money for product development of topical \nmicrobicides, medications which kill the HIV virus, that women can use \nto protect themselves without having to obtain the consent of an \npartner unwilling to use preventative measures.\n  HIV/AIDS is the worst plague mankind has ever known. No corner of the \nglobe is safe. It has hit hardest in the areas of the world with the \nleast resources with which to respond. I would argue that we should \nhelp these nations on purely humanitarian grounds. To those for whom \nself-interest is a\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\nstronger motivating factor, let me say this: the spread of HIV/AIDS \nposes very grave threats to economic growth and security in countries \nwhose stability has a direct impact on our own. If we do not help \naddress the threat now, it may well be to our detriment tomorrow. I \nurge the House to take up and pass the measure on which the Senate has \njust completed action.\n  The fight is not over. Next year, I plan to reintroduce legislation \nto improve the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative so that \ncountries dealing with the AIDS epidemic are better able to respond. I \nhope that my colleagues will support these efforts. It is also my \nsincere hope that the Senate will revisit the provisions that we \ndropped in order to reach compromise with our House colleagues. Failure \nto do so would be unwise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11546-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11546-S11547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE SMALL BUSINESS DROUGHT RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the Senate and the House prepare to \nbring the 107th session to a close, we leave some important small \nbusiness legislation unfinished. Regrettably, that includes passage of \nthe Small Business Drought Relief Act because of serial holds from \nRepublicans since August 1-3 and a half months. This emergency \nlegislation passed our committee with unanimous support, and yet \nSenators with no jurisdiction in small business, instigated by an \nadministration that claims to support small business, obstructed \npassage.\n  The committee reached out to those Senate members and their staffs \ntime and again, and there was no cooperation. Sixteen Governors--\nGovernor Hodges of South Carolina, Governor Easley of North Carolina, \nGovernor Barnes of Georgia, Governor Foster of Louisiana, Governor \nMusgrove of Mississippi, Governor Perry of Texas, Governor Wise of West \nVirginia, Governor Patton of Kentucky, Governor Glendening of Maryland, \nGovernor Holden of Missouri, Governor Keating of Oklahoma, Governor \nSundquist of Tennessee, Governor Warner of Virginia, Governor Siegel \nman of Alabama, Governor Huckabee of Arkansas, and Governor Guinn of \nNevada--reached out to the Congress asking for us to pass this bill, \nand they got no cooperation. The committee was ultimately able to \novercome tremendous differences between CBO's cost estimate and OMB's \ncost estimate to reach agreement with the Office of Management and \nBudget on passing this emergency legislation last week, but not even \nthat moved the Republican leadership to cooperate.\n  So we go home tonight, and our small businesses--main street \nAmerica--needlessly struggle to make ends meet, keep their doors open \nand employees on the payroll, because of partisan politics.\n  For those who don't remember, this is emergency legislation to help \nsmall non-farm-related businesses across this Nation that are in dire \nstraits because of drought conditions in their State. Just like the \nfarmers and ranchers, the owners of rafting businesses, marinas, and \nbait and tackle shops lose a lot of business because of drought.\n  Right now these small businesses can't get help through the SBA's \ndisaster loan program because of something taxpayers hate about \ngovernment--bureaucracy. SBA denies these businesses access to disaster \nloans because its lawyers say drought is not a sudden event and \ntherefore it is not a disaster by definition. Contrary to the Agency's \nposition that drought is not a disaster, as of July 16, 2002, the day \nwe introduced this bill, the SBA had in effect drought disaster \ndeclarations in 36 States. Unfortunately, the assistance was limited to \nfarm-related small businesses.\n  The 36 States include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, \nGeorgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New \nYork, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, \nVermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n  The situation has only gotten worse judging by SBA's own numbers. \nSince the bill was introduced, the SBA has declared disasters in two \nmore States and the District of Columbia. Instead of rising to the \noccasion and using their statutory authority to help the small \nbusinesses in these areas, they continue to deny them access to \ndisaster loans, hiding behind a legal opinion--a legal opinion that \nthey will not provide to the committee.\n  To make sure the facts of this legislation are accurate, let the \nrecord show that this bill does not expand the SBA disaster loan \nprogram. SBA already has this authority, and this bill simply restates \nand clarifies that authority to ensure that the law is applied fairly. \nLet the record show that SBA, contrary to its claims, has the expertise \nto determine when a drought is a disaster. First, the SBA already \ndeclares drought disasters and does so mainly by working with the U.S. \nSecretary of Agriculture. Second, in addition to working with the \nSecretary of Agriculture, there are existing SBA guidelines for \ndeclaring disasters, and those guidelines apply to drought too. For \nexample, the Governor of a State can request a declaration from the \nAdministrator of the SBA after certifying that more than five small \nbusinesses have suffered economic injury because of a disaster. Last, \nlet the record show that this legislation is modest in cost. CBO \nestimated that this bill would cost $5 million per year for 5 years, \nfar less than OMB's estimate of approximately $100 million per year. \nAnd last week, as I referenced earlier, we were able to reach an \nagreement with OMB that capped the cost at $9 million for fiscal year \n2003, enough to cover the cost of the bill as passed by the committee \nand the Bond/Enzi/Burns/Crapo amendment. Unfortunately, even OMB's \nconcurrence and the support of many Senators and Governors did not \npersuade the remaining Senator blocking passage of the bill to put \naside his differences for the sake of small businesses and permit it to \npass.\n  I thank the many supporters of this bill. My 22 colleagues who are \ncosponsors--Senators Bond, Hollings, Landrieu, Baucus, Bingaman, \nDaschle, Johnson, Edwards, Carnahan Cleland, Enzi, Lieberman, Harkin, \nEnsign, Reid, Helms, Allen, Bennett, Torricelli, Levin, Crapo and \nThurmond. All the Governors who put small businesses first and politics \nlast. Mr. Donald Wilhite, director of the National Drought Mitigation \nCenter at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, for all his assistance \nto my staff in understanding the scope of drought in this country and \nfor writing in support of the legislation. National Small Business \nUnited, for always being there to stand up for small businesses. The \nmany small business owners and small business advocates, such as \nWildlife Action, in South Carolina, who took the time to write me \nregarding the drought and their problems with the SBA. And last, but \ncertainly not least, from my home State, I thank Bob Durand of the \nMassachusetts Emergency Management Association for his help and \nsupport. We will take this fight up again in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several letters of \nsupport and my remarks be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 19, 2002.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We are deeply concerned that small \n     businesses in states experiencing drought are being \n     devastated by drought conditions that are expected to \n     continue through the end of the summer. We urge you to \n     support legislation that would allow small businesses to \n     protect themselves against the detrimental effects of \n     drought.\n       Much like other natural disasters, the effects of drought \n     on local economies can be crippling. Farmers and farm-related \n     businesses can turn in times of drought to the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture. However, non-farm small businesses \n     have nowhere to go, not even the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA), because their disaster loans are not \n     made available for damage due to drought.\n       To remedy this omission, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) \n     introduced the Small Business Drought Relief Act (S. 2734) on \n     July 16, 2002, to make SBA disaster loans available to those \n     small businesses debilitated by prolonged drought conditions. \n     This bill was passed by the Senate Small Business Committee \n     just eight days later. Also, the companion legislation (H.R. \n     5197) was introduced by Rep. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) on July 24, \n     2002.\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\n     Both bills are gaining bipartisan support, and we hope you \n     will cosponsor this important legislation and push for its \n     rapid enactment in the 107th Congress.\n       As 11 southern states are presently experiencing moderate \n     to exceptional drought conditions this summer, we cannot \n     afford to wait to act. We urge you to cosponsor the Small \n     Business Drought Relief Act and push for its consideration as \n     soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governors Don Siegelman of Alabama, Mike Huckabee of \n           Arkansas, Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, Paul E. Patton of \n           Kentucky, M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. of Louisiana, \n           Parris N.

John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The State of South Carolina is in its \n     fifth year of drought status, the worst in over fifty years. \n     Some parts of the state are in extreme drought status and the \n     rest is in severe drought status.\n       99% of our streams are flowing at less than 10% of their \n     average flow for this time of year. 60% of those same streams \n     are running at lowest flow on record for this date. The \n     levels of South Carolina's lakes have dropped anywhere from \n     five feet to twenty feet. Some lakes have experienced a drop \n     in water level so significant that tourist and recreational \n     use has diminished.\n       State and national climatologists are not hopeful that we \n     will receive any significant rainfall in the near future. To \n     end our current drought, we would need an extended period of \n     average to above average rainfall.\n       Droughts, particularly prolonged ones such as we are \n     experiencing now, have extensive economic effects. For \n     farmers who experience the economic effects of such a \n     drought, assistance is available through the USDA. For small \n     businesses, assistance is available only for agriculture \n     related small businesses, i.e. feed and seed stores. For \n     businesses that are based on tourism around Lakes and Rivers, \n     there is currently no assistance available.\n       We have reports of lake and river tourism dependent \n     businesses experiencing 17% to 80% declines in revenue. The \n     average decline in revenue is probably near 50% across the \n     board.\n       My staff has contacted Small Business Administration and \n     they are not authorized to offer assistance to these \n     businesses because a drought is not defined as a sudden \n     occurrence. Nonetheless, a drought is an ongoing natural \n     disaster that is causing great economic damage to these small \n     business owners.\n       I am requesting that you assist us in this situation by \n     proposing that the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \n     Committee take action to at least temporarily amend the SBA \n     authorizing language and allow them to offer assistance to \n     small businesses affected by prolonged drought. This would \n     allow Governors to ask SBA for an administrative declaration \n     of economic injury because of drought. The low interest loans \n     SBA can offer these businesses would allow many of them to \n     weather the drought and remain in business for the long run.\n       My staff has also been in contact with Senator Hollings' \n     legislative staff. I hope together, we can find an expedient \n     solution to the plight of these small business owners. Short \n     of finding a way to control the weather, this may be our only \n     option to help their dire situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Hodges,\n     Governor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11547-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11547-S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to express my \ndisappointment at the delay in providing crop disaster relief to \nfarmers across the country. Mother Nature has not been kind this year, \ndealing farmers weather that has devastated their crops and threatened \nthe survival of family farms.\n  In New York State crop damage has not come solely from drought. \nUnseasonably high temperatures in the spring followed by frost and \nhailstorms have devastated specialty crops such as apples, peaches, \npears, grapes, strawberries, stone fruits, onions, and cherries.\n  The unfortunate result of this disastrous weather is that a large \npercentage of these fruit farmers are bordering on financial ruin. I \nhave met with the farmers and growers of New York, and their stories \nare heartbreaking as they talk about bankruptcy and selling off their \nfamily's farm. Crop disaster relief is truly needed to keep these farms \ngoing as well as the rural economies that they support.\n  In order to provide this much needed assistance, I have worked with \nmy colleagues to pass legislation that would provide financial relief \nto farmers who have suffered losses due to natural disaster aid. I \ncosponsored S. 2800, a bill that would provide emergency disaster \nassistance to agricultural producers. I cosponsored the crop disaster \namendment to the Interior appropriations that passed with 79 votes. And \nI support Senator Baucus today in his continued efforts on behalf of \nthis Nation's farmers and our rural communities.\n  This year has been a true disaster for so many farmers. On behalf of \nfarmers and growers from the State of New York, I will continue to \nsupport crop disaster relief, particularly for specialty crop \nproducers. I urge my colleagues to support these efforts to provide \nassistance.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have heard my colleagues on the Senate \nfloor today talking about drought and the desperate need for drought \nassistance. Throughout this session, I have been a fervent advocate of \ndrought assistance for producers in Wyoming. I am speaking today \nbecause the need for assistance persists.\n  Today's discussion has focused on farmers. They need help. Farmers \nmissed out on the emergency livestock programs provided by the \nadministration. Even with crop insurance, farmers are facing serious \ndifficulties.\n  As this drought has continued for multiple years, crop insurance \npremiums have increased each time a producer is forced to take a loss. \nYield averages, the basis for insurance payments, have been dropping \nwith dismal production each year. Crop yields are so low this year that \nmarket prices are actually higher. The farm bill counter cyclical \npayments that were designed to support prices when markets fell below a \ncertain level have been thwarted by these higher prices. These higher \nprices are meaningless when the quantities have been so drastically \nreduced. Therefore, this protection has been rendered useless.\n  Farmers clearly need help, but I also think it is important to \nremember that our ranchers aren't safe yet either. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Bob and \nNancy Tarver. They are a ranching family from near my home of Gillette, \nWY.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                                         Tarver Heart X Ranch,\n\n                                 Gillette, WY, September 30, 2002.\n     Congresswoman Barbara Cubin,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Hon. Rep. Cubin: Thank you for the opportunity to share the \n     impact of the past three years of drought to our livestock \n     business in Northeastern Wyoming. The Heart X Ranch consists \n     of my husband, Bob, and two sons, Robert and James. I believe \n     we comprise a true family farm/ranch that is so often \n     referenced as to what congress wishes to save. Our income is \n     derived totally from agriculture and we provide the labor and \n     management for our ranch operation. Bob and I have been in \n     agriculture all of our lives. I was raised on a ranch in \n     Southeastern Montana and Bob is a Wyoming native whose roots \n     are Wyoming ranching. Our oldest son, Robert, is married and \n     his wife, Michelle teaches at Little Powder School. \n     Michelle's teaching has not only contributed to their family \n     living but also the benefits of health insurance for their \n     family. They have two sons, Tayler 6 years and Wyatt 3 years \n     old. James is engaged to be married.\n       My husband and I had a dream when we married to buy a \n     ranch. We have managed to buy a small place and lease the \n     majority of acres that we operate on. Along with our sons we \n     run cow-calf and a yearling operation. We are ultra \n     conservative and run our outfit as economically as possible. \n     . . as our fleet of 1978 ranch pickups exemplify.\n       The cost of drought to a ranching operation is staggering. \n     Explanation and computations of drought cost are detailed in \n     Attachment A. Summarizing the examples of additional cost for \n     this year is as follows:\n       Hay: $120.00 per cow; Cake: $21.00 per cow; Lick & Liquid \n     feed: $29.40 per cow; Heifer calf-feed lot: $18.75 per cow; \n     Pounds & dollars lost due to drought: $185.00 per cow; \n     $374.15.\n       The additional expenses that I have covered are the reality \n     of drought.\n       This is our third year of drought. The above are additional \n     cost for this year alone!\n       I am most grateful for the Feed Program--$23 per head, \n     Livestock Compensation Program--$18 per head, and the Nap \n     program--$1.00 per acre (depends on% loss, and if acres are \n     eligible) it is very evident from these numbers to see the \n     critical need for these programs and also the Disaster \n     Program for Livestock Assistance and Crop Disaster. Drought \n     is a natural disaster and the economic consequences are \n     devastating to agriculture. The necessity to have the \n     Disaster Programs for 2001 and 2002 are vital to save\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\n     the drought areas of American ranching and farming.\n       I believe with my whole heart and soul that to keep America \n     strong we need our farms and ranches providing the American \n     consumers the safest and best products in the world.\n       It is very humbling to share this information. However, I \n     am very proud to be a rancher and I am overwhelmed by not \n     only the financial devastation but also the mental pressures \n     of trying to save a viable family ranching operation from the \n     ravages of an unforgiving drought.\n       The drought in Wyoming has been compared to the 1930's. It \n     is heartbreaking to think that in America, commonly thought \n     of as the land of opportunity, the only ones that will be \n     left following the drought are the very wealthy and the hobby \n     rancher.\n       Thank you for your dedicated and persistent efforts to help \n     us in agriculture to survive the drought.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Tarver.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Schedule A.--Additional Cost of Drought 2002\n\n       1. We normally produce 1200-2000 ton of hay per year. 2000, \n     2001, and 2002 we produced only 150 ton per year. We have \n     been faced with purchasing hay because of very little hay \n     produced. Hay prices have jumped because of the far-reaching \n     drought conditions. The demand exceeds the supply. Cow \n     alfalfa hay prices (depending on your location/freight) have \n     ranged from $110 to $130 per ton for cow grass alfalfa hay. \n     The cost for our operation to replace the hay we did not grow \n     because of the drought is $80.00 per ton. [Using purchased \n     hay costing $115 per ton-$35 (cost to put up your own hay) = \n     $80 dollars per ton].\n       The drought mandates we feed hay for at least 5 months (150 \n     days @ 20 pounds per day = 1\\1/2\\ ton per cow X $80 dollars \n     per ton =$120.00 per cow.\n       2. Additional cattle cake is needed because of loss of \n     natural grazing vegetation. Cattle cake is fed along with the \n     hay to balance the nutritional needs of cattle. Because of \n     the drought twice the amount of pounds of cake per cow are \n     fed to meet the nutritional needs. We need wheat mids cake \n     (14 %protein) normal ration 2 pounds. The increase in cake \n     cost is 14 cents a day. The additional expense for cake for \n     150 days is $21.00 per head.\n       3. To enhance the limited natural vegetation supplemental \n     feeds (lick tubs or liquid feed) were used for 7 months this \n     year. The additional expense was 14 cents per day per cow--\n     210 dayX.14 cents =$29.40 per cow.\n       4. Additional Pasture & freight we have not found \n     additional pasture. The cost of moving is substantial: a. \n     $8.00 per head to freight about anywhere; b. $18.00-$25.00 \n     per head to pasture cow calf pairs.\n       5. We pasture our heifer calves until they are yearlings, \n     keeping some as replacements for our herd and selling the \n     remainder as bred heifers and open yearlings. This year \n     because of the drought the heifers calves will be sent a feed \n     yard for the winter months. The cost to feed the calves a \n     growth ration only is $1.00 per day. If we had the feed we \n     would do this cheaper at home. The additional cost to us will \n     be at least 25 cents per day. 25cents X 150 =$37.50 per \n     heifer calf. For loss computation I have used 50% heifer \n     calves in a herd so this loss would be $18.75 for calculation \n     purposes.\n       6. Less pounds have caused loss of income. We had to sell \n     steer calves and the small heifer calves starting August 15, \n     normally we sell calves the end of October. Our steer calves \n     in August weighted an average of 420 pounds compared to 600 \n     pounds last October. A 180-pound per steer calf loss is \n     devastating. Unfortunately there was a 20% drop in calf \n     prices, which compounded the pound loss. Steer calf income \n     took a 31% drop in 2002 for our ranch operation--$420 dollars \n     compared to $605 dollars the previous year. $185 per cow loss \n     in steer calf dollars produced.\n       7. Liquidation of the cowherd. Foundation stock cow sales \n     are giving up a lifetime commitment and are so very costly. \n     Herd genetics are a ranchers pride and also our profit. It \n     takes years to build a quality herd of cattle that does well \n     in our area and on our range. We would find buying back \n     quality cows that fit our ranching operation near impossible \n     and certainly cost prohibitive. The dollar value of this \n     cannot be measured.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I won't read the entire letter, but I would \nlike to highlight a few points that Bob and Nancy make. They are very \nthankful for the assistance given through the Livestock Feed Assistance \nProgram and the Livestock Compensation Program. These programs together \nprovide about $41 of assistance per cow. With this assistance, they \nhave purchased additional feed to supply their needs for the winter. \nThe Tarvers point out in their letter, however, that they have lost \nabout $374 per cow in 2002 due to drought. This loss has occurred \nprimarily through reduced forage growth in pastures, increased hay \ncosts and lower cattle weights. The drought assistance provided so far \nhas been short term. If we are going to save our family ranchers, we \nmust do more.\n  The Senate has consistently supported providing real relief to our \nproducers. In September we voted on an emergency agricultural amendment \nI cosponsored. That amendment would have provided almost $6 billion on \nboth farmers and livestock producers endangered by the drought across \nAmerica. After it was passed 79-16, the amendment was stalled along \nwith the Interior Appropriations bill. This was not the first time the \nSenate has shown strong support for disaster relief only to have it \nsnatched away. Senator Baucus and I successfully added an agricultural \ndisaster assistance package to the farm bill with a steady 69-30 vote. \nThe assistance package was removed from the conference report by the \nHouse.\n  We are not following through on our promises. The time has come to \nfulfill our words with action. If we have missed our final opportunity \nin this Congress, I urge my colleagues to pass emergency agricultural \nassistance as a top priority when we begin the 108th session. Thank \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11548-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11548-S11549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HELMS-LEAHY SMALL WEBCASTER SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, last week, I introduced the Small Webcaster \nSettlement Act of 2002, along with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy. Having now been passed by both Houses of \nCongress, this bill is expected soon to be signed by the President.\n  The Helms-Leahy bill is the result of a sustained and arduous \nnegotiating process involving numerous stakeholders. Its enactment \nenables small Internet radio services and the recording industry, if \nthey both choose, to settle their longstanding disputes regarding the \namount of royalties webcasters must pay in order to perform sound \nrecordings over the Internet.\n  This consensus legislation will bring much-needed stability to the \nemerging webcasting industry by permitting small commercial webcasters \nto establish with final certainty their financial obligations, thereby \nenabling entrepreneurs to secure additional venture capital and to \navoid bankruptcy in many cases.\n  Moreover, as enacted, this bill will ensure that privately negotiated \nsettlements will not be enacted into positive law, thereby negatively \nimpacting, either directly or indirectly, any industry or entity that \ndoes not or cannot yet settle their liabilities for these royalties.\n  Finally, this bill will require artists to be paid directly their \ncongressionally mandated share of performance royalties, so that there \nwill no longer be any risk that record companies with disproportionate \nbargaining leverage will, by contract, squeeze recording artists out of \ntheir fair share.\n  The Digital Millenium Copyright Act, DMCA, required, for the first \ntime, users of music recordings to pay performance royalties to owners \nof copyrights in sound recordings. The creation of this new performance \nroyalty represented a dramatic reversal of decades of U.S. public \npolicy.\n  Prior precedent had established that performances of sound recordings \non traditional broadcast radio were not deemed to result in liability \nfor performance royalties to sound recording copyright owners because \nit was those very same performances that introduced songs to the \nlistening public, thereby promoting sales of sound recordings and \ngenerating revenue for copyright owners and recording artists.\n  Notwithstanding this longstanding precedent, the DMCA required \nInternet radio services to pay sound recording performance royalties \nand determined that the royalties should be set by a panel or \narbitrators, known as the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or CARP.\n  Unfortunately, the arbitration process has become too lengthy, too \ntechnical, and too expensive for many stakeholders. As a result, \nthousands of small commercial webcasters, broadcasters, noncommercial \nwebcasters, college radio stations and hobbyists have been effectively \ndenied the opportunity to participate in the arbitration proceedings in \nany meaningful way. Perhaps it was because these smaller interests were \nnot adequately represented in the CARP proceeding that the resultant \nroyalty was so high and the rate structure so inflexible that the\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\nmajority of small webcasters feared that it would lead to their demise? \nAs the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee stated \nat a May 2002 hearing on this subject, Congress did not intend to \nbankrupt small webcasters when it created this new royalty.\n  It would be a mistake for someone to construe the Helms-Leahy bill as \na criticism of the arbitrators decision. Rather, I consider this \nlegislation to be an indictment of the process, with unintended \nconsequences flowing from the framework that Congress set forth in the \nDMCA.\n  It is impossible for arbitrators to appreciate the full implications \nof their determinations if significant industry participants cannot \nafford to appear before them or if those with disproportionate control \nover the outcome refuse to deal in good faith. I understand that \nSenator Leahy intends to pursue comprehensive CARP reform in the \nJudiciary Committee next Congress. Though I will no longer be serving \nin the U.S. Senate next year, I hope that the chairman and ranking \nmembers of both Judiciary Committees will follow through on this \ncommitment, working constructively to quickly remedy the concerns \nexpressed about the current CARP process.\n  There was not time to fully reform CARP this fall but I considered it \nessential that Congress move swiftly to ensure that small webcasters \nnot be bankrupted by unfair arbitration outcomes. An equally important \ngoal was to ensure that settlement agreements negotiated by recording \ncompanies and small webcasters facing bankruptcy not unfairly impact \nnon-participating third parties--such as larger webcasters and \nbroadcasters, or even the recording companies. Moreover, I consider it \ncritically important to underline that nothing in this bill should be \nconstrued as affecting the outcome of any pending litigation.\n  I commend Chairman Sensenbrenner for focusing attention on this issue \nand commencing the process that ultimately led to the passage of this \ncritically-needed legislation. I respect that there was a difference of \nopinion on the precedential value of H.R. 5469, as originally passed by \nthe House. Nevertheless, beyond dispute is the fact that numerous \nstakeholders had expressed serious reservations that the original \nHouse-passed bill could unintentionally and negatively influence future \nrate setting proceedings.\n  The Helms-Leahy bill removes that concern, helps ensure that small \nwebcasters will not be forced into bankruptcy, provides non-commercial \nwebcasters with additional flexibility, and accomplishes several other \ngoals on which the stakeholders and the Judiciary Committee leadership \ncould agree.\n  The deductibility provision contained in section 5(b) of the bill is \none that was viewed as important to several parties. The final \nprovision is intended to encourage competition among agents designated \nto distribute royalties. While I ultimately agreed to this provision, I \nwish to make it clear that I would consider it unconscionable if the \nprovision were used to justify higher royalty rates for users of sound \nrecordings.\n  The ability to deduct these fees is premised on a balance of \ninterests, owners of sound recordings should not be prejudiced by a \nprocess that precludes effective legal representation, designated \nagents should be incentivized to quickly and fairly conclude settlement \nagreements rather than engage in protracted and expensive legal and \narbitration proceedings, and music services and other users of sound \nrecordings should pay a fairly negotiated fee that is not impacted by \nthe costs of litigation, arbitration, and legal expenses incurred by \nthe designated agents.\n  Users already bear their own litigation, expert fee and legal \nrepresentation costs for participating in the CARP process and the \nresources of the Copyright Office are taxed when fair settlements are \nnot reached among the parties.\n  In my view, the public interest would not be well served if the \ndeductibility provision were interpreted in a manner that had the \neffect of diluting the payout to copyright owners, reducing the \nincentives for negotiating settlements, and/or increasing the fees paid \nby consumers for the use of sound recordings. To avoid these clearly \nundesirable and unintended outcomes, I believe it would be unwise to \ntake these costs into account in any arbitration or other proceeding to \nset royalty fees.\n  I expect this to be the final piece of legislation I author in my \ncareer as a United States Senator. I particularly wish to thank \nSenators Leahy and Hatch and their superb staffs for their expertise \nand assistance in ensuring the quick approval of the U.S. Senate. \nAdditionally, I want to recognize the substantial contributions of the \nSenate and House leadership as well as the leaders of the House \nJudiciary Committee, for their continued assistance and cooperation as \nwe worked through these difficult issues over the past several weeks.\n  Finally, I also wish to thank David Whitney, Joe Lanier, Wayne Boyles \nand David Crotts of my staff, the leaders of the affected industry and \nartist organizations who assisted me so greatly in negotiating this \ncompromise legislation and a young lady entrepreneur of whom I am \nextremely proud, Deb Proctor of WCPE-FM in Raleigh, NC who first \nbrought this issue to my attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11549-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11549-S11551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPERFORMANCE GOALS FOR THE MEDICAL DEVICE USER FEE AND MODERNIZATION ACT \n                                OF 2002\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Additional Efforts Related To Performance Goals\n\n       The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of \n     both informal and formal meetings (e.g., determination and \n     agreement meetings, informal pre-investigational device \n     exemption (IDE) meetings, pre-PMA meetings, pre-PMA filing \n     meetings) by both parties is critical to ensure high \n     application quality such that the above performance goals \n     can be achieved.\n\n\n                 j. maintenance of current performance\n\n       It is the intent of the Agency that in review areas where \n     specific performance goals have not been identified, current \n     performance will be maintained.\n\n\n                  k. application of user fee revenues\n\n       The Agency intends to apply significant user fee revenues \n     to support reviewer training and hiring and/or outside \n     contracting to achieve the identified performance goals in a \n     responsible and efficient manner.\n\n\n                     l. modular pma review program\n\n       The Agency intends to issue guidance regarding the \n     implementation of new section 515(c)(3) of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act. It is the intent of the Agency that \n     once this program is implemented, the Agency will work with \n     its stakeholders to develop appropriate performance goals for \n     this program. Until such time, the Agency intends to review \n     and close complete modules that are submitted well in advance \n     of the PMA submission as expeditiously as possible.\n\n\n                   m. ``follow-on'' licensed devices\n\n       The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research will, if \n     feasible, identify a category of ``follow-on'' licensed \n     devices and collect information to determine whether \n     alternative performance goals for such a category are \n     appropriate.\n\n\n                           n. bundling policy\n\n       The Agency will, in consultation with its stakeholders, \n     consider the issue of bundling for products with multiple \n     related submissions. After such consultation, the Agency will \n     either issue guidance on bundling or publish a notice \n     explaining why it has determined that bundling is \n     inappropriate.\n\n\n                  o. electronic review of applications\n\n       The Agency will continue its efforts toward development of \n     electronic receipt and review of applications, as \n     expeditiously as possible, acknowledging that insufficient \n     funding is included in the user fee program for this effort.\n\n\n                       p. preapproval inspections\n\n       The Agency will plan to improve the scheduling and \n     timeliness of preapproval inspections. The Agency will \n     monitor the progress of these efforts and provide such \n     information in the annual performance report.\n\n                     II. ANNUAL STAKEHOLDER MEETING\n\n       Beginning in fiscal year 2004, FDA will hold annual public \n     meetings to review and evaluate the implementation of this \n     program in consultation with its stakeholders.\n\n               III. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n\n       A. For original PMA submissions, Panel-Track PMA supplement \n     submissions, expedited original PMA submissions, 180-day \n     supplement submissions, and premarket report submissions, \n     issuance of one of the following letters is considered to be \n     an FDA decision:\n       1. approval\n       2. approvable\n       3. approvable pending GMP inspection\n       4. not approvable\n       5. denial\n       B.

Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any \n     other items, including any item that would require \n     presentation to an advisory committee.\n                                       The Secretary of Health and\n\n\n                                               Human Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman. As you are aware, the Medical Device \n     User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 was signed by the \n     President on October 26, 2002. Under Title I, the additional \n     revenues generated from fees paid by the medical device \n     industry will be used to expedite the medical device review \n     process, in accordance with performance goals that were \n     developed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in \n     consultation with the industry.\n       FDA has worked with various stakeholders, including \n     representatives from consumer, patient, and health provider \n     groups, and the medical device industry to develop \n     legislation and goals that would enhance the success of the \n     device review program. Title I of the Medical Device User Fee \n     and Modernization Act of 2002 reflects the fee mechanisms and \n     other improvements developed in these discussions. The \n     performance goals referenced in Section 101 are specified in \n     the enclosure to this letter, entitled ``Performance Goals \n     and Procedures.'' I believe they represent a realistic \n     projection of what FDA can accomplish with industry \n     cooperation and the additional resources identified in the \n     bill.\n       This letter and the enclosed goals document pertain only to \n     title I (Fees Related to Medical Devices) of Public Law 107-\n     250, Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. \n     OMB has advised that there is no objection to the \n     presentation of these views from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program. We appreciate the support of you \n     and your staffs, the assistance of other Members of the \n     Committee, and that of the Appropriations Committees, in the \n     authorization of this vital program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tommy G. Thompson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11551-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 6, \n2001in Madison, WI. Two men were arrested on the University of \nWisconsin campus for attempting to strangle a gay man. The attackers \nwere part of a visiting group on campus to talk about homosexuality. \nThe attackers approached the victim, told him that it was his time to \ngo to hell, then began choking him.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11551-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11551-S11552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ELECTRIC ASSISTED LOW-SPEED BICYCLES\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that H.R. 727 will \nsoon be on its way to the President for signature.\n  This bill, which passed the other body by a 401 to 1 margin on March \n6, 2002, will help promote the use of electric-assisted low-speed \nbicycles and will help seniors participate in cycling related \nactivities. For many of our seniors, long-distance bicycle rides or \nparticipation in bicycle clubs in areas with extensive hills, can \npresent an unfair challenge.\n  Simply put, this bill will allow seniors to more fully participate in \nthese events while, at the same time, providing solid exercise for \nthem. I believe that in states, such as my home state of Vermont, our \nsenior citizens may derive benefits from using these low-speed pedal-\nassisted electric bicycles for help getting up our steep terrain.\n  Not only will these bikes improve mobility options for seniors, they \nwill also help to reduce congestion on our roads and air pollution when \nused for commuting purposes. Since these bikes produce no noise or \nexhaust because they are powered by small batteries rather than \ngasoline powered engines, they provide an environmentally friendly \ntransportation option to our citizens and should be treated as bicycles \nand not as motor vehicles.\n  H.R. 727 states that these low-speed pedal-assisted electric bikes, \nas defined in very detailed Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, \nrules--found at 16 CFR 1512--shall be considered bikes and not motor \nvehicles.\n  These detailed existing safety standards for bicycles should be \napplied in every state, as in current law, and as would be required \nunder the bill for these low-speed pedal-assisted electric bikes. The \nexisting safety rules are based on extensive experience and tests done \non material strength, stem and fork torque resistance, pedal design and \nthe like and should apply throughout the nation. The existing rules, \nreferenced in H.R. 727, set the requirements for such things as: \nhandlebar stem insertions; pedal construction; chain guards; handlebar \nstem tests; stem-to-fork clamp tests; bicycle design; handlebar \nstrength; front hub retention; attachment hardware; hand levers for \nbrakes; reflectors; pedal reflectors; seat size; maximum seat height; \nand the like.\n  To assure the safety of these bicycles, the bill provides for federal \npreemption of State law or requirements--as provided in section 1(d) of \nthe bill--regarding those detailed CPSC safety rules. The CPSC would \nhave the authority to issue additional federal rules regarding the \nconstruction and physical properties of these low-speed bicycles to \nensure safety.\n  Obviously, local regulation of where these low-power bicycles can be \nridden, such as not on sidewalks if that is the state or local rule, or \nnot on high-speed thruways, or whether helmets are required, would \nstill be a local matter. Local or state governments would continue to \nregulate the use of these and other bikes, who could ride the bikes, \nand where they could be ridden, but they could not alter the safety \nrules for the construction of the bikes, or the metals or materials to \nbe used for that construction, which would be in the hands of the CPSC.\n  H.R. 727 also specifies a 20 mph limit on speed, on a flat surface, \nfor these electric assisted bikes. The bikes covered by this bill look \nsimilar to ``regular'' low-weight bicycles and will have similar speeds \nbut require less human leg power and stamina.\n  It is important to note that this bill does not relate to other \ndevices such as the Segway human transporter which does not meet any of \nthe detailed requirements for a bicycle set forth in the CPSC rules.\n  I am aware of companies researching such electric bicycle product \nadvancements, such as Wavecrest right here in Northern Virginia, and am \nexcited about the prospects for the future.\n  I appreciate the strong efforts in the other body of Mr. Cliff \nStearns, Mr. Billy Tauzin, Mr. Howard Berman, Mr. Earl Blumenauer, Mrs. \nLois Capps, Mr. Dennis Moore, Mr. Michael Oxley, Mr. Charles Pickering, \nMr. James Oberstar and many others. In the Senate, I appreciate efforts \nof Chairman Hollings, ranking member Senator McCain and Senator Burns, \nall of the Commerce Committee, in getting this bill to the Senate floor \nwhere it passed without opposition.\n  As I work on the massive reauthorization of our surface \ntransportation\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\nprogram next year, I intend to work to fund additional bicycle paths \nand enhance existing paths as use of these paths increases over time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11552-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE FAILURE TO PASS AN ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is with a tremendous amount of \nfrustration and disappointment that I come before the Senate to discuss \nthe failure of efforts in the 107th Congress to craft an energy bill. I \nhave been a long-time advocate of a comprehensive national policy that \nwould address the national and economic security aspects of this \ncountry's growing demand for energy, as well as the importance of \nprotecting our environment.\n  I was very proud of the work the Senate had done this year to produce \nthis legislation. Under the leadership of Majority Leader Tom Daschle \nand Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman, the \nSenate did what many in Washington thought impossible--we produced \nbalanced and responsible energy legislation combining increased \ndomestic production of conventional fuels, expanded use of alternative \nand renewable energy sources, and energy conservation and efficiency \nprograms. Unfortunately, in our rush to complete work on a number of \npending matters, many Senators chose to not proceed with Conference \nnegotiations, acquiescing in what I would characterize as a strategy to \nscuttle this worthwhile bill.\n  Perhaps the thought was that a better bill--or at least one that \nbetter met a different set of priorities--could be crafted next year. \nCandidly, I doubt it. I believe the demise of the Energy bill this year \nis unfortunate for West Virginia, and for the entire nation. During a \nnearly year-long debate on the complex components of the energy bill, \nmy position as a senior Majority member of the Senate Finance Committee \nallowed me to influence the legislation so that its end results would \nbe good for consumers, workers, and industries in my state of West \nVirginia. I am concerned that a new set of circumstances confronting \nthe 108th Congress will result in a bill that does not serve my state \nnearly as well.\n  While the need to grapple with energy issues will not go away, no \nmatter what other factors are to be considered, Congress will be forced \nto act in a vastly changed budgetary climate. The growing deficit, \nadditional proposed tax cuts, and the need to fund both a war on \nterrorism and a possible war with Iraq, will inhibit the ability of \nCongress to make any significant outlays to improve our energy \nsituation.\n  The 2002 energy bill was a bipartisan effort. Perhaps most \nsignificantly for West Virginia, there was general agreement among \nSenate conferees that the final bill should include meaningful Clean \nCoal incentives. I worked very hard to see that the Senate-passed bill \nincluded incentives for the installation of Clean Coal technologies on \nsmaller existing coal-burning facilities, such as we have in West \nVirginia. The version passed by the House would have bypassed existing \nfacilities altogether--putting thousands of West Virginia jobs at risk \nand jeopardizing the health of all West Virginians downwind of these \nplants. As a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee \nreconciling the two versions of the energy bill, I was able to ensure \nthat the final legislation included incentives for existing facilities. \nIf the energy bill is considered again in the 108th Congress, I will \nlikely again be a conferee, but my ability to apply pressure to benefit \nthe people and environment of our state will be lessened.\n\n  I also worked closely with a number of colleagues from both parties \nto see that the bill included incentives to capture coal mine methane, \na deadly hazard in coal mines, and a potent greenhouse gas when vented \nto protect the lives of miners. I was proud to join with members from \nboth sides of the aisle to extend credits for the production of oil and \nnatural gas from non-conventional sources. Without this credit, the \nnatural gas industry in the entire Appalachian Basin would likely cease \nto exist. Likewise, I was pleased to join in a bipartisan effort to \npromote the use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. \nSimilarly, I joined colleagues from across the political spectrum to \nfurther research and development and create tax incentives for the \nproduction of electricity from renewable sources, and to increase \nenergy efficiency in homes, commercial buildings, and appliances.\n  In fact, what most frustrates me is that this product of so much \nbipartisan cooperation is dead because of what may have been a cynical \ncalculation to reconsider later a few issues with which there will \nnever be truly bipartisan agreement.\n  If the next Congress does revisit the issue of a national energy \npolicy, I am certain that those in charge will put much-needed emphasis \non domestic production. At the same time, I have serious doubts that \nthe incoming congressional majorities will toil quite as hard to \nbalance that priority with the equally necessary issue of protecting \nthe environment. In the same vein, while I suspect that there will be \nnew efforts to exploit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and on our \nother public lands, regardless of the minimal amounts of mineral \nresources that may be recoverable, I am not confident that a new bill's \nauthors will show the same zeal to expand our domestic energy \nproduction from clean and abundant renewable resources.\n  This has been a hard fight, and while not perfect, the legislation we \nwere so close to producing would have been the truly comprehensive and \nbalanced energy policy that I have been calling for since I came to \nCongress eighteen years ago. Since then, I have continuously urged my \ncolleagues in the Congress, as well as both Republican and Democratic \npresidential administrations, to work together on a responsible energy \npolicy for this country. The 107th Congress was prepared to deliver a \nbalanced, comprehensive energy plan for the President's signature. Now, \nfor a number of reasons the energy bill is dead, putting the American \neconomy and the American environment at risk. I find this frustrating, \nshort-sighted, and extremely unfortunate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11552-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11552-S11553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            U.S. LEADERSHIP IN AEROSPACE--TODAY AND TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a core factor in \nAmerica's leadership and strength in the new century: aerospace. The \naerospace industry dominates the telecommunication and transportation \nworld, while military aerospace expertise has defended the Nation and \nserved as the eyes and ears of our forces overseas.\n  Congress established an Aerospace Commission last year to study the \nstate of the American aerospace industry in the global economy and \nnational security and to assess the importance of the domestic \naerospace industry for the future security of the Nation. It is \nappropriate that the Aerospace Commission released its report on the \nfuture of the aerospace industry this Monday during the final debate on \nhomeland security, an area only beginning to appreciate what aerospace \ncan offer.\n  The Aerospace Commission reviewed the range of military, civil, and \ncommercial aspects of aviation and space and studied the key components \nof the aerospace community--government, industry, labor, and academia. \nThe Commission benefited from the broad range of expertise and \nexperience among its Commissioners, including former Astronaut Buzz \nAldrin, former Defense Under Secretary John Hamre, and Director of the \nHayden Planetarium Dr. Neil Tyson.\n  The Commission offered several recommendations to correct the \nweakening of the aerospace sector. Each recommendation addressed a \ndifferent critical factor that is showing signs of fatigue. I would \nlike to discuss the Commission's recommendations relating to the \naerospace workforce and education.\n  The aerospace industry, like many of our high-tech sectors, has a \nworkforce crisis. According to the Commission report, our Nation has \nlost over 600,000 scientific and technical aerospace jobs in the past \n13 years. These job losses, first due to reduced spending in defense, \nthen due to acquisitions and mergers of aerospace companies, and later \nto foreign competition in the commercial aerospace market, represent a \nsignificant loss of skill and expertise. Many of the talented people\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\nwho remain are approaching retirement. How will industry and the \nGovernment restore the aerospace workforce and make aerospace a field \nthat attracts new and qualified talent?\n  Unfortunately, even the Aerospace Commission could not arrive at any \nshort-term solutions to this problem. The solution will only come from \nthe Government's and the private sector's long-term attention and \ncommitment. The Commission stressed that a long-term solution must \nbegin with improved math and science education across the entire \neducation range, from kindergarten to graduate school. Many of the \nCommission's recommendations in this regard mirror my own work on \nscience and math education and the federal workforce. The Commission \nfound that scholarship and internship programs to encourage more \nstudents to study and work in math, science, and engineering are vital \nif the aerospace community is to have a pool of scientifically and \ntechnologically trained applicants.\n  The Commission stressed that Congress needs to renew its focus on \nnational aerospace needs and priorities. Indeed, some of the \nCommission's recommendations are unconventional and will require the \nSenate's attention and deliberation to determine if they are the best \nsolution. The Commission's nine recommendations were:\n\n       Given the real and evolving challenges that confront our \n     Nation, Government must commit to increased and sustained \n     investment and must facilitate private investment in the \n     national aerospace sector. The Commission recommends that the \n     United States pioneer new frontiers in aerospace technology, \n     commerce, and exploration.\n       The Commission concludes that superior mobility afforded by \n     air transportation is a huge national asset and competitive \n     advantage for the United States. The Commission recommends \n     transforming the U.S. air transportation system as a national \n     priority. Specifically, the Commission recommends rapid \n     deployment of a new, highly automated air traffic management \n     system that is robust enough to efficiently, safely, and \n     securely accommodate an evolving variety and growing number \n     of aerospace vehicles and civil and military operations.\n       The Commission concludes that the Nation will have to be a \n     space-faring nation in order to be the global leader in the \n     21st century and that America must exploit and explore space \n     to assure national security, economic benefit, and scientific \n     discovery. The Commission recommends that the United States \n     create a space imperative and a partnership between NASA, \n     DOD, and industry to develop aerospace technologies, \n     especially in the areas of propulsion and power.\n       The Commission concludes that aerospace capabilities and \n     the supporting defense industrial base are fundamental to \n     U.S. economic and national security. The Commission \n     recommends that the Nation adopt a policy that invigorates \n     and sustains the aerospace industrial base. Specifically, the \n     Commission recommends new procurement policies to include \n     prototyping and spiral development to allow the continuous \n     exercise of design and production skills; removing barriers \n     to defense procurement of commercial products and services; \n     and stable funding for core capabilities.\n       The Commission concludes that the Government needs to \n     create an environment that fosters innovation in the U.S. \n     aerospace industry. The Commission recommends that the \n     Federal Government establish a national aerospace policy and \n     promote aerospace by creating a Government-wide management \n     structure. This would include a White House policy \n     coordinating council, and aerospace management office in OMB, \n     and a joint committee in Congress.\n       The Commission concludes that U.S. aerospace companies must \n     have access to global consumers, suppliers, and partners in \n     order to achieve economies of scale in production needed to \n     integrate that technology into their products and services. \n     The Commission recommends that U.S. and multilateral \n     regulations and policies be reformed to enable the movement \n     of products and capital across international borders on a \n     fully competitive basis, and establish a level playing field \n     for U.S. industry in the global market place. This would \n     include substantial overhaul of U.S. export control \n     regulation and efforts by the U.S. Government to neutralize \n     foreign government market intervention in areas such as \n     subsidies, tax policy, export financing and standards.\n       The Commission recommends a new business model for the \n     aerospace sector, designed to promote a healthy and growing \n     U.S. aerospace industry. This model is driven by increased \n     and sustained Government investment and the adoption of \n     innovative Government and industry policies that stimulate \n     the flow of capital into new and established public and \n     private companies.\n       The Commission recommends the Nation immediately reverse \n     the decline in, and promote the growth of, a scientifically \n     and technologically trained U.S. aerospace workforce. This \n     would include efforts by the administration and Congress to \n     create an interagency task force that develops a national \n     strategy on the aerospace workforce to attract public \n     attention to the importance and opportunities within the \n     aerospace industry; establish lifelong learning as key \n     elements of education reform; and make long-term investment \n     in education and training with major emphasis in math and \n     science.\n       The Commission concludes that Government policies must be \n     proactive and sustain public investments in long-term \n     research and RDT infrastructure to get new breakthroughs in \n     aerospace capabilities. The Commission recommends that the \n     Federal Government significantly increase its investment in \n     basic aerospace research, which enhances U.S. national \n     security, enables breakthrough capabilities, and fosters an \n     efficient, secure, and safe aerospace transportation system.\n\n  I was one of the first members of the House Space Caucus and \nunderstand the importance aerospace plays in our economy, security, and \neducation. The Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, which I chair, released \na report last year detailing how Federal civilian agencies use data \ncollected by satellites and planes to carry out their missions. My own \nState of Hawaii is at the forefront of using aerospace technology and \nresearch to help Hawaii's fragile ecosystem and agriculture.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take note of the information and \nrecommendations in the Aerospace Commission report so that we can work \ntogether to sustain and strengthen our aerospace community. To quote \nthe report, ``It is imperative that the U.S. aerospace industry remains \nhealthy to preserve the balance of our leadership today and ensure our \ncontinued leadership tomorrow.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11553-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11553-S11554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN PROBATE REFORM ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Crippen, Director).\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE\n\n     S. 1340--Indian Probate Reform Act of 2002\n       S. 1340 would amend laws that govern how an individual's \n     interest in Indian allotments (certain parcels of land that \n     are owned by individuals or groups of individuals) is \n     transferred upon the death of the owner. Based on information \n     for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), CBO estimates that \n     implementing S. 1340 would cost about $1 million in fiscal \n     year 2003, assuming the availability of appropriated funds, \n     to train BIA estate planning assistants and to notify \n     individual allotment interest owners and Indian tribes of the \n     changes in this law. CBO estimates that enacting S. 1340 \n     would not affect direct spending or revenues.\n       S. 1340 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose \n     no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.\n       S. 1340 would impose new private-sector mandates, but CBO \n     estimates that the total direct costs of those mandates would \n     not exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA ($115 \n     million in 2002, adjusted annually for inflation) for any of \n     the first five years that the mandates are in effect.\n       By placing new eligibility and distribution requirements on \n     the inheritance of interests in Indian trust and restricted \n     lands, S. 1340 would impose new private-sector mandates on \n     those persons who might otherwise inherit such interests \n     under current law. The loss of inheritance (or a portion of \n     an inheritance) would impose direct costs on people who would \n     otherwise receive an interest in such property. CBO expects \n     that the mandates would affect only a limited number of such \n     people in the near term. At the earliest, mandates in the \n     bill would take effect only upon the death of an owner of \n     land interests. Further, the mandates would only apply to \n     interest in trust or restricted land of someone who died \n     without a will. Although requirements in the bill would \n     affect some\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n     heirs, many such cases would involve only a small fractional \n     interest in land. Thus, CBO estimates that the costs of \n     private-sector mandates in the bill would not exceed the \n     annual threshold established in UMRA in any of the first five \n     years that the mandates are in effect.\n       The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Lanette J. \n     Walker (for federal costs), and Cecil McPherson (for the \n     impact on the private sector). This estimate was approved by \n     Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget \n     Analysis.\n         United States Department of the Interior, Office of the \n           Secretary,\n                                     Washington, DC, Jun 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter sets forth the views of the \n     Administration on S. 1340, a bill to amend the Indian Land \n     Consolidation Act of 2000 to provide for probate reform with \n     respect to trust or restricted lands. We support the bill.\n       S. 1340 will provide the American Indian people who own \n     trust and restricted assets with one uniform probate \n     intestate code that can be applied throughout Indian country. \n     The legislation is clearly the product of a lot of hard work \n     by Departmental employees and members of your staff in order \n     to achieve the common goal of reforming the Department's \n     Indian probate program.\n       During tribal consolidations held in July and August 2000 \n     on the proposed probate regulations, many Tribes recommended \n     and supported a uniform probate intestate code. At the \n     present time, federal statutes provide that the law of the \n     state where the land is located be applied in the \n     distribution of the estate. See 25 U.S.C. Sec. 348. As a \n     result of inter-tribal marriage, it is not uncommon that an \n     Indian decedent owns lands on reservations in several states. \n     The effect of applying up to 33 different state laws to the \n     restricted and trust lands of a decedent results in disparate \n     and unfair treatment of the distribution of the entire estate \n     to the same heirs.\n       For example, in Nebraska a surviving spouse is entitled to \n     receive the first $50,000 of the estate. Thereafter, the law \n     provides that the surviving spouse receive \\1/2\\ and children \n     get \\1/2\\ of the remainder of the estate. Minnesota law \n     provides that a surviving spouse's share is the first \n     $150,000 plus \\1/2\\ of the balance of the intestate estate if \n     all of the heirs are also heirs of the surviving spouse. In \n     contrast, Wisconsin law provides that a surviving spouse \n     receive 100 percent of the estate unless one or more children \n     are not the children of the surviving spouse, then the \n     surviving spouse receives only \\1/2\\. New Mexico law differs \n     from the previous examples in that a surviving spouse gets \n     all the community property, then \\1/4\\ of the estate if there \n     are descendants of the decedent.\n       Another area of concern is the inheritance rights of \n     adopted children and the inconsistencies in state laws. \n     Minnesota law provides that an adopted child may inherit from \n     his/her natural parents, while Montana law provides that an \n     adopted child may only inherit from the adopted parents.\n       The enactment of a uniform intestate code for trust and \n     restricted estates is of great benefit to both the heirs and \n     the Department. The benefit to the heirs is that the same law \n     will be applied to all the trust and restricted estate of the \n     decedent no matter where the real property is located. A \n     uniform intestate probate code will provide for the division \n     of shares of the entire estate and will be the same \n     throughout the United States. The heirs may disclaim their \n     interests or otherwise agree to a settlement to distribute \n     the estate if the children want to give a larger share to \n     their surviving parent. The federal government's cost to \n     update and maintain land records will be reduced. The \n     Department will be able to decide cases and issue orders in a \n     more timely manner. A new body of federal law will be created \n     and decisions will be more consistent across the Nation, \n     resulting in fewer appeals. The necessity of thoroughly \n     researching state laws will no longer exist, it will take \n     less time to issue an order determining heirs. Finally, a \n     uniform intestate code may encourage Indian tribes to adopt \n     their own inheritance codes. The uniform intestate code will \n     serve as a model for Tribes to develop their own tribal \n     probate codes.\n       The proposed uniform intestate succession facilitates the \n     consolidation of interests to remain in trust or restricted \n     status and complements the provision of Indian Land \n     Consolidation Act to minimize further fractionation of \n     Individual Indian interests in trust and restricted lands. \n     For estate planning purposes, one uniform intestate code will \n     provide a foundation to encourage the execution of wills for \n     disposition of trust or restricted assets. For example, the \n     proposed section for pretermitted spouses and children will \n     necessitate specific estate planning if the decedent marries \n     after the execution of a will but intends to leave nothing to \n     a new spouse. S. 1340 at Sec. 232(d). Similarly, if the \n     testator divorces after executing a will and has left \n     property to the former spouse, the devise is revoked by law \n     unless the will provides otherwise. S. 1340 at \n     Sec. 232(e)(2).\n       State probate laws are often amended and likewise affect \n     long term estate planning. A change in state law may also \n     necessitate the execution of a new will. Thus, frequent \n     amendments of state laws frustrate the purposes of promoting \n     estate planning among Indian landowners. There will obviously \n     need to be considerable community education on the new \n     sections of the proposed uniform intestate law that will \n     require more comprehensive estate planning.\n       We recommend that Senate Bill 1340 include a provision that \n     excepts the application of the uniform intestate code to the \n     Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma until such time as the Five \n     Nations bill is enacted. The Five Civilized Tribes are \n     subject to the state district courts of Oklahoma and Oklahoma \n     probate law is applied to determine intestate succession. \n     Thus, the removal of the exception should be reflected in S. \n     2880, the Five Nations legislation.\n       We would like to suggest amendments to portions of existing \n     federal statutes relevant to inheritance prior to the passage \n     of S. 1340. The amendments are:\n       25 U.S.C. Sec. 348--After the second ``Provided,'' strike \n     the words, ``That the law of descent in force in the State or \n     Territory where such lands are situate shall apply thereto \n     after patents therefor have been executed and delivered, \n     except by the'' and insert ``the Indian Land Consolidation \n     Act, as amended, shall apply where such trust or restricted \n     assets are located''. See S. 1340 at Sec. 234(c).\n       25 U.S.C. Sec. 372--Insert before the word ``hearing'' in \n     the words ``upon notice and hearing'', the words \n     ``opportunity for a''. Insert the words ``probate the \n     decedent's trust estate, and pay valid creditor's claims out \n     of funds in such estate or funds that may accrue up to the \n     date of death of the decedent'' after the word ``decedent,''. \n     Insert ``Provided, That in the payment of claims, 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3713(a)(1)(b) shall not apply.'' after ``section 373 of \n     this title.''\n       25 U.S.C. Sec. 373--Insert ``Provided also, that the \n     Secretary shall pay valid creditor's claims out of funds in \n     such estate or funds that may accrue up to the date of death \n     of the decedent except that 31 U.S.C.

I am speaking of Dolores \nGarcia, whose service in the Senate started the same day as my own, \nJanuary 3, 1983. Dolores and I had worked together prior to that when I \nwas Attorney General of New Mexico, and she had been with the Attorney \nGeneral's staff long before I came to that office.\n  My staff and I, as well as countless New Mexicans, feel fortunate to \nknow and work with Dolores. Diligent, competent, with a benevolent \nnature and a strong work ethic, Dolores embodies the best of human \ntraits. In her work as the coordinator for service academy nominations, \nshe has started many young leaders on their way to success. She helps \nkeep my Santa Fe office running smoothly, attends the needs of local \nand legislative officials, helps manage my office budget, and \ncoordinates my state schedule. No matter how busy she might be, she \nalways has time and a kind word for those who turn to her for help.\n  Dolores is a great friend to my staff and me. We hold her in the \nhighest esteem. Another long-time staff member commented that he \nthought his best hope of getting into Heaven is on her coattails. I \nfeel the same, Mr. President, and would feel fortunate to have her \nvouch for me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11554-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11554-S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A SPECIAL ADOPTION MONTH\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, November is a special month to the adoption \ncommunity, because it is National Adoption Month. In my state of Idaho, \nthis particular November is a very special month because it is when one \nof our newest citizens--Tilly McKeown--came home.\n  Tilly is one of hundreds of children from Cambodian orphanages who \nare the focus of a special humanitarian initiative by the United States \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and the State Department. \nAdoptions from Cambodia were halted late last year because of serious \nconcerns about the process in that country, and the initiative has been \nworking since then to investigate and clear these adoptions on a case \nby case basis.\n  We all want the adoption system to be ethical, transparent, and \nefficient. To achieve those goals in international adoptions, the \nUnited States signed the\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\nHague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, a landmark international \ntreaty setting standards for adoption that will protect the interests \nof children and families everywhere in the world. The Senate ratified \nthe treaty, and Congress passed legislation to implement it.\n  We expect our federal agencies involved in international adoption to \nwork toward these goals with all sending countries, whether they have \nsigned the treaty or not. These are important policy goals for our \ngovernment, but what is more important, they will help bring waiting \nchildren everywhere together with the families who will love them \nforever.\n  They also will help prevent situations like the Cambodian dilemma \nfrom ever happening again. Before last December, our country had never \nplaced a moratorium on adoptions out of a foreign country, and I think \nit is safe to say that anyone who knows anything about the Cambodian \nmoratorium hopes our country never takes such an action again. In fact, \nsome of us in Congress have worked on legislation to that end.\n  This surely must be the hope of every family whose adoption was \ncaught in the moratorium. Mr. President, the anguish these families \nhave endured is indescribable. I do not think a day has passed when \nthey have not pressed the Cambodian and American governments for a \nresolution to enable them to bring their children home to the United \nStates. They know all too well what an enormous impact government \npolicies can have on human lives and futures.\n  I hope that some day, Tilly's parents will tell her the true story of \nhow hard they worked, every day, to bring her home how sad they were \nevery time the answer was ``not yet,'' how they traveled all the way to \nCambodia just to see and hold her, and how overjoyed they were when \nthey finally got the call to bring their daughter home.\n  And when they tell her that story, I hope they also share with her \nthe fact that there were people across the nation and around the world \nwho also cared, and worried about her, and were trying to help her and \nher family. In the United States Senate, the House of Representatives, \nthe Department of State, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nand our embassies, people knew about Tilly and were working to remove \nthe obstacles that kept this family apart, while still carrying out the \nrequirements of the law. The White House played a critical role, \nproviding extraordinary leadership and resources to resolve this \ncomplicated situation. The commitment this Administration has made to \nall of these families and their children is truly remarkable and should \nbe commended. The humanitarian initiative has made tremendous progress, \nand none of this could have happened without the dedicated efforts of \nall these individuals, working together.\n  I realize the resolution of the Cambodian adoption crisis cannot come \nfast enough for the families involved, and some will never accept or \nforgive the decision that was made last December, or the amount of time \nthat has passed. To them, I pledge to see this initiative through and \nwork for reforms so that no other families are put in this predicament \nagain. To the many government officials who are working in the field or \nin Washington, D.C. on this initiative, I encourage you to persevere in \nthis very important effort; you are making a lasting difference in the \nlives of these families and their children.\n  And to Tilly, a very happy welcome to Idaho--at last.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11555-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SPINA BIFIDA\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to pay tribute to the \nmore than 70,000 Americans and their family members who are currently \naffected by Spina Bifida, the Nation's most common permanently \ndisabling birth defect. I also want to compliment the Spina Bifida \nAssociation of America, an organization that was founded in 1973 to \naddress the needs of the individuals and families affected by Spina \nBifida and which is currently the only national organization dedicated \nsolely to advocating on behalf of the Spina Bifida community.\n  Spina Bifida is a neural tube defect that occurs when the central \nnervous system does not properly close during the early stages of \npregnancy. Spina Bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, \nbut with proper medical care, people who suffer from Spina Bifida can \nlead full and productive lives. Today, approximately 90 percent of all \nbabies diagnosed with this birth defect live into adulthood, \napproximately 80 percent have normal IQs, and approximately 75 percent \nparticipate in sports and other recreational activities. However, they \nmust learn how to move using braces, crutches or wheelchairs, and how \nto function independently. The challenge now is to ensure that these \nindividuals have the highest quality of life possible and to prevent \nfuture cases of Spina Bifida.\n  Congress has done much to deal with the challenges posed by Spina \nBifida including providing funding to establish a National Spina Bifida \nProgram at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I was \npleased the Senate recently adopted the ``Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities Prevention Act of 2002,'' which takes \nimportant steps to improve the quality of life for individuals and \nfamilies affected by Spina Bifida.\n  I also want to thank the Spina Bifida Association of Mississippi for \nall it has done for the families in our State who are affected by this \ncondition. Specifically, I commend Susan Branson, the president of the \nSpina Bifida Association of Mississippi, for her dedication and \ncommitment to helping families like her own who each day face the joys \nand challenges of having a child with Spina Bifida. In October, which \nwas designated as National Spinal Bifida Awareness Month, Susan and her \nhusband, Alan, and their 4-year-old daughter, Abigail, visited \nWashington and met with me. The Bransons live in Jackson, Mississippi, \nand in addition to Abigail they have four other children. We talked \nabout their family's experience with having a child with Spina Bifida. \nWhen Abigail was born they were told that she would never be able to \nwalk. Today, due to her and her parents' vigilance, advocacy, and \ncommitment, Abigail can now walk with the aid of braces and a walker.\n  The Spina Bifida community and our nation have made great progress \nover the past three decades. Much work still needs to be done, but I am \nconfident this organization and its chapters are up to the challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11555-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRESSMAN JOSEPH R.

After much hard work from several members of \nthe New Jersey Delegation and hundreds of constituents in New Jersey \nand around the country, the President will sign H.R. 2546, The Real \nInterstate Driver Equity Act. This Act will bring tremendous relief to \nthose operators of the luxury ground transportation industry conducting \ninterstate business.\n  Four years ago, two of my constituents Don Kensey of Au Premiere \nLimousine of Bellmawr, and James Moseley of James Limousine of Cherry \nHill, approached my good friend Congressman Rob Andrews concerning the \nproblem limousine operators in New Jersey were having with local \njurisdictions in other States seizing and fining properly authorized \nvehicles upon picking up their clients to return them to New Jersey. \nJoining with many other limousine businesses in New Jersey and the \nNational Limousine Association, our constituents organized a national \ngrassroots campaign in the 106th Congress to educate the House and \nSenate. Today, the Congress is aware of the hardships faced by these \nsmall business owners across the country.\n  Because such a substantial portion of their service does not occur in \na single State, limousine and other prearranged ground transportation \nservice providers are frequently assessed registration and licensing \nfees by these other States. Enforcement of these requirements, which \nincludes vehicle impoundment and heavy fines, has caused tremendous \nhardship to drivers and owners of these businesses, over 80% of which \nare one-to-three car operators grossing less than $500,000 a year. I \nwould note that these problems are especially hard on small businesses \nin New Jersey, which borders on two States with large cities and \nairports.\n  Indeed, I was shocked to hear that in one particularly egregious \ninstance, the CEO of McGraw Hill Publishing was forced out of his \nlimousine, which was seized in another State and told to find another \nway home. That was when Senator Corzine and myself, along with \nCongressman Andrews decided to take action.\n  The Real Interstate Driver Equity Act simply prohibits States other \nthan a home licensing State from enacting or enforcing a law requiring \na fee or some other payment requirement on vehicles that provide \nprearranged transportation service. States and localities can no longer \nrestrict limousine or sedan services if the service is registered with \nthe Department of Transportation as an interstate carrier; the company \nmeets all of the requirements of the State in which it is domiciled or \ndo business; and the limousine or sedan service is engaged in providing \npre-arranged transportation from one state to another, including round \ntrips.\n  This Congress, through the hard work of our constituents, has finally \nremedied this inequity in our interstate commerce law.\n  There were several other members who were instrumental in passing \nthis legislation. I would like to thank Congressmen Roy Blunt and Rob \nAndrews, who took the lead on H.R. 2546 in the House of Representatives \nand helped ensure its passage last year. In April of this year, with \nthe assistance of my colleagues Senator Hollings and Senator McCain, \nthe Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee passed H.R. 2546 \nunanimously. I am also most grateful to Senator Reid, Senator Bond, and \nSenator Corzine for their able assistance in passing this important \nsmall business legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11556-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          USE OF CUSTOMS FEES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there is an important provision in the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 (H.R. 5710), that, if misinterpreted, \ncould limit the ability of the U.S. Customs Service to effectively \nprotect our borders.\n  Section 413 of this bill appropriately seeks to ensure that user fees \nthat are currently used exclusively by the Customs Service for the \npurposes set out in 19 U.S.C. 58(c) will continue to be used for that \nsole purpose. These fees are paid by commercial vessels, aircraft, \nrailroads and passengers that enter the U.S. This money is used to \nensure that there will be Customs personnel available to clear these \narriving goods and passengers efficiently when they arrive.\n  I am concerned that the wording of section 413 could be misconstrued \nsince it merely states that these fees must be directed to the \ncommercial operations of the Customs Service. I want to clarify that \nthe intent of this provision is that these fees continue to be used for \nthe purposes for which they were originally intended as set out in 19 \nU.S.C. 58(c). Additionally, I have consulted with Senator Baucus and \nSenator Lieberman and they both agree with this view.\n  The work done by Customs inspectors at our ports of entry is \ncritically important to our country's security and economic health. \nMore than 1,100 Customs inspector positions, as well as overtime pay \nfor Custom's employees, are currently funded out of the fees referred \nto in section 413. It is imperative that these fees continue to be used \nas intended. This statement serves as clarification that this is the \npurpose of section 413 of the Homeland Security bill being considered \nby the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11556-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11556-S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BROWNFIELDS REVITALIZATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight an issue of \ngreat importance to the people of my State and to people across this \ncountry.\n  Over the past several years, I worked closely with a number of my \nSenate colleagues to pass the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act. Signed into law by the President last \nyear, this act is an innovative piece of legislation that will promote \nand accelerate the cleanup of hundreds of brownfield sites around the \ncountry.\n  The Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act \npassed with strong bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. \nIt will help states and local communities clean up the country's \nestimated 1,000,000 brownfield sites. These sites blight our \ncommunities, threaten public health and safety, and drain local tax \nbases.\n  I am proud of this legislation. It devotes desperately needed \nresources to address the environmental and economic challenges posed by \nbrownfields.\n  Still, I remain convinced that there is much left to do. With an \nestimated 1,000,000 brownfield sites across this nation and new sites \nbeing discovered each day, the very best efforts of our government will \nbe insufficient to tackle this growing concern in any reasonable period \nof time.\n  For that reason, I have begun exploring legislative options to \nencourage additional private capital investment in the remediation and \nredevelopment of our nation's brownfield sites. Such a solution would \ncomplement the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration \nAct and could help us make great strides toward creating jobs and \ncleaning up the environment in communities across the country.\n  Over 60 percent of the institutional capital in the United States is \nheld for investment by tax-exempt entities such as pension funds and \nuniversity endowments. Given the risks associated with acquiring and \ncleaning up contaminated sites, it is no surprise that private \ninvestors are reluctant to invest large amounts of capital in \nbrownfields cleanup and revitalization. Tax exempt entities are often \nprevented from engaging in brownfield cleanups because of the unrelated \nbusiness taxable income, UBTI, provisions in the code.\n  The UBTI provisions of the tax code play an important role in \nensuring that entities do not use their tax-exempt status to gain a \ncompetitive advantage in the marketplace over taxed entities. It is \nclear, however, that the free market is not moving to remediate and \nredevelop many of these sites, certainly not at a rate that will solve \nthis problem during our lifetimes. It is my belief that without some \nadditional stimulus, many of these sites will remain unattractive as \nbusiness investments and will continue to languish and blight our \ncommunities.\n  If we were to allow tax-exempt entities to invest in the remediation \nand redevelopment of these sites without incurring UBTI, we may be able \nto create a powerful engine to help revitalize our Nation's brownfield \nsites. It also seems possible that we could accomplish these goals in \nthis slowed economic climate with a solution that neither materially \nimpacts revenues nor\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\nrequires significant costs for administration.\n  In the coming months, it is my intent to explore legislative options \nto encourage the investment of additional private capital into the \ncleanup and redevelopment of our Nation's brownfield sites. It is my \nintention and desire to work on this matter in a bipartisan fashion \nwith my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me thank the good Senator from \nMontana and take a moment to echo his remarks. I strongly supported the \nBrownfield Revitalization Act and applaud the strides that it is making \ntoward remediating brownfield sites across our Nation.\n  In Iowa, as in many other States, we are challenged with our share of \nbrownfields in places like Des Moines, Cedar Rapids and Sioux City. The \ncleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites can help reduce health \nrisks, protect the environment, revitalize surrounding communities, \npreserve open space and create jobs by reintroducing properties into \nthe stream of commerce that have languished for years.\n  Philosophically, I support efforts to encourage private markets to \nhelp solve problems such as those presented by our Nation's brownfield \nsites. Given the size and scope of the brownfield problem in this \ncountry, I believe it behooves us to look for additional, innovative \nand low-cost solutions to help encourage investment in the remediation \nand redevelopment of these sites.\n  I understand that current law may discourage tax-exempt investors \nfrom contributing capital to the remediation and revitalization of \nbrownfield sites. Let me say to my good friend and colleague from \nMontana that I will gladly work with him to explore legislative options \nto help bring additional private capital to bear on solving our \nNation's brownfield problem.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Iowa. As we \nhave worked together as chairmen and as ranking members of the Senate \nFinance Committee, I have always found him to approach issues in a fair \nand even-handed manner. Let me express my sincere appreciation to him \nfor the many bipartisan efforts that we have worked on together, \nparticularly the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act that passed 99-0 in the Senate. I look forward to \nworking with him on this and many other issues in the months and years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11557-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHIEF JUDGE LAWRENCE BASKIR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States Court of Federal Claims \nis the only federal court where the President may appoint and dismiss \nthe chief judge. Although this power has been available since the Court \nof Federal Claims was established in 1982, President George W. Bush is \nthe first President to use this power to remove a sitting judge. That \nis a regrettable decision because of the integrity and outstanding \njudicial record of the former incumbent, Chief Judge Lawrence Baskir. \nHis absence is already being felt in the slower pace of important \nprocedural reforms that Chief Judge Baskir had launched to improve the \nfairness and efficiency of the Court of Federal Claims.\n  Former Chief Judge Baskir was appointed in July, 2000 by President \nClinton after the retirement of the previous incumbent chief judge, who \nhad been appointed by President Regan. In his short, two-year tenure, \nChief Judge Baskir had accomplished much in boosting public awareness \nof and respect for the work of this important, but little-known federal \ncourt.\n  The Court hears cases brought against the federal government by \nAmerican citizens. It is especially important that litigants can rely \non its objectivity and integrity. Some may say that because its \noriginal complement of judges was appointed by President Reagan and \nGeorge Bush, Sr., its work had more of a political cast to it. Chief \nJudge Baskir worked hard to correct that impression, and he was \nscrupulous in every way in seeking to avoid even the appearance of any \npolitical involvement.\n  Among the ways he sought to reinforce the integrity of the Court was \nto ensure that incoming cases, some of which were highly charged with \npolitics, were assigned automatically, ``off the wheel,'' and not \ndirected to any particular, pre-determined judge. Just prior to his \nremoval from the bench, the Court's new procedural rules took effect, \nrules for which he had pressed for two years. The rules, which are \ncritical for the administration of justice and are the procedures for \nlitigating cases in the Court, had not been revised in 10 years. \nBecause Court rules define the parties' rights and obligations, they \ncan give unfair advantage to one side or another. Their content is \nalways contentious, and previous efforts to revise them had collapsed \nin deadlock. Chief Judge Baskir guided the revisions through with great \nsuccess.\n  He reorganized the Clerk's Office, putting an end to delays in \ndocument handling, and instituted a ``same day'' rule for recording \ncourt filings. He brought the Court's electronic data systems into the \n21st Century and created both internal and external web pages. He \nconverted the main courtroom into a state of the art electronic \ncourtroom, where attorneys can connect their own computers to the Court \nsystem, and have access to their own records and data and exhibits.\n  He also helped modernize the Court's alternative dispute settlement \nresolution, or ADR procedures. Resolving legal disputes through ADR can \nbe a useful alternative to long litigation in certain circumstances. \nADR is an important procedural option at the Court of Federal Claims, \nwhere citizens, often with very limited resources, are suing the \nfederal government with its unlimited resources. ADR can serve in such \ninstances to help level the playing field.\n  For example, he instituted a pilot ADR process in which incoming \ncases are assigned to an ADR judge at the same time they are assigned \nto a trial judge. This program is unique in the federal system, and has \nbeen chosen by the Federal Judicial Center as a model to examine and \nanalyze for possible application in other federal courts.\n  Chief Judge Baskir made sure that ordinary citizens got fair \ntreatment when they sued the federal government. Knowing of the large \nnumber of pro se plaintiffs, or people representing themselves, going \nup against the Justice Department, including parents with heartbreaking \ncases involving young children, he revised the system of handling these \ncases, and in the process referred more than 700 pro se plaintiffs to \nattorneys participating in the Court's vaccine program. Believing in \nthe duty of members of the legal profession to contribute a portion of \ntheir time without charge for the good of the public, he also helped \nlaunch a pro bono program within the Court for both judges and legal \nclerks, and among the attorneys who are members of the Court's bar.\n  Many of these accomplishments would be impressive for a chief \njudicial administrative official whose tenure lasted a full term. This \nrecord is all the more impressive for having been achieved by a Chief \nJudge whose term lasted a mere 22 months. He achieved much because he \nbrought an extensive legal and administrative background to the \nposition, including service as Acting General Counsel of the U.S. Army, \nas staff director and chief counsel of a major U.S. Senate \nsubcommittee, and as director and chief administrative officer of a \nmajor Presidential program under President Ford.\n  I commend Chief Judge Baskir on all that he accomplished as Chief \nJudge of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. I thank him for his service \nto our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11557-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11557-S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WHY SLOVENIA SHOULD BE INVITED TO JOIN NATO\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the expansion of NATO is a forgone \nconclusion. Formal invitations are expected at the Prague Summit next \nweek for three to nine new member countries to join. In fact, NATO \nenlargement represents a logical extension of the first serious \nAmerican intervention in European geopolitics; namely, the famous \nFourteen Points of President Woodrow Wilson, which provided substantial \nassistance and encouragement to the nations of Central Europe in their \nlong-deferred aspirations to gain political independence and \ninternational recognition. History has shown that the substantial \ndisengagement of America\n\n[[Page S11558]]\n\nfrom European politics between World War I and World War II, especially \nin Central Europe, left many newly independent nations in that region \nvulnerable to Russian and German hegemony.\n  As my colleagues know, NATO was originally created to confront the \nthreat of Soviet expansion and to counterbalance the Warsaw Pact. \nAccordingly, when the cold war ended NATO's continued existence was \nquestioned because it had fulfilled its original purpose. Rather than \ndisband, however, NATO's 16 member countries, led by the United States, \nhave sought to redefine the organization to meet the needs and \nchallenges of a new era. NATO member states more recently have taken on \nnew tasks, such as intervening and bringing to an end warfare in the \nBalkans. Since the September 11 attacks, NATO has also joined the \nbattlefront in the struggle against terrorism. Through it all, NATO has \nlooked to uphold the goals and principles it was conceived to defend: \ndemocracy, security cooperation, stability, and peaceful problem-\nsolving throughout Europe and North America.\n  Critics of NATO expansion commonly cite article 5 of the NATO charter \nwhich declares an attack on any one member is an attack on all and \nobligates the signatories to assist the victim, as an unwise commitment \nwith great potential to entwine the U.S. in foreign military conflicts \nin which U.S. security and vital national interests are not at stake. I \njoined those who were concerned, in the immediate aftermath of the cold \nwar, that seeking NATO membership would require cash-strapped emerging \ndemocracies in Southern and Eastern Europe to spend too much of their \nnational budgets on increased defense spending at the expense of \nmeeting pressing shortfalls in education, health care, and other basic \nsocial needs.\n  Nevertheless, NATO enlargement is and has been the policy of our last \nthree Presidents--Republicans and Democrats alike--and seems to have \nsolid bipartisan support in the Congress. In Warsaw last year, \nPresident Bush expressed his proenlargement views saying, ``all of \nEurope's new democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that \nlie between, should have the same chance for security and freedom, and \nthe same chance to join the institutions of Europe, as Europe's old \ndemocracies.'' At the upcoming NATO Summit in Prague, this alliance \nwill once again invite more countries to join NATO, and I believe \nstrongly that the Republic of Slovenia should be at the top of the list \nfor multiple reasons.\n  First, since Slovenia declared its independence in June 1991, the \nSlovenian people have made great strides towards becoming a stable \nparliamentary democracy. The Government of Slovenia is a tolerant one, \ngranting its citizens complete religious freedom and many of the same \ncivil liberties that we enjoy. It also respects the human rights of its \ncitizens and an independent judiciary reinforces respect for the rule \nof law. An ombudsman deals with human rights problems, including \ncitizenship cases. Minorities generally are treated fairly in practice \nas well as in law.\n\n  Second, with a rich industrial history, a traditional openness to the \nworld, and sound macroeconomic policies, Slovenia is among the most \nsuccessful countries in transitioning from socialism to a market \neconomy. It boasts a stable growth in GDP, which now exceeds the \nequivalent of $16,000 in purchasing power parity relative to this small \ncountry's per gross domestic product. Slovenia also ranks among the \ncountries with the lowest degree of investor risk. The level of \nprivatization achieved and many other measures have improved the \ncompetitiveness of the Slovene economy and the profitability of \ncompanies doing business with the European Union. Among the more than \n144,000 registered companies in Slovenia, the greatest number are \nengaged in trade and commerce, followed by industry, services, real \nestate, construction, transport and communications. Following \nindependence, small business flowered and now more than 90 percent of \nSlovenia's companies are classified as small business enterprises.\n  Third, Slovenia offers the alliance a new partner to help stabilize \nand pacify the historically and currently unstable ``powder-keg'' \nregion of the Balkans as well as Western and Central Europe. NATO \noperations in the Balkans have already proven the value of temporary \nbases, land, air and sea; transhipment facilities, transit concessions, \nairspace, road, and rail links, sea transport; access to national \nstrategic intelligence, joint exercises in specific conditions, \nlinguistic and other forms of civilian-military cooperation and medical \nservices and Slovenia in NATO will help greatly in this regard. \nSlovenia also assumed many of these responsibilities already when NATO \nwent to war with Serbia. Looking ahead, Slovenia's inclusion will \nfurther strengthen NATO's southern flank by bridging current NATO \nterritory from Italy to Hungary and eventually perhaps its extension to \nRomania and Bulgaria.\n  Fourth, Slovenian and U.S. Armed Forces have been developing ever-\ncloser working ties through collaborative database and curricula \ndevelopment activities. Although this collaboration has not occurred \nunder NATO auspices, it has helped lay a solid foundation for Slovenia \nbecoming a full-fledged NATO member. For instance, after the September \n11 attacks on America, the Government of Slovenia promptly offered \nintelligence aid to the U.S. in various forms and joined the \nantiterrorist coalition with full public consensus. Shortly thereafter, \nthe National Assembly of Slovenia adopted the Declaration on the Joint \nFight against Terrorism. Since then, the U.S. has deepened our \ninvolvement with Slovenia on other fronts as well. For example, the \nU.S. this fiscal year contributed an additional $14 million to the \nSlovenian-led, International Trust for De-mining and Mine Victims \nAssistance, ITF, which has become the premier demining program in \nsouthern Europe.\n  Fifth, the Slovenian armed forces have made significant strides in \nmodernizing and reforming their operations and equipment. The \nGovernment of Slovenia recently adopted a policy to transform the \nmilitary from the present conscript army towards fully- professional \narmed forces. This fundamental change should accelerate the \nestablishment of the main reaction forces of the brigade-size needed in \norder to be totally interchangeable and compatible with NATO tactics, \nlogistics and equipment. A large part of the 10th Battalion of this \nforce is currently deployed under the NATO flag in Bosnia, Herzegovina, \nand Kosovo. Furthermore, Slovenia has invested greatly in the education \nand training of its military officers and troops, so that today there \nare about the same percentage of English-speaking troops in the \nSlovenian Army as one would find in current NATO member's armed forces. \nIn fact, many top officers, more than 200, have trained in the American \nmilitary education institutes. According to both domestic and foreign \nestimates, the Slovenian Government has allocated $320 million for \nimplementing these basic defense reforms. In 1996, the National \nAssembly of Slovenia enacted a law mandating that all military \npurchases and acquisitions be in accordance with NATO standards for \ninter-operability. In short, the Government of Slovenia has already \ndone much of what is required and remains very committed to achieving \n100 percent NATO compatibility and fielding well-trained, effective \narmed forces.\n  Parenthetically, let me also say at this point that I don't think \nrequiring 2 percent of GDP in defense spending is necessarily a good \nindicator of maximizing the contribution of so-called mini-member \nstates in NATO. Some NATO member countries actually count military \npensions toward fulfilling this requirement, but how do such military \nexpenditures actually contribute to the deterrence and effectiveness of \nNATO armed forces? To me, it would make more sense to identify \nspecialized roles for the armed forces of mini-member states to \noptimize their respective contributions to the overall increased \nstrength and versatility of NATO.\n  Finally, Slovenia's sociopolitical development already mirrors West \nEuropean standards. Not surprisingly therefore, political debate in \nSlovenia now centers on health care, environment, education, social \nwelfare, and budget discipline. Since Slovenia's population is \ndemographically old, the pensioners issue is now hotly discussed. While \nthere is political consensus about the necessity for pension reform, \nsharp differences persist about the role the\n\n[[Page S11559]]\n\nstate ought to play in the new system and whether or not the system \nshould be privatized. Their great national debate is quite akin to the \ncurrent prescription drug and Medicare debate in the U.S.\n  Clearly, Slovenia has made great strides in constructing a thriving \ndemocratic government, ready to meet the challenges and demands of the \n21st century. It is very impressive that the Slovenian people and their \nduly elected government have accomplished all this in a mere 12 years. \nThe values and principles upon which their nation has been founded are \nmany of the same values and principles that we have come to cherish in \nour own Government and to champion throughout the world. We should \nembrace our Slovenian brothers and sisters and invite them into the \nNATO fold this November.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11559-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DOUBLING ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am delighted that Congress passed \nthe National Science Foundation Doubling Act last week. I have been \nworking for quite some time to increase basic research funding at the \nNational Science Foundation. Passing this bill at such a critical time \nfor our economy is extremely important, since investing in science and \ntechnology is one of the best ways to ensure long-term growth.\n  I am particularly pleased at the inclusion of two programs I \nauthored, the Math and Science Partnership Program and the Robert Noyce \nScholarship Program, that I separately proposed in freestanding \nlegislation. Each program is an investment designed to strengthen and \nimprove math and science education at elementary and secondary schools.\n  The Math and Science Partnership Program has strong bipartisan \nsupport, and President Bush requested and received funding in last \nyear's appropriation bill to jump start this important program. The \nMath and Science Partnership program's inclusion in the reauthorization \nbill is important to provide both policy guidance and a long-term \ncommitment to the program. This legislation provides increasing funding \nfor math and science partnerships for five years, with a specific \nrecommendation of $900 million for the first 3 years.\n  These grants will be awarded to universities, businesses, and State \nagencies to coordinate activities in math and science education for \nelementary and secondary school students. For example, funding could be \ngiven to a university which is working with a local business to offer \nworkshops to kindergarten through 12th grade teachers, giving them new \nideas for teaching science and math classes. Since introducing this \ninitiative, I have visited many West Virginia classrooms, and teachers \nare excited about the potential for this program. Teachers are eager to \npartner with engineers and scientists from business and academia to \nengage students in high quality science and math programs.\n  The Robert Noyce Scholarship Program will similarly take a big step \ntoward improving math and science education in schools. By awarding \ncollege scholarships in exchange for a promise from leading college \nstudents to teach in disadvantaged elementary and secondary schools, \nthis program is intended to attract the most motivated students into \nthe teaching profession. This NSF bill provides funding for the Noyce \nprogram for 5 years, with a recommendation of $60 million for the first \n3 years.\n  Together, the Math and Science Partnership Program and the Noyce \nScholarship Program will help the country in many ways. Promoting math \nand science education for our children is the most important investment \nwe can make for the future of science and technology in the United \nStates. I truly appreciate the bipartisan support for these incentives. \nI particularly want to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of \nHouse Science Committee Chairman Sherwood Boehlert, who introduced the \ncompanion bill in the House and has been an ally for many years on \nscience and education issues.\n  In addition to bolstering elementary and secondary math and science \neducation, this bill also strives to stimulate scientific research \nthroughout the country with the Experimental Program to Stimulate \nCompetitive Research, EPSCoR. This program targets States, like West \nVirginia, that have historically had low amounts of science and \ntechnology research, and uses a State's own science and technology \nresources to promote economic development.\n  Under EPSCoR, disadvantaged states still must develop competitive \nproposals that pass peer review standards at NSF, but states do get \nassistance to become competitive and develop their research capacity. \nIt is essential to encourage many states to invest in research. For \nmany years, I have worked closely with the West Virginia EPSCoR \nprogram, and I am proud of its work. I know that this program has \nhelped to leverage research and investment in our State. It has also \nhelped to promote partnerships within our state universities and \ncolleges, which is vital.\n  With this NSF bill, EPSCoR is a declared priority for NSF. Helping \nWest Virginia and other states become competitive in first class \nresearch helps the individual States and our country as a whole.\n  Overall, the most important part of this legislation is the plan to \ndouble the NSF budget over the next 5 years, with the increases in the \nfourth and fifth year contingent on NSF meeting performance measures. \nThis increase in funding will increase the length and amount of all \nresearch grants funded through NSF, giving researchers a better \nopportunity to conduct more in-depth studies and concentrate on \ndiscovery rather than grant proposals.\n  These types of grants are essential to technological and scientific \nadvancements, which are the engines for long-term economic prosperity. \nIndeed, realizing the vital role that NSF plays in the economy's long-\nterm health, some have called for a tripling of the NSF budget. Many of \nthe discoveries currently occurring in other fields, including health \ncare, are linked to the basic research in math, computing, and science \nthat is supported by the NSF. By seeking to increase the agency's \nbudget, the Congress has helped to ensure that the United States \nremains the world's leader in science and technology research and \ndevelopment.\n  Once again, I am proud that Congress has passed this valuable, \nbipartisan legislation, and I look forward to its approval by President \nBush.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11559-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11559-S11560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM PROTECTION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, the Senate should be embarrassed at what we \nare about to do. It is amazing to me, with the country facing so many \nimportant challenges, and a slow economy to boot, that the Senate would \nconsider adjourning for the year without passing the spending bills to \nfund the Government for the next 11 months. We are putting off until \nJanuary decisions that should have been made months ago--and as a \nresult, many Government agencies at the Federal, State, and local \nlevels will not see the additional money they have been promised until \nnext spring. That is halfway through the fiscal year.\n  Let's be clear about what is happening. The Federal Government will \nspend nearly $2 trillion this year. Yet we have not passed the \nappropriations bills because the administration objects to $9 billion \nin spending. We are about to pass a continuing resolution that runs \nthrough mid-January because the President objects to $9 billion--less \nthan one-half of 1 percent of Federal spending. And his own party \nsupports much of that spending.\n  I ask my Republican friends, do they think it will be much easier \nnext year to push through significant spending cuts? Of course not. \nWhen offered the opportunity to vote no on spending bills, my \nRepublican friends generally don't. We as Democrats must begin to blow \na hole in this ridiculous myth that somehow Republicans don't like \nspending. They like spending just fine. They may claim to be for \nsmaller government and lower spending, yet Republicans in the Senate \nhave supported appropriations bills more than 85 percent of the time \nsince they first took control in 1995. More and more, the differences \nbetween the parties are not over major spending decisions, because \nalmost everyone here votes for all the spending.\n  The main difference between the parties is that Democrats want to pay \nfor the spending, while Republicans are content to borrow from our \nchildren to pay for it. Today's GOP believes in the ``free lunch'' that \nwe were all taught didn't exist. Future generations will suffer as a \nresult.\n  What does a long-term CR actually mean for the American people? To \nstart, a long-term CR would undermine the war on terror by denying \nnearly $40 billion in additional homeland security funds requested by \nthe President. It would delay billions of dollars in planned increases \nto ramp up the Coast Guard and the Customs Service, hire hundreds of \nBorder Patrol agents, bolster State and local antiterrorism programs, \nand step up other domestic security programs. The 11,000 FBI agents who \nare supposed to be combating the war on terrorism will have to wonder \nwhether they have the necessary resources to fight that war. Many of \nthe requirements of the Transportation Security Act require large \nexpenditures, such as explosive detection equipment at airports--but \nthe money won't be there. The Customs Service will have to defer the \nscheduled hiring of more than 600 agents and inspectors to serve at the \nNation's high-risk land and sea points of entry. The President's budget \npromised $3.5 billion in new money to ``first responders,'' but those \nessential funds for emergency workers have not been approved. Thousands \nof emergency grants for fire departments, communications equipment, \nemergency operations centers, you name it--these items cannot be funded \nat fiscal year 2002 levels.\n  Or take education. The National Conference of State Legislatures has \nannounced that States face a cumulative $58 billion budget deficit. \nMany States are already cutting public education funding, and many \nothers are poised to do so--making inaction by the Federal Government \nextremely costly to our kids. Passing a long-term CR will delay \nincreases in funding for critically important education programs such \nas the title I program and the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, making it difficult for school districts to plan their budgets for \nthe upcoming school year. The President's budget promised $3.5 billion \nin new money to ``first responders,'' but that money for emergency \nworkers hasn't been approved.\n  Here is what's fascinating. Not a single Republican Senator up for \nelection said they were for less education spending. They all talked \nabout education as a top priority and voiced their support for the No \nChild Left Behind Act we passed last year. But who are they kidding? \nPublic schools trying to implement the changes required by the law need \nmore funding. For the GOP to support the law that authorizes the \nspending, but then object to the spending itself, is the height of \nhypocrisy.\n  Or take veterans programs, or Federal research spending. If a long-\nterm CR is approved, it would shortchange veterans by funding Veterans \nAdministration medical care at $2.5 billion less than what is needed to \nmeet their needs. The 4-million veterans who rely on the VA for their \nhealth care will have to worry if that care will be available to them. \nAnd the Director of the National Institutes of Health has said that he \nmight have to scale back bioterrorism research grants.\n  Now, we aren't living in a vacuum here. Like many others, I would \nlike to find ways to slow the growth in Federal spending, and I have \nseveral ideas for doing so. But this year, the differences are so small \nrelative to the budget that inaction is simply unnacceptable.\n  And here is what's worse. The Republicans, who exhort us to be \nmindful of how we are spending ``the people's\n\n[[Page S11561]]\n\nmoney'' now that deficits have returned--these are the same Republicans \nwho voted for $500 billion in additional deficit-blowing tax cuts in \nthe House, and would have voted for just as much in the Senate if given \nthe chance. This President, who claims to be fiscally responsible and \nurges us to watch how we spend, sent up a budget this year with nearly \n$600 billion in new tax cuts for the well-off and increases in spending \nof 20 percent since he took office. And we are forced into a budget \nimpasse over $9 billion.\n  Let me be clear: When we increase the deficit and add to the debt to \npay for new tax cuts or new spending, it is no longer ``the people's \nmoney.'' It is our kids' money, and for that reason we should be far \nmore responsible with our fiscal policy than we have been the last 2 \nyears.\n  Congress has been abdicating its responsibilities by failing to do \nsomething about the economy before we leave. There are many good \nstimulus ideas out there--some of which are affordable, while others \ncould be paid for by scaling back tax cuts scheduled for 2004 or 2006. \nBut as things stand today, the Senate is unlikely to consider any real \nstimulus until after the State of the Union Address next year which \nmeans Congress won't act before February or March, which means that \nrelief won't be in place before next summer. That is inexcusable. The \nAmerican people shouldn't have to wait 8 months for us to act.\n  Simply put, to delay action on the budget when the difference is $9 \nbillion out of $2 trillion, and when Republicans have voted for more \nthan $500 billion in additional tax cuts, is an insult. We can do \nbetter, and we must.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11561-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OMB PROPOSED REVISIONS TO A-76 REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over the \nadministration's proposed changes to the A-76 process, and its impact \non the Federal workforce and accountability in contracting decisions. \nThe OMB draft rules issued last week raise serious questions over the \ntransparency of Federal procurement policies and their effect on \nFederal workers. True competition must be fair to Federal employees, be \ncost-effective, and promote financial transparency and public \naccountability.\n  The proposed regulations to A-76 do not represent fair competition. \nThe regulations would place Federal workers at a severe disadvantage by \nimplementing a competition process where Federal jobs may be eliminated \nat any time, even before a competition is completed. The process would \nplace greater emphasis on a contractor's past performance but would \nfail to account for the past performance of in-house employees.\n  The OMB proposal could threaten cost-effective procurement policies. \nUnder the draft rules, subjective notions of ``best value'' would \nreplace objective cost-savings in driving decisions for whether Federal \nwork would be performed in-house or by the private sector. Government \nprocurement should be based on sound analysis giving the greatest \nweight to cost savings. Decisions to contract out Federal jobs, which \nare based on projections and expectations of performance, risk \nsquandering limited public resources on contractor promises to deliver \nmore work than is needed, at a higher cost to the public.\n  We must ensure that any changes to A-76 are fair. The OMB proposal \nwould require agencies to complete competitions within a 12-month \ntimeframe. If a Federal agency was unable to finish a competition in \nthis time, OMB could simply out-source Federal jobs to a contractor \nwithout competition. Moreover, the draft regulations would support the \nadministration's arbitrary targets for contracting out Federal jobs, \nwhich I oppose because these targets artificially impose goals for \ncontracting out. The proposal would also expand the types of Federal \njobs that would be subject to public-private competitions, such as \nsupervisory positions.\n  According to OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy, the majority \nof public-private competitions under the proposed rules would be based \non the current lowest cost standard. There would be a pilot project to \ntest the ``best value'' standard on information technology jobs. \nHowever, the use of the ``best value'' standard approach is \ncontroversial and subjective. I would hope that this would be limited \nto a genuine pilot project and would allow for a careful, objective \nreview of the results.\n  There are important steps we can take now to improve financial \ntransparency and accountability in Federal contracting while \nstrengthening fairness in public-private competitions. In June of this \nyear, I was pleased to work with Senator Kennedy to improve financial \ntransparency and cost-savings in contracting policies at the Department \nof Defense. Our amendment to the DoD authorization bill failed by only \none vote. Our amendment would have required cost savings before \ndecisions were made to contract out Government functions. It would have \nimproved financial transparency by establishing measures for the true \ncost and size of the DoD contractor workforce. Our proposal would have \npromoted equity in public-private competitions by ensuring that Federal \nemployees had the opportunity to compete for existing and new DoD work \nand that DoD competed an equitable number of contractor and civilian \njobs.\n  As chairman of the Senate Government Affairs Federal Services \nSubcommittee and Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I look forward \nto ensuring that Federal contracting policies are conducted in a manner \nthat achieves the best return on the dollar and is fair to our Federal \nworkforce. It is my intention to work with my colleagues in the 108th \nCongress to pursue these goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11561-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11561-S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CREDIT CARD ARMIES--FIREARMS AND TRAINING FOR TERROR IN THE UNITED \n                                 STATES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to bring the attention of my \ncolleagues to a report released in October by the Violence Policy \nCenter, VPC, entitled Credit Card Armies--Firearms and Training for \nTerror in the United States. This report analyzes the ease with which \nmembers of terrorist organizations and criminals gain access to \npowerful firearms and ammunition. According to the VPC report, \nterrorist groups with little more than a credit card and a driver's \nlicense, can easily obtain military grade firepower, including 50 \ncaliber sniper rifles, assault weapons, and extraordinarily powerful \nammunition.\n  In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation searched the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System for information on individuals detained. \nHowever, according to a New York Times article, the Department of \nJustice ordered the FBI to stop using NICS records for investigating \nsuspected terrorists even after the FBI found that at least two \nindividuals detained in relation to the terrorist investigation had \nbeen cleared to buy firearms. Further evidence gathered by the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and reported by the New York Times \ndetermined that 34 firearms used in crimes had at some point been \npurchased by an individual on the same list of people detained after 9/\n11.\n  The VPC report provides several examples of terrorist groups, from \nal-Qaida to the Irish Republican Army, using our loopholes in our gun \nlaws to purchase 50 caliber sniper rifles and other military style \nfirearms. We need to pass the Schumer-Kennedy Use NICS in Terrorist \nInvestigations Act and also Senator Reed's ``Gun Show Background Check \nAct. These bills would assist law enforcement in identifying prohibited \ngun buyers and recognizing patterns of illegal purchases and misuse.\n  In January 2001, regulations issued by the Department of Justice \ndirected the FBI to retain NICS information for a 90-day period. This \n90-day period allows local law enforcement and the FBI to check NICS \nfor illegal gun sales to criminals, terrorists and other prohibited \nbuyers, identify purchasers using fake identification, and screen for \ngun dealers misusing the system. However, in June 2001, the Attorney \nGeneral proposed reducing the length of time that law enforcement \nagencies can retain NICS data to 24 hours. This is simply an \ninsufficient amount of time for law enforcement to review the NICS \ndatabase.\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\n  The Attorney General's action concerns me greatly. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the Use NICS in Terrorist Investigations Act introduced by \nSenators Kennedy and Schumer. This legislation would codify the 90-day \nperiod for law enforcement to retain and review NICS data. The need for \nthis legislation was highlighted late last year when the Attorney \nGeneral denied the Federal Bureau of Investigation access to the NICS \ndatabase to review for gun sales to individuals they had detained in \nresponse to the September 11th terrorist attacks and refused to take a \nposition on an amendment which would authorize that access.\n  Senator Reed's Gun Show Background Check Act, which is supported by \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, would extend the \nBrady Bill background check requirement to all sellers of firearms at \ngun shows. I cosponsored it because it is vital that we do all we can \nto prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals and \nterrorists.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider these important pieces of gun safety \nlegislation not only to protect our children from gun accidents and \ncriminal use, but also to limit easy access to dangerous weapons by \npeople who would seek to threaten our Nation's security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11562-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER JEFFERY FREEMAN\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Jeff served in four \nmaritime patrol squadrons as a Patrol Plan Tactical Coordinator, \nMission Commander, and ultimately as Officer-in-Charge, flying over \n3,500 hours in the P-3 Orion aircraft, deploying to remote locations \naround world, and flying hundreds of hours tracking Soviet and other \nforeign submarines. Jeff served as a legislative fellow in my office, \nand he has served in the Navy Appropriations Liaison Office providing \nsupport to both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.\n  His family and his fellow shipmates can be proud of his distinguished \nservice. Commander Freeman, his wife Annemarie of Biloxi, and their \nfour children, have made many sacrifices during his Naval career, and \nwe appreciate their contribution of conscientious service to our \ncountry. As he departs the Pentagon to start his second career, I call \nupon my colleagues to wish Jeff and his family every success, and the \ntraditional Navy ``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11562-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VETERANS' BENEFITS ACT OF 2002, S. 2237\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Senate's \naction last night when it passed S. 2237, the Veterans' Benefits Act of \n2002. This important legislation will make much-needed improvements to \nveterans' disability compensation payments, Medal of Honor pensions, \nhousing benefits, claims adjudications, and education benefits through \nincreased funding for State Approving Agencies. I strongly urge the \nPresident to sign this bill into law as quickly as possible.\n  I am pleased this bill also includes an important provision that will \nexpand the civil protections provided to members of the National Guard \nunder the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. I worked \nclosely on this provision with its sponsor, Senator Paul Wellstone. My \nlate friend and colleague from the State of Minnesota was an outspoken \nadvocate on behalf of America's veterans throughout his service in the \nSenate. The Wellstone-Dayton provision in this bill will better protect \nmembers of the National Guard in Minnesota and around the country. The \nprovision specifies that National Guard members mobilized for more than \n30 days by a state at the request of the Federal Government to respond \nto a national emergency be allowed protections under the Soldiers' and \nSailors' Civil Relief Act during their duty.\n  The Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act allows America's military \npersonnel to have their legal rights secured until they can return from \nthe military to defend themselves. It covers such issues as rental \nagreements, security deposits, prepaid rent, evictions, installment \ncontracts, credit card interest rates, mortgage interest rates, \nmortgage foreclosures, civil judicial proceedings, and income tax \npayments. One of the most widely known benefits under the act, for \nexample, is the ability to reduce consumer debt and mortgage interest \nrates to six percent under certain circumstances. The original \nSoldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act was actually passed during \nWorld War I. The statute was reenacted during World War II, then later \nmodified during Operation Desert Storm. However, until now the Act's \ncoverage has not included the National Guard as comprehensively as \ntheir active duty and reservist counterparts. I believe this is wrong.\n  Following the terrorist attacks against the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001, members of the Minnesota National Guard were \nactivated by our State at the request of the President to provide \nsecurity at several major airports. As the duration of these \nactivations grew to several months, I began to hear from these brave \nmen and women about the stress and financial burdens that accompanied \ntheir service. Senator Wellstone and I were shocked to learn that, \nalthough the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act exists to ease \nmany of these same burdens for active-duty service members and \nreservists, members of the National Guard were not similarly covered \nfor these types of activations, because this service was deemed to be \nState, rather than Federal, service. This discovery led to the \nWellstone-Dayton provision.\n  Anyone who visited our Nation's airports after September 11 will not \nsoon forget the contributions of countless members of the National \nGuard who, at the request of the President, contributed to a sense of \ngreater security and peace of mind for air travelers by providing \nairport security. The men and women who provided these security efforts \ndid so with courage and selflessness.\n  In light of September 11, it seems apparent that the National Guard \nhas, and ought to have, a clear role in protecting Americans from \noutside threats. Further, when the President requests the men and women \nof the National Guard take on these new missions which help to protect \nAmericans from terrorism, their civil interests should be protected \nunder the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act. Accordingly, I am \nhappy that this will be properly ensured with the Senate's passage of \nS. 2237 last night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11562-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11562-S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION SHARING\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, for several years, I have been actively \nworking to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure and promote \ninformation sharing between the government and the private sector. From \nmy experience with Y2K, I recognized that our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure was vulnerable and that the private sector and the \ngovernment needed to cooperate. Last year I introduced S. 1456, the \nCritical Infrastructure Information Security Act of 2001, which sought \nto bolster critical infrastructure security by fostering and \nencouraging critical infrastructure information sharing. Both the \nSenate Government Affairs Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural \nResource Committee held hearings on this issue. Once legislation \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security was introduced in the \nSenate, I worked to ensure that some of the protections found in S. \n1456, specifically protection from public disclosure pursuant to the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), were addressed and considered in the \nproposed legislation.\n  The need for congressional attention on this issue stems from the \ngrowth of new technology and the increased reliance on computer \nnetworks created new vulnerabilities. For the past two decades, once \nphysically distinct operations, controls and procedures have been \ntightly integrated with information technology. Pipelines can be \ncontrolled remotely. A vulnerability in a telecommunication systems can \nimpact the functioning of the Department of Defense and the financial \nservices\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\nsector. Sectors are more interconnected and more interdependent.\n  Eighty-five percent of the United States' critical infrastructures, \nthe essential services that if disrupted or destroyed would impact our \neconomic or national security such as financial services, \ntelecommunications, transportation, energy, and emergency services, are \nstill owned and operated by the private sector. Osama bin Laden has \ncalled on his supporters to attack the pillars of the U.S. economy the \nprivate sector.\n  If the private sector and the Federal Government are increasingly \ninterconnected and are targets for those who wish us ill, it makes \nsense for both targets to share information with each other. We have to \nthink differently about national security, as well as who is \nresponsible for it. In the past, the defense of the Nation was about \ngeography and an effective military command-and-control structure. Now \nprevention and protection must shift to partnerships that span private \nand government interests.\n  Yet the private sector has no access to government information about \npossible threats, much of which is often classified. The Federal \nGovernment, with its unique information and analytical capabilities, \nlacks specific information from the private sector on attacks. Both \nparties have a blind spot and only see parts of the problem. Government \nand industry would benefit from cooperating in response to threats, \nvulnerabilities, and actual attacks by sharing information and \nanalysis. If the Department of Homeland Security is tasked to match \nthreats with vulnerabilities, the private sector must be a willing \npartner.\n  Although the Senate bipartisan FOIA agreement that I negotiated is \nnot included in the current homeland security bill, I am pleased that \nthe final version includes a number of provisions that will foster \ncritical infrastructure information sharing. As the government and the \nprivate sector cooperate and begin to exchange information, we will be \nin a better position to prevent, respond to and recover from future \nattacks to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11563-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF MICHAEL McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my concerns regarding \nthe confirmation of Michael W. McConnell to serve on the United States \n10th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Of President George W. Bush's judicial nominees, Michael W. McConnell \nis the most hard-line, impassioned, and consistent public foe of a \nwoman's right to choose yet to come before the Senate. His legal views \nand philosophy are far outside the American mainstream.\n  This nomination passed out of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, \nand came before the full Senate on November 15. Given the lack of time \nto review Professor McConnell's record, an absence of recorded votes in \nopposition to this nominee should not be taken as a vote of confidence \nfrom all Senators.\n  McConnell is a long-time anti-choice scholar and activist whose views \non the constitutional right to privacy leave little doubt about how he \nwould rule in cases involving the right to choose. He believes that Roe \nv. Wade was wrongly decided and that significant restrictions on \nabortion are appropriate, even while Roe stands. He has joined \nconservative political activists in calling for a constitutional \namendment to ban all abortions, possibly even in cases of rape and \nincest.\n  This issue of abortion is one in which thoughtful people of good \nconscience may disagree. However, it is my belief that Michael \nMcConnell's core personal beliefs on the immorality of abortion and the \nmoral status of the embryo, articulated repeatedly in numerous forums \nincluding law reviews, op-eds, and legal [or court] briefs, will make \nit difficult if not impossible for him to consider impartially the \ncases that would come before him as a judge.\n  McConnell's view of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act \nalso illustrates his inability to be impartial. Not only has he \ncontended that the law is unconstitutional, but his view of the FACE \nAct is so colored by his opposition to the right to choose that he has \nexpressed his admiration for a judge who blatantly ignored the law in \nacquitting defendants who broke the law.\n  Anti-choice legislatures have demonstrated great creativity in \ncreating innovative barriers to a woman's right to choose. The \nconstitutionality of these new barriers is frequently determined by the \ncircuit courts, and is rarely reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n  It is my hope that the administration will begin to reach across the \naisle to identify moderate, consensus nominees. The alternative will be \nan ongoing crisis in the judiciary. It is also my hope that Professor \nMcConnell is not a harbinger of what is to come when Supreme Court \nvacancies occur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11563-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              CONGRATULATIONS TO BOB AND MARY JEAN FREESE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS.

During that \nhalf century, their loving relationship has not only helped them raise \nfive children, but has served them well in raising two additional \ngenerations, with seven grandchildren and one great-grand child.\n  Bob and Mary Jean were united at Salem Lutheran Church in Spokane, \nWashington on December 6, 1952. Throughout their lives together they \nhave demonstrated a commitment to public service, and instilled a \nsimilar public service ethic in their families.\n  Bob is the son of a Marine Corps Officer and served honorably in the \nUnited States Air Force for ten years, and later was a plant engineer \nwith Continental Baking Company. Mary Jean was a long time employee in \nthe Spokane County Auditor's office.\n  While Bob and Mary Jean reside in Spokane, Washington, their \ndaughter-in-law Maria Freese has provided dedicated service to the \npeople of Montana, first as a member of my Senate staff and later as \nTax Counsel with the Senate Finance Committee. Their son Terry recently \nretired from 25 years of service with Congressman Norm Dicks and as a \nPresidential appointee at the Department of Energy, their daughter \nRobin works with the state of Washington, their son Russell served with \nthe U.S. Air Force, their daughter Peggy has worked with Spokane \nCommunity College.

Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the \ndistinguished career of Riverside County Supervisor Tom Mullen, who \nwill retire on December 13, 2002. Supervisor Mullen's passion for good \ngovernment and good planning has set a standard for his county and for \nCalifornia.\n  Before his tenure as Supervisor, Tom Mullen worked in the field of \nlaw enforcement, serving 11 years with the Riverside Police Department \nand the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. He also served as an \naide to former California State Senator Robert Presley, Director of \nIntergovernmental Affairs for the Riverside County Transportation \nCommission, and Director for External Program Development for the \nUniversity of California, Riverside's College of Engineering and Center \nfor Environmental Research and Technology.\n  As Supervisor of Riverside County's Fifth District, Mullen helped \ndevelop programs for young people, improve education, improve \ninfrastructure, reduce traffic congestion and make the streets safer by \nadding more police officers to the beat. In recent years, his focus has \nbeen on creating as transportation, habitat and housing blueprint for \nRiverside County, a plan that will guide the rapid development expected \nto occur in the coming years. Because of his diligent work and vision, \nRiverside County's plan has won state and\n\n[[Page S11564]]\n\nnational praise and will give the County a firm guide for the future.\n  During his career in public service, Supervisor Mullen has served \nwith many different organizations and received many awards for his \nleadership and vision. He served as Chairman of the Board of \nSupervisors, the Riverside County Transportation Commission, the March \nJoint Powers Authority (MJPA) and currently serves as Co-Chairman of \nthe County Child Protective Services Committee. Among Mullen's \naccolades, he received the Riverside Community College Alumnus of the \nYear Award in 2000, the Management Leader of the Year Award from UCR's \nA. Gary Anderson School of Management in 1998 and the good Government \nAward from the Riverside County Chapter of the Building Industry \nAssociation in 1997.\n  It is clear that Supervisor Mullen has made a tremendous impact on \nthe County and on the lives of the people of Riverside. With good \neconomic sense and organization, Tom Mullen has been able to lead one \nof the nation's fastest growing areas. I commend him and extend my best \nwishes to the Supervisor, his wife, Kathy Tappan, and his family on \nthis occasion and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11564-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION \n                                 PLANT\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, on October 24, 2002, the Paducah \nGaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, KY commemorated and celebrated its \n50th anniversary. In 1952, the Paducah Plant began the process of \nenriching uranium to help build and maintain our national security \nagainst our adversaries throughout the Cold War era, and to this day \nthe 1,500 workers there continue their work to help ensure a safer \nworld by dismantling nuclear agents from Russia's stockpile of weapons \nfrom its gladly-gone-days as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\n  Throughout these past 50 years, the Federal Government did not always \nshoot straight with the Paducah Plant workers. Much of the time the \nworkers were exposed to harsh and deadly chemical and industrial \nagents. Many became sick and many died while the Federal Government \nlooked the other way. But throughout these times these workers forged \nahead, and they continue to do so today. Now knowing the dangers of \nthen and even the risks that go along with their jobs today, these \ndedicated workers still roll up their sleeves and get the job done, \nwithout complaint and with no questions asked. They are selfless and \nhumble. The history of the Paducah Plant and its workers, and what they \nhave and continue to do to ensure a more peaceful world, has and will \ncontinue to be an inspiration to us all.\n  The Paducah Plant is tucked away in God's country in southwest \nKentucky between the Ohio River and rolling prairies and farmland. The \nPaducah community and those in the surrounding area have been bedrock \nin their support of this plant and its workers, and they are owed a \ngreat deal of gratitude as well on this 50th anniversary. They have \nalways been there with support and prayer for these plant workers and \ntheir family members during the toughest and roughest of times.\n  While the Federal Government and others turned away and failed to \nlive up to their responsibilities to the Paducah Plant workers--\nneighbors, friends and family members were always there to comfort them \nand each other. This is a spirit which humbles us all. May God bless \nall those associated with this plant and its mission. We owe all of \nthem more than we will ever realize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11564-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MR. STEPHEN ROGERS\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart and great \nsadness that I bring news of the death of Stephen Rogers, a former \npublisher and long time President of the Syracuse Post-Standard. Mr. \nRogers was a Central New York institution, a man who actively played a \nrole in the newspaper's operation up until the day he died at ninety \nyears old.\n  Although not originally from Central New York, he became one of the \narea's most influential figures, both because of his pen and community \nactivism. Rogers was famous among local politicians for never shying \naway from asking tough questions, prompting a close friend to call him \nSocrates with a press card. Everyone from the Governor on down knew \nthat an editorial board meeting at the Post-Standard was no walk in the \npark, as Rogers would force all who came to Syracuse to vigorously \ndefend their policy choices. It is testament to Rogers' character and \nto how much he respected his craft, however, that no one ever doubted \nthat the meetings would be enlightening and evenhanded. Indeed, \njournalism was part of the very marrow of Rogers' bones and a beloved \nprofession: he once wryly told a group of college students, ``Believe \nme, it's more fun that working for a living.''\n  Rogers' love of fishing was perhaps the only activity that could \nmatch his commitment to his trade. New York State's beautiful lakes \nquickly helped bond him to the area when he first arrived in 1955, and \nhe showed his love for the area by giving back to the community in so \nmany ways. As Chairman of the Metropolitan Development Association, he \nwas a staunch advocate and promoter of economic development in Central \nNew York. Although he was criticized by some for overstepping the \nlimits of objectivity required by his day job, Rogers felt that he \ncould not in good conscience earn a living in community without giving \nback. It's not surprising that he could also count his leadership of \nthe state publishers' association, the water board, and the United Way, \nas well as time spent on the boards of the YMCA, the former Crouse-\nIrving Memorial Hospital, Le Moyne College, the Red Cross and the \nsymphony as other significant volunteer accomplishments.\n  If there is one thing to say about Stephen Rogers, it is that he was \nthe epitome of good citizenship. His dedication to his craft, community \nactivism, and unceasing work ethic meant that he stood out as a leader \nin Central New York up until his final days. He will be sorely missed \nby us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11564-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CENTURY CONSTRUCTION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCentury Construction in Erlanger, KY. Last Friday, Sandy Taylor, \nAssistant Administrator for the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration's, OSHA, 5th region in Chicago, presented Mike Mangeot, \nPresident and CEO of Century Construction, with a Voluntary Protection \nProgram, VPP, award for Century's exemplary record of safety in the \nworkplace.\n  OSHAs Voluntary Protection Programs are designed to recognize and \npromote effective safety and health management. In the programs, \nmanagement, labor and OSHA work together to establish a cooperative \nrelationship aimed at improving safety standards in the workplace. VPP \nparticipants are a select group of facilities, which have designed and \nimplemented outstanding health and safety programs. Kevin Still, \nCentury's Vice President for Administration and Safety Director in \ncharge of Century's safety programs, deserves special recognition for \nthe part he has played in creating a safe working environment for \nCentury's employees. Kevin has been an integral part of Century's \nsuccess.\n  There are over 6 million work places in the United States. Of these, \nonly 900 have received VPP awards. Out of the nearly 750,000 \nconstruction contractors in this country, only three have won a VPP \naward for safety. Century is the first ever mobile site participant to \nwin this award. By working with employees from both top-to-bottom and \nbottom-to-top, Century has demonstrated how far communication and \nteamwork can take an organization.\n  The men and women of Century Construction deserve our admiration and \nrespect for their hard work and determination. I am proud to know that \nsuch companies are operating within Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11564-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11564-S11565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING PUBLIC SERVICE OF ANN JORGENSEN\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto recognize and express appreciation for the contributions to public \nservice made by Ann Jorgensen, who is finishing her term as board \nmember to the Farm Credit Administration.\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\n  A production agriculture and hog farmer from my home State of Iowa, \nMs. Jorgensen moved to Washington in 1997 to serve on the \nPresidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed, three-member board of the \nFarm Credit Administration, FCA. FCA is an independent U.S. Government \nagency responsible for regulating and examining the entities of the \nFarm Credit System. The Farm Credit System is a nationwide financial \ncooperative that lends to agriculture and rural America.\n  Members of the FCA board also serve as Directors for the Farm Credit \nSystem Insurance Corporation, FCSIC, to which Ms. Jorgensen was elected \nas the first woman chair in January 2000. FCSIC is an independent U.S. \nGovernment corporation responsible for ensuring the timely payment of \nprincipal and interest on insured notes, bonds, debentures, and other \nobligations issued on behalf of Farm Credit System banks. Ms. \nJorgensen's leadership was instrumental in keeping the insurance fund \nat or near the statutory 2 percent capitalization level.\n  During Ms. Jorgensen's 5-year tenure at the Farm Credit \nAdministration, many changes took place in the Farm Credit System \ninfluenced by the FCA board. Through the board approval of \nrestructuring applications, the number of Farm Credit System \nassociations consolidated from 250 to 103, thus creating greater \nefficiencies, better customer service, and cost savings to \nassociations. The board also amended participation regulations allowing \nfor the purchase of a 100-percent interest in participations and \neliminating the territorial consent requirement. With these and other \nchanges, the Farm Credit System today is well capitalized and \nprofitable with a high asset quality.\n  Prior to her appointment to the FCA board, she served on a number of \ngoverning boards for the State of Iowa, including 6 years as a member \nof the Board of Regents. The Board of Regents is responsible for the \nState's three universities, including the University of Iowa Hospital, \na world-renowned teaching hospital, and its affiliated clinics. She \nalso served on the board of the Iowa Department of Economic Development \nand chaired the Iowa Rural Development Council. Among many other boards \nand committees, she has also served on the Agriculture Product Advisory \nBoard, the Interstate Agricultural Grain Marketing Commission, the \nNational Pork Producers Council Environmental Committee, the European \nTrade Task Force Legislative Study Committee; the Iowa Public \nBroadcasting Network Board of Directors and Foundation Board.\n  She was named to the Farm Foundation's Bennett Agricultural Round \nTable in June 2000. This provides a forum for discussion and dialogue \namong agricultural, agribusiness, government, academic, and interest \ngroup leaders on issues of importance to agriculture and rural America. \nAlpha Zeta, the national honorary agricultural fraternity, named her to \nits Centennial Honor Roll in 1997. She has also been inducted into the \nIowa Volunteer Hall of Fame, and along with her husband, has previously \nbeen recognized by Farm Futures magazine as owner of one of the Top 10 \nBest Managed Farms.\n  I thank her for her numerous contributions to our farmers as well as \nrural America, and I extend my very best wishes for her continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11565-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO LT.

Thomas Stapleton's \nfellowship officially ends upon the adjournment of this session and \nbefore he leaves, I wish to extend my most sincere thanks and \nappreciation for his exemplary service to myself, the citizens of \nMissouri and our great nation.\n  Lt. Col. Stapleton is a seasoned military leader with over 17 years \nof tactical, budget and acquisition experience that have been a \ntremendous contribution to my office. Lt. Colonel Stapleton served his \nnation in Operation Just Cause and Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm \nfrom 1989-1991. He is a Distinguished Military Graduate from Canisius \nCollege, Buffalo, New York, holds a Master of Business Administration \nfrom Rochester Institute of Technology and attended Georgetown \nUniversity's Government Affairs Institute.\n  Throughout his career, Lt. Colonel Stapleton's level of commitment \nand service have been evident in his various decorations and awards \nincluding the Bronze Star which he was awarded for exceptional service \nin Operation Desert Storm. Lt. Colonel Stapleton has proven his \nabilities and has consistently performed above and beyond the call of \nduty.\n  During his tour as a military fellow, Tom fulfilled crucial functions \nand carried out critical assignments within my office. His budgetary \nexperience as an Army comptroller served him well in resolving numerous \ndefense appropriations issues. His tactical experience was an \ninvaluable resource as evidenced by the many dependable information \nbriefs I received after the devastating attacks of 9-11. These \nattributes further served Tom as he traveled the roads of Missouri on \nmy behalf meeting with veterans, military service-members and \nconstituents at various installations, veteran's facilities and town \nhall meetings. In addition, I relied heavily on Lt. Colonel Stapleton's \nstrong volley and solid serve in crushing two of my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Warner, on the tennis court.\n  Lt. Colonel Stapleton is not just a soldier but a devoted husband and \ncommitted father of three children. Whether he was coaching soccer with \nhis son, enjoying family vacations or throwing a birthday party for his \nchildren, Tom consistently made time for his family throughout his very \ndemanding tour as a fellow. Anyone familiar with Lt. Colonel \nStapleton's numerous achievements, awards and much deserved \ncommendations knows that Tom's top priority is to be a dedicated family \nman. Tom embodies the values that we as Americans all hold dear. His \ncommitment to family and country set the standard for a professional \nsoldier and solid role model.\n  The Military Congressional Fellows programs affords members of \nCongress with a critical military perspective coupled with invaluable \nservice and professionalism. The tremendous reputation and success of \nthis program are a direct reflection of Fellows like Lt. Colonel \nStapleton. Tom has distinguished himself as a member of my staff and my \ndefense team. On behalf of the citizens of Missouri and a grateful \nNation, we wish Lt. Col. Thomas Stapleton, his wife Anne, and three \nchildren Toni, Carly and Jack the best as he continues his \ndistinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11565-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11565-S11566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NANCY KRAFT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nto join me in paying tribute to a dedicated member of the Montana \nDepartment of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, FWP, as she concludes 32 years \nof service to her State and Nation. We are proud that this native \nMontanan spent her entire working life dedicated to serving Montana's \nState's citizens and visitors.\n  Mrs. Nancy Kraft deserves this honor. We owe her our gratitude for \nher contributions to the conservation of Montana's wildlife and natural \nresources, as well as her efforts to preserve the outdoor heritage that \nmakes the Treasure State's way of life unique.\n  Nancy's personal and professional career accomplishments truly \nreflect the character of life under the big sky. Her loyal service over \nthree decades--spent in our capital city of Helena--are a testament to \nall those who value wildlife and open spaces. I would like to take a \nmoment to reflect upon Nancy's career as she embarks on a new phase of \nlife beyond government service.\n  Born in Helena, Nancy attended primary school locally and began work \nat the then Department of Fish and Game in 1970 as a temporary employee \nin the General Licensing section handling delinquent accounts. Skilled \nin pursuing overdue collections she soon designed a system that over \nthe years returned more than $300,000 to the people of Montana.\n  Nancy progressed through several positions of increasing \nresponsibility, while continuing to make sure licensing operations were \nclosely related to\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\nthe needs and interests of Montana's recreating public. In 1985 she was \nselected as the FWP General License Section Supervisor. Her capable \nleadership led to substantive changes in regulations and license fees \nduring the time that outdoor recreation became a major economic \ninfluence in Montana.\n  Because of her in-depth knowledge and ability to bring diverse \ninterests together, Nancy was assigned to a team of FWP experts charged \nwith the task of designing a system to automate the licensing \nprocesses. Recognizing that the transition to computers from a paper \nprocess was a major undertaking, she worked tirelessly to ensure the \nmyriad regulations, drawing systems, fee schedules, and calendar \nrequirements were accurately reflected in the system design.\n  In her final assignment Nancy was selected to be the Licensing Bureau \nChief with responsibility for the collection of fees exceeding $30 \nmillion annually. Shortly after FWP celebrated its 100th anniversary, \nNancy and her team embarked on one of the biggest challenges in state \ngovernment--providing ongoing services with no down time while changing \nsystems affecting over 400,000 customers.\n  Over the past 2 years Nancy helped lead the transition to the new \nAutomated Licensing System. Within eight months of implementation, the \nsystem processed over one million license sales with error rates below \n1 percent, and produced a steady increase in customer satisfaction. \nThis shining example of perseverance and poise under pressure is a \nreflection of the quiet competence that Nancy Kraft brings to her \nworkplace every day for the people of Montana.\n  Nancy's contributions to the State's highly complex and important \nlicensing functions cannot be overstated. Her staff's accurate \nforecasting and collection of millions of dollars each year allow FWP \nto perform its primary mission while preparing for future uses of \nMontana's special natural resources. Such achievements are a clear \ntestament to how she has, for more than 30 years, enhanced the fishing, \nhunting, and parks experience held in such high esteem by the people of \nMontana and our many visitors.\n  As a well known and highly regarded member of the Helena community, \nNancy's ability and knowledge, her willingness to find solutions, and \nher congenial way of dealing with people from all walks of life will be \nmost difficult to replace.\n  It is a great honor for me to present the credentials of Nancy Kraft \nto the Senate today. All of her actions reflect a devoted public \nservant with a sense of purpose.\n  As Nancy departs from public service I ask my colleagues to join with \nme in delivering this tribute to Nancy for her outstanding career and \nservice to the State of Montana and the Nation, and our best wishes for \na productive and rewarding retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11566-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11566-S11567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING PROFESSORS MR. JAMES ADAMS AND DR. DENNIS C. \n                                 JACOBS\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate fellow \nHoosiers Mr. James Adams and Dr. Dennis C. Jacobs on their recent \nselection as Professors of the Year. It is a major accomplishment as \nonly four awards are given out nationally, one for each classification \nof institution. Mr. Adams was recognized as Outstanding Baccalaureate \nCollege Professor of the Year and Dr. Jacobs was recognized as \nOutstanding Research and Doctoral University Professor of the Year.\n  I am particularly proud, Mr. President, because Mr. Adams and Dr. \nJacobs are two of four national Professors of the Year, and my home \nstate of Indiana is the home for both. Both Mr. Adams and Dr. Jacobs \nrepresent the very best in higher education and Hoosier values.\n  Mr. James Adams is a professor of art at Manchester College in North \nManchester, Indiana. During 42 years at Manchester, Mr. Adams has \ntaught in the Art, English, Music, and Spanish departments, driven by \nhis interest in new technologies, integrating service with learning, \nand interdisciplinary approaches to subjects. He has truly set an \nexample to the rest of the teaching community.\n  In addition, Mr. Adams has been an exchange professor to Germany and \nSpain, and was instrumental in creating study-abroad programs on his \ncampus. His international interest has also led him to supervise an \nIndiana University summer program in England, serve as faculty-in-\nresidence for DePauw University in Spain, and he has conducted at least \n20 student tours to Mayan sites.\n  Mr. James Adams' hobbies have also brought him success. He is a \npracticing painter and photographer who has exhibited throughout the \nUnited States and in England, Mexico, and Spain. A contributor to his \ncommunity, Mr. Adams is a frequent lecturer at the Fort Wayne Museum of \nArt, and he also does pro bono work with the local Department of Motor \nVehicles office, serving as a translator for Latino residents new to \nthe area.\n  Mr. Adams earned undergraduate degrees at George Washington \nUniversity and the Concoran School of Art, with a double major in Art \nand Modern Languages. He holds a Master of Fine Arts at the Instituo \nAllende, which is affiliated with the University of Guanajuato, Mexico, \nand he spent three years at the Ruskin School of Art at Oxford \nUniversity.\n  Dr. Dennis C. Jacobs is a professor of chemistry at the University of \nNotre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. At Notre Dame, he has won several \nteaching awards and the Presidential Award for dedicated service to the \nUniversity. His contribution to the learning community is evident.\n  In 1999, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching \nnamed him a Carnegie Scholar largely for completely redesigning an \nimportant introductory chemistry class. The redesign led to greater \nstudent success and engagement, and the course is considered a \nleading example of the trend toward peer-led curricula. This is a \nremarkable accomplishment.\n\n  Dr. Jacobs has also combined chemistry and service learning, creating \na course in which students and community partners evaluate lead \ncontamination in area homes. He is also a Fellow with the Center for \nSocial Concerns, focusing on other methods of integrating community \nservice into the curriculum.\n  His work has earned him great respect in his community. One of his \ncolleagues has described him as ``the kind of teacher who never stops \ngrowing, thinking, and changing.''\n  Dennis Jacobs earned undergraduate degrees at the University of \nCalifornia at Irvine in physics and chemistry and a Ph.D. in physical \nchemistry at Stanford University.\n\n\n                            national winners\n\n  Outstanding Baccalaureate Colleges: James Adams, Professor, Art, \nManchester College, North Manchester, IN\n  Outstanding Community Colleges: Alicia Juarrero, Professor, \nPhilosophy, Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD\n  Outstanding Doctor and Research Universities: Dennis Jacobs, \nProfessor, Chemistry, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN\n  Outstanding Master's Universities and Colleges: Francisco Jimenez, \nDirector of Ethnic Studies Program and Fay Boyle, Professor in the \ndepartment of Modern Languages and Literatures, Santa Clara University, \nSanta Clara, CA\n\n\n                             state winners\n\n  Alabama: Natalie Davis, Professor, Political Science, Birmingham-\nSouthern College\n  Alaska: Steven Johnson, Assistant Professor and Director of Debate, \nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage\n  Arizona: Christopher Impey, Professor, Astronomy, University of \nArizona\n  Arkansas: Gay Stewart, Associate Professor, Physics, University of \nArkansas\n  California: Cecilia Conrad, Associate Professor, Economics, Pamona \nCollege\n  Colorado: Aaron Byerley, Professor, Aeronautical Engineering, United \nStates Air Forces Academy\n  Connecticut: Bruce Saulnier, Associate Professor, Computer \nInformation Systems\n  District of Columbia: James A.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Erv Neff, a longtime \nfriend and current President of the Minnesota State Retiree Council, \nAFL-CIO. On December 4, Erv will step down as the President of the \nRetiree Council after six years of dedicated service. Under Erv's \nleadership, the Minnesota State Retiree Council, AFL-CIO, has grown \nfrom 19 affiliated organizations in 1996 to 115 affiliated \norganizations today. Erv established the goal to expand the membership \nand the mission of the Retiree Council, and he succeeded admirably.\n  Erv has a lifetime of distinguished accomplishments. They include his \nstewardship of the Twin Cities Musicians Union and his service as an \ninvaluable advisor to dozens of prominent public officials. His legacy \nwill be enhanced by his post-retirement activities. Many people view \nretirement as an opportunity to relax after a lifetime of hard work and \npersonal and professional accomplishments. Not Erv Neff. Erv recognized \nthe potential positive contributions Minnesota retirees could make \ntoward improving the quality of life in our state. He joined the AFL-\nCIO Retiree Council and was quickly elected to leadership positions \nwithin the organization. Since his election as President of the Council \nin 1996, Erv has demonstrated that the Council could play an active \nrole in promoting legislative initiatives that would benefit senior \ncitizens and working men and women. He led the Council's efforts to \npass improved prescription drug benefits for senior citizens at the \nstate and national levels. He arranged for prominent speakers to appear \nat monthly Council meetings to educate members on a wide variety of \nissues. By demonstrating the ability of the Council to play an \neffective role in improving the lives of senior citizens, Erv was able \nto build the Council into one of the most vigorous advocacy \norganizations in Minnesota.\n  I hope that Erv will look back with deserved pride on his service to \nworking men and women and senior citizens. He has accomplished much \nthroughout his life, and thousands of Minnesotans owe him their \ngratitude.\n  I wish Erv and his wife, Betsy, the very best this life has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11567-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11567-S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       POLITICAL REFORM IN EGYPT\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to address an \nimportant area for American foreign policy: much needed political \nreform in Egypt.\n  In the past, Egypt has proven to be a helpful ally. Egypt showed \ncourage in becoming the first Arab nation to sign a peace treaty with \nIsrael after the Camp David talks in 1978. Egypt fought with the broad \ninternational coalition we led as part of the Gulf War in 1990-91. And \nI believe that at times Egypt has helped to provide a moderate and \nthoughtful voice to discussions with more radical Arab states about \nMiddle East and international issues. In fact, Egypt was banned from \nthe Arab League for a number of years for some of its stands, and \nPresident Sadat was assassinated for his role in the Camp David talks.\n  However, I am very concerned about political repression in Egypt and \nthe effect that this could have on the direction that nation takes in \nthe future and on the larger issue of Middle East peace.\n  We have seen in recent years how political and economic repression in \nmany Arab states have fueled the fires of Islamic radicalism. Arab \ncommunities that have little or no hope of economic progress, and where \nviews are stifled by autocratic authorities, have proven to be fertile \nground for radicals like Osama bin Laden and others who play to their \nfears, and use their anger and frustration as weapons. We know that \nradical Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism thrive in nations \nstruggling with oppression and poverty. I think there is a clear link \nbetween the motives we have seen of those individuals involved in the \nSeptember 11 attacks, the bombing of the Khobar towers and other \nterrorist acts with the repressive environments in their home nations.\n  Now I am afraid that the lack of political and legal reform in Egypt \nhas become a growing problem, and this could further add to other \nmounting obstacles we now see in the Arab world. Consequently, the \nEgyptian government needs to seriously address democratic and \ninstitutional reform and it needs to do so quickly.\n  Since holding out an olive branch to Israel at Camp David, Egypt has \nreceived a great deal of American economic and military assistance. \nWhile many roads and infrastructure projects have been built over the \nyears, now is the time to press Egypt to embrace and enact political \nreforms. This will have a positive impact on both Egyptian civil \nsociety and the economy.\n  For instance, as a Washington Post editorial recently pointed, Egypt \nneeds to develop a responsible media that objectively reports news and \ninformation instead of government-backed anti-American and anti-Semitic \npropaganda that does nothing but fuel tensions throughout the region.\n  Also, Egypt needs to do a better job of strengthening the rule of \nlaw. This is fundamental not only to the development of a market \neconomy, but to more robust social expression. I believe\n\n[[Page S11568]]\n\nit would be in Egypt's best interest to immediately release Saad Eddin \nIbrahim, a dual American-Egyptian citizen who is in prison for the \n``crime'' of advocating political reforms.\n  So far we have not debated in the Senate on the Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill for the 2003 fiscal year. And it now looks like we \nmay not even have the opportunity to address it at all before the end \nof this Congress.\n  But, let me serve notice to my colleagues that when the Senate takes \nup the Foreign Operations bill next year that I plan to bring up the \nissue of political reform in Egypt and ask that we take a closer look \nat U.S. aid to that nation.\n  In fact, I have already drafted an amendment that would modify \ncurrent law to expand the understanding that in providing assistance, \nthe United States expects both economic and political reform be \nundertaken in Egypt.\n  I very much look forward to this debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11568-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RETIREMENT OF CECIL WILLIAMS--AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF ARKANSAS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the long \nand great career of Cecil Williams, who spent a life's work fighting on \nbehalf of farmers and the farming way of life in my home State of \nArkansas.\n  Cecil is retiring, after leading the Agricultural Council of Arkansas \nfor 37 years. He joined the organization in 1965 and set to work \nimmediately doing everything he could to make a better world for the \nthousands of farm families that have made their livelihoods out of the \nfertile soil of Arkansas. Since then, he has played a central role in \nmany, many achievements: passage of important check-off programs for \nthe cotton, rice, soybean, and corn industries; creation of the \nProducers Steering Committee within the National Cotton Council; the \nimplementation of better insurance protection for Arkansas farmers, \njust to name a few.\n  Over the years, he has seen many things come and go--economic crises, \noverwhelming floods and endless droughts, farm bill after farm bill, \nand, yes, he has seen many politicians come and go, too.\n  He has also seen a lot of changes and a lot of problems that won't \nseem to go away: higher farm costs against ever lower commodity prices, \nurban and suburban sprawl that increasingly compete for land resources, \na slow but continual rise in the average age of farmers.\n  Through it all, Cecil Williams has fought, tooth and nail, for \nArkansas's farmers. He has fought with grit and determination, with \npassion and loyalty. He has fought with heart and with every bead of \nsweat he could give. He is a company man who has endured almost as long \nas the company. And through the years, he has quietly but surely built \na career that stands as an inspiration for all of us who believe in \nproduction agriculture. I suppose he is not old enough to be the father \nof Arkansas agriculture, but he certainly has been its guardian. And he \nhas served it well.\n  I have known Cecil for many years, first as the daughter of a rice \nfarmer in the Arkansas Delta, and for the past 10 years as a Senator \nand congresswoman. Through two farm bills and through countless attacks \non the foundation of America's farm policy, I have relied on Cecil's \ncounsel and wisdom. His advice has always been sound, always deeply \nrooted in a respect and admiration for the people we both serve. He has \nnever let us down.\n  And, now, on his retirement, it is my fervent hope that we who \ninherit his years of dedication and service will preserve and \nperpetuate his example, that we do not let him down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11568-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11568-S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MARY JANE BRANNON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Mary Jane Crump Brannon graduated \nfrom Huntingdon College in 1937 with majors in biology and English, and \na minor in French. She received her Master of Arts degree from the \nUniversity of Alabama in 1938 in Parasitology. She did further graduate \nwork at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois. She \ncompleted her Ph.D. in Parasitology at Tulane University in 1943. She \nwas the mother of seven children, and taught biology at her alma mater \nfor forty years.\n  She began teaching at Huntingdon in 1956, and taught full-time until \n1986, and part-time for ten more years. During much of this time and \nduring the time I was a student at Huntingdon, she was head of the \nBiology Department. After her retirement she ran an Elderhostel program \nfor Huntingdon College and the Alabama Shakespeare Festival.\n  Those are the facts about Dr. Brannon and her career, but they do not \nbegin to hint at the many lives she touched while teaching at \nHuntingdon. She was a great teacher, brilliant scientist, and \nincredibly committed to the betterment of her students.\n  Every student who studied advanced biology at Huntingdon during those \n40 years knew Dr. Brannon, and she knew them and took an interest in \nthem. They overlooked her difficulty with names--``Please answer \nquestion number seven Joe-Charlie-Sally-whatever your name is, \nchild..''--because they knew she cared about them, and because she \nreally wanted them to learn biology. She was very demanding of her \nstudents, but none were afraid of her; they knew she would do her best \nto teach them.\n  Pre-med students all looked to her for advice in getting into medical \nschool. One student wanted to go to Tulane Medical School, but could \nnot afford it. Dr. Brannon and the Chairman of the Tulane Admissions \nCommittee were friends, and she called him. After their conversation \nTulane offered that student a full tuition scholarship. Scholarships to \nmedical school were even rarer then than they are now!\n  It would be difficult to count the number of students she helped get \ninto graduate or professional school, but in 1983 she had taught 56 \nDoctors of Medicine or Osteopathy, seven dentists, and dozens of \nbiologists. In 1983 alone, eleven Huntingdon graduates were admitted to \nmedical school, out of a graduating class of less than 200! Many of \nthese owed their acceptance into medical, dental, or graduate school to \nher advice, or to having her ``pull strings'' with directors of \nadmission. Huntingdon's 89% acceptance rate to medical school was in \nlarge part due to her teaching and leadership.\n  Dr. Brannon followed the lives of her former students closely, and \nevery year she contacted them in person or by mail. They all looked \nforward to the ``Biology Christmas Letter'' to find out what their \ncollege friends were doing currently. She served as a hub for \ninformation about classmates and the college. Dr. Brannon, by her \nloyalty to Huntingdon College caused her students to recognize the \nuniqueness of the school, and to be loyal also. When I attended \nHuntingdon College, everyone knew there was no more talented, \nhardworking or loyal student than those in the biology department. They \nwere a special group. They reflected her values.\n  Students went to Dr. Brannon with their personal problems, too. One \nstudent, who now has a Ph.D. in chemistry, tells of going to Dr. \nBrannon for advice about her boyfriend, who had proposed. ``I remember \nseeking her advice, which was practical, insightful, and blunt, when a \nguy asked me to marry him my last year at Huntingdon. She told me if I \nwere going to get a Ph.D., that particular guy would not be a good \nmatch intellectually, etc. She told me there would be plenty of guys \nwho would want to marry me later on after I received my Ph.D. She \nencouraged me to get my education first, which was a bold statement \nfrom a teacher to a female student in the 1970s.''\n  She was always arranging field trips for her students to take--trips \nto research labs, to the medical and dental schools, or to wilderness \nareas of Alabama. She planned and coordinated an annual trip to Panama \nCity, Florida, right after the end of the school year so that students \ncould gather biological specimens. It was also so they could have a \nlittle fun, but she was their chaperone, and nobody dared misbehave! \nShe always gave a nighttime lecture and demonstration on \nbioluminescence, showing us the ``things in the Gulf that glow in the \ndark.''\n  Every semester, for every class that she taught, Dr. Brannon invited \nthe entire class over to her home for dinner. She did this for more \nthan 30 years,\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\neach semester. It was a personal way of telling us that she cared about \nus and wanted to share her home and talents with us.\n  She was a superb teacher. She taught students about biology, but \nperhaps more importantly she taught them about living and loving. \nBecause of the real interest she had in each student, she was a \npowerful influence for good in each one's life.\n  Teachers are very important people. Many have touched my life in \nsignificant ways. Those special teachers who have a real passion for \ntruth and excellence, and who care deeply about their subjects and \ntheir students are the ones who change lives--and change them for the \nbetter. Dr. Mary Jane Brannon was one of those. She saw the world \nclearly, spoke quickly and frankly (when one speaks the truth there is \nless need to hesitate), and strongly desired that her students live \nlives dedicated to excellence. Those who studied under her could not be \nunaffected. Indeed, she inspired students who were not her students. \nShe was more than a teacher, she was a force for learning and right \nliving.\n  Her former students remember her with gratitude, admiration and \nlove.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11569-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to join the National \nBible Association in celebrating one of the most important pieces of \nliterature in human history: the Bible. As Senate co-chair of National \nBible Week 2002, it is my honor to participate in a nationwide \nrecognition of the Bible's importance in our daily lives. From November \n24 through December 1, communities and churches across America will \ntake part in this tradition by reading and reflecting on the Bible's \nteachings and how they can help us to lead better lives.\n  This week of Biblical awareness is something that those whose faiths \nare based in Judeo-Christian belief can appreciate. But National Bible \nWeek is also an opportunity for Americans of all religious backgrounds \nto experience the benefits of Bible study. Just as America's students \nread the Constitution of the United States and examine the laws that \ngovern our social behavior, so should everyone read the Bible and \nconsider the traditions and lessons that have come to govern our moral \nbehavior. The ethical guidelines that the Bible provides for us have, \nin large part, built the moral basis of the Western world and its \ngovernments. Furthermore, the notions of right and wrong, of good and \nbad, and the principles we teach our children are illustrated by the \nBible's stories. Through this book, God's word gives us a complete set \nof simple rules to follow to lead a virtuous life.\n  National Bible Week encourages the country to make time, over the \ncourse of 8 days, for returning to the source of their religious \nbeliefs. In this way, a nationwide look at the Bible serves to bring \npeople of different sects and schools together. It allows us to \nrecognize the common text we all share, regardless of denomination or \nchurch, and lays down a standard of conduct and piety that applies to \neveryone without discrimination.\n  As a practicing Catholic, I carry God's word in my heart every day \nand, for me, the Bible is a source of strength and comfort. In my own \nbehavior, with my family, and in my work, I rely on God's message to \nguide me. It is my hope that those who may have put the Bible aside \nwill open themselves up to National Bible Week as a chance to reread \nsuch an important text, for believers and nonbelievers alike.\n  National Bible Week 2002 will be inaugurated in New York with a \nkickoff luncheon to raise funds for the National Bible Association, an \norganization dedicated to promoting daily Bible reading. I congratulate \nthis group's efforts to encourage better Biblical understanding and to \ndraw people of faith towards common ground for a clearer, more \nuniversal understanding of the Bible's lessons and God's word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11569-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11569-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11569-4", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT DOCUMENTING THE STATE OF SMALL BUSINESS AT THE END OF THE \n                       TWENTIETH CENTURY--PM 121\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  This report documents the state of small business at the end of the \n20th century. Small businesses have always been the backbone of our \neconomy. The perennially account for most innovation and job creation. \nSmall businesses have sustained the economy when it is robust and \ngrowing as well as in weaker times when small businesses have put the \neconomy back on the track to long-term growth.\n  We must work together to give small businesses an environment in \nwhich they can thrive. Small businesses are disproportionately affected \nby Government regulations and paperwork, and I am committed to reducing \nthis burden. We should regulate only where there is a real need, fully \njustified through rigorous cost-benefit analysis and clear legal \nauthority. And when Government must regulate, it must adopt commonsense \napproaches. Regulations work best when agencies anticipate and analyze \nthe effects of their proposals on small firms. Rules need to reflect \nthe ability of small businesses to comply.\n  Another barrier to unleashing the full potential of small business is \nour tax code. I am committed to reducing taxes for all Americans--\nespecially small businesses. We must eliminate permanently the estate \ntax, which so often has spelled the death of the business and the jobs \nof its employees after the death of its founder. Our tax code should \nencourage investment in small businesses, and particularly in new and \ngrowing businesses. Because the innovations that drive tomorrow's \neconomy come from entrepreneurial small businesses today, we must help \nthem enter the marketplace, not impede them before they get there. \nAbove all, small businesses need a tax code that is understandable and \nstable. Fairness, simplicity, transparency, and accountability should \nbe our goals, and I am committed to this end.\n  Small business embodies so much of what America is all about. Self-\nreliance, hard work, innovation, the courage to take risks for future \ngrowth: theses are values that have served our Nation well since its \nvery beginning. They are values to be passed on from generation to \ngeneration. We must ensure that our small businesses continue to thrive \nand prosper, not just for their own sakes, but for all of us.\n                                                       George W.

A bill to repeal the sunset of the provisions of the Economic \nGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Investors are the backbone of the U.S. \neconomic system. They provide the capital that entrepreneurs use to \nstart and grow businesses. Investors invest in everything from \ncorporations like General Electric to the local Mom and Pop convenience \nstore. These are the businesses that employ our American workers and \ncompete against other businesses throughout the United States and the \nworld. It is investor capital that fuels the most dynamic workings of \nour economy.\n  Too often, our Federal Government has taken the American investor for \ngranted. Even worse, our Federal Government has singled him out for \nadverse treatment by placing significant impediments in his path.\n  Congress needs to refocus our government's attention on helping our \ninvestors as well as making our U.S. businesses more attractive \nentities in which to invest.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, the ``Contract with Investors,'' \nwhich incorporates a number of proposals to foster a better investment \nenvironment.\n  In order to satisfy an arcane Senate budget rule, the 2001 tax-relief \nlaw's provisions will expire in 2011. Making this bipartisan tax relief \npermanent will eliminate a large source of investor uncertainty that \ncurrently exists in the marketplace. Businesses are having a hard time \nplanning with the Tax Code potentially reverting back to old tax laws. \nBusinesses, and the investors who own them, need certainty and a stable \nenvironment in which to prosper. Making last year's tax provisions \npermanent will go a long way towards providing that certainty.\n  The second thing my bill does is accelerate last year's marginal \nincome tax rate reductions. Instead of reducing the tax brackets in \n2004 and 2006, as currently scheduled, my bill will move the 2004 rate \nreductions up to 2003 and the 2006 rate reductions up to 2004. Marginal \ntax-rate reductions benefit all income tax-paying Americans. Many \ninvestors invest in businesses that are sole proprietorships, i.e. non-\nincorporated business entities. Owners of these businesses pay the \nhighest individual marginal income tax rate; under my bill the highest \nrate they would pay in 2004 and beyond would be 35 percent, the same \nrate as corporations.\n  The third provision would accelerate the repeal of the estate, or \nmore accurately ``death'', tax. A December 1998 report by the Joint \nEconomic Committee concluded that the existence of the death tax during \nthe last century has reduced the stock of investors' capital in the \neconomy by nearly half a\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\ntrillion dollars. The Joint Committee estimates that, by repealing the \ndeath tax and putting those resources to better use, as many as 240,000 \njobs could be created over seven years, and Americans would have an \nadditional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income.\n  Last year, Dr. Wilbur Steger, President of Consad Research \nCorporation and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University testified \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee that an immediate death-tax repeal \nwould provide a $40 billion automatic stimulus to the economy. This is \nbased on estimates of the amount of net unrealized capital gains that \nwould be unlocked by such a repeal. Many Americans choose to hold onto \ntheir assets until death in order to obtain for their heirs a ``step-\nup'' in basis. Eliminating the death tax and a limited step-up in basis \nwill provide an incentive for Americans to sell assets before death, \nhence the term ``unlocking.''\n  Under current law, the death tax will go down to zero in 2010 but \nreappear thereafter, at potent 2001 levels, thus adding significant \ncomplexity to future death-tax planning, increasing costs that are a \ndrag on productivity, and retreating from a principled rejection of a \nfrankly immoral tax. This is unsatisfactory. Until the death tax is \nrepealed, family businesses, farms and ranches must still pay for \nexpensive life-insurance policies, death-tax planners, and tax \nattorneys. These expenses total more than $12 billion a year, according \nto Consad Research Corporation. A more efficient utilization of these \nresources would result in an immediate stimulus for the economy. More \nworkers will be hired, more capital assets purchased and more \nproductive goods made if we accelerate the elimination of the death tax \nand make it permanent. In short, Congress should hurry up and bury the \ndeath tax for all time to enable family businesses, farms, and ranches \nto begin investing those billions of wasted resources in the economy, \ncreating jobs and expanding services, providing a powerful stimulus for \ntheir long-term survival. My bill would permanently repeal the death \ntax in 2005, thus allowing all Americans 2 years to plan for a future \nin which the federal government no longer taxes the death of its \ncitizens.\n  The fourth provision in my Contract with Investors addresses the \ntaxation of capital gains. My bill would reduce it to 10 percent. The \ncapital-gains tax is a form of double-taxation that penalizes risk-\ntaking and entrepreneurship. As many economists, including Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, note, the capital-gains tax should not \nexist. Short of eliminating this tax, Congress must enact a large, and \npermanent, reduction in the capital-gains tax rate in order to \nstimulate new investment and more productive use of resources for both \nthe short-term and the long-term health of our economy.\n  According to a recent study by the American Council for Capital \nFormation, American taxpayers face capital-gain tax rates that are 35 \npercent higher than those paid by the average investor in other \ncountries. In addition, the United States is one of a small number of \ncountries that requires a holding period for an investment to qualify \nfor a lower capital-gain treatment.\n  In the last decade, individual capital-gains rate reductions and \nshortening of the holding period has boosted U.S. economic growth. \nReducing the cost of capital will promote the promote the type of \nproductive business investment that fosters growth in output and high-\npaying jobs. Lowering rates will aid entrepreneurs in their effort to \npromote technological advances in products and services that people \nwant and need.\n  And let's not forget about our national savings. Reducing capital-\ngains taxes means fewer taxes on Americans who choose to save for their \nfuture. What our economy needs is to remove impediments for savings and \ncapital formation. When Americans choose to save for their retirement \nsecurity and other financial goals, they are investing in the United \nStates. We need to make that choice more attractive so that Americans \nchoose to invest more in the United States. Reducing the capital-gains \ntaxes will help achieve this goal.\n  My bill will also modernize the capital-loss provisions by increasing \nthe amount of capital loss an individual may deduct against ordinary \nincome to $10,000 from the current-law $3,000, and indexing it for \nfuture inflation. This $3,000 limit was arbitrarily set over 25 years \nago and would have grown to $10,000 had it been indexed when it was \nenacted. Due to this lack of indexation, many investors are forced to \nhold on to unproductive investments. Updating this $3,000 limit will \npermit investors to sell these unproductive assets and invest the \nproceeds in more productive assets.\n  Next, my bill will provide additional incentives for Americans to \nincrease the amounts and periods of time in which they invest for their \nretirement security. Increasing the annual, maximum IRA contribution \nfrom $3,000 to $5,000 and the annual, maximum 401(k) plan contribution \nfrom $11,000 to $15,000 would enable American workers to save more for \ntheir future by investing in businesses. Increasing from 70.5 to 75 the \nage at which those tax-deferred retirement-savings accounts must begin \nmaking minimum required annual withdrawals will allow American seniors \nwho are approaching this arbitrary age to choose whether to maintain \ntheir investments. They will not longer be forced to divest.\n\n  The next provision in my bill would eliminate the double taxation of \ncorporate profits. Currently, businesses pay income taxes on their \nprofits. Their investors are forced to pay a second income tax on the \namounts that corporations distribute to them in the form of dividends. \nThe national Center for Policy Analysis has calculated that the \ncombined tax rate on corporate profits is approximately 60 percent.\n  My bill would remedy this problem by exempting from income tax the \ndividends received by individuals from publicly traded C corporations. \nEliminating this taxation will produce higher returns on dividend-\nyielding equity investments. Companies will have an incentive to make \nmoney and give it to the investor/shareholders in order to increase the \nvalue of the stock. Investors and businesses will benefit from this \nproposal.\n  Finally, I have included five provisions under Sense of the Senate \nlanguage. I believe that the Senate must act on these issues and I \nstand ready and willing to assist my fellow Senators in solving these \nproblems.\n  First, Congress should pass legislation to safeguard American \nworkers' pension and retirement accounts. This year, the Finance \nCommittee unanimously passed out of committee such a bill. The Senate \nand the House of Representatives should act quickly to pass similar \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  Second, Congress should modernize this country's international tax \nprovisions in order to permit U.S. companies to better compete \ninternationally. Our Tax Code's provisions, particularly the \ninternational tax, are placing our U.S. companies and the investors who \nown them at a distinct competitive disadvantage. Congress must \nmodernize these provisions and move towards ending the current practice \nof taxing profits earned outside our country's boundaries.\n  Third, Congress must take the trouble to purge redundant, outdated, \nand unscientific regulatory burdens on investors and U.S. companies. \nCongress is quick to pass onerous new laws but slow to repeal them. \nThis is an abdication of our responsibilities as legislators. Before \nplacing new burdens on investors and businesses, Congress should be \nrequired to perform a cost-benefit analysis as well as instituting \nperformance criteria to monitor and evaluate these new burdens on U.S. \nbusinesses and investors.\n  Fourth, Congress should enact meaningful tort reform as soon as \npossible.\n  Finally, Congress should enact meaningful tax reform that simplifies \nthe Federal Tax Code and reduces the cost-recovery periods that \nbusinesses are forced to use to recover the costs of capital.\n  Now is the time for bold action. A ``Contract with Investors'' is \nlong overdue. I have laid out my principles. I look forward to future \nhearings and discussions with my colleagues. It's time to get working.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 5. A bill to strengthen and permanently preserve social security \nthrough the power of investment and compound interest without benefit \nreductions or tax increases, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to join the senior Senator \nfrom Texas in introducing the Social Security Preservation Act. He has \nworked a decade on this proposal, and I want to ensure that, as he \nleaves this distinguished body in a few short weeks, his time and \neffort will not have been wasted, for the stakes are far too high.\n  Everyone knows that America's demographics are rapidly changing. In \njust nine short years, in 2011, the first of my generation of baby \nboomers will retire. In the 20 years thereafter, the number of \nAmericans aged 65 and older will grow four times as fast as the number \nof working Americans. Under the current system, where no real \ninvestments are ever made and current benefits are paid entirely by \ntaxing current workers, how do we expect to pay for this shift in \ndemographics? In 2015, Social Security will be distributing more in \nbenefits than it collects in payroll taxes, and by 2038, the system \nwill be completely bankrupt. Congress will be forced to either raise \ntaxes on the next generation of workers by nearly 40 percent or cut the \nbenefits of retirees by nearly 30 percent. If we continue to defer the \ndifficult decisions on how we fix the system, that will be the position \nwe will find ourselves in. If we begin now, however, we can stabilize \nand enhance the system before it is scheduled to go broke. But we must \nstart now.\n  In his message to Congress on Social Security in 1935, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt called for a Social Security system of ``voluntary \ncontributory annuities by which individual initiative can increase the \nannual amounts received in old age.'' This bill embraces that vision, \nand will strengthen and permanently preserve Social Security by \nactually making investments. All workers will have the option of \ninvesting a portion of their wages into accounts that earn a higher \nrate of return. Upon retirement, these investing workers would use the \nmoney in their accounts to purchase an annuity to pay benefits promised \nunder the current system plus a bonus for participating in the new \nsystem. They could keep any excess. All workers, both those who invest \nand those who choose to remain in the current system, would be \nguaranteed every dollar of their currently promised benefit. No worker \nwould ever experience a cut in benefits or a hike in taxes at any time. \nAnd when fully implemented, these changes to Social Security will yield \nbenefits over two times those currently provided to an average worker. \nAnd the system's coming insolvency in 2038 would be reversed.\n  It is time for our Nation to confront Social Security's impending \nfinancial crisis. For too long, we have ignored our nation's changing \ndemographics which will result in a crushing burden being placed on our \nSocial Security and Medicare systems if we don't deal with this \nchallenge now. It will demand either higher taxes or reduced benefits \nlater if we continue to defer our responsibilities. For too long, we \nhave feared open and informative debate about reforming the Social \nSecurity system, believing that the American people are unwilling to \nconsider the realities that we face. Politicians have been afraid of \nthe political risks in honestly dealing with Social Security. The \nCongress and the President must face up to their responsibilities in \ndealing with this challenge. I will reintroduce this legislation to \nreform the Social Security system at the beginning of the next Congress \nand look forward to working with my colleagues and President Bush in \nthis effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3173. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to establish a \nnational health program administered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement to offer Federal employee health benefits plans to \nindividuals who are not Federal employees, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to make \navailable to all Americans the same range of private health insurance \nplans available to Members of Congress and other Federal employees \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, FEHBP.\n  Too many Americans do not have real insurance options. Many \nindividuals lack insurance because no insurer is willing to cover them \nat a reasonable price. Others work for employers who do not provide \nhealth insurance or offer only one insurance provider. This legislation \naddresses these issues by giving individuals and businesses access to \nthe group purchasing power of FEHBP and the wide range of health plans \nin that program.\n  The OPTION Act, Offering People True Insurance Options Nationwide, \nwould expand insurance options by allowing individuals to enroll in \nprivate health insurance plans nearly identical to the plans available \nto federal employees. Though the OPTION program would be separate from \nthe Federal employees program, it would be modeled after FEHBP and \nwould draw from FEHBP's strengths: plan choice, group purchasing \nsavings, comprehensive benefits, and open enrollment periods.\n  Under this legislation, all FEHBP health plans would be required to \noffer an OPTION health plan to non-Federal employees with the same \nrange of benefits they offer Federal employees through FEHBP.\n  OPTION enrollees would be placed in a separate risk pool to prevent \nany adverse effect on current FEHBP employees, annuitants, and their \nfamilies. The OPTION Act would not result in any changes to the \npremiums or benefits of today's FEHBP health plans.\n  OPTION health plans would not be allowed to impose any preexisting \ncondition exclusions on new OPTION enrollees who have at least one year \nof health insurance coverage immediately prior to enrollment in an \nOPTION plan. To prevent people from waiting until they are sick to \nenroll, health plans would be allowed to exclude coverage for \npreexisting conditions for up to one year for people without coverage \nimmediately prior to enrollment.\n  One of the few differences from FEHBP is that OPTION plans would be \nallowed to vary premiums by age so that younger enrollees would be more \nlikely to enroll. OPTION plans also would be required to offer rebates \nor lower premiums to encourage and reward longevity of health coverage. \nThese provisions would act as an incentive for people to sign up when \nthey are young and to maintain continuous coverage.\n  Along with making FEHBP available in the individual market, the \nOPTION program will allow businesses to tap into the type of group \nbuying power in the federal employees program if they voluntarily \nchoose to participate. To be eligible, a business would have to be \nwilling to pay at least a minimum percentage of premiums, varying from \n40 percent to 60 percent depending on the size of the business. \nEmployers would also be offered an incentive to begin enrolling their \nemployees by allowing them to pay as little as 20 percent of the \npremium for the first year. This innovative employer option would \nencourage employer health coverage rather than shifting coverage away \nfrom the private sector. I want to emphasize that employer \nparticipation would be entirely voluntary.\n  Under the OPTION Act, premiums would not be government-subsidized. \nInstead, enrollees and those employers who choose to participate would \nbe responsible for the cost of the premiums.\n  The OPTION program would be administered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement, OPM, which administers the FEHBP program, and would \ngenerally follow the rules for FEHBP. OPM has developed considerable \nexpertise in negotiating and working with health plans and has shown \nthat it can run a health program well at a minimal cost. We can build \non OPM's expertise to extend the same health insurance options to all \nAmericans.\n  Finally, once it is up and running, this program would pay for \nitself. Administrative costs would be covered from a portion of the \nOPTION premiums. Those who benefit from the program would pay for its \noverhead costs.\n  This legislation could open the door for many Americans to obtain \ngood health insurance coverage. Health insurance premiums in today's \nmarket can be especially high, both for individuals and for small \nbusinesses buying insurance on their own. This legislation will reduce \nthe cost of insurance, and as a result will help to reduce the number \nof uninsured Americans. It will also expand insurance options. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this very important legislation.\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nemployers in renewal communities to qualify for the renewal community \nemployment credit by employing residents of certain other renewal \ncommunities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I am introducing a modification of \nlegislation I introduced earlier in the 107th Congress relating to the \nRenewal Community program. The Renewal Community program has been \ntremendously valuable in promoting job growth and economic development \nin the poorest areas of the country.\n  There are 40 urban and rural renewal community areas designated under \nthe Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000. The poverty rate in \nrenewal communities is at least 20 percent, and the unemployment rate \nis one-and-a-half times the national level. The households in the \nrenewal communities have incomes that are 80 percent below the median \nincome of households in their local jurisdictions. Four areas of \nLouisiana received renewal community designations.\n  Businesses in a renewal community can receive a variety of tax \nbenefits for hiring residents of the same renewal community. These tax \nbenefits include A $1,500 Federal credit for hiring workers from the \nrenewal community, as well as a $2,400 work opportunity credit for \nhiring employees from groups with traditionally high unemployment \nrates. There is one important qualification in the program that poses a \npeculiar problem in Louisiana, as well as a few other parts of the \ncountry: a business can only take advantage of these credits if it \nhires residents from the same renewal community that the business is \nin.\n  Why is this a problem for Louisiana? Because, some of our renewal \ncommunities border each other. Under the rules of the program, the \nbusiness cannot receive the credit for hiring a resident of a different \nrenewal community. In Louisiana, the closest available job for someone \nmight be at a business two or three miles away, but if that business is \nnot in the same renewal community as the worker, the business cannot \nget the tax credit.\n  A good example of what I am talking about is in the northern part of \nLouisiana, home of the North Louisiana Renewal Community and the \nOuachita Renewal Community. The city of Monroe is located at the heart \nof the Ouachita Renewal Community and it serves as the economic hub for \nNortheast Louisiana. All around Monroe and the Ouachita Renewal \nCommunity there are parishes which fall in the North Louisiana Renewal \nCommunity, Morehouse Parish to the north, Richland Parish to the east, \nCaldwell Parish to the south, and Lincoln Parish to the west. People \nfrom these parishes will naturally look in Monroe for jobs. But under \nthe rule, businesses in Monroe cannot take advantage of the tax credits \neven if they hire wokers from only a short distance away.\n  My legislation, the Renewal Community Tax Benefit Improvement Act of \n2002, will allow the employers in one renewal community to hire \nemployees from an adjacent or nearby renewal community area and still \nreceive the tax benefits granted through the act. The bill I am \nintroducing today is a slightly more narrow version of my earlier bill \nto bring needed flexibility to the renewal community program. I am \npleased that my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, is an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  This legislation is a small change that will make a big difference to \nthe people of Louisiana. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 3177. A bill to authorize appropriations for the programs of the \nDepartment of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, to amend the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology, NIST, Authorization \nAct. The bill is a routine authorization of appropriations for NIST. It \nincludes some provisions to change the Institute's Advanced Technology \nProgram that were the subject of hearings in the Commerce Committee \nearlier this year. In addition, the bill includes several technical \nchanges to the NIST Act which the agency has requested.\n  NIST is really a hidden treasure. Twice in the past five years, NIST \nScientists have shared in the Physics Nobel Prize. Whether they are \ninvestigating the collapse of the World Trade Center, making small \nmanufacturers better, sponsoring innovative research, or improving \ntimekeeping, the people of this little-noticed agency continue to do \namazing work, and I commend them.\n  Nonetheless, we continue to be embroiled in an annual tug-of-war on \nfunding for the Advanced Technology Program, known as ATP. I am \nencouraged that Secretary Evans and Deputy Secretary Bodman want to \nstabilize this program. I am introducing this bill to help them in that \ncause by including several of the Department's suggestions to improve \nthe ATP.\n  The benefits of the ATP are well-documented. The program has been \nstudied thoroughly from individual case studies, to comprehensive \nexaminations like the 2001 study by the National Academy of Sciences' \nNational Research Council. The results are clear. ATP is stimulating \ncollaboration, accelerating the development of high-risk technologies, \nand paying off for the nation.\n  The Commerce Department has proposed several changes to the ATP. The \nbill includes provisions to allow universities to lead ATP projects and \nto have interest in the intellectual property developed under those \nprojects, as well as provisions to further clarify that projects are to \nremove scientific and technical barriers and to evaluate ATP's review \nprocess.\n  In addition, the bill would clarify that the program should operate \nfree of political influence by ensuring that final project decisions \nare made by career NIST officials, as they have been since the \nprogram's inception.\n  However, the Administration's proposal for recoupment of up to 5 \ntimes the original amount of funding is not acceptable and is not \nincluded. The record on recoupment was made at our hearing in April of \nthis year. It is an approach which the program has tried and failed. \nMore importantly, recoupment discourages companies from participating \nin the program, imposing overwhelming accounting burdens that companies \nmay be unable to fulfill.\n  In the end, the bill hopes to build on ATP's tremendous successes. \nSince its inception in 1989 this industry-led, competitive, and cost-\nshared program has helped the U.S. develop the next generation of \nbreakthrough technologies in advance of its foreign competitors.\n  The Commerce Committee heard testimony from Scott Donnelly of GE. His \ncompany, with ATP funding, developed a new method to produce the X-ray \npanels that are the heart of a new digital mammography system. This \nsystem is giving women and their doctors access to better, cheaper \ndigital mammograms.\n  A March 1999 study found that future returns from just three of the \ncompleted ATP projects, improving automobile manufacturing processes, \nreducing the cost of blood and immune cell production, and using a new \nmaterial for prosthesis devices, would pay for all projects funded to \ndate by the ATP.\n  The bill also provides full funding for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, MEP, Centers which the Administration has proposed to cut. \nIronically,\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\nthese MEP Centers help fulfill one of the top priorities stated in the \nAdministration's budget: ``revitalize the economy and create jobs.'' \nMEP helps small manufacturers stay competitive and, in 2000, helped \nthese businesses attain $2.3 billion in increased or retained sales, \nsave costs of $480 million, and create or retain more than 25,000 jobs.\n  While the time remaining in this session is short, I want to \nintroduce this NIST Authorization bill to stimulate the productive \ndialog that we have had with interested members and the Administration \non the programs of NIST. I look forward to continuing this work during \nthe 108th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11580-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 359--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \n               OF THE THURGOOD MARSHALL SCHOLARSHIP FUND\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the State of New Jersey was critically important during \n     the American Revolution because of the strategic location of \n     the State between the British armies headquartered in New \n     York City, New York, and the Continental Congress in the city \n     of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;\n\n[[Page S11581]]\n\n       (2) General George Washington spent almost half of the \n     period of the American Revolution personally commanding \n     troops of the Continental Army in the State of New Jersey, \n     including two severe winters spent in encampments in the area \n     that is now Morristown National Historical Park, a unit of \n     the National Park System;\n       (3) it was during the ten crucial days of the American \n     Revolution between December 25, 1776, and January 3, 1777, \n     that General Washington, after retreating across the State of \n     New Jersey from the State of New York to the State of \n     Pennsylvania in the face of total defeat, recrossed the \n     Delaware River on the night of December 25, 1776, and went on \n     to win crucial battles at Trenton and Princeton in the State \n     of New Jersey;\n       (4) Thomas Paine, who accompanied the troops during the \n     retreat, described the events during those days as ``the \n     times that try men's souls'';\n       (5) the sites of 296 military engagements are located in \n     the State of New Jersey, including--\n       (A) several important battles of the American Revolution \n     that were significant to the outcome of the American \n     Revolution and the history of the United States; and\n       (B) several national historic landmarks, including \n     Washington's Crossing, the Old Trenton Barracks, and \n     Princeton, Monmouth and Red Bank Battlefields;\n       (6) additional national historic landmarks in the State of \n     New Jersey include the homes of--\n       (A) Richard Stockton, Joseph Hewes, John Witherspoon, and \n     Francis Hopkinson, signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence;\n       (B) Elias Boudinout, President of the Continental Congress; \n     and\n       (C) William Livingston, patriot and Governor of the State \n     of New Jersey from 1776 to 1790;\n       (7) portions of the landscapes important to the strategies \n     of the British and Continental armies, including waterways, \n     mountains, farms, wetlands, villages, and roadways--\n       (A) retain the integrity of the period of the American \n     Revolution; and\n       (B) offer outstanding opportunities for conservation, \n     education, and recreation;\n       (8) the National Register of Historic Places lists 251 \n     buildings and sites in the National Park Service study area \n     for the Crossroads of the American Revolution that are \n     associated with the period of the American Revolution;\n       (9) civilian populations residing in the State of New \n     Jersey during the American Revolution suffered extreme \n     hardships because of the continuous conflict in the State and \n     marauding contingents of loyalist Tories and rebel \n     sympathizers;\n       (10) because of the important role that the State of New \n     Jersey played in the successful outcome of the American \n     Revolution, there is a Federal interest in developing a \n     regional framework to assist the State of New Jersey, local \n     governments and organizations, and private citizens in--\n       (A) preserving and protecting cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the period; and\n       (B) bringing recognition to those resources for the \n     educational and recreational benefit of the present and \n     future generations of citizens of the United States; and\n       (11) the National Park Service has conducted a national \n     heritage area feasibility study in the State of New Jersey \n     that demonstrates that there is a sufficient assemblage of \n     nationally distinctive cultural, historic, and natural \n     resources necessary to establish the Crossroads of the \n     American Revolution National Heritage Area.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to assist communities, organizations, and citizens in \n     the State of New Jersey in preserving the special historic \n     identity of the State and the importance of the State to the \n     United States;\n       (2) to foster a close working relationship among all levels \n     of government, the private sector, and local communities in \n     the State;\n       (3) to provide for the management, preservation, \n     protection, and interpretation of the cultural, historic, and \n     natural resources of the State for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of future generations;\n       (4) to strengthen the value of Morristown National \n     Historical Park as an asset to the State by--\n       (A) establishing a network of related historic resources, \n     protected landscapes, educational opportunities, and events \n     depicting the landscape of the State of New Jersey during the \n     American Revolution; and\n       (B) establishing partnerships between Morristown National \n     Historical Park and other public and privately owned \n     resources in the Heritage Area that represent the fulcrum of \n     the American Revolution;

and aerospace \n     industry, which is responsible for an estimated 11,200,000 \n     American jobs.\n       (6) The industrial and cultural heritage of the aviation \n     and aerospace industry in the State of Ohio includes the \n     social history and living cultural traditions of several \n     generations.\n       (7) The Department of the Interior is responsible for \n     protecting and interpreting the Nation's cultural and \n     historic resources, and there are significant examples of \n     these resources within Ohio to merit the involvement of the \n     Federal Government to develop programs and projects in \n     cooperation with the Aviation Heritage Foundation, \n     Incorporated, the State of Ohio, and other local and \n     governmental entities to adequately conserve, protect, and \n     interpret this heritage for the educational and recreational \n     benefit of this and future generations of Americans, while \n     providing opportunities for education and revitalization.\n       (8) Since the enactment of the Dayton Aviation Heritage \n     Preservation Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-419), partnerships \n     among the Federal, State, and local governments and the \n     private sector have greatly assisted the development and \n     preservation of the historic aviation resources in the Miami \n     Valley.\n       (9) An aviation heritage area centered in Southwest Ohio is \n     a suitable and feasible management option to increase \n     collaboration, promote heritage tourism, and build on the \n     established partnerships among Ohio's historic aviation \n     resources and related sites.\n       (10) A critical level of collaboration among the historic \n     aviation resources in Southwest Ohio cannot be achieved \n     without a congressionally established national heritage area \n     and the support of the National Park Service and other \n     Federal agencies which own significant historic aviation-\n     related sites in Ohio.\n       (11) The Aviation Heritage Foundation, Incorporated, would \n     be an appropriate management entity to oversee the \n     development of the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       (12) Five National Park Service and Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage Commission studies and planning documents: ``Study \n     of Alternatives: Dayton's Aviation Heritage'', ``Dayton \n     Aviation Heritage National Historical Park Suitability/\n     Feasibility Study'', ``Dayton Aviation Heritage General \n     Management Plan'', ``Dayton Historic Resources Preservation \n     and Development Plan'', and Heritage Area Concept Study (in \n     progress), demonstrated that sufficient historical resources \n     exist to establish the National Aviation Heritage Area.\n       (13) With the advent of the 100th anniversary of the first \n     powered flight in 2003, it is recognized that the \n     preservation of properties nationally significant in the \n     history of\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\n     aviation is an important goal for the future education of \n     Americans.\n       (14) Local governments, the State of Ohio, and private \n     sector interests have embraced the heritage area concept and \n     desire to enter into a partnership with the Federal \n     government to preserve, protect, and develop the Heritage \n     Area for public benefit.\n       (15) The National Aviation Heritage Area would complement \n     and enhance the aviation-related resources within the \n     National Park Service, especially the Dayton Aviation \n     Heritage National Historical Park, Ohio.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to establish the \n     Heritage Area to--\n       (1) encourage and facilitate collaboration among the \n     facilities, sites, organizations, governmental entities, and \n     educational institutions within the Heritage Area to promote \n     heritage tourism and to develop educational and cultural \n     programs for the public;\n       (2) preserve and interpret for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of present and future generations the \n     unique and significant contributions to our national heritage \n     of certain historic and cultural lands, structures, \n     facilities, and sites within the National Aviation Heritage \n     Area;\n       (3) encourage within the National Aviation Heritage Area a \n     broad range of economic opportunities enhancing the quality \n     of life for present and future generations;\n       (4) provide a management framework to assist the State of \n     Ohio, its political subdivisions, other areas, and private \n     organizations, or combinations thereof, in preparing and \n     implementing an integrated Management Plan to conserve their \n     aviation heritage and in developing policies and programs \n     that will preserve, enhance, and interpret the cultural, \n     historical, natural, recreation, and scenic resources of the \n     Heritage Area; and\n       (5) authorize the Secretary to provide financial and \n     technical assistance to the State of Ohio, its political \n     subdivisions, and private organizations, or combinations \n     thereof, in preparing and implementing the private Management \n     Plan.\n\n     SEC. 1003.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II on February 19, 1942, President \n     Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, \n     setting in motion the forced exile of more than 110,000 \n     Japanese Americans.\n       (2) In Washington State, 12,892 men, women and children of \n     Japanese ancestry experienced three years of incarceration, \n     an incarceration violating the most basic freedoms of \n     American citizens.\n       (3) On March 30, 1942, 227 Bainbridge Island residents were \n     the first Japanese Americans in United States history to be \n     forcibly removed from their homes by the U.S. Army and sent \n     to internment camps. They boarded the ferry Kehloken from the \n     former Eagledale Ferry Dock, located at the end of Taylor \n     Avenue, in the city of Bainbridge Island, Washington State.\n       (4) The city of Bainbridge Island has adopted a resolution \n     stating that this site should be a National Memorial, and \n     similar resolutions have been introduced in the Washington \n     State Legislature.\n       (5) Both the Minidoka National Monument and Manzanar \n     National Historic Site can clearly tell the story of a time \n     in our Nation's history when constitutional rights were \n     ignored. These camps by design were placed in very remote \n     places and are not easily accessible. Bainbridge Island is a \n     short ferry ride from Seattle and the site would be within \n     easy reach of many more people.\n       (6) This is a unique opportunity to create a site that will \n     honor those who suffered, cherish the friends and community \n     who stood beside them and welcomed them home, and inspire all \n     to stand firm in the event our Nation again succumbs to \n     similar fears.\n       (7) The site should be recognized by the National Park \n     Service based on its high degree of national significance, \n     association with significant events, and integrity of its \n     location and setting. This site is critical as an anchor for \n     future efforts to identify, interpret, serve, and ultimately \n     honor the Nikkei- persons of Japanese ancestry-influence on \n     Bainbridge Island.\n\n     SEC. 302.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) an important facet of the history of the United States \n     is the story of how the United States was populated;\n       (2) the migration, immigration, and settlement of the \n     population of the United States--\n       (A) is broadly termed the ``peopling of America''; and\n       (B) is characterized by--\n       (i) the movement of groups of people across external and \n     internal boundaries of the United States and territories of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) the interactions of those groups with each other and \n     with other populations;\n       (3) each of those groups has made unique, important \n     contributions to American history, culture, art, and life;\n       (4) the spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n     economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n     pluralism and diversity of the American population;\n       (5) the success of the United States in embracing and \n     accommodating diversity has strengthened the national fabric \n     and unified the United States in its values, institutions, \n     experiences, goals, and accomplishments;\n       (6)(A) the National Park Service's official thematic \n     framework, revised in 1996, responds to the requirement of \n     section 1209 of the Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1a-5 note; title XII of Public Law 101-628), that \n     ``the Secretary shall ensure that the full diversity of \n     American history and prehistory are represented'' in the \n     identification and interpretation of historic properties by \n     the National Park Service; and\n       (B) the thematic framework recognizes that ``people are the \n     primary agents of change'' and establishes the theme of human \n     population movement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a \n     primary thematic category for interpretation and \n     preservation; and\n       (7) although there are approximately 70,000 listings on the \n     National Register of Historic Places, sites associated with \n     the exploration and settlement of the United States by a \n     broad range of cultures are not well represented.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to foster a much-needed understanding of the diversity \n     and contribution of the breadth of groups who have peopled \n     the United States; and\n       (2) to strengthen the ability of the National Park Service \n     to include groups and events otherwise not recognized in the \n     peopling of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1103.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Trails System \n     Willing Seller Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In spite of commendable efforts by State and local \n     governments and private volunteer trail groups to develop, \n     operate, and maintain the national scenic and national \n     historic trails designated by Act of Congress in section 5(a) \n     of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1244(a)), the \n     rate of progress towards developing and completing the trails \n     is slower than anticipated.\n       (2) Nine of the twelve national scenic and historic trails \n     designated between 1978 and 1986 are subject to restrictions \n     totally excluding Federal authority for land acquisition \n     outside the exterior boundaries of any federally administered \n     area, including the North Country National Scenic Trail, the \n     Ice Age National Scenic Trail, and the Potomac Heritage \n     National Scenic Trail.\n       (3) To complete the North Country National Scenic Trail, \n     the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, and the Potomac Heritage \n     National Scenic Trail as intended by Congress, acquisition \n     authority to secure necessary rights-of-way and historic \n     sites and segments, limited to acquisition from willing \n     sellers only, and specifically excluding the use of \n     condemnation, should be extended to the Secretary of the \n     Federal department administering these trails.\n\n     SEC. 203. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING MULTIJURISDICTIONAL \n                   AUTHORITY OVER THE NATIONAL TRAILS SYSTEM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to address \n     the problems involving multijurisdictional authority over the \n     National Trails System, the Secretary of the Federal \n     department with jurisdiction over a national scenic or \n     historic trail should--\n       (1) cooperate with appropriate officials of each State and \n     political subdivisions of each State in which the trail is \n     located and private persons with an interest in the trail to \n     pursue the development of the trail; and\n       (2) be granted sufficient authority to purchase lands and \n     interests in lands from willing sellers that are critical to \n     the completion of the trail.\n\n     SEC. 204.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wildfire Prevention Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is an increasing threat of wildfire to millions \n     of acres of forest land and rangeland throughout the United \n     States;\n       (2) forest land and rangeland are degraded as a direct \n     consequence of land management practices (including practices \n     to control and prevent wildfires and the failure to harvest \n     subdominant trees from overstocked stands) that disrupt the \n     occurrence of frequent low-intensity fires that have \n     periodically removed flammable undergrowth;\n       (3) at least 39,000,000 acres of land of the National \n     Forest System in the interior West are at high risk of \n     wildfire;\n       (4) an average of 95 percent of the expenditures by the \n     Forest Service for wildfire suppression during fiscal years \n     1990 through 1994 were made to suppress wildfires in the \n     interior West;\n       (5) the number, size, and severity of wildfires in the \n     interior West are increasing;\n       (6) of the timberland in National Forests in the States of \n     Arizona and New Mexico, 59 percent of such land in Arizona, \n     and 56 percent of such land in New Mexico, has an average \n     diameter of 9 to 12 inches diameter at breast height;\n       (7) the population of the interior West grew twice as fast \n     as the national average during the 1990s;\n       (8) efforts to prioritize forests and communities for \n     wildfire risk reduction have been inconsistent and \n     insufficient and have resulted in funding to areas that are \n     not prone to severe wildfires;\n       (9) catastrophic wildfires--\n       (A) endanger homes and communities;\n       (B) damage and destroy watersheds and soils; and\n       (C) pose a serious threat to the habitat of threatened and \n     endangered species;\n       (10) a 1994 assessment of forest health in the interior \n     West estimated that only a 15- to 30-year window of \n     opportunity exists for effective management intervention \n     before damage from uncontrollable wildfire becomes \n     widespread, with 8 years having already elapsed since the \n     assessment;\n       (11) following a catastrophic wildfire, certain forests in \n     the interior West do not return to their former grandeur;\n       (12) healthy forest and woodland ecosystems--\n       (A) reduce the risk of wildfire to forests and communities;\n       (B) improve wildlife habitat and biodiversity;\n       (C) increase tree, grass, forb, and shrub productivity;\n       (D) enhance watershed values;\n       (E) improve the environment; and\n       (F) provide a basis in some areas for economically and \n     environmentally sustainable uses;\n       (13) sustaining the long-term ecological and economic \n     health of interior West forests and woodland, and their \n     dependent human communities, requires preventing severe \n     wildfires before the wildfires occur and permitting natural, \n     low-intensity ground fires;\n       (14) more natural fire regimes cannot be accomplished \n     without the reduction of excess fuels and thinning of \n     subdorminant trees (which fuels and trees may be of \n     commercial value);\n       (15) ecologically-based forest and woodland ecosystem \n     restoration on a landscape scale will--\n       (A) improve long-term community protection;\n       (B) minimize the need for wildfire suppression;\n       (C) improve resource values;\n       (D) reduce rehabilitation costs;\n       (E) reduce loss of critical habitat; and\n       (F) protect forests for future generations;\n       (16) although the National Fire Plan, and the report \n     entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in \n     Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' (65 Fed. Reg. \n     67480), advocate a shift in wildfire policy from suppression \n     to prevention (including restoration and hazardous fuels \n     reduction), Federal land managers are not dedicating \n     sufficient attention and financial resources to restoration \n     activities that simultaneously restore forest health and \n     reduce the risk of severe wildfire;\n       (17) although landscape scale restoration is needed to \n     effectively reverse degradation, scientific understanding of \n     landscape scale treatments is limited;\n       (18) the Federal wildfire research program is funded at \n     approximately 1/3 of the amount that is required to address \n     emerging wildfire problems, resulting in the lack of a \n     cohesive strategy to address the threat of catastrophic \n     wildfires; and\n       (19) rigorous, understandable, and applied scientific \n     information is needed for--\n       (A) the design, implementation, and adaptation of landscape \n     scale restoration treatments and improvement of wildfire \n     management technology;\n       (B) the environmental review process; and\n       (C) affected entities that collaborate in the development \n     and implementation of wildfire treatment.\n\n     SEC. 103. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, \n     and monitor practical science-based forest restoration \n     treatments that will reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and \n     improve forest and woodland health, in the interior West;\n       (2) to develop the practical scientific knowledge required \n     to implement forest and woodland restoration on a landscape \n     scale;\n       (3) to develop the interdisciplinary knowledge required to \n     understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of \n     wildfire control on ecosystems and landscapes;\n       (4) to require Federal agencies--\n       (A) to use ecological restoration treatments to reverse \n     declining forest health and reduce the risk of severe \n     wildfires across the forest landscape;\n       (B) to ensure that sufficient funds are dedicated to \n     wildlife prevention activities, including restoration \n     treatments; and\n       (C) to monitor and use wildfire treatments based on the use \n     of adaptive ecosystem management;\n       (5) to develop, transfer, and assist land managers in \n     treating acres with restoration-based treatments and use new \n     management technologies (including the transfer of \n     understandable information, assistance with environmental \n     review, and field and classroom training and collaboration) \n     to accomplish the goals identified in--\n       (A) the National Fire Plan;\n       (B) the report entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining \n     Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' \n     (65 Fed. Reg. 67480); and\n       (C) the report entitled ``10-Year Comprehensive Strategy: A \n     Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland Fire Risks to \n     Communities and the Environment'' of the Western Governors' \n     Association; and\n       (6) to provide technical assistance to collaborative \n     efforts by affected entities to develop, implement, and \n     monitor adaptive ecosystem management restoration treatments \n     that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and \n     socially responsible.\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Bingaman) proposed an amendment to the \nbill S. 2222, to resolve certain conveyances and provide for \nalternative land selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct related to Cape Fox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation, and for \nother purposes, as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n           TITLE I--CAPE FOX LAND ENTITLEMENT ADJUSTMENT ACT\n\n     SECTION 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Cape Fox Land Entitlement \n     Adjustment Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n     Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for \n     the Native Village of Saxman.\n       (2) As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast \n     Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under \n     section 16 of ANCSA.\n       (3) Except for Cape Fox, all other Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n     village corporations were restricted from selecting within \n     two miles of a home rule city.\n       (4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of Ketchikan, \n     Cape Fox was restricted from selecting lands within six miles \n     from the boundary of the home rule City of Ketchikan under \n     section 22(1) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1621(1)).\n       (5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by precluding \n     the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, \n     industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in \n     its core township but in surrounding lands far removed from \n     Ketchikan and its watershed.\n       (6) As a result of the six mile restriction, only the \n     remote mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core \n     township, which is nonproductive and of no known economic \n     value, was available for selection by the corporation. \n     Selection of this parcel was, however, mandated by section \n     16(b) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)).\n       (7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n     fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n     selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA \n     selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation \n     affected by this restriction.\n       (8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA requires adjustment of Sealaska \n     Corporation's (Sealaska) selections and conveyances to avoid \n     creation of additional split estate between National Forest \n     System surface lands and Sealaska subsurface lands.\n       (9) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n     of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, in which Sealaska holds \n     title or conveyance rights to several thousand acres of \n     subsurface lands that encumber management of Tongass \n     National Forest surface lands.\n       (10) The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this \n     Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n     subject to valid existing rights, provide a means to resolve \n     some of the Cape Fox and Sealaska ANCSA land entitlement \n     issues without significantly affecting Tongass National \n     Forest resources, uses or values.\n       (11) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA through the provisions of this Act, and the \n     related adjustment of Sealaska's selections and conveyances \n     hereunder, are in accordance with the purposes of ANCSA and \n     otherwise in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 103. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   LANDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16(b) of ANCSA \n     (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to select \n     or receive conveyance of approximately 160 acres of federal \n     unconveyed lands within Section 1, T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M.\n\n     SEC. 104. SELECTION OUTSIDE EXTERIOR SELECTION BOUNDARY.\n\n       (a) Selection and Conveyance of Surface Estate.--In \n     addition to lands made available for selection under ANCSA, \n     within 24 months after the date of enactment of this title, \n     Cape Fox may select, and, upon receiving written notice of \n     such selection, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey \n     approximately 99 acres of the surface estate of Tongass \n     National Forest lands outside Cape Fox's current exterior \n     selection boundary, specifically that parcel described as \n     follows:\n       (1) T. 73 S., R. 90 E., C.R.M.\n       (2) Section 33: SW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 38 acres.\n       (3) Section 33: NW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 13 acres.\n       (4) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SE\\1/4\\: 40 acres.\n       (5) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\: 8 acres.\n       (b) Conveyance of Subsurface Estate.--Upon conveyance to \n     Cape Fox of the surface estate to the lands identified in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to \n     Sealaska the subsurface estate to the lands.\n       (c) Timing.--The Secretary of the Interior shall complete \n     the interim conveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this \n     section within 180 days after the Secretary of the Interior \n     receives notice of the Cape Fox selection under subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 105. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN CAPE FOX AND THE TONGASS \n                   NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n       (a) General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall offer, and \n     if accepted by Cape Fox, shall exchange the federal lands \n     described in subsection (b) for lands and interests therein \n     identified by Cape Fox under subsection (c) and, to the \n     extent necessary, lands and interests therein identified \n     under subsection (d).\n       (b) Lands To Be Exchanged to Cape Fox.--The lands to be \n     offered for exchange by the Secretary of Agriculture are \n     Tongass National Forest lands comprising approximately \n     2,663.9 acres in T. 36 S., R. 62 E., C.R.M. and T. 35 S., R. \n     62 E., C.R.M., as designated upon a map entitled ``Proposed \n     Kensington Project Land Exchange,'' dated March 18, 2002, and \n     available for inspection in the Forest Service Region 10 \n     regional office in Juneau, Alaska.\n       (c) Lands To Be Exchanged to the United States.--Cape Fox \n     shall be entitled, within 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, to identify in writing to the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and the Interior the lands and interests in lands \n     that Cape Fox proposes to exchange for the federal lands \n     described in subsection (b). The lands and interests in lands \n     shall be identified from lands previously conveyed to Cape \n     Fox comprising approximately 2,900 acres and designated as \n     parcels A-1 to A-3, B-1 to B-3, and C upon a map entitled \n     ``Cape Fox Corporation ANCSA Land Exchange Proposal,'' dated \n     March 15, 2002, and available for inspection in the Forest \n     Service Region 10 regional office in Juneau, Alaska. Lands \n     identified for exchange within each parcel shall be \n     contiguous to adjacent National Forest System lands and in \n     reasonably compact tracts. The lands identified for exchange \n     shall include a public trail easement designated as D on said \n     map, unless the Secretary of Agriculture agrees otherwise. \n     The value of the easement shall be included in determining \n     the total value of lands exchanged to the United States.\n       (d) Valuation of Exchange Lands.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall determine whether the lands identified by \n     Cape Fox under subsection (c) are equal in value to the lands \n     described in subsection (b). If the lands identified under \n     subsection (c) are determined to have insufficient value to \n     equal the value of the lands described in subsection (b), \n     Cape Fox and the Secretary shall mutually identify additional \n     Cape Fox lands for exchange sufficient to equalize the value \n     of lands conveyed to Cape Fox. Such land shall be contiguous \n     to adjacent National Forest System lands and in reasonably \n     compact tracts.\n       (e) Conditions.--The offer and conveyance of Federal lands \n     to Cape Fox in the exchange shall, notwithstanding section \n     14(f) of ANCSA, be of the surface and subsurface estate, but \n     subject to valid existing rights and all other provisions \n     of section 14(g) of ANCSA.\n       (f) Timing.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall attempt, \n     within 90 days after the date of enactment of this title, to \n     enter into an agreement with Cape Fox to consummate the \n     exchange consistent with this title. The lands identified in \n     the exchange agreement shall be exchanged by conveyance at \n     the earliest possible date after the exchange agreement is \n     signed. Subject only to conveyance from Cape Fox to the \n     United States of all its rights, title and interests in the \n     Cape Fox lands included in the exchange consistent with this \n     title, the Secretary of the Interior shall complete the \n     interim conveyance to Cape Fox of the federal lands included \n     in the exchange within 180 days after the execution of the \n     exchange agreement by Cape Fox and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture.\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\n     SEC. 106.

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans cherish the continued existence of diverse \n     wilderness ecosystems and wildlife found on their Federal \n     lands and share a strong sense of moral responsibility to \n     protect their wilderness heritage as an enduring resource to \n     cherish, protect, and bequeath undisturbed to future \n     generations of Americans.\n       ( 2) The values an area of wilderness offer to this and \n     future generations of Americans are greatly enhanced to the \n     degree that the area is diverse in topography, elevation, \n     life zones and ecosystems, and to the extent that it offers a \n     wide range of outdoor recreational and educational \n     opportunities accessible in all seasons of the year.\n       (3) Large blocks of wildlands embracing a wide range of \n     ecosystems and topography, including low-elevation forests, \n     have seldom remained undisturbed due to many decades of \n     development.\n       (4) Certain wildlands on the western slope of the Cascade \n     Range in the Skykomish River valley of the State of \n     Washington offer an outstanding representation of the \n     original character of the forested landscape, ranging from \n     high alpine meadows and extremely rugged peaks to low-\n     elevation mature and old-growth forests, including \n     groves with some of the largest and most spectacular trees \n     in Washington, with diameters of eight feet and larger.\n       (5) These diverse, thickly forested mountain slopes and \n     valleys of mature and old-growth trees in the Skykomish River \n     valley harbor nearly the full complement of the original \n     wildlife and fish species found by settlers of the 19th \n     century, including mountain goats, bald eagles, black bear, \n     pine marten, black-tailed deer, as well as rare and \n     endangered wildlife such as northern spotted owls and \n     goshawks, Chinook and Coho salmon, and steelhead and bull \n     trout.\n       (6) An ecologically and topographically diverse wilderness \n     area in the Skykomish River valley accessible in all seasons \n     of the year will be enjoyable to users of various kinds, such \n     as hikers, horse riders, hunters, anglers, and educational \n     groups, but also to the many who cherish clean water and \n     clean air, fish and wildlife (including endangered species \n     such as wild salmon), and pristine mountain and riverside \n     scenery.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress hereby declares that it \n     is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to better serve the diverse wilderness and \n     environmental education needs of the people of the State of \n     Washington and its burgeoning metropolitan regions by \n     granting wilderness protection to certain lower elevation \n     wildlands in the Skykomish River valley of the State of \n     Washington; and\n       (2) to protect additional lands adjacent to the Henry M. \n     Jackson Wilderness designated by the Washington Wilderness \n     Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-339), in further tribute to the \n     ecologically enlightened vision of the distinguished Senator \n     from the State of Washington and former Chairman of the \n     Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (formerly \n     the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee).\n\n     SEC. 503.

Such actions \n     are not subject to the Pueblo's right to withhold consent to \n     new uses in the Area as set forth in section 705(a)(3)(i).\n       (c) Disputes Involving Forest Service Management and Pueblo \n     Traditional Uses.--\n       (1) General.--In the event that Forest Service management \n     of the Area and Pueblo traditional and cultural uses \n     conflict, and the conflict does not pertain to new or \n     modified uses subject to the process set forth in subsection \n     (a), the process for dispute resolution set forth in this \n     subsection shall take effect.\n       (2) Dispute resolution process.--(A) When there is a \n     dispute between the Pueblo and the Forest Service regarding \n     Pueblo traditional and cultural use and Forest Service \n     management of the Area, the party identifying the dispute \n     shall notify the other party in writing addressed to the \n     Governor of the Pueblo or the Regional Forester respectively, \n     setting forth the nature of the dispute.

If the parties are unable to resolve the \n     dispute within 3 days, either party may file an action for \n     immediate relief in the United States District Court for the \n     District of New Mexico, and the procedural exhaustion \n     requirements set forth above shall not apply.\n\n     SEC. 708.

To the extent \n     that enlargement of existing utility corridors is required \n     for any technologically-advanced telecommunication, \n     television, or utility services, the Pueblo shall not \n     unreasonably withhold agreement to a reasonable enlargement \n     of the easements described above.\n       (i) Forest Service Rights of Way.--In accordance with the \n     Pueblo having given its consent in the Settlement Agreement, \n     the Secretary of the Interior shall grant to the Forest \n     Service the following irrevocable rights-of-way in perpetuity \n     for Forest Service trails crossing land of the Pueblo in \n     order to provide for public access to the Area and through \n     Pueblo lands:\n       (1) a right-of-way for a portion of the Crest Spur Trail \n     (Trail No. 84), crossing a portion of the La Luz tract, as \n     identified on the map;\n       (2) a right-of-way for the extension of the Foothills Trail \n     (Trail No. 365A), as identified on the map; and\n       (3) a right-of-way for that portion of the Piedra Lisa \n     North-South Trail (Trail No. 135) crossing the Piedra Lisa \n     tract, if the Pueblo ever acquires the Piedra Lisa tract.\n\n     SEC. 710.

If the land exchange \n     offer is not made within 180 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the United States House of \n     Representatives, a report explaining the reasons for the \n     failure to make the offer including an assessment of the need \n     for any additional legislation that may be necessary for the \n     exchange. If additional legislation is not necessary, the \n     Secretary, consistent with this section, should proceed with \n     the exchange pursuant to existing law.\n       (d) Land Acquisition.--(1) The Secretary is authorized to \n     acquire lands owned by the Pueblo within the Evergreen Hills \n     Subdivision in Sandoval County or any other privately held \n     lands inside of the exterior boundaries of the Area.

No. 94-2624 HHG (D.D.C.), or other proceedings directly \n     related to resolving the issues litigated in that case, may \n     apply for reimbursement in accordance with this section. \n     Costs directly related to such participation which shall \n     qualify for reimbursement shall be--\n       (A) dues or payments to a homeowner association for the \n     purpose of legal representation; and\n       (B) legal fees and related expenses.\n       (2) The reimbursement provided in this subsection shall be \n     in lieu of that which might otherwise be available pursuant \n     to the Equal Access to Justice Act (24 U.S.C. 2412).\n       (3) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and \n     directed to make reimbursement payments as provided in this \n     section out of any money not otherwise appropriated.\n       (4) Applications for reimbursement shall be filed within \n     180 days of the date of enactment of this Act with the \n     Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, \n     Washington, D.C.\n       (5) In no event shall any one party be compensated in \n     excess of $750,000 and the total amount reimbursed pursuant \n     to this section shall not exceed $3,000,000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11618-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. CLELAND.

IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEDERAL LAND MANAGERS \n                   AND GATEWAY COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT COMPATIBLE \n                   LAND MANAGEMENT OF BOTH FEDERAL AND ADJACENT \n                   LANDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\n       (1) Communities that are adjacent to or near Federal lands, \n     including units of the National Park System, units of the \n     National Wildlife Refuge System, units of the National Forest \n     System, and lands administered by the Bureau of Land \n     Management, are vitally impacted by the management and public \n     use of these Federal lands.\n       (2) These communities, commonly known as gateway \n     communities, fulfill an integral part in the mission of the \n     Federal lands by providing necessary services, such as \n     schools, roads, search and rescue, emergency, medical, \n     provisioning, logistical support, living quarters, and \n     drinking water and sanitary systems, for both visitors to the \n     Federal lands and employees of Federal land management \n     agencies.\n       (3) Provision of these vital services by gateway \n     communities is an essential ingredient for a meaningful and \n     enjoyable experience by visitors to the Federal lands because \n     Federal land management agencies are unable to provide, or \n     are prevented from providing, these services.\n       (4) Gateway communities serve as an entry point for persons \n     who visit the Federal lands and are ideal for establishment \n     of visitor services, including lodging, food service, fuel \n     and auto repairs, emergency services, and visitor \n     information.\n       (5) Development in these gateway communities affect the \n     management and protection of these Federal lands, depending \n     on the extent to which advance planning for the local \n     development is coordinated between the communities and \n     Federal land managers.\n       (6) The planning and management decisions of Federal land \n     managers can have unintended consequences for gateway \n     communities and the Federal lands, when the decisions are not \n     adequately communicated to, or coordinated with, the elected \n     officials and residents of gateway communities.\n       (7) Experts in land management planning are available to \n     Federal land managers, but persons with technical planning \n     skills are often not readily available to gateway \n     communities, particularly small gateway communities.\n       (8) Gateway communities are often affected by the policies \n     and actions of several Federal land agencies and both the \n     communities and the agencies would benefit from greater \n     interagency coordination of those policies and actions.\n       (9) Persuading gateway communities to make decisions and \n     undertake actions in their communities that would also be in \n     the best interest of the Federal lands is most likely to \n     occur when such decisionmaking and actions are built upon a \n     foundation of cooperation and coordination.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to require \n     Federal land managers to communicate, coordinate, and \n     cooperate with gateway communities in order to--\n       (1) improve the relationships among Federal land managers, \n     elected officials, and residents of gateway communities;\n       (2) enhance the facilities and services in gateway \n     communities available to visitors to Federal lands, when \n     compatible with the management of these lands; and\n       (3) result in better local land use planning and decisions \n     by Federal land managers.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Gateway community.--The term ``gateway community'' \n     means a county, city, town, village, or other subdivision of \n     a State, or a federally recognized American Indian tribe or \n     Alaska Native village, that--\n       (A) is incorporated or recognized in a county or regional \n     land use plan; and\n       (B) a Federal land manager (or the head of the tourism \n     office for the State) determines is significantly affected \n     economically, socially, or environmentally by planning and \n     management decisions regarding Federal lands administered by \n     that Federal land manager.\n       (2) Federal land agencies.--The term ``Federal land \n     agencies'' means the National Park Service, United States \n     Forest Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and \n     the Bureau of Land Management.\n       (3) Federal land manager.--The term ``Federal land \n     manager'' means--\n       (A) the superintendent of a unit of the National Park \n     System;\n       (B) the manager of a national wildlife refuge;\n       (C) the field office manager of a Bureau of Land Management \n     area; or\n       (D) the supervisor of a unit of the National Forest System.\n       (d) Participation in Federal Planning and Land Use.--\n       (1) Participation in planning.--The Federal land agencies \n     shall provide for meaningful public involvement at the \n     earliest possible time by elected and appointed officials of \n     governments of local gateway communities in the development \n     of land use plans, programs, land use regulations, land use \n     decisions, transportation plans, general management plans, \n     and any other plans, decisions, projects, or policies for \n     Federal public lands under the jurisdiction of these agencies \n     that will have a significant impact on these gateway \n     communities. To facilitate such involvement, the Federal land \n     agencies shall provide these officials, at the earliest \n     possible time, with a summary in nontechnical language of the \n     assumptions, purposes, goals, and objectives of such a plan, \n     decision, project, or policy and a description of any \n     anticipated significant impact of the plan, decision, or \n     policy on gateway communities.\n       (2) Early notice of proposed decisions.--To the extent \n     practicable, the Federal land agencies shall provide local \n     gateway communities with early public notice of proposed \n     decisions of these agencies that may have a significant \n     impact on gateway communities.\n       (3) Training sessions.--The Federal land agencies shall \n     offer training sessions for elected and appointed officials \n     of gateway communities at which such officials can obtain a \n     better understanding of--\n       (A) agency planning processes; and\n       (B) the methods by which they can participate most \n     meaningfully in the development of the agency plans, \n     decisions, and policies referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (4) Technical assistance.--At the request of the government \n     of a gateway community, a Federal land agency shall assign, \n     to the extent practicable, an agency employee or contractor \n     to work with the community to develop data and analysis \n     relevant to the preparation of agency plans, decisions, and \n     policies referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (5) Review of federal land management planning.--At the \n     request of a gateway community, and to the extent \n     practicable, a Federal land manager shall assist the gateway \n     community to conduct a review of land use, management, or \n     transportation plans of the Federal land manager likely to \n     affect the gateway community.\n       (6) Coordination of land use.--To the extent consistent \n     with the laws governing the administration of the Federal \n     public lands, a Federal land manager may enter into a \n     cooperative agreement with a gateway community to provide for \n     coordination between--\n       (A) the land use inventory, planning, and management \n     activities for the Federal lands administered by the Federal \n     land manager; and\n       (B) the land use planning and management activities of \n     other Federal agencies, agencies of the State in which the \n     Federal lands are located, and local and tribal governments \n     in the vicinity of the Federal lands.\n       (7) Interagency cooperation and coordination.--To the \n     extent practicable, when the plans and activities of two or \n     more Federal land agencies are anticipated to have a \n     significant impact on a gateway community, the Federal land \n     agencies involved shall consolidate and coordinate their \n     plans and planning processes to facilitate the participation \n     of the gateway community in the planning processes.\n       (8) Treatment as cooperating agencies.--When a proposed \n     action is determined to require the preparation of an \n     environmental impact statement, the Federal land agencies \n     shall, as soon as practicable, but not later than the scoping \n     process, actively solicit the participation of gateway \n     communities as cooperating agencies under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (e) Grants To Assist Gateway Communities.--\n       (1) Grants authorized;

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II on February 19, 1942, President \n     Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, \n     setting in motion the forced exile of more than 110,000 \n     Japanese Americans.\n       (2) In Washington State, 12,892 men, women and children of \n     Japanese ancestry experienced three years of incarceration, \n     an incarceration violating the most basic freedoms of \n     American citizens.\n       (3) On March 30, 1942, 227 Bainbridge Island residents were \n     the first Japanese Americans in United States history to be \n     forcibly removed from their homes by the U.S. Army and sent \n     to internment camps. They boarded the ferry Kehloken from the \n     former Eagledale Ferry Dock, located at the end of Taylor \n     Avenue, in the city of Bainbridge Island, Washington State.\n       (4) The city of Bainbridge Island has adopted a resolution \n     stating that this site should be a National Memorial, and \n     similar resolutions have been introduced in the Washington \n     State Legislature.\n       (5) Both the Minidoka National Monument and Manzanar \n     National Historic Site can clearly tell the story of a time \n     in our Nation's history when constitutional rights were \n     ignored. These camps by design were placed in very remote \n     places and are not easily accessible. Bainbridge Island is a \n     short ferry ride from Seattle and the site would be within \n     easy reach of many more people.\n       (6) This is a unique opportunity to create a site that will \n     honor those who suffered, cherish the friends and community \n     who stood beside them and welcomed them home, and inspire all \n     to stand firm in the event our Nation again succumbs to \n     similar fears.\n       (7) The site should be recognized by the National Park \n     Service based on its high degree of national significance, \n     association with significant events, and integrity of its \n     location and setting. This site is critical as an anchor for \n     future efforts to identify, interpret, serve, and ultimately \n     honor the Nikkei- persons of Japanese ancestry- influence on \n     Bainbridge Island.\n\n     SEC. 402.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wildfire Prevention Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is an increasing threat of wildfire to millions \n     of acres of forest land and rangeland throughout the United \n     States;\n       (2) forest land and rangeland are degraded as a direct \n     consequence of land management practices (including practices \n     to control and prevent wildfires and the failure to harvest \n     subdominant trees from overstocked stands) that disrupt the \n     occurrence of frequent low-intensity fires that have \n     periodically removed flammable undergrowth;\n       (3) at least 39,000,000 acres of land of the National \n     Forest System in the interior West are at high risk of \n     wildfire;\n       (4) an average of 95 percent of the expenditures by the \n     Forest Service for wildfire suppression during fiscal years \n     1990 through 1994 were made to suppress wildfires in the \n     interior West;\n       (5) the number, size, and severity of wildfires in the \n     interior West are increasing;\n       (6) of the timberland in National Forests in the States of \n     Arizona and New Mexico, 59 percent of such land in Arizona, \n     and 56 percent of such land in New Mexico, has an average \n     diameter of 9 to 12 inches diameter at breast height;\n       (7) the population of the interior West grew twice as fast \n     as the national average during the 1990s;\n       (8) efforts to prioritize forests and communities for \n     wildfire risk reduction have been inconsistent and \n     insufficient and have resulted in funding to areas that are \n     not prone to severe wildfires;\n       (9) catastrophic wildfires--\n       (A) endanger homes and communities;\n       (B) damage and destroy watersheds and soils; and\n       (C) pose a serious threat to the habitat of threatened and \n     endangered species;\n       (10) a 1994 assessment of forest health in the interior \n     West estimated that only a 15- to 30-year window of \n     opportunity exists for effective management intervention \n     before damage from uncontrollable wildfire becomes \n     widespread, with 8 years having already elapsed since the \n     assessment;\n       (11) following a catastrophic wildfire, certain forests in \n     the interior West do not return to their former grandeur;\n       (12) healthy forest and woodland ecosystems--\n       (A) reduce the risk of wildfire to forests and communities;\n       (B) improve wildlife habitat and biodiversity;\n       (C) increase tree, grass, forb, and shrub productivity;\n       (D) enhance watershed values;\n       (E) improve the environment; and\n       (F) provide a basis in some areas for economically and \n     environmentally sustainable uses;\n       (13) sustaining the long-term ecological and economic \n     health of interior West forests and woodland, and their \n     dependent human communities, requires preventing severe \n     wildfires before the wildfires occur and permitting natural, \n     low-intensity ground fires;\n       (14) more natural fire regimes cannot be accomplished \n     without the reduction of excess fuels and thinning of \n     subdorminant trees (which fuels and trees may be of \n     commercial value);\n       (15) ecologically-based forest and woodland ecosystem \n     restoration on a landscape scale will--\n       (A) improve long-term community protection;\n       (B) minimize the need for wildfire suppression;\n       (C) improve resource values;\n       (D) reduce rehabilitation costs;\n       (E) reduce loss of critical habitat; and\n       (F) protect forests for future generations;\n       (16) although the National Fire Plan, and the report \n     entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining Resources in \n     Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' (65 Fed. Reg. \n     67480), advocate a shift in wildfire policy from suppression \n     to prevention (including restoration and hazardous fuels \n     reduction), Federal land managers are not dedicating \n     sufficient attention and financial resources to restoration \n     activities that simultaneously restore forest health and \n     reduce the risk of severe wildfire;\n       (17) although landscape scale restoration is needed to \n     effectively reverse degradation, scientific understanding of \n     landscape scale treatments is limited;\n       (18) the Federal wildfire research program is funded at \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of the amount that is required to address \n     emerging wildfire problems, resulting in the lack of a \n     cohesive strategy to address the threat of catastrophic \n     wildfires; and\n       (19) rigorous, understandable, and applied scientific \n     information is needed for--\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\n       (A) the design, implementation, and adaptation of landscape \n     scale restoration treatments and improvement of wildfire \n     management technology;\n       (B) the environmental review process; and\n       (C) affected entities that collaborate in the development \n     and implementation of wildfire treatment.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enhance the capacity to develop, transfer, apply, \n     and monitor practical science-based forest restoration \n     treatments that will reduce the risk of severe wildfires, and \n     improve forest and woodland health, in the interior West;\n       (2) to develop the practical scientific knowledge required \n     to implement forest and woodland restoration on a landscape \n     scale;\n       (3) to develop the interdisciplinary knowledge required to \n     understand the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of \n     wildfire control on ecosystems and landscapes;\n       (4) to require Federal agencies--\n       (A) to use ecological restoration treatments to reverse \n     declining forest health and reduce the risk of severe \n     wildfires across the forest landscape;\n       (B) to ensure that sufficient funds are dedicated to \n     wildlife prevention activities, including restoration \n     treatments; and\n       (C) to monitor and use wildfire treatments based on the use \n     of adaptive ecosystem management;\n       (5) to develop, transfer, and assist land managers in \n     treating acres with restoration-based treatments and use new \n     management technologies (including the transfer of \n     understandable information, assistance with environmental \n     review, and field and classroom training and collaboration) \n     to accomplish the goals identified in--\n       (A) the National Fire Plan;\n       (B) the report entitled ``Protecting People and Sustaining \n     Resources in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems--A Cohesive Strategy'' \n     (65 Fed.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 599, S. 2222.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2222) to resolve certain conveyances and provide \n     for alternative land selections under the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act related to Cape Fox Corporation and \n     Sealaska Corporation, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and \ninsert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n                                S. 2222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     [SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress finds and declares that:\n       [(1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n     Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act, as amended, (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601, \n     et seq.) for the Native Village of Saxman.\n       [(2) As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast \n     Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under \n     section 16 of ANCSA.\n       [(3) Except for Cape Fox, all other Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n     village corporations were restricted from selecting within \n     two miles of a home rule city.\n       [(4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of \n     Ketchikan, Cape Fox was restricted from selecting lands \n     within six miles from the boundary of the home rule City of \n     Ketchikan under section 22(l) of ANCSA.\n       [(5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by \n     precluding the corporation from selecting valuable timber \n     lands, industrial sites, and other commercial property, not \n     only in its core township but in surrounding lands far \n     removed from Ketchikan and its watershed.\n       [(6) As a result of the six mile restriction, only the \n     remote mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core \n     township, which is nonproductive and of no economic value, \n     was available for selection by the corporation. Selection of \n     this parcel was, however, mandated by section 16(b) of ANCSA.\n       [(7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n     fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n     selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA \n     selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation \n     affected by this restriction.\n       [(8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA requires adjustment of Sealaska \n     Corporation's (Sealaska) selections and conveyances to avoid \n     creation of split estate between national forest surface and \n     Sealaska subsurface lands.\n       [(9) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n     of Sealaska/Tongass National Forest split estate.\n       [(10) The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this \n     Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n     subject to valid existing rights, provide a means to resolve \n     certain Cape Fox and Sealaska ANCSA land entitlement issues \n     without significantly affecting Tongass National Forest \n     resources, uses or values.\n       [(11) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances \n     of land under ANCSA through the provisions of this Act, and \n     the related adjustment of Sealaska's selections and \n     conveyances hereunder, are in accordance with the purposes of \n     ANCSA and otherwise in the public interest.\n\n     [SEC. 2. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       [This Act may be cited as the ``Cape Fox Land Entitlement \n     Adjustment Act of 2002''.\n\n     [SEC. 3. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN NON-\n                   PRODUCTIVE LANDS.\n\n       [Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16(b) of ANCSA, \n     Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) shall not be required to \n     select or receive conveyance of approximately 160 \n     nonproductive acres, more particularly described as within \n     the following described lands:\n       [T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M., section 1.\n\n     [SEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n     Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for \n     the Native Village of Saxman.\n       (2) As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast \n     Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under \n     section 16 of ANCSA.\n       (3) Except for Cape Fox, all other Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n     village corporations were restricted from selecting within \n     two miles of a home rule city.\n       (4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of Ketchikan, \n     Cape Fox was restricted from selecting lands within six miles \n     from the boundary of the home rule City of Ketchikan under \n     section 22(1) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1621(1)).\n       (5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by precluding \n     the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, \n     industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in \n     its core township but in surrounding lands far removed from \n     Ketchikan and its watershed.\n       (6) As a result of the six mile restriction, only the \n     remote mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core \n     township, which is nonproductive and of no known economic \n     value, was available for selection by the corporation. \n     Selection of this parcel was, however, mandated by section \n     16(b) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)).\n       (7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n     fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n     selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA \n     selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation \n     affected by this restriction.\n       (8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA requires adjustment of Sealaska \n     Corporation's (Sealaska) selections and conveyances to avoid \n     creation of additional split estate between National Forest \n     System surface lands and Sealaska subsurface lands.\n       (9) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n     of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, in which Sealaska holds \n     title or conveyance rights to several thousand acres of \n     subsurface lands that encumber management of Tongass National \n     Forest surface lands.\n       (10) The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this \n     Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n     subject to valid existing rights, provide a means to resolve \n     some of the Cape Fox and Sealaska ANCSA land entitlement \n     issues without significantly affecting Tongass National \n     Forest resources, uses or values.\n       (11) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA through the provisions of this Act, and the \n     related adjustment of Sealaska's selections and conveyances \n     hereunder, are in accordance with the purposes of ANCSA and \n     otherwise in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 3. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   LANDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16(b) of ANCSA \n     (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to select \n     or receive conveyance of approximately 160 acres of federal \n     unconveyed lands within Section 1, T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M.\n\n     SEC. 4. SELECTION OUTSIDE EXTERIOR SELECTION BOUNDARY.\n\n       (a) Selection and Conveyance of Surface Estate.--In \n     addition to lands made available for selection under ANCSA, \n     within 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     Cape Fox may select, and, upon receiving written notice of \n     such selection, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey \n     approximately 99 acres of the surface estate of Tongass \n     National Forest lands outside Cape Fox's current exterior \n     selection boundary, specifically that parcel described as \n     follows:\n       (1) T. 73 S., R. 90 E., C.R.M.\n       (2) Section 33: SW portion of SE \\1/4\\: 38 acres.\n       (3) Section 33: NW portion of SE \\1/4\\: 13 acres.\n       (4) Section 33: SE \\1/4\\ of SE \\1/4\\: 40 acres.\n       (5) Section 33: SE \\1/4\\ of SW \\1/4\\: 8 acres.\n       (b) Conveyance of Subsurface Estate.--Upon conveyance to \n     Cape Fox of the surface estate to the lands identified in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to \n     Sealaska the subsurface estate to the lands.\n       (c) Timing.--The Secretary of the Interior shall complete \n     the interim conveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this \n     section within 180 days after the Secretary of the Interior \n     receives notice of the Cape Fox selection under subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN CAPE FOX AND THE TONGASS \n                   NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n       (a) General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall offer, and \n     if accepted by Cape Fox, shall exchange the federal lands \n     described in subsection (b) for lands and interests therein \n     identified by Cape Fox under subsection (c) and, to the \n     extent necessary, lands and interests therein identified \n     under subsection (d).\n       (b) Lands To Be Exchanged to Cape Fox.--The lands to be \n     offered for exchange by the Secretary of Agriculture are \n     Tongass National Forest lands comprising approximately \n     2,663.9 acres in T. 36 S., R. 62 E., C.R.M. and T. 35 S., R. \n     62 E., C.R.M., as designated upon a map entitled ``Proposed \n     Kensington Project Land Exchange,'' dated March 18, 2002, and \n     available for inspection in the Forest Service Region 10 \n     regional office in Juneau, Alaska.\n       (c) Lands To Be Exchanged to the United States.--Cape Fox \n     shall be entitled, within 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, to identify in writing to the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and the Interior the lands and interests in lands \n     that Cape Fox proposes to exchange for the federal lands \n     described in subsection (b). The lands and interests in lands \n     shall be identified from lands previously conveyed to Cape \n     Fox comprising approximately 2,900 acres and designated as \n     parcels A-1 to A-3, B-1 to B-3, and C upon a map entitled \n     ``Cape Fox Corporation ANCSA Land Exchange Proposal,'' dated \n     March 15, 2002, and available for inspection in the Forest \n     Service Region 10 regional office in Juneau, Alaska. Lands \n     identified for exchange within each parcel shall be \n     contiguous to adjacent National Forest System lands and in \n     reasonably compact tracts. The lands identified for exchange \n     shall include a public trail easement designated as D on said \n     map, unless the Secretary of Agriculture agrees otherwise. \n     The value of the easement shall be included in determining \n     the total value of lands exchanged to the United States.\n       (d) Valuation of Exchange Lands.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall determine whether the lands identified by \n     Cape Fox under subsection (c) are equal in value to the lands \n     described in subsection (b). If the lands identified under \n     subsection (c) are determined to have insufficient value to \n     equal the value of the lands described in subsection (b), \n     Cape Fox and the Secretary shall mutually identify additional \n     Cape Fox lands for exchange sufficient to equalize the value \n     of lands conveyed to Cape Fox. \n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\n     Such land shall be contiguous to adjacent National Forest \n     System lands and in reasonably compact tracts.\n       (e) Conditions.--The offer and conveyance of Federal lands \n     to Cape Fox in the exchange shall, notwithstanding section \n     14(f) of ANCSA, be of the surface and subsurface estate, but \n     subject to valid existing rights and all other provisions of \n     section 14(g) of ANCSA.\n       (f) Timing.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall attempt, \n     within 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     enter into an agreement with Cape Fox to consummate the \n     exchange consistent with this Act.

Subject only to conveyance from Cape Fox to the \n     United States of all its rights, title and interests in the \n     Cape Fox lands included in the exchange consistent with this \n     Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall complete the interim \n     conveyance to Cape Fox of the federal lands included in the \n     exchange within 180 days after the execution of the exchange \n     agreement by Cape Fox and the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n     SEC. 6. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN SEALASKA AND THE TONGASS \n                   NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n       (a) General.--Upon conveyance of the Cape Fox lands \n     included in the exchange under section 5 and conveyance and \n     relinquishment by Sealaska in accordance with this Act of the \n     lands and interests in lands described in subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of the Interior shall convey to Sealaska the \n     federal lands identified for exchange under subsection (b).\n       (b) Lands To Be Exchanged to Sealaska.--The lands to be \n     exchanged to Sealaska are to be selected by Sealaska from \n     Tongass National Forest lands comprising approximately 9,329 \n     acres in T. 36 S., R. 62 E., C.R.M., T. 35 S., R. 62 E., \n     C.R.M., and T. 34 S., Range 62 E., C.R.M., as designated upon \n     a map entitled ``Proposed Sealaska Corporation Land Exchange \n     Kensington Lands Selection Area,'' dated April 2002 and \n     available for inspection in the Forest Service Region 10 \n     Regional Office in Juneau, Alaska.

This program is of tremendous \nimportance to my home State of California. Its mission is to develop \nand implement a long-term comprehensive plan that will improve water \nmanagement for the Bay-Delta and restore its ecological health. The \nprogram has several goals: improving water supply reliability, \nincluding additional water storage and conveyance; protecting drinking \nwater quality; restoring ecological health; and protecting Delta \nlevees.\n  Mr. President, on August 28, 2000, the Federal Government and the \nState of California entered into a Record of Decision (ROD) which \nselects a preferred program alternative for the Calfed Bay-Delta \nProgram, setting forth the overall direction of this program. Under the \nROD, the Calfed agencies (comprised of both Federal and State agencies) \nwill proceed with the specific actions in Stage 1, which covers the \nfirst 7 years of this program. This legislation authorizes those Stage \n1 actions which are to take place in fiscal years 2003 through 2005 for \nwhich there are appropriations. A fundamental tenet of this program is \nthat all program elements proceed in a balanced manner. The Record of \nDecision explicitly requires balance in carrying out the program.\n  While the provision that the Senate is considering today is scaled \nback from the bills that I have previously introduced on this matter, \nthe intent of the legislation is the same: to provide that the Calfed \nProgram be carried out in a balanced manner consistent with the Record \nof Decision of August 28, 2000, including the principles and schedules \nstated therein, and other applicable law. I want to clarify that this \nprovision in no way affects or modifies any other authority that an \nagency has to carry out activities related to, or in furtherance of, \nthe Calfed Program.\n  Finally, this legislation would provide authority to the Secretary of \nthe Interior and the other Federal agency heads identified in the ROD \nto participate in the Calfed Bay-Delta Authority established by the \nCalifornia Bay-Delta Authority Act, to the extent not inconsistent with \nother law.\n  Mr. President, early next Congress, Senator Kyl and I plan to \nintroduce additional Calfed authorizing legislation on which we have \ncollaborated that would provide greater specificity. I thank Senator \nKyl for his willingness to work with me on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is favorably considering \nthis legislation today. The Calfed Bay-Delta Program enjoys broad-based \nsupport in California and is vital to the future of the State.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased today that the Senate is \npassing legislation to authorize the Secretary of the Interior and \nother Federal agency heads to participate in the implementation of the \nCALFED Bay-Delta Program.\n  For decades, water allocation in California was conducted through \nendless appeals, lawsuits, and divisive ballot initiatives. Such \nbattles were painful and they prevented us from finding real solutions \nto our state's very real water problems. In 1994, a new state-federal \npartnership program called CALFED promised a better way. Through a plan \nto provide reliable, clean water to farms, businesses, and millions of \nCalifornians while at the same time restoring our fish, wildlife and \nenvironment, CALFED was committed to identifying a solution that all \nwater users could share.\n  Over the years, what has made CALFED work is that it employs a \nconsensus approach that balances the needs of the various interests \ncompeting for California's scarce water resources. This balance is most \nclearly articulated in the Record of Decision (ROD) that was agreed to \non August 28, 2000 by the Federal Government and the State of \nCalifornia. The CALFED ROD outlines clearly the CALFED Bay-Delta \nPrograms' goals and repeatedly reiterates the need to move forward with \nthese goals in a balanced manner.\n  This legislation authorizes the federal agencies to undertake the \nactions and activities identified in the ROD. It is our intent that all \nactivities are to be implemented in a manner consistent with the ROD. \nThis legislation is not intended to authorize activities, such as major \nconstruction projects, that would otherwise require completion of \nfeasibility studies, permits under section 404(a) of the Clean Water \nAct and other applicable laws, and project-specific authorizations. In \naddition, the legislation requires that federal participation in the \nCALFED Bay-Delta Program proceed in a way that is consistent with other \nlaws.\n  I want to particularly thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for her \ncontinued leadership on this legislation. This bill will help insure \nthat the CALFED Bay-Delta Program continues to play a vital role in \nmeeting California's water needs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4978\n\n  Mr. REID. Senator Bingaman has a substitute at the desk.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the University of Alaska is the successor to and the \n     beneficiary of all Federal grants and conveyances to or for \n     the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines;\n       (2) under the Acts of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1214, and \n     January 21, 1929, 45 Stat. 1091, the United States granted to \n     the Territory of Alaska certain Federal lands for the \n     University of Alaska;\n       (3) the Territory did not receive most of the land intended \n     to be conveyed by the Act of March 4, 1915, before repeal of \n     that Act by section 6(k) of the Alaska Statehood Act (Public \n     Law 85-508, 72 Stat. 339);\n       (4) only one other State land grant college in the United \n     States has obtained a smaller land grant from the Federal \n     Government\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\n     than has the University of Alaska, and all land grant \n     colleges in the western States of the United States have \n     obtained substantially larger land grants than has the \n     University of Alaska;\n       (5) an academically strong and financially secure state \n     university system is a cornerstone to the long-term \n     development of a stable population and to a healthy, diverse \n     economy and is in the national interest;\n       (6) the Federal Government now desires to acquire certain \n     lands for addendum to various conservation units;\n       (7) the national interest is served by transferring certain \n     Federal lands to the University of Alaska which will be able \n     to use and develop the resources of such lands and by \n     returning certain lands held by the University of Alaska \n     located within certain Federal conservation system units to \n     Federal ownership; and\n       (8) the University of Alaska holds valid legal title to and \n     is responsible for management of lands transferred by the \n     United States to the Territory and State of Alaska for the \n     University and an exchange of lands for lands that are \n     capable of producing revenues to support the education \n     objectives of the original grants is consistent with and in \n     furtherance of the purposes and terms of, and thus not in \n     violation of, the Federal grant of such lands.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to fulfill the original commitment of Congress to \n     establish the University of Alaska as a land grant university \n     with holdings sufficient to facilitate operation and \n     maintenance of a university system for the inhabitants of the \n     State of Alaska; and\n       (2) to acquire from the University of Alaska lands it holds \n     within Federal parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas \n     to further the purposes for which those areas were \n     established.\n\n     SEC. 2. LAND GRANT.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject \n     to valid existing rights, the University of Alaska \n     (``University'') is entitled to select up to 250,000 acres of \n     Federal lands or interests in lands in or adjacent to Alaska \n     as a land grant. The Secretary of the Interior \n     (``Secretary'') shall promptly convey to the University the \n     Federal lands selected and approved in accordance with the \n     provisions of this Act.\n       (b)(1) Within forty-eight (48) months of the enactment of \n     this Act, the University of Alaska may submit to the \n     Secretary a description of lands or interests in lands for \n     conveyance. The initial selection may be less than or exceed \n     250,000 acres and the University may add or delete lands or \n     interests in lands, or until 250,000 patented acres have been \n     conveyed pursuant to this Act, except that the total of land \n     selected and conveyed shall not exceed 275,000 areas at any \n     time.\n       (2) The University may select lands validly selected but \n     not conveyed to the State of Alaska or to a Native \n     Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), except that these lands or \n     interests in lands may not be approved or convey to the \n     University unless the State of Alaska or the Native \n     Corporation relinquishes its selection in writing.\n       (3) The University may not make selections within a \n     conversation system unit, as defined in the Alaska National \n     Interest Lands Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 3101), or in the \n     Tongass National Forest except within lands classified as LUD \n     III or LUD IV by the United States Forest Service and limited \n     to areas of second growth timber where timber harvest \n     occurred after January 1, 1952.\n       (4) The University may make selections within the National \n     Petroleum Reserve--Alaska (``NPRA''), except that--\n       (A) no selection may be made within an area withdrawn for \n     village selection pursuant to section 11(a) of the Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act for the Native villages of \n     Atkasook, Barrow, Nuiqsit and Wainwright;\n       (B) no selection may be made in the Teshekpuk Lake Special \n     Management Area as depicted on a map that is included in the \n     final environmental impact statement for the Northeast NPRA \n     dated October 7, 1998; and\n       (C) No selections may be made within those portions of NPRA \n     north of latitude 69 degrees North in excess of 92,000 acres \n     and no selection may be made within such area during the two \n     year period extending from the date of enactment of this Act. \n     The Secretary shall attempt to conclude an agreement with the \n     University of Alaska and the State of Alaska providing for \n     sharing NPRA leasing revenues within the two year period. If \n     the Secretary concludes such an agreement, the Secretary \n     shall transmit it to the Congress, and no selection may be \n     made within such area during the three year period extending \n     from the date of enactment of this Act. If legislation has \n     not been enacted within three years of the date of enactment \n     of this Act approving the agreement, the University of Alaska \n     may make selections within such area. An agreement shall \n     provide for the University of Alaska to receive a portion of \n     annual revenues from mineral leases within NPRA in lieu of \n     any lands selections within NPRA north of latitude 69 degrees \n     North, but not to exceed ten percent of such revenues or \n     $9 million annually, whichever is less.\n       (5) Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a selection, \n     the Secretary shall publish notice of the selection in the \n     Federal Register. The notice shall identify the lands or \n     interest in lands included in the selection and provide for a \n     period for public comment not to exceed sixty (60) days.\n       (6) Within six months of the receipt of such a selection, \n     the Secretary shall accept or reject the selection and shall \n     promptly notify the University of his decision, including the \n     reasons for any rejection. A selection that is not rejected \n     within six months of notification to the Secretary is deemed \n     approved.\n       (7) The Secretary may reject a selection if the Secretary \n     finds that the selection would have a significant adverse \n     impact on the ability of the Secretary to comply with the \n     land entitlement provisions of the Alaska Statehood Act or \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601) or \n     if the Secretary finds that the selection would have a \n     direct, significant and irreversible adverse effect on a \n     conservation system unit as defined in the Alaska National \n     Interest Conservation Act.\n       (8) The Secretary shall promptly publish notice of an \n     acceptance or rejection of a selection in the Federal \n     Register.\n       (9) An action taken pursuant to this Act is not a major \n     Federal action within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of \n     Public Law 91-190 (83 Stat. 852, 853).\n       (c) The University may not select Federal lands or \n     interests in lands reserved for military purposes or reserved \n     for the administration of a Federal agency, unless the \n     Secretary of Defense or the head of the affected agency \n     agrees to relinquish the lands or interest in lands.\n       (d) The University may select additional lands or interest \n     in lands to replace lands rejected by the Secretary.\n       (e) Lands or interests in lands shall be segregated and \n     unavailable for selection by and conveyance to the State of \n     Alaska or a Native Corporation and shall not be otherwise \n     encumbered or disposed of by the United States pending \n     completion of the selection process.\n       (f) The University may enter selected lands on a non-\n     exclusive basis to assess the oil, gas, mineral and other \n     resource potential therein and to exercise due diligence \n     regarding making a final selection. The University, and its \n     delegates or agents, shall be permitted to engage in \n     assessment techniques including, but not limited to, core \n     drilling to assess the metalliferous or other values, and \n     surface geological exploration and seismic exploration for \n     oil and gas, except that exploratory drilling of oil and gas \n     wells shall not be permitted.\n       (g) Within one year of the Secretary's approval of a \n     selection, the University may make a final decision whether \n     to accept these lands or interests in lands and shall notify \n     the Secretary of its decision. The Secretary shall publish \n     notice of any such acceptance or rejection in the Federal \n     Register within six months. If the University has decided to \n     accept the selection, effective on the date that the notice \n     of such acceptance is published, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in the described selection \n     shall vest in the University.\n       (h) Lakes, rivers and streams contained within final \n     selections shall be meandered and lands submerged thereunder \n     shall be conveyed in accordance with section 901 of the \n     Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (94 Stat. \n     2371, 2430; 43 U.S.C. 1631).\n       (i) Upon completion of a survey of lands or interest in \n     lands subject to an interim approval, the Secretary shall \n     promptly issue patent to such lands or interests in lands.\n       (j) The Secretary of Agriculture and the heads of other \n     Federal departments and agencies shall promptly take such \n     actions as may be necessary to assist the Secretary in \n     implementing this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The University shall \n     not be required to convey to the Secretary any lands other \n     than those referred to in section 3(a) of this Act. The \n     Secretary shall accept quitclaim deeds from the University \n     for these lands.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about S. \n1497, the Virgin River Dinosaur Footprint Preserve Act and its \ncompanion measure in the House, H.R. 2385. This bill would convey \ncertain property to the city of St. George, Utah, in order to provide \nfor the protection and preservation of certain rare paleontological \nresources on that property.\n  This legislation would provide vital protections to one of our \nnation's most recent, and most intact pre-Jurassic paleontological \ndiscoveries. In February 2000, Sheldon Johnson of St. George, UT, began \ndevelopment preparations on his land when he uncovered one of the \nworld's most significant collections of dinosaur tracks, tail \ndraggings, and skin imprints in the surrounding rock. Without any \nadvertising, the site has attracted many tens of thousands of visitors \nand the interest of some of the world's top paleontologists.\n  This was a fantastic discovery that has added important new insights \ninto the Jurassic period. However, now that these prints have been \nuncovered, the fragile sandstone in which the impressions have been \nmade is in jeopardy due to the heat and wind typical of the southern \nUtah climate. We must act quickly if these footprints from our past are \nto be preserved. This bill would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to purchase the land where the footprints and tail draggings \nare found and convey the property to the city of St. George. The city \nwill work together with the property owners and Washington County to \npreserve and protect the area and the resources found there.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to Sheldon and LaVerna Johnson who made \nthis discovery on their land and have dedicated thousands of hours of \ntheir personal time and much of their own money to trying to preserve \nthis site. They have done all they can to protect it, while at the same \ntime opening up their land for visitors and scientists to view the new \nfindings free of costs. They have given so much to this cause, but they \ncannot keep it up indefinitely. They desperately hope that the \nGovernment will step up and help carry the burden of managing this \nprecious resource, and with passage of this legislation tonight we will \nprovide them with the relief they deserve.\n  I thank Senators Bingaman and Murkowski, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, for \ntheir assistance in seeing this measure passed by Congress and sent to \nthe President. I also thank Representative James Hansen, my good friend \nand the sponsor of the companion measure in the House for all he has \ndone to make this legislation possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read \nthe third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (H. R. 2385), as amended, was read the third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we get to the next matter, let me \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. He has \nbeen here all night. But for him, we would not have made the progress \nwe have. All Senators should be very grateful for his weighing in on \nthese delicate matters. I appreciate what the Senator from Utah has \ndone to help us get to this point.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader. I \nwish to make it clear that without his leadership and cooperation, we \nwould not be doing what we are doing. It takes two hands to clap. We \nwere waving our hands uselessly in the air until the Senator from \nNevada stepped in. I am very grateful to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11651-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11651-S11652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TIMPANOGOS INTERAGENCY LAND EXCHANGE ACT\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend, the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, in a discussion \nregarding the Clark County Shooting Range bill, S. 1451. The chairman \nhas been very helpful in moving this important legislation through the \nprocess and I appreciate and am grateful for his hard work. As we moved \nthis bill through the committee process, the chairman made two \nconstructive suggestions regarding how my bill might be improved. I \nbelieve that it would benefit the full Senate for us to review those \nissues briefly at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I share the assistant majority leader's view that this \nbill would address an important need for a safe recreational shooting \nfacility\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nin southern Nevada and believe that S. 1451, which my committee \nreported favorably with amendment, is a good bill. The two primary \nconcerns raised by many interested parties were that the original bill \nwould have released land from wilderness study area status and that the \nparcel of land conveyed was possibly too large, and therefore the bill \nmight set an unfortunate precedent on those two issues.\n  Mr. REID. As the chairman knows, we worked together on these two \nissues and developed a compromise solution that he, Senator Murkowski, \nSenator Ensign, Congressman Gibbons, Congresswoman Berkley, Clark \nCounty and I could all support. The compromise included conveying the \nfull 2800 acres to Clark County but requiring that only the core of the \narea, 640 acres, be developed for facilities and that the remainder of \nthe area remain as open space to serve as a valuable buffer around the \nrange. This compromise if completely consistent with Clark County's \nintended use of the land because the county realizes the absolute \nnecessity of having a substantial buffer around a shooting range. In \nfact, the county provided their plans for the facility, which embody \nthe compromise.\n  As I have noted many times on the floor of the Senate, Clark County \nhas nearly doubled in population from 770,000 to more than 1.4 million \npeople since 1990. This growth has placed greater demands on public \nlands throughout Clark County for recreational activities such as \nhunting, fishing and target shooting. There are literally dozens, if \nnot hundreds, of makeshift shooting ranges across Las Vegas Valley that \npose extreme danger to nearby homes and our increasingly busy roads. \nThis facility will provide a great public benefit by creating a safe \ncentralized location for this important purpose. It will enhance public \nsafety by reducing indiscriminate shooting. The need for this shooting \nrange is crystal clear and I am grateful that the chairman has \nrecognized the urgency associated with this issue.\n  In addition, I would like the Record to reflect that the issue of \nwilderness study area release is now a moot point because the \nwilderness study area in question was released earlier this month when \nPresident Bush signed the Clark County Conservation of Public Lands and \nNatural Resources Act into law. Public law 107-282 designated about \n450,000 acres as wilderness and released 220,000 acres from wilderness \nstudy area consideration in Clark County. Having made this point, I \nwould like to ask the chairman whether he shares my view that no \nprecedent could be set on the issue of wilderness study area release \ngiven that there is no wilderness study area in existence?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do share that view and appreciate the fact that \nwilderness study area release is no longer a concern in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the chairman's concurrence on that point and \nhis leadership on this and other public land related issues very much. \nWe now face a dilemma. The very good Clark County Shooting Range bill \nthat was earlier reported by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee cannot pass this year because the House of Representatives \nhas gone home for the year. However, the House passed a similar bill \nearlier this year. The substantive difference in the House bill is that \nit does not include the buffer requirement we put in the Senate version \nof the bill. Given that we agree that no wilderness study area \nprecedents can be set here, and given that the county's plan for the \nrange were used to create our buffer compromise. I hope the chairman \nmight allow for the passage of the House version of this bill so that \nthis important project can be started this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/19/senate-section/article/S11655-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. REID.
