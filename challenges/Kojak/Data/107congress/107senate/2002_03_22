More than wishful thinking, yearning, or shallow \noptimism, we turn to You for lasting hope. We have learned that true \nhope is based on the expectation of interventions by Your Spirit that \nare always on time and in time. You are the intervening Lord of the \nPassover, the opening of the Red Sea, and the giving of the Ten \nCommandments. You have vanquished the forces of evil, death, and fear \nthrough the Cross and the Resurrection. All through the history of our \nNation, You have blessed us with Your providential care. It is with \ngratitude that we affirm, ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the \nLord.''--Psalm 33:12.\n  May this sacred season, including Passover and Holy Week, be a time \nof the rebirth of hope in us. May Your Spirit of hope displace the \ndiscordant spirit of cynicism, discouragement, and disunity. Hope \nthrough us, O God of Hope. Flow through us patiently until we hope for \none another what You have hoped for us. Then Lord, give us the vision \nand the courage to confront those problems that have made life seem \nhopeless for some people. Make us communicators of hope. We trust our \nlives, the work of this Senate, and the future of our Nation into Your \nall-powerful hands. In the name of the Hope of the world. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2311-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Zell Miller led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2311-5", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to draw to the attention of our\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\ncolleagues in the Senate and also to the American people the \nunfortunate decision by this administration to recommend that we alter \nand change some enormously important privacy protections. These \nprotections were recommended by the previous administration--by \nPresident Clinton--and were scheduled to go into effect about a year \nfrom now. These protections to ensure the privacy of medical records. I \nwill speak on the substance of the issue in a moment.\n  What I find equally distressing is that we are seeing a series of \nactions taken by the administration--this is just the latest example--\nwhere the administration seems to be opting in favor of the companies \nand corporations at the expense of individuals. In this case, the \nadministration is acting at the expense of the medical privacy of our \nfellow citizens.\n  We have recently seen the administration effectively undermine the \nvery sensible and responsible ergonomics recommendations to try to \nprotect people in the workplace. This affects 800,000 workers--\nprimarily women--in our society. Those workers are risking their health \nwithout protections. In this case, we saw the administration siding \nwith the companies and corporations at the expense of workers.\n  We have seen it most recently in the Enron situation. We have seen \nindividuals who are the major players in the corporations walking away \nwith millions and millions of dollars, and the workers seeing their \nlife's savings eliminated. And just this week, we tried to put in \nprotections for workers in the future. The administration opposed those \nparticular recommendations.\n  In an entirely different area, we see where the administration has \ncome down on the side of the major health corporations at the expense \nof individuals on the powerful issue of medical privacy and medical \nrecords. The most sensitive information that individuals have is in \ntheir medical records.\n  We have seen over the period of this last year and a half a \nconsiderable amount of dialog and discussion, and a number of hearings. \nWe had recommendations in place, which were to go into effect about a \nyear from now. These were announced by the previous administration in \nresponse to a requirement put into law in what we call the HIPAA \nlegislation--the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation that dealt with health \ninsurance portability and accountability.\n  We put in that legislation a requirement on the administration to \ncome forward with medical records protections.\n  But announced yesterday and today was the decision by the \nadministration to recommend that we wipe away the most important \nprotections that individuals have; that is, their ability to say, no, I \nwill not share the information that is in my medical records.\n  In the existing proposed regulations, an individual could say, all \nright, the hospital or the doctor could share it with the insurance \ncompany, but that is all they could share it with.\n  It permitted individuals to say that some information is so sensitive \nthat they do not want to share it with the insurance company. They \ncould pay for a doctor's visit out of pocket rather than sending the \ninformation to their insurer--which could very well come back, as it so \noften does, to their employer.\n  We have not passed legislation that will prohibit discrimination \nagainst individuals in the workplace--even genetic discrimination.\n  This is the most sensitive information. We had the promulgation of \nrules and regulations under the administration that were to go into \neffect next year. It is surrounding information which is of the most \nsensitive nature.\n  The American people give a high priority to privacy. They do not want \nto have their own private lives infringed on by individuals or by any \ngovernmental agencies. They hold their medical information in the \nhighest order of priority.\n  For the administration to side with the medical corporate world in \nbeing willing to share that kind of sensitive information which \nindividuals do not want shared, I think, is an infringement on the \nrights to privacy for Americans that this country will not and should \nnot tolerate.\n  In our committee, we will have hearings on this administration's \nproposal as soon as we return from the April recess. We will introduce \nlegislation to ensure the protection of privacy for the American \npublic.\n  I see my friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who has worked on \nthis issue. Our colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has been a \nleader on this issue. It has not been a partisan issue. It has been \nbipartisan in nature. But it is an issue of high importance and \nconsequence.\n  Privacy is an enormously important value for our fellow citizens. To \ntry at the stroke of a pen to say that your medical records are not \ngoing to be protected is a violation of the most important and basic \nprivacy rights of an individual. It is wrong. It is basically a \nsurrender to major corporate interests. We have seen that too often in \nrecent times.\n  We want an administration that is going to represent the best in \nterms of protecting our individual rights and our individual liberties, \nand not always be serving the large medical corporate interests. The \nadministration's decision has been recommended, suggested, and \nsupported by those interests.\n  It is wrong. We are going to do everything we possibly can to prevent \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commend my colleague from Massachusetts. \nI had no idea he was coming over to the floor to address an issue which \nhe has spent a great deal of time on over the years. I found myself \noutraged when I awoke this morning and saw the headline in our local \nnewspaper, ``Medical Privacy Changes Proposed.''\n  I do not have any long prepared speech to give, but I associate \nmyself with the remarks of my friend and colleague from Massachusetts. \nWe have worked hard over the years to try to see to it that people's \nprivacy is protected.\n  We know today, as a result of technology, the gathering of \ninformation, consumers want the right to know, but they also want the \nright to say no when it comes to having access to some of the most \nprivate and personal information.\n  We would not tolerate allowing someone to break into your home and \nrifle through your closets and to find out, without any justification, \nthe most personal details of your life or your family's life. Yet what \nthe administration is doing here, in a sense, is going to allow people \nto do just that when it comes to the most personal and private \ninformation about you and your family--your medical history--and the \ndamage that can be done to people with that kind of access.\n  So I am terribly disappointed this morning to hear that the \nadministration is going to be rolling back regulations that are \ndesigned to protect people. They are doing so, they claim, in the name \nof ensuring more rapid care. Well, I say shame on them. Shame on them \nfor pitting care against your right to protect you and your family from \npeople knowing your personal and private information.\n  That is not what this is all about, wanting to protect you and \ngetting you better care. We know people want access to this \ninformation. We know why they want access to the information. That is \nwhy people are so concerned. This is not about liberals or \nconservatives, Democrats and Republicans. This is about the fact that \nwe, as Americans, feel deeply and strongly about our right to have \nprivate information kept private.\n  There is a growing fear in our society of technology being used not \nonly to improve our lives, as it is in so many ways, but to make it \neasier for people to rifle through our medicine cabinets, peer into our \ncheckbooks, and be able to track us on Internet activities. It worries \nAmericans that this is becoming far too prevalent.\n  What we need to have is our Government standing up for individual \ncitizens who cannot hire lawyers, who do not have the resources to go \nout and pay for people to bring lawsuits when this kind of information \nis abused or misused. We need to stand with them and say: Look, if you \nwant to have this information, you have to get the patient's and the \nfamily's permission. In many cases, of course, families are going to \ngive that permission, but you have to ask for it, and you have to get \ntheir permission to do so. The idea that you could bypass them and just \ndecide\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nyou are going to have access to that information, without securing the \npatient's approval in order to have access to that information, I think \nis just downright wrong.\n  I am heartened to know that the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee is going to take steps, certainly through \na hearing process, but, as well, to put the administration on notice \nthat this rule change they are about to establish is not going to occur \nwithout significant opposition.\n  I tried to call Senator Shelby in his office today. I cochaired the \ncaucus, if you will, on privacy along with my colleague from Alabama, \nSenator Shelby. I think he may have already gone back to his home State \nof Alabama. He may have left last evening. He was not here this \nmorning. But I wanted to invite him to join me in this Chamber, as he \nhas on so many other occasions when it comes to these privacy issues, \nto stand up to say that we are going to insist that people have the \nright to say no.\n\n  I cannot speak for him here, but I am confident that when the Senator \nfrom Alabama is heard on this issue, his voice and his words will not \nbe significantly different than what I have said here already and that, \nin a bipartisan way, we will be standing up, very strongly, in seeing \nto it that this proposed rule change is not going to just fly through \nhere without significant opposition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2313-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2313-S2314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to raise concern about a 5-to-4 \ndecision that was reached earlier this week by the Supreme Court on the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, a bill that, along with many others in \nthis body, I helped write back in the 1990s. It took a long time--about \n7 years--from the time that bill was first introduced to the time it \nbecame law in February of 1993. But it was a singular achievement which \nimproved tremendously the quality of life for millions of people who \nhad worried about their dearly beloved ones--their children, their \nparents--so when their loved one was sick or they had a newborn or \nadopted a child, they could take some time off--12 weeks maximum in a \nyear of unpaid leave--to be with their family during a time of crisis, \nor a ``joyous crisis,'' a birth, if you will--that is hardly a crisis \nbut, nonetheless, an important period in people's lives, or a \nlegitimate crisis--a child's illness or a parent they were caring for--\nto be with them without losing their job.\n  That is all it was: To help people, who often had been caught in the \nquandary of having to choose between the family they loved and the job \nthey needed, when they needed to be with their families, yet there was \nthe risk of losing their job if, in fact, they made the choice to be \nwith their family.\n  I pointed out, on dozens and dozens of occasions, during the debate \nover 7 years in this Chamber, that I knew countless Members of this \nbody who took time away from the Senate--missed dozens of votes, never \nwent to committee hearings, did not see constituents--because a child, \na spouse, or a parent needed our colleagues to be home with them. And \nnone of their constituents ever held it against them, when they came up \nfor reelection, because they missed a lot of votes because they were at \na children's hospital taking care of a child or they were with their \nwife or husband when they were desperately ill and they needed to be \nwith them. Certainly, we understood. In fact, had they been here voting \nand disregarding the needs of their families, they might have been in \ngreater jeopardy politically for having made that choice.\n  But it seemed to me if Senators and Congressmen would make the choice \nto be with their families--and rightfully so--that we ought not ask \naverage citizens to make any different choice. We wanted to provide the \nopportunity for them to do so without losing their job. That was the \nunderlying thought process and the genesis of the bill.\n  One of the requirements in the bill was for a general notification to \nemployees of what the bill provided for: the 12 weeks of unpaid leave. \nThere were some regulations that were adopted along those lines as a \nresult of the passage of the bill.\n  I think Sandra Day O'Connor got it right. The Court overruled the \nregulation because the regulation required specific notice to \nemployees. It went beyond, if you will, you could argue, the general \nnotification of the bill. But as Justice O'Connor pointed out, there \nwas nothing in the bill that said you could not have additional \nrequirements. You had a general notification, but there was nothing in \nthe legislation, nor in the legislative history, that would have banned \na regulation saying, you probably ought to give more specific notice to \nindividuals rather than just tacking it up on a bulletin board \nsomeplace and saying: You have a right to 12 weeks of leave. We hope \nyou get word of this.\n\n  Her point was it would be unrealistic to assume that individual \nemployees would be aware of what the law provided to them with just a \ngeneral notification. Her suggestion was that the regulation to require \nspecific notification would not be going too far. What happened here \nwas the regulation also said that if you do not do that, then you are \nrequired to provide an additional 12 weeks of leave.\n  The case, frankly, before the Court may not have been the best fact \nsituation. In this particular case, the employer had been extremely \ngenerous to the employee, in my view. The employer had already provided \nabout 30 weeks of leave for that particular employee. So it was one of \nthose cases where it was not the best set of facts to make the point.\n  I am in this Chamber to urge the agency, if you will, to take another \nlook at these regulations. And I strongly urge that they come back and \nreissue the regulation, if you will, on the specific notification. I \nthink that is the way to go. And then, in view of the Court's decision \nabout any additional penalties, I would say, pare back on that some \nway. Again, leave it to legal scholars how to write this and how to \nfashion this.\n  But the point is, on such a close decision--5 to 4--I do not believe \nthe Court was suggesting somehow we ought to eliminate the need for \nspecific notification, even though the bill talked about general \nnotification. That is the point I want to make.\n  This is a law that I am told has already provided benefits to more \nthan 35 million people in this country in the last decade who have been \nable to take advantage of this.\n  A lot of people cannot take advantage of it. I know that because it \nis unpaid leave. A lot of people find themselves in economic \ncircumstances where unpaid leave is something they just can't afford to \ndo. Candidly, we would never have passed a bill that would have \nrequired paid leave. The opposition was overwhelming to that idea. We \nhave since suggested some creative ways in which States may be able to \nprovide for paid leave under limited circumstances, and we are \nconsidering that legislation.\n  Even with the unpaid provisions of this proposal, millions of people \nhave been able to spend time with their families during very important \nperiods in any family's life. As I said, in the situation of a newly \narrived child, and I certainly know the joys of that, having had a \ndaughter 6 months ago, knowing how important it is for my wife and \nmyself to be able to spend time with Grace as she begins her new life. \nAnd certainly as a Member of the Senate, I can do that without any fear \nof losing my job because of it.\n  There were literally millions of people who could not take time to be \nwith their newborn without that fear on the table. Obviously, adoption \nmakes the case clearly how important it is for a newly adopted child to \nbe able to be with her new parents or his new parents during that \nbonding period.\n  I don't think I have to make the case. If any of you have been to a \nchildren's hospital in a waiting room and seen the fear and anxiety in \na mother's or father's face holding a child that is going into the \nhospital for some operation or into a pediatric intensive care unit, \nlooking on the faces of parents with a newborn who is struggling to \nstay alive, wondering whether or not they should be there or on the \njob, as if somehow they could actually do a job while their child is \nsitting in an emergency room or an intensive care unit.\n  It seemed to us logical that we provide this opportunity for people \nnot to be forced into that situation. I regret we couldn't do something \nabout having paid leave for people. We are one of the few countries in \nthe world that does\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nnot do that. Almost every other industrialized, advanced nation in the \nworld provides for paid leave under these circumstances. We don't do \nthat. I regret that. But I don't have 51 votes for that in this \nChamber. I had to do what I could do. So unpaid leave is the best I \ncould do.\n  The fact that millions of people have been able to take advantage of \nthat is something for which I am very proud. I hope we can come back to \nthis issue of notice. This has been a positive benefit for a lot of \npeople. But a lot of people are unaware that the law exists. Some \ngeneral notice tacked up on a bulletin board someplace means that an \nawful lot of people probably wouldn't find out about it. Specific \nnotice makes more sense to me.\n  My hope is the administration will promulgate a regulation that will \ncall for specific notification and tailor it accordingly so it will not \nrun afoul of the Supreme Court decision reached 5 to 4 a few days ago.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, yesterday the majority leader of the \nSenate described the conditions under which he intended to bring to the \nSenate legislation authorizing trade promotion authority. That is a \neuphemism for fast-track authority.\n  President Bush has requested of this Congress that we give him fast-\ntrack trade authority.

Nuclear arms treaties are negotiated and \nbrought to the Congress without fast-track authority. Only trade \nagreements, we are told, must have this handcuff put around Members of \nCongress, so they cannot offer any amendments.\n  The reason I care about this is I have watched trade agreement after \ntrade agreement be negotiated, often trading away the interests of \nproducers in the United States, only to discover the problems that \narise cannot be solved by these agreements.\n  To give an example, the White House negotiated a trade agreement with \nCanada, under fast-track trade authority. I was serving in the House at \nthe time. I was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. The \ntrade agreement came back to the House, to the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and the vote in committee for that trade agreement was 34 to \n1. I cast the lone vote against the agreement.\n  The chairman of the committee came to me and said: Congressman \nDorgan, we must have a unanimous vote. It is very important. You are \nthe only one who is holding out. It is really important you understand \nthat Canada is our biggest trading partner, our neighbor to the north. \nThe administration has negotiated this with great care. We really want \nto have a unanimous vote. Won't you join us?\n  I said: Absolutely not. It does not matter to me if I am the only \nvote. It does not matter to me at all.\n  The vote was 34 to 1, and they were sorely disappointed they could \nnot get a unanimous vote out of the Ways and Means Committee. I was \nthis troublemaker.\n  So the trade agreement went into effect, passed the House, passed the \nSenate. No one was able to offer an amendment. I could not offer an \namendment. After the trade agreement was finished, we began to see an \navalanche of Canadian grain being sent into our country. That Canadian \ngrain came from the Canadian Wheat Board, which is a state trading \nenterprise. The Canadian Wheat Board has a monopoly on wheat, and is \nable to ship to this country deeply subsidized Canadian grain, \nundercutting our farmers, taking money right out of our farmers' \npockets. Nothing could be done about it because I could not amend the \ntrade agreement. Our hands were tied. That is what fast-track trade \nauthority is all about.\n  Let me talk about trade for a few minutes and why I am going to \noppose this fast-track resolution when it comes to the Senate. I and \nsome others in the Senate--Senator Byrd has described his opposition--\nwill be trying to slow down the fast track bill, and to ultimately \ndefeat it.\n\n  Let me describe why. It is not because we are protectionists. It is \nnot because we want to build a wall around our country. Those of us who \noppose fast track believe in expanded trade. We believe trade is good \nfor our country. We believe expanded trade and breaking down barriers \nin foreign markets makes sense for our country. We believe all of that. \nWe also believe and insist and demand that trade be fair.\n  Let me point out what the Constitution says about trade. The U.S. \nConstitution, article I, section 8, says: The Congress shall have the \npower to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several \nStates and with Indian tribes.\n  It could not be more clear. The Congress shall have the power to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations--not the President, not the \nexecutive branch, not the judicial branch, but the Congress and only \nthe Congress.\n  With fast track, Congress relinquishes its responsibility. We will \nlet someone else go negotiate a trade treaty, go into a room, shut the \ndoor, and in private, in secret, negotiate a trade treaty, and then \nbring it back to the Congress. Our hands will be tied behind our backs, \nas we will not be able to offer any amendments. That is what fast-track \ntrade authority is all about.\n  I will use a chart to describe one piece of trade that I think \ndemonstrates the bankruptcy of what has been going on in international \ntrade. The example I have in mind involves trade with Korea in \nautomobiles. Now, someone watching or listening on C-SPAN or someone in \nthis Chamber might well drive a Korean car. If you do, good for you. \nYou have every right to drive it. Korean cars are sold all over this \ncountry. You can go to a dealership, and buy a car from Korea, from \nJapan, from Europe. That is consumer choice. I would never be critical \nof that.\n  But the fact that there are lots of Korean cars coming to our country \ndoes not mean that there is free trade. You have to look at both sides \nof the equation. Last year the country of Korea sent to the United \nStates 569,000 Korean automobiles. How many cars made in the United \nStates are sold in Korea? Only 1,700. I repeat, we purchased in the \nUnited States 570,000 Korean cars and the Koreans purchased 1,700 from \nus.\n\n  Let me also describe how this happens. Korea does not want American \ncars in Korea. Under the World Trade Organization, tariff barriers to \nsending American cars to Korea have come down. Why would we not get \nmore cars into Korea? In January, an English-language Korean newspaper \npublished an article describing the trade barriers faced by imported \ncars in the Korean marketplace. It is based on a report put out by a \nKorean state-run think tank, the Korea Institute for International \nEconomic Policy. The report cites a widespread climate of fear and \nintimidation associated with imported cars, including threats of \nphysical harm. Now, this is a report by a Korean think tank, saying \nthat Koreans face threats of physical harm, lengthy safety test \nprocedures, and discrimination by the traffic police.\n  An especially flagrant example of unfair trade that caught my \nattention: Korean importers have been frustrated in their inability to \nshowcase foreign cars at the Seoul Motor Show, the biggest car show in \nKorea. In May of 2000, the distributors put on their own import motor \nshow. As the import show began to attract interest and some orders for \nforeign cars, the Korean Ministry of Finance announced the selling of \nany cars with engine displaced at\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\ngreater than 3,000 cc--which is effectively any imported car--would \nhave to be reported to it. This had an immediate chilling effect on \nprospective buyers; a lot of car orders were canceled due to fears of \ntax audits and the like.\n  In January of this year, the deputy U.S. trade representative, Jon \nHuntsman, stated that ``Korea had somehow become a dynamic exporter \nwithout becoming an equally dynamic importer, dampening the competition \ncompanies need to keep their edge in the global marketplace.''\n  This is an example of an intolerable trade situation.\n  Let me give you another example, about Brazilian sugar. There is a \ntariff on sugar, but none on molasses. So what happens? Brazilian sugar \nis sent into the United States through Canada disguised as molasses. It \nis shipped from Brazil to Canada, loaded on as liquid molasses, and \nbecomes stuffed molasses. It comes from Canada to the United States. \nThe sugar is unloaded from the stuffed molasses. The molasses go back \nto Canada, and the whole process is repeated. This is fundamentally \nunfair trade. It goes on all the time, right under our noses. And \nnothing is being done about it--nothing. No one is willing to lift a \nlittle finger to resolve these problems. All they want to do is go to \nthe next trade issue.\n  Over $100 million in U.S. beef per year cannot get into Europe. Now, \nI have here a picture of what a typical U.S. cow, or heifer might look \nlike. It happens to be a Hereford. That is what I raised when I was a \nkid. Now, our cattle are sometimes fed hormones, and to hear the \nEuropeans describe it, our cattle have two heads. Absurd, of course. We \nbuy a lot from Europe every single year, but we cannot get beef into \nEurope.\n  There is so much more. Every pound of beef we send into Japan at the \nmoment, 12 years after we had a beef agreement with Japan, has a 38\\1/\n2\\ percent tariff. Each pound of beef has a 38\\1/2\\ percent tariff \nattached when we send it to Japan. That is after we had a beef \nagreement. We had all the negotiators over there who reached a big deal \nwith Japan. It was front-page headlines across the country: Beef \nagreement with Japan. Good for us. The agreement provided there will be \na 50 percent tariff on all United States beef going to Japan, which \nwill reduce over time, but snap back as the quantity increases. We have \ngotten more beef into Japan, yes, but 12 years after the agreement, we \nstill have a 38\\1/2\\ percent tariff on each pound of beef going into \nJapan.\n\n  We ought to expect to get more T-bones into Tokyo. That is my cry: T-\nbones to Tokyo; pork chops to China. Get rid of stuffed molasses to \nChina. How about cars to Korea?\n  How about asking those who are supposed to represent our country to \nstop worrying about the next agreement and fix a few of the problems we \nhave created for American workers and American businesses? I am \nperfectly willing to ask Americans to compete anywhere under any \ncircumstances as long as the competition is fair.\n  I said in the Chamber before, it is not fair competition when someone \nputs a 12-year-old in a factory, 7,000 miles from here, works them 12 \nhours a day, pays them 12 cents an hour, keeps the doors locked, and \nships the product to a store shelf in Pittsburgh, Fargo, or Denver. \nThat might be good for the consumer in terms of low prices, but it is \nnot fair trade and it is not fair to America's producers.\n  We had a hearing one day in which we were told about how some people \nwho make carpets in central Asia and the Middle East. They put the \nyoung kids, 8-, 10-, 12-year-old kids, in the factories, and they use \nneedles to work with the carpets. They put gunpowder on the tips of \ntheir fingers and lit the gunpowder to burn them, so that the tips of \ntheir finger became deeply scarred from the burns. That way, when the \nkids were making carpets and they would stick their fingers with the \nneedles, they could not feel it and it would not hurt--no downtime. And \nthen the carpets end up on a store shelf someplace in the United \nStates. Fair trade? I don't think so. Abusing children is not fair \ntrade just because a product is getting manufactured at lower costs. \nAbusing children is just plain abusing children.\n  We ought not have on any store shelf in any place in this country the \nproduct of slave labor wages. We should not be letting in women's \nblouses made in a factory in Honduras where the doors are locked and \npeople are paid slave wages--we ought not have that on the store \nshelves of this country. That is not good for consumers. It is not good \nfor anybody.\n  This country needs to be a leader in demanding fair trade. We do not \ndo that. We want to pass fast track so we can do another trade \nagreement, and essentially keep a blind eye for what is going on in the \nold agreements and move on to the next one.\n  I got involved with this issue because of wheat farmers in North \nDakota. After the United States-Canada free trade agreement, I watched \nall that Canadian grain being dumped into our country, money taken from \nthe pockets of our farmers and ranchers. They are furious about it, as \nwell they should be.\n  On March 6, the U.S. trade ambassador stood up for the American steel \nindustry. He said: We will slap tariffs on those who are unloading \nmassive amounts of steel in this country and ruining our steel \nindustry. We will give our steel producers a chance to compete on a \nmore level playing field. Now, the tariffs are not what they should \nhave been. There were too many loopholes. But at least it is a step in \nthe right direction, and I commend the trade ambassador for doing that.\n  But the fact is, we also just had a guilty verdict against Canada on \nwheat trade, yet no tariffs have been imposed. Make no mistake about \nthe finding of unfair trade. Here is what the USTR found:\n\n       USTR concluded that for several years, the Canadian Wheat \n     Board has taken sales from U.S. farmers because it is immune \n     from commercial risk, benefits from special privileges and \n     has competitive advantages due to its monopoly control over a \n     guaranteed wheat supply. This infringes on the integrity of \n     the competitive trading system.\n\n  That is how our trade ambassador has described the ongoing problem. \nSo is our government taking prompt action, as it did for the steel \nindustry? No. USTR has decided not to impose a tariff rate quota, as \nrequested by our wheat farmers, because of fears that such an action \n``would violate our NAFTA and WTO commitments.''\n  So in effect, USTR has concluded that Canada is guilty of unfair \ntrade, but it is not going to do anything about it anytime soon. \nGranted, USTR is talking about taking the Canadians to the WTO. My \ngreat-great-grandchildren might get some result out of the WTO. There \nis no guarantee it will be a good result. I guarantee only that the way \nthe World Trade Organization works, the proceedings will not be \ntransparent, because panels deliberate cases behind closed doors, in \nsecret. This country ought to demand open government and demand that \nWorld Trade Organization proceedings be open for all to see.\n  When we have the fast track, so-called trade promotion authority bill \non the floor of the Senate, there will be a number of amendments. I \nintend to offer an amendment saying that the proceedings of trade \ntribunals must be open to the public. The American people have a right \nto see what is going on. And they may not like what they see.\n  Also, I will have an amendment proposing tariff rate quotas on \nCanadian wheat. I am going to raise some of the trade problems I have \ndiscussed today, and I think the Senate ought to have a chance to vote \non this.\n  Advocates of free trade sometimes remind me of the Hare Krishnas, who \nchant the same thing over and over. Our trade negotiators are always \nsinging the same song: free trade this, free trade that. I am tired of \nthe chanting. The question is, Is someone going to stand up on the \nfloor of the Senate and demand fair trade on behalf of America's \nworkers and America's producers? Do we demand fair trade or don't we?\n  In this town there are only two recognized views of trade. You are \neither a protectionist xenophobic stooge who just doesn't get it and \ncan't see over the horizon and can't see the big picture, or you are \nfor global trade, expanded trade, opportunity, and jobs for the future. \nThat is the way the issue is presented. You are either kind of a nut \nwho wants to build walls around America and bring Smoot-Hawley back, or \nyou have a broad vision and you are a great statesman and good for you.\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n  That is the most thoughtless bunch of nonsense I ever heard. That is \nnot an adequate description of the views of trade we ought to embrace. \nThere ought not be anyone who is worried about standing up on the floor \nof the Senate and saying: Look, I stand up for this country's \ninterests. I stand up for the interests of people who work in this \ncountry, who produce textiles, who work on the manufacturing floor, and \nwho produce automobiles, who work in the fields and produce grain or \nlivestock. We stand up for them.\n  Our government is not ensuring a level playing field. We have stacked \nthe deck with bad international trade agreements, ineffective trade \nnegotiators and bad agreements, one after the other. Now we are told, \nlet's implement fast-track authority again so we can have a new \nagreement. I say to those who demand fast-track authority, please fix a \nfew of the old problems and then come back and we will talk about new \nagreements. Fix some of the old problems first.\n\n  Will Rogers once said that the United States has never lost a war and \nnever won a conference. He must surely have been thinking of our \nnegotiators. I have suggested many times that our negotiators wear \njerseys, like they do in the Olympics. Next time they sit around a \ntable with China, Japan, Europe, Canada, and Mexico, they could look \ndown at their jersey and be reminded that they represent the United \nStates. They represent workers, businesses, investors, and others who \nhave decided that, in a global economy, they want a fair shake. Nothing \nmore more, just a fair shake.\n  I am flat sick and tired of seeing negotiators go abroad and \nnegotiate a trade agreement that ties America's hands behind its back.\n  The first 25 years after the Second World War our trade was all \nforeign policy. We were bigger, better, stronger than anybody in the \nworld, and we could outperform anyone with one hand tied behind our \nback. So what we did is we granted trade concessions all around the \nworld because it was foreign policy to be helpful to foreign \ngovernments. That was the first 25 years after the Second World War.\n  The second 25 years have been different because we suddenly had \ntough, shrewd international competitors. Too much of our trade policy \nhas been soft-headed foreign policy. And it is not working.\n  We have a large, growing trade deficit, the largest in human \nhistory--a large deficit with China, a large deficit with Japan, a \nlarge deficit with Europe, a large and growing deficit with Canada and \nMexico. This is not working.\n  We used to have a small trade surplus with Mexico and then we had a \nnew trade agreement with Mexico and turned it into a big deficit. We \nhad a moderate deficit with Canada. We got a new trade agreement with \nCanada and doubled the deficit. Of course, with China and Japan, it has \nbeen a miserable failure. Our trade relationship with them has failed \nto really break down the barriers and open up their markets.\n  So my message is not that I want us to put walls around our country. \nI don't believe in that. My message is not that we should create \nspecial protections for American producers. I don't believe in that. I \nbelieve in fair, free, and open competition. My message is, I demand, \non behalf of the workers and producers of this country, that trade \nagreements represent fair trade conditions. If the rules are fair, if \nthe conditions are fair, then we ought to be able to compete. I know we \nwill compete and do well anywhere in the world under those \ncircumstances.\n  This issue is an issue, at its roots, that has to do with jobs and \neconomic opportunity and growth. When we give commencement speeches at \nhigh schools and colleges, we look out onto that sea of faces of young \nmen and women, the best and brightest in our country, and we see people \nwho are entering the workforce. The question is, What kind of an \neconomy will they join?\n  We have people around this country bragging about their states being \nlow-wage states. That is nothing to brag about. We need good jobs, good \ncareers, good salaries, and good opportunities for the future. \nManufacturing jobs have always been a base of good jobs that pay well \nand have good benefits, but our manufacturing industry is rapidly being \ndecimated by trade agreements that are unfair to American workers and \nAmerican businesses.\n  So I simply wanted to say today that we are going to have a vigorous \nand significant debate on this issue. It is long overdue. I welcome the \nopportunity to have trade promotion authority on the floor. Those who \nbring it should understand it will not be easy to get it. Those of us \nwho have amendments to offer will be here offering many amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2316-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2316-S2317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am chairman of an appropriations \nsubcommittee. Last fall we asked Governor Ridge, who is the Director of \nHomeland Security, to come and testify on matters dealing with homeland \nsecurity issues. In my subcommittee, we fund the U.S. Customs Service \nand others.\n  Governor Ridge determined that he could not do that and would not do \nthat. Other committees have experienced the same reaction from the \nGovernor. I think the administration is making a mistake. I think \nGovernor Ridge is an excellent public servant. I enjoy working with \nhim, but he really does need to come and testify before congressional \ncommittees. I think it will benefit him, it will benefit the Bush \nadministration, it will benefit the Congress and the American people.\n  I did want to say, however, as we construct homeland defense, I think \nthe administration's recommendations are good ones. I support them. I \nhave commended President Bush for his prosecution of the war against \nterrorism. I think his recommendations in this budget dealing with \nhomeland security are some thoughtful and good recommendations.\n  But there is one recommendation that is now floating around, being \nadvanced by Governor Ridge and others, that I will not support. That is \na recommendation to merge the Customs Service with the Immigration \nService. Let me describe why I think that would be inappropriate.\n  There is a discussion going on about merging a number of agencies of \nthe Federal Government into one larger agency. We are not going to \nsolve the problems of any agency by simply creating larger \nbureaucracies. That doesn't solve any problems of government.\n  We had an embarrassing circumstance a couple of weeks or so ago in \nwhich the Immigration Service issued visas to Mohammed Atta and one of \nthe other terrorists who flew the airplanes into the World Trade Center \nand murdered thousands of people.\n  We need to solve those problems at the INS. I must say Mr. Ziglar, \nwho runs the INS, a friend of mine and acquaintance of most of the \nSenate, has inherited an agency that had a lot of problems, no question \nabout that. I know he is struggling mightily to deal with them. I wish \nhim well and I want to help him to do that. But he inherited an agency \nthat wasn't able to track anything on its computers. It couldn't track \ndown someone who overstayed a visa. I think Mr. Ziglar has a lot of \nwork to do, and I want to help him do that.\n  But visiting the problems at the INS that Mr. Ziglar inherited on the \nCustoms Service makes no sense at all. The Customs Service runs pretty \nwell. We have some problems there as well, but it is an entirely \ndifferent agency, which deals with the facilitation of trade and the \nprohibition of illegal goods from coming into the country. It is the \nsecond largest revenue raiser for the Federal Government next to the \nInternal Revenue Service. So I don't want to visit upon the Customs \nService the problems of the INS or any other Federal agency, and I \ndon't believe you solve the problems with respect to these issues by \ncreating larger government and bigger bureaucracies.\n  So again, I would encourage Governor Ridge to come testify before \nCongressional committees, and discuss matters such as these. The idea \nof merging Customs and the INS is one that I just cannot support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take a few moments today to recall the \ndays of yesteryear.\n  I came to this body in January of 1959, after having served in the \nother body, the House of Representatives, for 6 years. When I came to \nthe Senate, I came into the midst of a chamber that was made up of men \nand one woman, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. These men were ``tall \nmen, sun crowned, who live(d) above the fog in public duty and in \nprivate thinking,'' men like Richard B. Russell of Georgia. Senator \nRichard Russell had never married, but he had a bride. His bride was \nthe Senate. There was none other like him.\n  In my service in the Senate, this man from Georgia, Richard Brevard \nRussell, was the uncrowned leader, as far as I am concerned, of the \nSenate. There were men like Lyndon Johnson, Everett Dirksen, Lister \nHill of Alabama, John McClellan, William Fulbright, Norris Cotton, and \nI could go on; John Pastore of Rhode Island, Senator O'Mahoney of \nWyoming. They are all gone now.\n  I look about me today and I see the desks and the chairs. They were \nhere then. Then one after another, as I look about me, I can see those \nSenators, Wayne Morse, Wallace Bennett, Jacob Javits, and Herman \nTalmadge.\n  I stand alone in this Chamber as in a great banquet hall where men \nhave come and gone, fallen like winter's withered leaves. There is only \none other Senator today who was here when I came here: Strom Thurmond.\n  The Senate is a far different place, far different from what it was \nwhen the Senator who is presiding over this Senate today, Senator \nChristopher Dodd, was a page boy; a different Senate. Yes, it is a \ndifferent time. But the memories of those men and that woman who gave \nher ``Declaration of Conscience,'' Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, are \nstill in my heart.\n\n  I begin now to make a few remarks about one of those Senators whose \nnames I have mentioned, the late Senator Herman Talmadge. We heard the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Georgia yesterday, Mr. Zel \nMiller, speak of the passing of Herman Talmadge. As a colleague of the \nlate Herman Talmadge, I say these few words in memory of him.\n  Mr. President, there was once a saying in the state of Georgia that \n``if you were not a Talmadge man, you were a communist.''\n  That saying spoke so well of the high regard, the esteem, and the \nrespect that the people of that proud southern State, which was one of \nthe original 13 States, possessed for the Talmadge family and why the \nTalmadges were such a politically prominent family for so many years.\n  The Talmadge dynasty began in 1926--I was a little boy in a 2-room \nschool house in southern West Virginia that year--when Eugene Talmadge \nwas elected Commissioner of Agriculture. He was later elected Governor \nof Georgia to an unprecedented four terms.\n  It continued with his son, Herman Eugene Talmadge whose death we \nmourn today. Herman Eugene Talmadge served the State of Georgia first \nas Governor, 1948-1955, and then as a United States Senator, 1957-1980.\n  He had been in this body 2 years when I came and when the father of \nthe Presiding Officer today, the late Thomas Dodd, came to the Senate \nwith me. We came together from the House where we had previously served \ntogether.\n  During the Talmadge tenure, other powerful political leaders emerged \nin that great state, and obtained state and national offices. These \nincluded Senator Richard Russell, who sleeps peacefully today under a \nsouthern sky in a lonely cemetery in Georgia. I stood in that cemetery, \nat the grave of the late Senator Richard Russell.\n\n  Then there was President Jimmy Carter. I served as majority leader in \nthis body during the years of his Presidency. Then there was Senator \nSam Nunn, whom we all know, remember, and respect, and for whom we have \nan enormously high regard.\n  But the Talmadges were always there!\n  Some maintain that the Talmadge reign ended in 1980 when Senator \nHerman Talmadge lost his bid for reelection. But I can't help but \nbelieve that it did not end until this past Wednesday night when this \nsharp-witted man of simple values, who spent so much of his life in \npublic service and who did so much to make his State and our Nation \nbetter, passed away. His passing should serve to remind all of us how \nmuch we need people who are dedicated to public service.\n  Herman Eugene Talmadge's public service began during World War II. \nNow listen to this: he was serving in the Navy when Pearl Harbor was \nattacked. He immediately requested combat duty, and participated in a \nnumber of important naval engagements during the war, including the \ninvasion of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Okinawa. He was present at \nthe Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.\n  Upon the death of his father, Herman Talmadge became Governor of \nGeorgia, and his administration is regarded as one of the most \nprogressive administrations in the history of that great state of \nGeorgia.\n  In 1957, he took a seat in the Senate. I can see him standing over \nthere, a man of few words. He was like John Pastore. Those two men were \namong the sharpest witted Senators with whom I have ever served.\n  In 1957, Herman Talmadge began an extraordinary career, which \nincluded serving as chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry, where he became known as the ``champion of \nAmerican agriculture'' because of the imprint he left on almost all \nfarm legislation that was passed during his tenure as chairman. He \nauthored legislation to expand and improve the School Lunch Program. He \nhelped to develop the Food Stamp Program. As chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee and a crusader for rural development, Senator \nTalmadge established a rural development subcommittee and led the \nenactment of the Rural Development Act of 1972.\n  He was a member of the Senate Finance Committee--there was a sharp \nbrain on a great committee, the Senate Finance Committee. I have never \nseen men or women in this Senate whose brains were more sharp than that \nof Herman Talmadge.\n  He was also very active on welfare legislation long before it became \na popular issue to promote, and he authored a provision giving tax \ncredits to private businesses to provide job training. There was a \npioneer!\n  Talmadge was always a powerful proponent of programs calculated to \nget people on their feet, and to give them the means with which to \nsecure their future and the future of their children. He was just as \nadamantly opposed to programs he felt perpetuated cycles of dependency, \n``You gotta have more people pulling the wagon than riding,'' he was \nfond of saying. He could say it crisply, succinctly, right to the \npoint.\n  Senator Talmadge came to national attention in 1973, when he was \nappointed to serve on the Watergate Committee. According to an article \non him in the Georgia Historical Quarterly, Senator Talmadge:\n\n       . . . thought the Watergate investigation was one of the \n     most important events in the history of the United States \n     [because] it demonstrated how a republican form of government \n     [This is not a democracy, it is a republic; it is a \n     republican form of Government] could correct the conduct of \n     public officials and alert others not to make the same \n     mistake.\n\n  It was during the Watergate hearings that the American people were \nable to observe for themselves the penetrating, get-to-the-heart-of-\nthe-matter style of Senator Talmadge, and I am sure they were \nimpressed.\n  Despite Senator Talmadge's productive and historic achievements in \nthe Senate, his life was not without adversity. While serving in this \nChamber,\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nSenator Talmadge suffered the tragic death of one of his sons, and \nendured other personal and professional misfortunes.\n  Nevertheless, in his memoirs (Talmadge, A Political Legacy, A \nPolitician's Life: A Memoir), he wrote:\n\n       In looking back over my life, I suppose I have the normal \n     share of regrets. But if I had it all to do over again, I \n     wouldn't hesitate to enter politics. The rewards far outweigh \n     the price one has to pay. When I speak to a civic club or \n     just walk down the street, I invariably run into someone who \n     has benefited in some way from my three-and-a-half decades in \n     public life. Yes, it was a good life.\n\n  Mr. President, Herman Eugene Talmadge served his country and he \nserved it well, in war and in peace. He served his State and the people \nof America very well with his extraordinary career in the Senate. His \nwas indeed a ``good life'' and one for which all of us can be grateful. \nSo:\n\n     Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, that she cannot destroy;\n     Which come, in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled!\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Let \nme read it, if I may.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, in concurrence with \nthe Republican leader, may resume the consideration of S. 565, the \nelection reform bill; that debate on the bill be limited to 2 hours \nequally divided in the usual form; that the following be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments in order, and that debate on each \namendment be limited to 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form \nunless otherwise listed; further, that no second-degree amendment be in \norder prior to a vote in relation to each amendment; further, that \nsecond-degree amendments must be relevant to the amendment to which it \nis offered and debate be limited to 30 minutes unless otherwise listed; \nfurther, that any pending amendment not listed be withdrawn; that upon \ndisposition of the listed amendments, the bill be read the third time \nand the Senate vote on passage of the bill; and that upon passage, the \ntitle amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, all without further intervening \naction or debate; further, that no call for the regular order be in \norder with respect to this bill:\n  Senator Levin, provisional balloting; Senator Clinton, residual \nballot benchmark; Senator Rockefeller, overseas voters; Senator Wyden, \nvoting by mail and first time voter; Senator Nelson of Florida, DOJ \nrequest; Senator Nickles, confidentiality voter lists; Senator Roberts, \nprovisional balloting notices; Senator Hatch, Internet study; Senator \nThomas, sense of Senate on rural concerns; Senator Grassley, use of \nSocial Security numbers; Senator Smith of New Hampshire, election media \nreporting; and Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell, managers' amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me express my very sincere gratitude to \nboth leaders, first of all to Senator Daschle and his very fine staff \nwho were immensely helpful in pulling this together. I thank the \nRepublican leader, Senator Lott, for his wonderful leadership. He has \nbeen tremendously helpful to us in putting this agreement together. I \nalso thank Senator McConnell and Senator Bond and their staffs for \nmaking it possible. Senator Lott's office worked very closely with \ntheir offices in bringing us to this point.\n  We have had an awful lot of amendments. This bill had already handled \nsome 35 or 40 amendments. We then had to lay the bill aside, and there \nwas still an outstanding list of 40 or 45 amendments. This is a much \nmore abbreviated list, and it will allow us to get to final passage on \nthis bill.\n  I am very optimistic we will end up with a positive vote in the \nSenate on this very important issue of election reform. It has been a \nlittle more than a year since the election of 2000. As we have said, \nthis bill is forward looking. It is not about what happened in 2000; \nrather, what had been happening for many years in regard to the \ndeteriorating condition of our election structure in the country. \nFlorida merely highlighted for many Americans what had happened in many \nof the States as well.\n  This bill, while not a complete answer, will put us on a very strong \nroad to resolving a lot of the outstanding issues that occurred then.\n  I am very grateful to the staffs of all those Senators involved--\nSenators Schumer and Torricelli. I thank my own staff, Veronica \nGillespie and Kennie Gill of the Rules Committee, as well as Shawn \nMaher of my office, who have worked very hard. We are not done yet. We \nhave work to do on this unanimous consent agreement to deal with the \nremaining amendments and then a conference with the House.\n\n  But this unanimous consent agreement, which took the cooperation of \nall Members of this Chamber, brings us very close to final passage of a \ngood bill, my firm hope is, so that resources in the discretionary \nfunds of this bill might even be available for the 2002 election, if we \ncan get this done sometime over the next several months; that is, the \nfinal conference report.\n  The purpose of this bill, as has been stated by many, is to make it \nharder to defraud the system but, just as importantly, to make it \neasier for people to cast their ballots: the provisional voting \nprovisions, statewide voter registration, making sure people who are \ndisabled will have access to voting, being able to check your vote, not \novervoting, as well as the antifraud provisions and the provisions \ndealing with the establishment of a permanent commission on elections.\n  All Members in this Chamber have been extremely cooperative on seeing \nto both of those twin goals: easier to vote and harder to defraud the \nsystem. Without the cooperation of everyone in this Chamber, we would \nnot have arrived at this unanimous consent agreement.\n  So it is a great compliment to Members from all across the country \nthat we have been able to arrive at this unanimous consent agreement, \nthe disposition of these amendments, and final passage of the bill that \nwill make it possible for us to say we have made it easier to vote in \nAmerica and harder to defraud the system. If that is achieved in the \nfinal product we produce, we will have responded to the challenge posed \nto us by what occurred not only in the 2000 national election but what \nhad been occurring across the country for many years. I express my \ngratitude again to all involved.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \napproved Judge James C. Mahan, of Las Vegas, to be the next judge on \nthe United States District Court for the District of Nevada.\n  May I say on behalf of my colleague, Senator Ensign, and myself that \nJim Mahan has the unequivocal support of both Senators from Nevada.\n  Jim Mahan currently serves as a Judge on the Eighth Judicial District \nCourt in Clark County, Nevada, He was Governor Kenny Guinn's first \njudicial appointment to the Clark County District Court in February \n1999, an appointment that reflects the deep respect Judge Mahan has \ngarnered from his colleagues and other Nevada officials. Since taking \nthe bench on March 8, 1999, he has presided over a docket of more than \n3,000 civil and criminal cases. Despite this heavy docket, Judge Mahan \nalso hears probate matters, drug court and grand jury returns on a \nregular basis.\n  As my colleagues have heard me state on numerous occasions, Las Vegas \nhas been the fastest growing metropolitan community in the United \nStates for more than a decade. Very hard work and dedication is \nrequired of our judges, policemen, firemen, and other civil servants on \na daily basis.\n  These qualities will serve Judge Mahan well on the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Nevada, whose docket has increased at a rate \nthat mirrors the explosive growth of my home State, especially Las \nVegas.\n  I am so proud to have played a role in creating three additional \njudgeships for the District of Nevada over the last few years.\n  Prior to the Senate's confirmation of Roger Hunt and Kent Dawson last \nyear, and Larry Hickes last month, Nevadans seeking justice in Federal \ncourt were forced to wait up to 3 years before their case went to \ntrial. And these delays may have been worse had it not been for our \nhard working judges. Those judges hear, on average, more cases than any \nactive judges throughout the country.\n  Although the docket remains one of the busiest in the Federal \njudiciary, these judgeships--and the fine jurists who have filled \nthem--have had an immediate impact on the Federal bench in Nevada. When \nhe takes his place on the District Court, Jim Mahan will be a \ntremendous asset to what is already one of the finest courts in the \nnation.\n  As he assumes his new judgeship, Judge Mahan also will be taking a \nwealth of other experiences with him to the bench. Before becoming a \njudge, he and Frank A. Ellis III formed the law firm of Mahan & Ellis, \nwhere they practiced business and commercial law for 17 years in Las \nVegas.\n  A long-time resident of Las Vegas, having lived and practiced law \ncontinuously since 1973, Jim was admitted to practice in Nevada in 1974 \nin both State and Federal court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in \n1974, and the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980.\n  Jim Mahan was born in El Paso, TX, on December 16, 1943. His family \neventually moved to Grand Junction, CO, where he graduated from high \nschool. Jim graduated from the University of Charleston in Charleston, \nWV, in 1965, and received his law degree from Vanderbilt University \nSchool of Law in 1973. In between his graduate and law school studies, \nJim served in the United States Navy.\n  Jim has been blessed with a beautiful family. He and his wife of 33 \nyears, Eileen, are the proud parents of one son James, Junior, who is a \ngraduate from the University of Southern California.\n  In short, Jim Mahan has already proven that he is an excellent judge \nand a fine Nevadan. He will make an outstanding addition to the Federal \nbench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2319-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the 90th anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the USA, GSUSA, \nthis month. Girl Scouting began on March 12, 1912, when founder Juliet \nGordon Low assembled 18 girls from Savannah, GA. She believed that \ngirls should be given the opportunity to develop physically, mentally, \nand spiritually.\n  This excellent organization empowers girls to develop their full \npotential, to relate positively to others and their community, and to \npromote sound values and community service. GSUSA continues to expand \nits programs to address contemporary issues affecting girls, while \nmaintaining its original core values. The organization's foundation is \nstill premised on the original 1912 ``Girl Scout Promise and Law.''\n  Today, Girl Scouting has a membership of 3.8 million, comprised of \n2.7 million girl members and over 900,000 adult members, making this \nthe largest organization for girls worldwide. Moreover, this American \norganization is a member of the larger worldwide family of 10 million \ngirls and adults in 140 countries.\n  Through Girl Scouting, girls acquire self-confidence and expertise, \ntake on responsibilities, are encouraged to think creatively and act \nwith integrity, all qualities essential for good citizenship and great \nleaders. At each level of Girl Scouting, girls engage in numerous \nactivities including science and technology, sports, health and \nfitness, the arts, global awareness, community service, money \nmanagement and finance, and much more. Importantly, the organization \nhas established a research institute, receiving government funding to \naddress violence prevention. It is also addressing the digital divide \nwith activities that encourage girls to pursue careers in science, \nmath, and technology.\n  In 2001, GSUSA launched a major initiative rededicating themselves to \ntheir founder's vision of empowering girls to grow into healthy, \nresourceful citizens. They are diligently working to ensure that Girl \nScouting is available to every girl in every community, reaching beyond \nracial, ethnic, socioeconomic or geographic boundaries. Girl Scout \ntroops meet everywhere including suburban, urban and rural areas, \nhomeless shelters, migrant farm camps, and juvenile detention \nfacilities. Some girls meet online via the Internet. And through one of \nGirl Scout's signature initiatives, Girl Scouts Beyond Bars, girls meet \nin prisons where their mothers are incarcerated.\n  Out of the almost one million adults in Girl Scouting, 99 percent are \nvolunteers. While Girl Scouts enjoys the largest adult involvement of \nall such organizations, new leaders and mentors are constantly needed \nto serve the increasing number of participants who desire to be Girl \nScouts.\n  Though the first troops met before women were given the right to \nvote, 90 years later there is a ``Troop Capitol Hill'' made up entirely \nof Congresswomen who are honorary Girl Scouts. More than 50 million \nwomen are alumnae. Over two-thirds of our doctors, lawyers, educators, \ncommunity leaders, and women Members of Congress were once members of \nGirl Scouting, as were 64 percent of the women listed in ``Who's Who of \nAmerican Women.''\n  For 90 years this month, this respected organization has demonstrated \na proven track record of empowering girls to become leaders, equipping \nadults to be positive role models and mentors for children, and helping \nto build strong communities. With the support and dedication of \nCongress, Girl Scouts will surely continue this fine tradition for the \nnext 90 years and beyond.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 90th \nanniversary\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nof the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Founder Juliette \nLow envisioned an organization that would encourage girls to serve in \ntheir communities and experience the open air. Decades later, girls and \nyoung women from communities across our Nation enjoy scouting \nactivities that nurture their mental, physical, and spiritual well-\nbeing in an accepting and supportive environment. I commend the efforts \nof the Girl Scouts and the outstanding volunteers who make this \nimportant work a reality.\n  Thousands of girls across the State of New Jersey actively \nparticipate in Girl Scouts. I have heard heartening stories of scouts \nvisiting senior residence facilities, food pantries, and soup kitchens. \nIn the wake of September 11, these thoughtful young people contributed \nin many meaningful ways. These active girls and young women participate \nin anti-smoking campaigns, sports, lessons in civics and the law, \noutdoors activities, and much more. These initiatives build self-\nconfidence, and strong leadership and life skills. We cannot \nunderestimate the importance of this positive reinforcement in the \nlives of girls and young women. Innovative leadership and tremendous \noutreach efforts in my State continue to promote the Girl Scout \ninitiative For Every Girl, Everywhere. I offer my wholehearted support \nfor this ambitious endeavor. Imagine the possibilities!\n  Thank you, Girl Scouts, for decades of volunteerism in our \ncommunities and dedication to young women. As our nation affirms its \ncommitment to service, the Girls Scouts shine so brightly. \nCongratulations on this very special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2320-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2320-S2321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Daschle-Bingaman substitute \namendment, also known as the Energy Policy Act of 2002, includes \nportions of a bill that was reported favorably last year from the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  That bill, the Federal Reformulated Fuels Act, S. 950, was approved \nwith the committee's understanding that further action by the full \nSenate would be necessary to solve the delicate problem of eliminating \nMTBE from the fuel supply to protect water resources, while maintaining \nair quality and stimulating renewable fuel use.\n  The substitute amendment before the Senate now does a good job of \nresolving that problem and balancing many political and environmental \nconcerns. This language does not represent the perfect solution for my \nState or the Northeast. However, without it, MTBE contamination of \nwater resources will continue unabated. With it, at least we can be \nassured of greater protection of air and water quality.\n  If States proceed to ban MTBE without clear Federal authority \nprovided in this amendment, air quality could suffer as RFG areas would \nbe forced to use ethanol in a very inflexible way due to the existing \noxygen content requirement in the Clean Air Act. In that situation, and \nwithout the anti-backsliding provisions in the substitute amendment \nbefore us, there might be significant increases in vehicle emissions of \nboth volatile organic compounds, which contribute to smog, and toxic \nair pollutants, and large and sudden increases in gasoline prices could \nalso occur.\n  I would have preferred a bill that, in addition to eliminating the \noxygen content requirement, simply eliminated the existing one-pound \nwaiver of Reid vapor pressure requirements for ethanol blends and \nallowed all Governors to opt-in easily to the RFG program for their \nwhole States. But, at least this language expedites Governors' access \nto that RVP waiver's elimination and provides accelerated opt-in \nauthority to the entire States in the ozone transport region, where the \nozone problems are quite serious. My preferred construction would have \ngone even further toward providing ever greater air quality benefits \nand a clearer set of ``national'' fuels.\n  The provision on liability limitations for renewable fuels is also \nproblematic in that it is not clear to many of us why such a limitation \nis necessary. One would assume that Congress has required a renewable \nfuel content in motor vehicle fuel knowing what renewable fuels will be \nused to meet this requirement. Indeed, we assume that these renewable \nfuels will be ethanol and biodiesel. If these renewable fuels are as \nbeneficial to the public health as we have been lead to believe, then \nthere should be no need for such a liability limitation.\n  Under the provision, it is clear that no liability limitation applies \nto MTBE. It is clear that no liability limitation applies to any cases \nfiled prior to the date of enactment of the bill. It is clear that the \nlimitation applies only to a defective product claim and no other type \nof claim. It is clear that this limitation applies only to a renewable \nfuel, and if such fuel is blended with substances that do not meet the \ndefinition of a renewable fuel, the limitation does not extend to those \nsubstances.\n  The limitation is not intended to limit any legal requirements that \napply to the use, distribution, transport or storage of these renewable \nfuels, and as such, this provision does not amend or modify any such \nrequirements. Nor should this provision be read to curtail the duty of \nthe producers, transporters and distributors of these fuels to act \nresponsibly with regard to their products, including providing all \nwarnings of dangers to human health or the environment associated with \ntheir products and taking all precautions to avoid any such harm which \nmay include eliminating the use of the product altogether.\n  The substitute amendment provides protection against increases in \ntoxic air pollutant emissions by maintaining the overcompliance that \nrefiners have achieved since the inception of the RFG program. This is \nparticularly vital to the Northeast, as vehicles are a \ndisproportionately large source of these emissions inventory. The \nlanguage includes an important statutory deadline for further EPA \nrulemaking to impose any additional and necessary toxics reductions to \nprotect public health. As my colleagues may know, several studies have \nimplicated vehicle toxics emissions as a contributor to increased \ncancer and developmental risks in congested urban areas.\n  Perhaps as important, the amendment requires the EPA to do a much \nbetter job of ensuring that fuels and fuel additives don't harm water \nquality, as well as air quality. Manufacturers will need to regularly \nsupply information to the Agency on the public health and environmental \nimpacts of the use of fuels and fuel additives. The Administrator will \nbe held responsible for assuring that that data is up to date and \nadequate for determining whether those substances' use is a cause for \nconcern.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been a strong proponent of encouraging \nthe use of alternative and renewable fuels for decades. That is why I \nhave supported S. 760, a bill to provide incentives for those fuels and \nvehicles, and many many other efforts to motivate reductions in our \ndependency on petroleum. We are making a small dent in that dependency \nwith this language. The total motor gasoline consumption in 2012 is \nexpected to exceed 180 billion gallons annually. The substitute's \nprovisions require that about 2.8 percent of gasoline consumption in \nthat year to be fuel made from renewable sources. This is good for \nenergy security and the environment.\n  Work has been underway in Congress to try to solve this problem since \nMTBE contamination was first found. Senators Boxer, Feinstein and Bob \nSmith, in particular, have been instrumental in addressing the matter. \nBefore S. 950, the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported a \nbill, S. 2962, in the 106th Congress which had an effect similar to \nwhat is contained in this substitute amendment. Many of the most \nimportant concepts in those bills are now embodied in the amendment. It \nis past time that Congress acted on this matter. Further delay will \nsimply lead to more water resource contamination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief and informal section-by-section \nsummary of the renewable fuels and MTBE provisions be included in the \nRecord following my statement. This may assist Senators and their staff \nin understanding what we are attempting to do with this substitute. I \nurge them to help us solve this problem.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n       Section 819. Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel. \n     Amends the Clean Air Act to require that gasoline sold or \n     dispensed to consumers in the United States contain a certain \n     volume of renewable fuel starting in the year 2004. The \n     volume starts at 2.3 billion gallons in the first year and \n     increases to 5.0 billion gallons in 2012. The volume \n     requirement continues thereafter at the same percentage that \n     the 5.0 billion gallons represents in relation to the total \n     gasoline pool in 2012. Existing Clean Air Act compliance \n     requirements for section 211 apply to this new requirement.\n       Renewable fuel is defined as motor vehicle fuel made from \n     grain or other biomass sources, methane from landfills, \n     sewage, etc. and that replaces or reduces fossil fuel. This \n     includes ethanol and biodiesel.\n       EPA must promulgate regulations translating the total \n     national volume requirement into percentages that are \n     applicable to individual refiners, blenders and importers. \n     They may achieve compliance with the applicable percentage by \n     buying credits from others in the industry that have used \n     more renewable fuel than required.\n       Credits are valid for up to three consecutive years, \n     depending on regulations promulgated. Compliance with the \n     applicable percentage of renewable fuel may be deferred for \n     one year, if the refiner, blender or importer makes up the \n     deficit in the following year and complies with the following \n     year's requirement. Ethanol made from non-corn sources, such \n     as dedicated energy crops, animal waste, municipal solid \n     waste, and wood and wood residues, generates 1.5 credits for \n     every gallon sold or introduced into commerce.\n       Using EIA information, EPA will ensure that no less than 35 \n     percent of the applicable renewable fuel use shall take place \n     in every season. In 2004, ethanol consumed in California will \n     not be included in calculating that year's seasonal \n     variation.\n       EPA, in consultation with DOE and USDA, may waive the \n     renewable fuel requirement in whole or in part on petition by \n     one or more States by reducing the national quantity required \n     for one year at a time, if one of two conditions are met. \n     One, implementation would severely harm the economy or \n     environment of a State, a region or the country. Two, there \n     is an inadequate domestic supply or distribution capacity to \n     meet the requirement. DOE must do an initial study within 180 \n     days to review the consumer impacts of the requirement in \n     2004 and make recommendations regarding a waiver.\n       Small refineries are not covered by the renewable fuel \n     content requirement until 2008. Before 2007, DOE must study \n     the economic hardship on small refineries of compliance with \n     that requirement. If DOE finds disproportionate impact on a \n     small refinery, EPA will provide an extension on compliance \n     for up to 2 years. Small refiners may opt in to the renewable \n     fuel program at any time before compliance is required.\n       Exclusions from Ethanol Waiver. A Governor may require that \n     gasoline to be blended with ethanol must achieve a lower Reid \n     vapor pressure than the Clean Air Act currently provides, \n     upon a showing to EPA that there will otherwise be an \n     increase in emissions that will contribute to air pollution \n     in that State. EPA is required to act on a Governor's \n     petition within 90 days, and promulgate regulations that will \n     take effect the later of one year or the next high ozone \n     season. If approving the Governor's petition would result in \n     insufficient supplies of gasoline, EPA will extend the \n     effective date of the regulations for not more than 1 year \n     and may renew the extension two more times.\n       Renewable Fuels Safe Harbor. This section provides that \n     renewable fuels required to be used and as defined by this \n     act will not be deemed defective in design or manufacture, in \n     terms of a manufacturer's liability for introducing it into \n     commerce after enactment, so long as the renewable fuel does \n     not violate EPA controls or prohibitions and the manufacturer \n     is in compliance with EPA requests for information on the \n     renewable fuels' public health and environmental effects, the \n     techniques for detecting the additive in fuel, and the \n     resulting effects on emissions from vehicles, vehicles' \n     performance, and any emissions related effect on public \n     wealth and welfare.\n       Section 832. The Leaking Underground Storage Tank, LUST, \n     program is modified to allow EPA and the States to use LUST \n     monies to carry out corrective actions to remediate MTBE and \n     other ether contamination that poses a threat to human \n     health, welfare, or the environment. Contamination by or from \n     an underground tank leak is not required for use of the \n     funds.\n       Bedrock/Soil Remediation. Funds are authorized to study \n     remediation of aquifers of various sorts that have been \n     contaminated by MTBE.\n       Total LUST funds authorized to be appropriated for this \n     section are $402.35 million.\n       Section 833. Authority for Water Quality Protection From \n     Fuels. The Clean Air Act is amended to allow EPA to regulate \n     fuels and fuel additives to prevent degradation of water \n     quality.\n       MTBE use is discontinued not later than 4 years after \n     enactment, except in any State that chooses to continue using \n     it. EPA will promulgate the appropriate implementing \n     regulations and may allow trace quantities of MTBE in motor \n     vehicle fuel to exist nationally after 4 years. This Federal \n     phase out is not intended to affect any existing State \n     efforts to ban MTBE.\n       Existing domestic manufacturers of MTBE supplying today's \n     nonattainment areas are eligible for transition assistance \n     for conversion of their facilities to produce MTBE \n     substitutes. There are $750 million total authorized for \n     2003-05 for such assistance.\n       Section 834. Elimination of the Oxygen Content Requirement \n     for Reformulated Gasoline. The 2 percent oxygen content \n     requirement for RFG under section 211 of the Clean Air Act is \n     eliminated 270 days after enacted, except that it is \n     eliminated upon enactment for California.\n       To ensure that elimination of the oxygen requirement and \n     the phase out of MTBE do not increase toxic air pollutant \n     emissions, within 270 days EPA must promulgate regulations to \n     ensure that each refinery or importer of RFG maintains its \n     toxics emissions reduction performance achieved in 1999-2000. \n     If that performance is not achieved in any region, PADD, of \n     the country, EPA must modify the regulations for all RFG to \n     assure performance.\n       EPA will promulgate revisions to the RFG regulations to \n     require that the more stringent VOC performance requirements \n     of Southern region RFG apply to all RFG.\n       Section 835. Public Health and Environmental Impacts of \n     Fuels and Fuel Additives. EPA is required to regularly \n     collect information from manufacturers on the public health \n     and environmental effects, including water quality, of fuels \n     and fuel additives. EPA must also study a variety of \n     potential MTBE substitutes.\n       Section 836. Analyses of Motor Vehicle Fuel Changes. Within \n     5 years, EPA will conduct and submit to Congress a broad \n     analysis of the changes in emissions of air pollutants and \n     air quality due to the changes in the use of motor vehicle \n     fuel that occurred as a result of this act.\n       Section 837. Additional Opt-in Areas Under Reformulated \n     Gasoline Program. Any Governor of a State in the ozone \n     transport region, 13 north/eastern States, may opt the whole \n     State in to the reformulated gasoline program so long as \n     there is a sufficient capacity to supply RFG. EPA shall \n     implement this change not later than 2 years after the \n     Governor's request, but opt in States must stay in the \n     program for at least 4 years.\n       Section 838. Federal Enforcement of State Fuels \n     Requirements. States may have the Federal Government enforce \n     a State's controls on fuels or fuel additives if the controls \n     are part of an approved SIP and otherwise meet the \n     requirements of section 211(c)(4)(c).\n       Section 839. Fuel System Requirements Harmonization Study. \n     EPA and DOE will conduct a study of motor vehicle fuel \n     requirements and report to Congress by June 1, 2006, with \n     recommendations for improving air quality, reducing costs to \n     consumers and producers, and to increase supply liquidity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2321-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2321-S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU Mr. President, I am in support of a piece of \nlegislation offered by my good friend and colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins. Before I begin, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend her for her distinguished leadership in this area. Throughout \nher career as a U.S. Senator, she has worked hard to develop laws that \nreflect the healthcare needs of the people of Maine and of the Nation. \nEach and every proposal to help increase access to health care that she \nhas put forward has been based on sound principles and innovative \nstrategies. This bill is no exception.\n  Almost 39 million Americans have no access to health insurance. In \nLouisiana, almost 1 million people go to bed each night worried about \nwhat they would do if they or their family member becomes seriously \nill. That is one out of five people in our State. As a result, a great \nnumber of Americans are forced to decide between medical treatment and \nother life essentials such as food and shelter or worse, forgo \ntreatment all together. The research has confirmed for us what common \nsense has lead us to believe all along. In a recent survey, 39 percent \nof those Americans without insurance said that they put off necessary \nmedical treatments or tests because they could not afford them.\n  In order to understand the issues affecting the uninsured, it is \nimportant that we ask ourselves, who are the uninsured? Nearly 30 \npercent of the 39 million uninsured Americans are women of child \nbearing age; 12 million of the uninsured are children. More than 8 out \nof 10 uninsured are in working families. Nearly 8 out of every 10 are \nmiddle income. These statistics point to serious gaps in our health \ncare delivery system, gaps that can and need to be filled\n  This bill attempts to fill these gaps. The Access to Affordable \nHealth Care Act, which I am introducing today, is a seven-point plan \nthat combines a variety of public and private approaches to\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nmake quality health care coverage more affordable and available. The \nbill focuses on three key populations: small business employees; \npregnant women and children as well as working individuals. In \naddition, it supports programs targeted at providing these populations \ngreater access to affordable coverage. Let me explain in greater \ndetail.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act establishes a tax credit for \nsmall businesses to help meet the company's cost of providing health \ninsurance. In addition, it provides grants to help states develop \nhealth insurance cooperatives for small companies.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act gives states the option to \nexpand the Children's Health Insurance Program for pregnant women and \neligible children. Because of statewide efforts under LACHIP, more than \n100,000 Louisiana children now have health insurance.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act provides a refundable tax \ncredit for low and middle income workers who don't have employer-\nprovided coverage. It also improves the welfare-to-work transition by \nbridging the gap when newly employed workers lose their Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  Providing access to insurance is not only the right thing to do it is \nthe smart thing to do. Uninsured patients are 3 times more likely to \nrequire hospitalization for avoidable conditions. The uninsured have a \ngreater chance of being diagnosed with late stage cancer. They are 2 \ntimes as likely to die of breast cancer. Because they are often unable \nto avail themselves on preventive care, the majority of medical \nattention they receive is catastrophic and delivered by an emergency \nroom. What these statistics show is that when we provide greater access \nto health insurance we not only save lives, but we also save millions \nof dollars in long term health care costs.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague from Maine for her efforts in \nproducing this important legislation. I look forward to working with \nher and other like minded colleagues towards reaching the day when all \nAmericans are insured.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2322-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE LATE HERMAN EUGENE TALMADGE\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recall the memory of my devoted cousin and loyal friend. \nIt is with great sadness that I remember my former colleague here in \nthe United States Senate, the late Herman Talmadge, who shared this \nfloor with me for many years. He passed away yesterday at his home in \nHampton, GA.\n  Herman Eugene Talmadge was born in 1913 to Eugene and Mattie Thurmond \nTalmadge in McRae, GA. He graduated from the University of Georgia \nSchool of Law in 1936 and then went on to practice law in Atlanta with \nhis father. He continued to practice law until he felt a patriotic duty \nto volunteer for World War II. He entered the United States Navy in \n1941 as an ensign. He was discharged from the Navy as a lieutenant \ncommander in 1945. Senator Talmadge was also the capable Governor of \nthe fine State of Georgia from 1948 to 1955. As Governor, Senator \nTalmadge focused his efforts on the farmers and rural areas of Georgia.\n  Senator Talmadge distinguished himself in the United States Senate. \nDuring his tenure, he served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nvice chairman of the Finance Committee, and on the Watergate committee \nhearings. Senator Talmadge continued to support rural areas and the \nfarming community in the United States Senate when he helped pass the \nRural Development Act of 1972. This act promoted the development of \njobs and infrastructure in rural areas. He gained much of his national \nrecognition during the year long Watergate committee hearings.\n  Senator Talmadge may have best been known for the outstanding \nservices that he provided to the good people of Georgia. He tried to \nprovide the best possible service to everyone that he possibly could. \nHe never forgot those who voted for him, and he was always willing to \nhelp his constituents. It was a combination of this constituent support \nand his strong work ethic that made him so hard to beat in an election.\n  Senator Talmadge was a public spirited, patriotic citizen. He will \nlong be remembered for all his great works in the United States Senate, \nand for his unwavering commitment and support to the people of the \nPeach State. He was not only a statesman, but also a true southern \ngentleman, and he will undoubtedly be missed by a large circle of \nfamily and friends.\n  My heartfelt thoughts and Prayers go out to the entire Talmadge \nFamily. May God's richest blessings rest on them and sustain them in \nthis time of sorrow and grief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2322-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 2002\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on the occasion of women's \nhistory month, I am proud to honor the long tradition of New York women \nwho made history. And there is no more appropriate place to begin than \nwith three women heroes who gave their lives to save others at the \nWorld Trade Center. Officer Kathy Mazza, Emergency Medical Technician \nYamel Merino, and Officer Moira Smith were recently named Women of \nDistinction for their heroic acts on September 11, and for their \nhistory of service to the people of New York.\n  Kathy Mazza served as the first female commandant of the Port \nAuthority Police Training Academy. Yamel Merino was recognized as New \nYork's emergency medical technician of the year last year, and Moira \nSmith previously received the Distinguished Duty Medal for rescuing \npeople after a subway crash.\n  On September 11 these three heroes brought the same commitment to \ntheir jobs that they showed every day, willing to put their lives on \nthe line at a moment's notice for fellow New Yorkers who they did not \nknow. We will never forget their selfless acts of courage and \ncommitment to duty on that day, and how they worked side by side with \ntheir brothers to escort as many people as possible to safety. Our \nthoughts remain with their families who have suffered an immeasurable \nloss during this tragedy, and who are comforted by the knowledge that \ntheir loved ones acted with honor and bravery.\n  Years from now their stories will be told alongside the stories of so \nmany courageous New York women who devoted their lives to others and \nshaped history through their actions. After all, New York was the \nbirthplace of one of the largest social movements of this country's \nhistory. In Seneca Falls in 1848, women came together to issue the \nDeclaration of Sentiments that served as a launching point for the \nwomen's rights movement.\n  So many of our foremothers whose contributions are now legendary \ncalled New York home. From the great abolitionist Harriet Tubman who \nprovided safe passage to her sisters and brothers who sought freedom \nfrom slavery, to Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony who never \ngave up in the movement for women's suffrage, to the great labor leader \nKate Mullany, New York women have always made a difference.\n  When celebrating this women's history month, we pause to salute the \naccomplishments of women who gave so much of themselves to this \ncountry. Children generations from now will come to understand our \ngreat loss on September 11 by learning the stories of Kathy Mazza, \nYamel Merino, Moira Smith and all of the firefighters, police officers \nand first responders to whom we owe so much. Today and everyday we need \nto do our part to tell their stories and to honor their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2322-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2322-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The four assailants used anti-gay slurs while beating \nthe victim.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\nagainst the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement \nEnhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become substance.

Steve has \ndistinguished himself with a rewarding career as a public school \nteacher and as an accomplished State Representative in the Rhode Island \nGeneral Assembly.\n  In 1972, Steve began his teaching career in the Exeter West Greenwich \nSchool System where he has taught Social Studies, History and \nGeography. Even as a young child, Steve dreamed of being a teacher, and \nhis enthusiasm, dedication and professionalism over the past three \ndecades has had a profound effect on our community and in the lives of \ngenerations of young people.\n  Steve is described as a hardworking and imaginative teacher who has a \nspecial gift for relating to his students. He is modest, friendly and \nwitty and easily earns their respect and admiration. He has a deep \nbelief that every student can learn and that each has contribution to \nmake. Moreover, Steve has been a leader in the School Department and \nhas chaired the school improvement team and coordinated its \nprofessional development plan. He can be credited with bringing \nstandards-based training to the school and has worked to provide \ngraduate course work in support of these efforts. In addition to his \nclassroom duties, Steve also devotes his time and talents as the Coach \nof the Jr. High Soccer Team and the Cross Country Team.\n  In 2000, Steve Anderson was honored as the recipient of both the \nCharles B. Willard Achievement Award and the Alumni Service Award from \nhis alma mater Rhode Island College. The Charles B. Willard Award is \npresented to graduates who have brought honor to the College by \ndistinguished service in their field. Additionally, the Alumni Service \nAward honors those who have made a contribution to the College by \nunselfishly devoting their time, talents and resources or to an \nindividual who has made a contribution to the state or nation which \nreflects ideals of service to the community. Indeed, Steve Anderson \nepitomizes the spirit of both these coveted awards.\n  In the General Assembly, Steve has been a leader on education issues \nand successfully sought funding for National Board Certification for \nProfessional Teaching Standards in Rhode Island, for innovative reading \nprograms for pre-school children and for the Rhode Island Geographic \nAlliance.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Stephen J. Anderson for \nhis commitment to education and public service. He inspires us with his \nexample of leadership, and I join with a grateful community in \ncommending him for his efforts in the classroom, as a policy maker and \nas outstanding Rhode Island citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2323-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING WOMEN 4 WOMEN, INC.\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I offer a proper salute to \nWomen 4 Women, Inc. of Greater Louisville, KY for its significant \nsocial and economic contributions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Women 4 Women, founded and currently chaired by Elaine Musselman in \n1993, is a not-for-profit organization, which aims to bring about \npositive social change by addressing existing issues confronting women \nand bringing these particular issues to a proper level of awareness in \nthe community. In order to accomplish this goal, Women 4 Women offer \ntheir various resources to chosen community organizations and assist \nthem in building adequate channels of communication to enhance their \ncapacity to solve social and economic problems affecting women. Women 4 \nWomen has also achieved an extraordinary level of success with their \nfundraising efforts. They have developed one of the most respected \ncharity events held in Kentucky with their annual women's golf \ntournament. Also included with the golf tournament is a kick-off \nluncheon featuring a national speaker, a 5K run/walk, a family festival \nand a music celebration. Over the years, Women 4 Women has amazingly \ndonated more than $500,000 for various causes through their fund-\nraising capabilities. This group, made up of over one hundred women, is \ndedicated to their causes, diligent in their efforts, and determined to \nbring about change.\n  Women 4 Women deserves special attention for unveiling their \nBenchmark 2000 partnership program in Jefferson County, KY for which \nthey won an Ogden Newell & Welch Inc. Award. Specifically, Benchmark \n2000 aims to study the status of women and girls in Jefferson County \nthrough strong coalition building between citizens and government in \norder to improve the overall economic and social status of females. By \ncombining existing data and information from citizens, government \nofficials, and service providers, the diligent participants of this \nprogram hope to, over time, address the existing needs of females and \nbring about positive social change.\n  I would like to express my sincerest admiration to all members of \nWomen 4 Women for their hard work in the area of women's rights and \ncommitment to the greater good of the community.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to \npay tribute to two pillars of the Community of Maine, Buzz Fitzgerald \nand Joel Abromson. How can I describe what these two men meant to their \nbeloved home State? These words of then President-elect John Fitzgerald \nKennedy provide a start: ``And when, at some future date, the high \ncourt of history sits in judgment on each of us, recording whether in \nour brief span of service we fulfilled our responsibilities to the \nstate, our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be \nmeasured by the answers to four questions: first, were we truly men of \ncourage; second, were we truly men of judgment; third, were we truly \nmen of integrity; and finally, were we truly men of dedication?''\n  These words, first uttered by President-elect Kennedy when I was an \nelementary school student in Caribou, began to have real meaning for me \nwhen they were quoted regularly in speeches by my old boss and mentor, \nBill Cohen, a gifted orator and, in many ways, a walking Bartlett's.\n  But the full impact of Kennedy's glorious phrases struck me with \nspecial poignancy this year as I pondered the loss of two of Maine's \nleading citizens, two good friends, two wonderful men who were taken \nfrom us while still in their early 60's, at the height of their powers.\n  One was born in St. John Plantation in far northern Maine, the other \nin Auburn. One moved when he was one year old, the other after college. \nBut each became synonymous with his community, Buzz Fitzgerald with \nBath, and Joe Abromson with Portland.\n  Each contributed mightily to his company, to his community, to his \nState. Each had a family that extended well beyond actual relatives to \nMainers in all walks of life. Each made the lives of thousands of \npeople better, and each did it without apparent effort and without a \nhint of self-righteousness.\n  It is often said that if you want a job done well, find a busy man. \nEach of these remarkable individuals ran a company, each possessed a \nbreathtaking list of civic and charitable credentials, and each \ndemonstrated a willingness to embrace causes that would send many \nbusinessmen fleeing for cover.\n  As I watch Buzz become a champion of reproductive rights for women, \nor Joel become a leading advocate for equal rights for gays and \nlesbians, I watched the embodiment of Kennedy's four defining \ncharacteristics: courage, judgment, integrity, dedication. Those four \nqualities were an immense aid to Joel as he championed a state law that \nwould outlaw discrimination against Maine citizens who are gay or \nlesbian. Even though he did not prevail, he led his noble fight for gay \nrights with courage and integrity, in a manner that is to be commended.\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\n  Indeed, I saw two men who could immerse themselves in the most \nemotional of issues, those causes that rubbed nerves raw in public \ndebate, and I could see them emerge without enemies. Disagreeing \nwithout being disagreeable is a high art form, and these two men \ncreated a portrait of what informed public discourse should be.\n\n  Buzz and Joel took their jobs and their commitments seriously, but \nnever themselves. A rich store of humor, often self-deprecating, was \nnever far from their lips. Successful people rarely lack charm, and \neach possessed it in abundance. Whether it was the union leadership \nhammering out a contract agreement with Buzz at the Bath Iron Works or \nJoel's colleagues on both sides of the aisle negotiating with him on a \nbill in the Maine Senate, friends and adversaries alike were drawn to \nboth men because they invariably deserved to be trusted. It may be \nhackneyed to say their word was their bond. But it was. Always.\n  A friend of mine who knew both men, but was not an intimate of \neither, tells a story that is illustrative. When my friend's father \ndied in Florida, the first contribution made in his memory came from \nJoel Abromson. And when Buzzy's sister, Gayle Corey, died of a virulent \nform of cancer, Buzz did not wait to receive expressions of condolence; \nrather, he sent notes to Gayle's friends thanking them for befriending \nher. One does not easily forget gestures such as these, and there were \nthousands of others. In the final days and weeks of his life, Buzz \ncalled other cancer patients trying to cheer them up.\n  Fortunately for all of us who benefited from knowing them, many Maine \nleaders, led by Governor King, participated in exceptionally moving \npublic tributes to these two remarkable individuals while they were \nstill alive to hear the accolades. Having spoken to both of them \nshortly before they died, I know that they were touched by the \noutpouring of appreciation for lives well lived.\n  Losing public treasures like Joel and Buzz when they had so much more \nto give reminds us anew that life is unfair, as President Kennedy often \nnoted. Fair or not, our state has lost two remarkable citizens and we \nwill not see their like again soon.\n  To me, they are the standard by which we should measure ourselves. \nEach of us will honor their memory most appropriately if we try to \nemulate the service they gave so generously to our State and its \npeople.\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2324-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:\n\n       POM-220. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to permit \n     states to promote long-term care insurance under Medicaid; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 109\n\n       Whereas, As the number of elderly in America continues its \n     swift growth, the issue of long-term care will present an \n     increasing number of problems for our Nation. Demographic \n     trends leave little doubt that, without significant changes, \n     the publicly funded Medicaid program may be stretched beyond \n     its capacity to respond adequately to the needs of our \n     country's poor and elderly; and\n       Whereas, The challenge of paying for long-term care most \n     often ends up being handled by Medicaid. The Federal-State \n     partnership of Medicaid, which is designed to provide health \n     coverage for the poor, ends up covering the long-term care \n     costs for millions of older Americans who become poor only \n     because their resources are exhausted by the high costs of \n     nursing homes or in-home care. Approximately one of every \n     three Medicaid dollars is spent on long-term care; and\n       Whereas, While each state determines the eligibility \n     requirements for Medicaid based on specific factors, general \n     eligibility thresholds limit the assets that can be preserved \n     by a Medicaid recipient and spouse; and\n       Whereas, There is a bill before Congress, H.R. 1041, that \n     seeks to permit states more flexibility to enter into long-\n     term care partnerships under Medicaid in order to promote the \n     use of long-term care insurance. Clearly, any measure to \n     increase insurance in this area would be most helpful for our \n     country; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to permit states to \n     promote long-term care insurance under Medicaid; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-221. A joint resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Vermont relative to the \n     desecration of the United States Flag; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                     Joint Senate Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, the flag of the United States is one of the \n     greatest symbols of our nation, and\n       Whereas, this symbol represents the defining principles of \n     our country, and\n       Whereas, Americans have placed their lives in harm's way \n     and, in hundreds of thousands of cases, have sacrificed their \n     lives defending these principles, and\n       Whereas, their willingness to sacrifice their lives in \n     defense of these cherished principles demonstrates one of the \n     purest and most commendable forms of patriotism, and\n       Whereas, these patriots have focused on the flag as the \n     ultimate symbol for which they and their families have \n     sacrificed, and\n       Whereas, the flag serves important ceremonial functions at \n     public gatherings, funerals, celebrations of patriotic \n     holidays, parades and countless other gatherings, and\n       Whereas, respect for the flag and the various protocols \n     attendant thereto (such as proper display, proper folding, \n     saluting, et cetera) serves as an introduction, for many \n     young Americans to the symbol of our nation, and\n       Whereas, we the American people, accord our flag a unique \n     position of respect, love and admiration for the principles \n     it represents, and recognize the importance of providing \n     dignity and honor to this symbol, and\n       Whereas, these principles include the protection of \n     individual freedoms enumerated in the First Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution including free speech, free press, \n     peaceable assembly, and petitions for the redress of \n     grievances, now therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives, That \n     the General Assembly expresses its respect and admiration for \n     our United States Flag, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly expresses its \n     condemnation of all acts of flag desecration, and similar \n     displays of disrespect for the United States Flag, and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the Congress of \n     the United States to ensure that proper respect and treatment \n     will always be afforded to the United States Flag, and that \n     the Congress explore all avenues available, which may include \n     a constitutional amendment, a statutory change and a public \n     education program, to protect the United States Flag from \n     physical desecration, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State transmit copies of \n     this resolution to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate \n     and all members of the Vermont Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2324-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2324-S2325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5876.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nenhance the access of Medicare beneficiaries who live in medically \nunderserved areas to critical primary and preventive health care \nbenefits to improve the Medicare+Choice program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Bond and Inouye entitled the ``Medicare Safety Net Access \nAct of 2002,'' or ``Access 2002,'' would improve services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and protect a critical mission of health centers, to \nprovide access to care to underserved rural, frontier, and inner-city \ncommunities.\n  Community health centers, CHC's, provide primary and preventive care \nto more than 700,000 medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries, \nincluding over 20,000 in New Mexico. Health centers also provide \ncritical support services that help seniors more easily access care. In \nmany cases, the local health center may be the only source of primary \nand preventive care for Medicare beneficiaries in a community.\n  While hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries turn to health \ncenters for care, many centers struggle to provide services to these \npatients. Current Medicare regulations cause health centers significant \nfinancial losses that have a direct impact on access to care. In \naddition, the Medicare federally qualified health center, FQHC, benefit \nhas not been modernized to include many of the new preventive and other \nservices added to the Medicare package by Congress in recent years \nagain undermining the critical role that health centers play in \nproviding access to care.\n  To address these and other issues, Senators Bond, Inouye, and I are \nintroducing the ``Medicare Safety Net Access Act of 2002'', also known \nas ``Access 2002.'' The legislation would address the following \nproblems.\n  With respect to payment issues, the bill ensures that Medicare covers \nthe cost of providing care to Medicare beneficiaries at CHC's. Congress \nprovides more than $1.3 billion in section 330 funding to CHC's to \nprovide care to\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nthe uninsured. When Medicare fails to cover the costs of care for \nMedicare beneficiaries, CHC's must make up for the shortfall through a \nvariety of mechanisms including drawing from the section 330 grants, \nwhich are supposed to be dedicated for care to the uninsured.\n  Medicare has historically provided such cost-based reimbursement to \nother safety net providers, such as certain rural hospitals, cancer \nhospitals, and children's hospitals. Moreover, Congress passed \nlegislation in 2000 to protect health centers from the same problem in \nMedicaid.\n  The legislation assures that CHC's are afforded the same protections \nthrough the Medicare program so that Federal funding for the uninsured \nis not redirected to pay for shortfalls from Medicare patients. It does \nso by eliminating the per visit payment cap on health centers' Medicare \npayments. In the Medicare statute, Congress clearly intended to cover \nthe cost of a health centers' Medicare patients, but the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, applies an arbitrary ``payment \ncap'' that is not in the Federal statute. For many health centers, the \ncap has significantly reduced their Medicare payments, particularly for \npatients that have chronic illnesses, and forced them to reduce care \nthey would have otherwise provided for their uninsured patients. Our \nbipartisan legislation prevents the imposition of the Medicare payment \ncap for health centers, and again, mirrors cost-based reimbursement \nthat a number of other safety-net providers receive through Medicare.\n\n  The bill also extends payment protections to Medicare+Choice. This is \nachieved by establishing a supplemental or ``wrap-around'' payment much \nlike the one that currently exists in the Medicaid program for FQHC's \ncontracting with managed care organizations. As this has worked so well \nin the Medicaid program, Congress should also enact a ``wrap-around'' \npayment in the Medicare+Choice program to ensure CHC's are having their \nreasonable costs appropriately covered.\n  In addition, the legislation eliminates regulatory hurdles that \nimpair health centers' ability to provide preventive ambulatory \nservices to Medicare patients. While CHC's provide primary care \nservices to their patients, Medicare does not cover anything other than \nthe most basic services provided at CHC's. Such services that health \ncenters may provide that Medicare does not pay on a cost basis, \ninclude: mammograms, nutrition services, or laboratory or x-ray \nservices. Some of these services have been recently been added by \nCongress but the Medicare FQHC benefit has not been updated to reflect \nthose changes. This legislation would expand the services that health \ncenters could provide to medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Furthermore, the bill ensures the availability of these services to \nthose enrolling in Medicare managed care but requiring Medicare+Choice \nplans to contract with a sufficient number of FQHC's to make FQHC \nservices accessible to plan enrollees.\n  And finally, the ``Medicare Safety Net Access Act of 2002'' \nestablishes a safe harbor in the federal anti-kickback statute for \narrangements between health centers and other providers that improve \naccess to services for low-income patients in underserved communities. \nHealth centers and other providers often participate in arrangements \ndesigned to expand their ability to provide care in the poor \ncommunities they serve. However, these arrangements can potentially \nexpose health centers under the federal anti-kickback laws.\n  For nine years, a proposed ``safe harbor'' has been pending before \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the \nInspector General, HHS IOG, that would allow health centers to contract \nwith other providers to improve health services to low-income patients \nwithout fear of being in violation of the anti-kickback law. To qualify \nunder the proposed safe harbor, the arrangement would have to meet \nstrict criteria to protect against fraud and abuse, including the \ndemonstration of a community benefit through the savings of grant \ndollars intended for care for the uninsured or an increase in the \navailability of services to a medically underserved community. There \nare additional requirements, such as assurances that the arrangement to \nnot limit a patient's freedom of choice, in addition to any others that \nthe IOG deems are needed as long as they are consistent with \ncongressional intent.\n  Community health centers enjoy strong bipartisan support in Congress \nbecause they are cost-effective providers of services that keep \npatients healthy and out of costly specialty and emergency settings. As \nmore people prepare to enter the Medicare program, it is vital that \nbeneficiaries in rural, frontier, and inner-city areas have access to \nthe full range of Medicare benefits. Health centers are the vehicle to \nmake that happen. I urge passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordererd to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nestablish a national cemetery for veterans in the Jacksonville, \nFlorida, metropolitan area; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this Nation honors in many ways \nthe service of those who have worn the uniform of our Armed Forces and \nplaced themselves in harm's way to defend our freedom and way of life. \nThis Nation raises great monuments to commemorate the many battles and \nthe countless heroes of those battles fought throughout our history. \nThis Nation sets aside special days to remember the sacrifice of \ngenerations of Americans who have stepped forward in America's defense.\n  This Nation hallows ground where we lay to rest those who have served \nus in our hour of greatest need. Our National Cemetery System is not \nonly hallowed ground, national cemeteries are monuments to military \nservice, the places where we go on those special days to pay tribute to \nthe sacrifice of so many in our history.\n  Today I offer legislation to establish a national cemetery near \nJacksonville, FL, to meet the needs of thousands of veterans who have \nchosen to live out their lives in northeast Florida and southeast \nGeorgia. Florida's veteran population is the second largest in the \nNation. Right now in northern Florida and southern Georgia, there are \nnearly half-a-million veterans. Florida has the Nation's oldest veteran \npopulation and one of the largest remaining populations of World War II \nveterans. We are all aware that this greatest of generations is passing \naway at higher and higher rates.\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\n  Unfortunately for these hundreds of thousands of veterans in Florida \nand Georgia, the nearest national cemetery is located in Bushnell, FL, \nwhich is 3-hour drive from Jacksonville. The national cemetery in St. \nAugustine is full and closed. The nearest national cemetery in Georgia \nis in Marietta just north of Atlanta.\n  Our veterans have made great sacrifices to protect our country in her \ndays of peril, and certainly deserve to rest in honored respect in a \nnational cemetery. To honor the veterans of northeast Florida and \nsoutheast Georgia, we must act now, in order to have this facility \nestablished by 2006 when our World War II veterans' deaths are expected \nto reach their peak.\n  Senators Graham and Cleland and I are honored and proud to sponsor \nthis important bill, and we look forward to the support of our \ncolleagues as we provide for our veterans who have given so much for \nour country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2069\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     establish, in accordance with chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, a national cemetery in the Jacksonville, \n     Florida, metropolitan area to serve the needs of veterans and \n     their families.\n       (b) Consultation in Selection of Site.--Before selecting \n     the site for the national cemetery established under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with--\n       (1) appropriate officials of the State of Florida and local \n     officials of the Jacksonville metropolitan area, and\n       (2) appropriate officials of the United States, including \n     the Administrator of General Services, with respect to land \n     belonging to the United States in that area that would be \n     suitable to establish the national cemetery under subsection \n     (a).\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report on the establishment of the national cemetery under \n     subsection (a). The report shall set forth a schedule for \n     such establishment and an estimate of the costs associated \n     with such establishment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 2070. A bill to amend part A of title IV to exclude child care \nfrom the determination of the 5-year limit on assistance under the \ntemporary assistance to needy families program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Children \nFirst Act. Since 1996, federal funding for child care assistance under \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, has significally \nincreased, making it possible for states to provide more low-income \nfamilies with child care assistance and expand initiatives to improve \nthe quality of child care. This has been an extremely important \nendeavor. Access to quality childcare helps families to work and \nchildren to succeed. Yet, we must do more. Only one out of seven \nchildren eligible for assistance through the CCDBG program receives a \nsubsidy, approximately 12.9 million eligible children without \nassistance. In March 2000, a family earning as little as $25,000 could \nnot qualify for child care assistance in most States. The need for \nchild care assistance is likely to significantly increase in the near \nfuture. Many States are currently faced with serious budget shortfalls \nthat threaten the progress they have made in the provision of child \ncare in recent years. The administration's recently proposed welfare \nplan would increase work-related requirements for welfare recipients, \nwhich if passed will create an even greater demand for child care. Even \nif this aspect of the administration's welfare proposal is rejected as \nunworkable, which I believe is the case, we must make providing high-\nquality child care to low-income families a priority in this Congress. \nThe Children First Act will do just that.\n  Increased availability of child care enables low-income parent on \nwelfare, and parents trying to stay off welfare, to work and support \ntheir families. According to a recent administration report, employment \namong single mothers with young children grew in recent years fro 58 \npercent to 73 percent. The administration noted: ``These employment \nincreased by single mothers and former welfare mothers are \nunprecedented.'' Most people agree that employment gains among single \nmothers can only be sustained if families have access to dependable \nchild care. Studies show that when child care is available, and when \nfamilies get help paying for care, they are more likely to work.\n  When I talk to people in my home State of New Mexico about welfare \nreform, they identify access to childcare as the most important work \nsupport we can provide. In New Mexico, 57 percent of children under 6 \nlive in households in which all parents work. Approximately 67 percent \nof these households have income less than 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty threshold. Yet less than 25 percent of children under the age \nof 6 eligible under federal law for childcare assistance are receiving \nassistance in New Mexico. Families with both parent working aen earning \nhe minimum wage must pay 49 percent of their income on childcare for \none child. Without subsidized care, many of these families can not \nafford to work.\n  When I talk to people in New Mexico about improving our education \nsystem, the need for improved school readiness is often theotp concern. \nImproved quality of child care is an important component in that effort \nas well. Quality child care provides low-income children with the early \nlearning experiences that they need to do well in school. We know that \nchildren in high-quality early care score higher on reading and math \ntests, are more likely to complete high school and go onto college, and \nare less likely to repeat a grade or get charged in juvenile court. In \ncontrast, children in poor quality child care have been found to be \nmore likely to be referred to special education, delayed in language \nand reading skills and to display more aggression toward other children \nand adults.\n  In the recently enacted No Child Left Behind Act, Congress and the \nPresident signaled a new commitment to improving educational outcomes \nin our schools. The legislation required states, school districts, and \ncommunities to close achievement gaps between disadvantaged students \nand their peers. In his State of the Union Address earlier this year, \nPresident Bush acknowledged the important of early learning and made it \na priority for his administration. Increased federal support for child \ncare is critical to supporting high-quality early learning programs. We \nshould work on a bipartisan basis--as we did with respect to the No \nChild Left Behind Act--towards this goal.\n  We must increase access to child car, but we must also do more to \nensure the improved quality of child care. Many families in New Mexico, \neven those receiving assistance, cannot provide their children with a \nhigh quality child car setting. In part, this is caused by the low \nreimbursement rates provided due to limited funding. For example, in \nNew Mexico the reimbursement rate is $396, while the market rate \naveraged $470. As a result the higher quality provider often do not \naccept state-subsidized children into their programs.\n  A lack of qualified care provider also make the provision of high \nquality care difficult. Childcare workers in New Mexico make, on \naverage, $6.24 per hour, less than half the average weekly wage. Less \nthan 20 percent of these workers receive employee benefits such as \nhealth insurance and paid sick leave.\n  The Children First Act will address these issues by increasing \nfunding for the Child Care Development Block Grant by $11.2 billion \nover five years. With these funds, states will be able to serve \napproximately 1 million more children nationally. The bill also \ncontains an increase in the quality set-aside in CCDBG, which will \nprovide funds specifically for efforts to improve quality. States can \nuse these funds to provide training to care providers and create and \nenforce standards of care. The bill also makes common sense changes to \nthe TANF program that support work by enabling states to increase the \navailability and improve the quality of child care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. \nIt will help low-income families work and help prepare our children to \nsucceed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n  S. 2071. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe collection of tolls form vehicles or military equipment under the \nactual physical control of a uniformed member of the Armed Forces, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a \nbill that will exempt our Nation's military vehicles and equipment from \nbeing subject to paying tolls on America's roads, bridges and ferries. \nAs the Ranking Member of Environment & Public Works Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over our highway system, and as a senior member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I believe that this an appropriate action \nlong overdue. In this time of war and heightened threat to America's \nshores, the thought of all units in an Army troop convoy digging into \ntheir pockets to drop quarters into the nets at tollbooths on the \nJersey turnpike is absurd. When we created the interstate highway \nsystem in the 1950's under the strong leadership of President \nEisenhower, a primary motivation of the former General of the Army was \nto facilitate the movement of men and material in times of crisis. Yet \nin the intervening years, as toll roads have been established, no one \nat the Federal level has thought to exempt the armed forces form being \nslowed down to pay these levies. While the Federal Government has not \nacted, many States, most notably my State of New Hampshire, has seen \nfit to exempt those who are protecting us from paying these tolls. \nAmerica's armed forces deserve all the help we can give them. The \nshortsighted among us might say that all we need to do is to provide \nsome expedited form of payment, so that the tolls can be collected \nfaster. I say that our troops deserve better. There is just no reason \nto subject our military to paying tolls in order to use America's roads \nwhen their only reason for being on those roads is to protect America. \nTherefore, my bill provides for a complete exemption from tolls, and \nnot just half-way measures to simplify the payment. But my bill goes \neven further. In the same vein, I believe that it is essential, should \na crisis arise, or God forbid, should America again be attacked, to \nspeed our troops through the toll facilities. Accordingly, I have \nwritten the bill a provision to require a toll facility, in times of an \nemergency declared by the President, to reserve a dedicated support for \nAmerica's military by voting for this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2071\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide States with the option of covering intensive community mental \nhealth treatment under the Medicaid Program, to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce today a \ncritical piece of mental health legislation with my colleagues Senators \nBingaman and Breaux. This legislation, the Medicaid Intensive Community \nMental Health Act, will assist and encourage States to provide \ncomprehensive intensive mental health services through the Medicaid \nProgram.\n  Since deinstitutionalization, too many people with severe mental \nillnesses have fallen through the cracks of our mental health system in \npart because too many States and localities have not established \nintensive community-based programs to assist those with severe mental \nillness.\n  In 1999, the Supreme Court rules in its Olmstead decision that \nindividuals with disabilities, including mental illness, who are \ncapable of living in a community setting, must be placed in less \nrestrictive settings. Two years after this decision, my State of New \nJersey and States nationwide are struggling to improve and expand \ncommunity-based mental health services in order to ensure that the \nappropriate services are in place for the mentally ill so that they can \nlead productive lives outside of the institution. And, let me be clear \nthat this applies to children just as it applies to adults. I know my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, has expressed deep concern \nabout the hundreds of youth with mental illness in his State who are \nbeing held at detention centers because there are very limited \ncommunity-based mental health treatment options.\n  These children do not deserve to be treated as criminals, they need \nand deserve access to treatment, counseling, and other rehabilitative \nand supportive services. We need to give States the flexibility and the \nresources they need to make these options available. Currently, Federal \nfinancing for community-based mental health care is so complex and \nburdensome that States are unable to offer a comprehensive, coordinated \nset of community-based intensive mental health services with a single \npoint of access. Rather, those in dire need of these services are \nforced to rely on a patchwork of uncoordinated programs with missing \nservice components.\n  Currently, States must apply for six optional Medicaid waivers in \norder to provide these services. This legislation would help fill the \ncracks in our mental health care system by allowing States, through a \nsingle policy decision, to finance the entire array of community-based \nservices that individuals with severe mental illness need. The Medicaid \nIntensive Community Mental Health Act would allow States to choose the \n``intensive community mental health treatment'' option under Medicaid, \nwhich would allow States to provide services such as psychiatric \nrehabilitation, crisis residential treatment, medication education and \nmanagement, integrated treatment services for individuals with co-\noccurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders, and family \npsycho-education services, among others, in a coordinated manner.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, there are about 3,000 people residing \nin psychiatric hospitals. About half of these people, or 1,500 people, \nare eligible to be released, but, due to a lack of intensive community-\nbased treatment, they continue to remain needlessly institutionalized. \nIf passed, this legislation would help States to create an integrated \nsystem of intensive community-based mental health care for those with \nsevere mental illness. Not only would this option improve community-\nbased services for the mentally ill, but it would also give states a \nmechanism to assist people who otherwise require costly \nhospitalization.\n  Far too often in our Nation, individuals with severe mental illness \nare either unable to access appropriate mental health care or have \nrepeated but ultimately unsuccessful hospitalizations. And \nunfortunately, untreated mental illness has led many sufferers to \nbecome homeless. It has also led many to commit crimes. Ultimately, \nthis legislation will help States respond to the problems associated \nwith deinstitutionalization, homelessness, and the criminalization of \nmental illness, and in doing so, it will help people with severe mental \nillness to live better lives in their communities and with their \nfamilies.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Breaux, for \njoining me today to introduce this important legislation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/22/senate-section/article/S2331-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3075.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 186, S. 1499.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (S. 1499) to provide assistance to small business concerns \nadversely impacted by the terrorist attacks perpetrated against the \nUnited States on September 11, 2001, and for other purposes.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3076\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand Senators Kerry and Bond have a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration, that the amendment be \nagreed to, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3076) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would urge that there be no \nfurther delay, no further obstruction, and that the Senate act--at long \nlast--to pass a bill that is very important to so many small businesses \nin this country crippled by the economic fall-out of September 11, \nincluding businesses that were already struggling before September 11 \nduring the recession and are now faced with even more difficult \nprospects.\n  For months, tens of thousands of small businesses have been asking \nfor help--an immediate helping hand--just to keep their businesses \ngoing--particularly working capital to meet payroll and pay the bills--\nbut they have been forced to make ends meet by using credit cards and \ndepleting personal savings because small businesses doesn't have the \nsame access as big\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nbusiness--to credit or otherwise. Left in the lurch by congressional \ninaction and delay, these businesses and their employees paid the \nprice.\n  Now it is time that the Senate delivers the relief the vast majority \nof us were prepared to deliver in the first weeks after September 11, \nurgent relief delayed by partisan gamesmanship.\n  My American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act has \ngotten a lot of attention over the past 5 months. It has been blocked \nfrom even a meaningful debate on the Senate floor. What makes this week \ndifferent?\n  What makes it different is that we have reached final agreement with \nthe White House on a compromise, thanks to our last resort--hardball \ntactics of our own--and the bill has at long last been cleared to pass \nthe Senate by unanimous consent.\n  I thank the 63 cosponsors of this bill. I thank the numerous small \nbusinesses and small business advocates who have worked so hard and \nused so much of their limited resources to free this bill for passage. \nThis diverse coalition of business leaders and Democratic and \nRepublican policy makers have stood by us from day one--their support \nshould have been enough to guarantee passage way back then, but it \nwasn't enough to stop some from playing partisan games with even \nbipartisan legislation. Now, at long last, the good faith efforts of \nour supporters are being rewarded.\n  It is my hope that having worked out our differences with the White \nHouse, we have cleared the way for passage not just through the Senate \nbut also through the House. Once this help is enacted, small businesses \nwill finally be able to receive desperately needed economic relief.\n  I am pleased with the compromise. It preserves provisions that are \nreally important for those small businesses that have needed help over \nthe past few months but fell through the cracks in SBA's disaster loan \nprogram, or fell through the cracks in the private sector where lenders \nhave cut back on loans to small businesses over the past year.\n  It simply was not enough, not efficient, and not cost-effective to \nuse only one of SBA's many lending programs to serve all the small \nbusinesses throughout this country that were hurt by the terrorist \nattacks or that have been struggling with the credit crunch. All of the \nSBA's tools should be used to help the affected small businesses, and \nthis bill does just that. Because this bill was blocked from \nconsideration, Senator Bond and I were forced to enact some of these \nprovisions through a defense bill. I very much thank Senators Byrd and \nHollings for including them. Specifically, we made it possible for \nsmall businesses to get working capital loans through the SBA's 7(a) \nloan program. SBA is calling these ``STAR loans,'' and compared to the \neconomic injury disaster loans, borrowers are accessing capital faster. \nIn just seven weeks, since the loans were made available, nearly $38 \nmillion has been loaned to 129 small businesses. It reminds us that \nbeing able to go sit in the office of a lender in the same town is far \nmore efficient and effective than requiring a small business in West \nVirginia or Puerto Rico to call a 1-800 number in Niagara Falls for \nemergency assistance.\n\n  One needs only to look at the record by comparison for economic \ninjury disaster loans outside New York and Virginia to see the need for \nthese STAR loans. After 22 weeks (nearly 6 months), only 2,600 loans \nhave been approved, adding up to a denial rate of almost 50 percent . \nThat doesn't even include the small businesses that were turned away \nbefore they even filled out an application because of outdated size \nstandards. That has left a lot of small businesses across this country \nwithout assistance. A lot of small business owners turning are in their \nkeys to the bank. As one small business advocate said today, in \nreference to the thousands of tour bus companies that went out of \nbusiness, ``I understand the banks now own a wonderful fleet of tour \nbuses.''\n  Well, for those small tour bus owners who have been waiting for this \nbill to pass and still need a working capital loan to ramp back up in \nthe upcoming tour season, the compromise preserves the refinancing of \nbusiness debt under a disaster loan. They need this so that they can \nrestructure debt to survive this business slump. We fought very hard to \nkeep this assistance in the bill.\n  For the owners of travel agencies--the majority of which are small \nbusinesses--we have increased the size standards for your industry so \nthat more of your companies qualify for disaster loans and 7(a) \nemergency loans. Please spread the word to travel agencies that were \nturned away earlier in the year because they were considered too large. \nThey might need working capital more than ever now that the airlines \nhave completely eliminated commissions.\n  For small businesses that need access to credit and can't get it \nbecause of the credit crunch, Senator Bond and I were able make SBA's \nprograms more affordable by reducing the fees borrowers pay through \nSeptember 2004. In both the Senate and the House, we have had hearing \nafter hearing trying to get fairer fees for the borrowers who need \ncapital and the lenders who make loans, but until now we haven't gotten \nany cooperation. This bill will make a difference. Whether you need \nworking capital through SBA's 7(a) loan program or credit to buy a \nbuilding or equipment through SBA's 504 loan program, it will now be \nless expensive. Stimulating lending and borrowing is good for the \neconomy because it creates jobs and saves jobs. By law, small \nbusinesses that borrower money through the SBA 504 loan program have to \nhire or retain on employee for each $35,000 borrowed. This is a win-win \nsituation for our economy.\n  The overall purpose of this emergency legislation is to provide \naccess to the full complement of SBA loans and business counseling in \norder to help small businesses hurt by the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11th and their aftermath.\n  This legislation will help mitigate bankruptcies, business closures, \nand lay-offs and address the shrinking availability of credit. However, \nsmall businesses doing business with the Federal Government have also \nfelt the impact of the terrorist attacks.\n  Small business contractors, because of very real and legitimate \nsecurity concerns, have experienced a dramatic increase in costs for \nwork in and around Federal Government facilities. We have heard reports \nof small businesses being denied access to their equipment on military \nbases, waiting for hours each day to enter government facilities and \nbeing limited in the hours they can work on their projects.\n  Let me cite the situation faced by Dave Krueger, President of AS \nHorner Construction, Inc. out of Albuquerque, NM. Dave was currently \ndoing work on a Federal contract at an Air Force facility pouring \nconcrete parking aprons. Immediately after the attack, his company was \nlocked out of the facility for nearly 2 weeks and currently has limited \nhours to access the construction site. Dave estimates that this will \nresult in cost increases of at least 10 percent, meaning he will take a \nloss on this contract.\n  Such situations cannot go unresolved. Small businesses are far too \nimportant, not just to our national economy, but to our national \ndefense as well. Small business is a vital component of our national \nsupply chain and essential to our national security interests. To \naddress this, S. 1499 establishes an expedited procedure whereby \nFederal small business contractors can apply for an equitable \nadjustment to their contract if costs have been incurred due to \nsecurity or other measures resulting from the terrorist attacks. In the \ninterest of compromise, Senator Bond and I agreed to reduce the funding \navailable for these provisions from $100 million to $50 million.\n  The Kerry-Bond approach has always been cost-effective--about five \ntimes cheaper than the administration's approach. CBO estimated that \nproviding this assistance to small businesses would cost $860 million. \nThe final compromise, based on CBO's estimates, is down from $860 \nmillion to $300 million.\n  This is a good compromise. It will help small businesses in every \nState. It is a reasonable approach that maximizes existing resources \nand private sector help. I strongly and respectfully urge my colleagues \nto let this legislation pass. Small businesses in your State will thank \nyou.\n  I ask that a list of supporters of S. 1499 be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n       S. 1499 Supporters: Airport Ground Transportation \n     Association; American Bus Asso-\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\n     ciation; American Subcontractors Association; Associated \n     General Contractors of America; Association of Women's \n     Business Centers; CDC Small Business Finance; Chicago \n     Association of Neighborhood Development Organizations; \n     Citizens Financial Group, RI; Clovis Community Bank, CA; \n     Coastal Enterprises, ME; County of San Diego; Delaware \n     Community Reinvestment Act Council; Fairness in Rural \n     Lending; Florida Atlantic University Small Business \n     Development Center; Helicopter Association; HUBZone \n     Contractors National Council; National Association of \n     Government Guaranteed Lenders; National Community \n     Reinvestment Coalition; National League of Cities; National \n     Limousine Association; National Restaurant Association; \n     National Small Business United; National Tour Association; \n     New Jersey Citizen Action; Rural Housing Institute; Rural \n     Opportunities; Self Help Credit Union; Small Business \n     Legislative Council; U.S. Conference of Mayors; United \n     Motorcoach Association; United States Air Tour Association; \n     United States Chamber of Commerce; United States Tour \n     Operator Association; Women's Business Development \n     Center.\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nvote in favor of S. 1499, the American Small Business Emergency Relief \nand Recovery Act. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKerry, for introducing the bill, and I am pleased to be its principal \ncosponsor. Since S. 1499 was introduced on October 4, 2001, 62 of our \nSenate colleagues have joined us as cosponsors.\n  The measure before the Senate today is a comprehensive managers' \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1499, which incorporates significant changes \nthat have been agreed to following lengthy negotiations with the staffs \nfrom the White House and the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. In \nparticular, I thank Andy Card, the President's Chief of Staff, Dr. \nLawrence Lindsey, Director of the National Economic Advisors, and Steve \nMcMillin, Assistant Director at OMB, for their personal involvement in \nthe negotiations.\n  The managers' substitute amendment modifies S. 1499 to recognize \nchanges in the disaster relief and credit programs at the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, that were enacted on January 10, 2002, in \nsection 203 of the Department of Defense and Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations for Recovery from and Response to Terrorists Attacks on \nthe United States, P.L. 107-117 Emergency Disaster Supplemental.\n  Enactment of S. 1499, as amended, will insure that valuable credit \nand management assistance will flow to small businesses that were \nharmed by the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers \nand the Pentagon. It is my understanding the House of Representatives \nis prepared to act quickly on the bill soon after the 2-week recess, so \nthat it can be sent to President Bush for his signature in the near \nfuture. Fast action by Congress is critical. Small businesses from \nacross the United States are continuing to struggle under the dual \npressures from the economy and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have received pleas for help from small business in \nMissouri and across the nation: small restaurants that have lost much \nof their business due to the fall off in business travel; local flight \nschools that have been grounded as a result of the recent terrorist \nattacks; and Main Street retailers who are struggling to survive. The \nAmerican Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act contains \nsound initiatives to help our nation's small businesses and their \nemployees. We in Congress must act and act soon to help our Nation's \nsmall businesses.\n  In response to the urgent calls for strong and effective Federal \nGovernment action to reverse the decline in the economy and stimulate a \nbusiness rebound, last October I introduced the Small Business Leads to \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2001, S. 1493, which was designed to provide \neffective economic stimulus in three distinct but complementary ways: \nincreasing access to capital for the nation's small enterprises; \nproviding tax relief and investment incentives for our small firms and \nthe self-employed; and directing one of the Nation's largest \nconsumers--the Federal Government--to shop with small business in \nAmerica.\n\n  Historically, when our economy slows or turns into a recession, the \nstrength of the small business sector helps to right our economic ship, \nwith small businesses leading the Nation to economic recovery. Small \nbusinesses employ over one-half of the U.S. workforce and create 75 \npercent of the net new jobs. Clearly, we cannot afford to ignore \nAmerica's small businesses as we consider measures to stimulate our \neconomy.\n  S. 1499 goes to the heart of a major problem confronting thousands of \nsmall businesses today by taking on access to capital barriers. This \nbill is a bipartisan collaboration between Senator Kerry, and me and \nour staffs of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. We \nhave worked together to devise one-time modifications to the SBA \nDisaster Relief, 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs because the traditional \napproach to disaster relief will not address the critical needs of \nthousands of small businesses located at or around the World Trade \nCenter, the Pentagon and in strategic locations throughout the United \nStates.\n  In New York City, it could be a year and more before many of the \nsmall businesses destroyed or shut down by the terrorist attacks can \nreopen their doors for business. Small firms near the Pentagon, such as \nthose at the Reagan National Airport or Crystal City, VA, are also shut \ndown or struggling. And there are small businesses throughout the \nUnited States that were shut down for national security concerns and \ncontinue to struggle to regain lost customers.\n  Small enterprises located in the Presidentially declared disaster \nareas surrounding the World Trade Center and the Pentagon are not the \nonly businesses experiencing extreme hardship as a direct result of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11. Nationwide, thousands of small \nbusinesses are unable to conduct business or are operating at a bare-\nminimum level. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk of being lost as \nsmall businesses weather the fall out from the September 11 attacks.\n  Regular small business disaster loans fall short of providing \neffective disaster relief to help these small businesses. The Emergency \nDisaster Supplemental included a provision from S. 1499 as introduced \nthat allows small businesses to defer for up to 2 years repayment of \nprincipal and interest on their SBA disaster relief loans. Interest \nthat would otherwise accrue during the deferment period would be \nforgiven. The thrust of this essential ingredient is to allow the small \nbusinesses to get back on their feet without jeopardizing their credit \nor driving them into bankruptcy. The managers' substitute amendment \nrestates this key provision.\n  The managers' substitute amendment also retains the provision \npermitting small businesses located in the Presidentially declared \ndisaster areas and those small businesses directly affected by the \nterrorist attack to refinance existing business debt. Repayment of \nprincipal shall be deferred for disaster loans to refinance existing \nbusiness debt, however, interest would accrue during the deferment \nperiod.\n  S. 1499 would provide a special financial tool to assist small \nbusinesses as they deal with these significant business disruption. \nSmall businesses in need of working capital would be able to obtain \nSBA-guaranteed ``Emergency Relief Loans'' from their banks to help them \nduring this period. Fees normally paid by the borrower to the SBA would \nbe eliminated, and the SBA would guarantee 85 percent of the loan. A \nkey feature of the bill is the authorization for banks to defer \nrepayment of principal for up to one year. This section would remain in \neffect for 9 months after the date of enactment of the act.\n  My colleagues and I have heard from thousands of small businesses \nsince the terrorist attacks that small businesses are experiencing \nsignificant hardship. The downturn in business activity, however, was \nclearly underway prior to September 11. The downturn was further \nexacerbated by the terrorist attacks.\n  S. 1499 would provide for changes in the SBA 7(a) Guaranteed Business \nLoan Program and the 504 Certified Development Company Loan Program to\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\nstimulate lending to small businesses that are most likely to grow and \nadd new employees. The managers' substitute amendment incorporates the \nprovision from the emergency supplemental that reduces the annual fee \npaid by lenders from 50 basis points, 0.50 percent, to 25 basis points, \n0.25 percent. In addition, the up front origination fee paid by small \nbusiness borrowers would be reduced. These enhancements to the SBA's \n7(a) program, and comparable reductions in 504 loan program fees, are \nto continue through September 30, 2004. They are designed to make the \nprograms operate more effectively and efficiently during the period \nwhen the economy is weak and banks have tightened their underwriting \nrequirements for small business loans.\n  Specifically, when the economy is slowing, it is normal for banks to \nraise the bar for obtaining commercial loans. However, making it harder \nfor small businesses to survive is the wrong reaction to a slowing \neconomy. By making these adjustments to the 7(a) and 504 loans to make \nthem more affordable to borrowers and lenders, we will be working \nagainst history's rules governing a slowing economy, thereby adding a \nstimulus for small businesses. Essentially, we will be providing a \ncounter-cyclical action in the face of a slow economy with the express \npurpose of accelerating the recovery.\n  The SBA has a very effective infrastructure for providing management \nassistance to small businesses located nationwide. The Small Business \nDevelopment Center, SBDC, SCORE, Women's Business Center and Microloan \nprograms provide much needed counseling to small businesses that are \nstruggling or facing problems in their start-up phase. With the U.S. \neconomy under unusual stress, many segments of the small business \ncommunity are today unable to cope with daily management issues.\n  S. 1499 would authorize expansions in these programs so that the \nSBDCs, the SCORe chapters and the Women's Business Centers are \npositioned to address the needs of a large influx of small businesses \nlooking for help. Our bill would create special authorization for each \nprogram to provide assistance tailored to the needs of small businesses \nfollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, the bill \nwould increase the authorization levels by the following amounts: SBDC \nprogram, $25 million, SCORE $2 million, Women's Business Centers $2 \nmillion, and Microloan technical assistance, $5 million.\n  For small businesses that are doing business with the Federal \nGovernment section 9 of the managers' substitute amendment to S. 1499 \nwould authorize a fund of $50 million to compensate small businesses \nwhen Federal action as the result of the terrorist attacks, has caused \nthe costs to increase for small businesses to meet the terms of their \ncontracts. The fund would be administered by the Department of the \nTreasury. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy would establish \nguidelines for administering the program, and the contracting agencies \nwould consult with the SBA when determining whether an award should be \nmade.\n  The American Small Businesses Emergency Relief and Recovery Act is \nimportant legislation that is needed to help the many struggling small \nbusinesses. Swift passage will be very helpful to the long-term \nsurvival of many of American's small businesses, and I urge each of my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as \namended, be read the third time and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate turn \nto the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 361) directing the \n     clerk of the House of Representatives to make corrections in \n     the enrollment of the bill, H.R. 2356.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am in support of the unanimous \nconsent for the adoption of H. Con. Res. 361 making technical \ncorrections to H.R. 2356 passed by the Senate yesterday.\n  Several weeks ago, I met with Senator McCain to discuss a list of 12 \ntechnical corrections to H.R. 2356. Of those 12 items, we were able to \ncome to an agreement in principle on 6. After weeks of negotiations \nbetween my staff, and the staffs of Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold, we have before us today the fruit of our labor. I thank them \nand their staff, specifically Jeanne Bumpus and Bob Schiff, for their \nhard work and persistence in making these minor corrections.\n  The items contained in this concurrent resolution are a compilation \nof technical corrections sought by me, and corrections sought by the \nSenators from Arizona and Wisconsin. In fact, the independent \nexpenditure reporting correction was raised by FEC Commissioners Brad \nSmith and Dave Mason and advanced by the staff of my colleagues from \nArizona and Wisconsin. I applaud my colleagues for addressing this \ntechnical issue and will ask consent that a letter from Commissioners \nMason and Smith outlining technical issues with H.R. 2356 for the \nSenate to consider be included in the Record. Similarly, the correction \nto the citation to the Immigration and Nationalization Act was raised \nby the FEC. Shays-Meehan inadvertently cited the definition of \n``advocates'' rather than ``lawfully admitted for permanent \nresidence.''\n  These technical corrections clarify some other important points: \nRespecting the primacy of State law in financing State and local party \nbuildings; continuing to allow members to transfer excess campaign \nfunds to party committees without limit; ensuring that we do not change \nthe rules for 2002 candidates engaged in a run-off, recount, or \nelection contest; providing for direct member challenges to the \nconstitutionality of H.R. 2356; and providing a sunset provision for \nexpedited review in the D.C. court so that plaintiffs who live on the \nwest coast do not forevermore have to come to Washington, DC, to \nchallenge provisions of the act.\n  However, I remain strongly opposed to the underlying H.R. 2356 and \nbelieve its disparate treatment of individuals, parties, groups, \ncorporations, and labor unions runs afoul of our fundamental \nconstitutional rights. By singling out national party committees and \nchilling their speech at the State and local level, this legislation \nensures the end of ``national'' party committees and the beginning of \n``federal'' party committees. Further, the broadcast gag\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nprovisions in the bill are not only unprecedented in scope, but \nhaphazard in applicability. I will ask consent that 5 additional items \nbe included in the Record which highlight the egregious constitutional \nand practical problems with this legislation.\n  Again I thank Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their efforts \non this concurrent resolution and commend the House for their swift \naction on this concurrent resolution.\n  I ask to have additional material printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n\n                                  Federal Election Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2002.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Rules.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: You have asked for comments on \n     provisions of H.R. 2356 that appear sufficiently problematic \n     in enforcement or interpretation as to require legislative \n     clarification. We urge Congress to consider ways to address \n     these issues which could otherwise hinder our ability to \n     effectuate the will of the Congress or to administer the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act.\n       We note that we have had only a few days to review the \n     House-passed version of H.R. 2356, so the list below may not \n     be exhaustive of all desirable technical and clarifying \n     changes.\n       1. Should the Commission regulate Internet web pages or e-\n     mail as ``Public Communication''? The proposed new definition \n     of ``Public Communication'' (proposed Part 22 of Section 301 \n     of the FECA [2 USC 431]) includes ``any other form of general \n     public political advertising.'' The Commission has treated \n     Internet web pages available to the public and widely-\n     distributed e-mail as forms of ``general public political \n     communication.'' Thus, the new definition combined with the \n     Commission's established interpretation of the FECA could \n     command regulation of Internet and e-mail communications. \n     Congress should clarify whether it intends for the Commission \n     to regulate publicly-available web pages and widely-\n     distributed e-mail as forms of ``Public Communication.''\n       2. Does Congress intend to prohibit state or local \n     political parties from making contributions to state or local \n     PACs? Proposed new Section 323(d) prohibits contributions by \n     national state or local political parties to 527 \n     organizations other than political parties, ``political \n     committees,'' and authorized committees of state and local \n     candidates. Since the term ``political committee'' as used \n     in the FECA is limited to Federal (e.g. FECA-registered) \n     political committees, Congress may wish to clarify whether \n     it intends to prohibit state and local political parties \n     from making state-permissible (non-Federal) contributions \n     to state-registered political committees.\n       3. Does Congress intend to prohibit Federal Officeholders \n     from appearing at fundraising events for state an local \n     candidates? Proposed new Section 323(e) prohibits raising of \n     non-Federal funds by Federal officeholders, except for state \n     or local party committees or for the official's own campaign \n     for state or local office. Congress may wish to clarify \n     whether it intends to allow Federal officeholders to appear \n     at fundraising events for authorized committees of state or \n     local candidates.\n       4. Does Congress intend to exempt non-Federal amounts spend \n     on ``Federal Election Activity'' (``Levin Amendment'' funds) \n     from state reporting requirements? Section 453 of the FECA \n     pre-empts state law ``with respect to election to Federal \n     office.'' This provision prohibits states from imposing \n     reporting requirements additional to those of the FECA. \n     Section 103 of H.R. 2356 requires state and local parties to \n     disclose to the FEC non-Federal amounts expended for a share \n     of ``Federal Election Activity.'' Thus, these funds reported \n     to the FEC as ``Federal Election Activity'' would presumably \n     be exempt from state reporting requirements. The ``Levin'' \n     funds must be ``donated in accordance with state law'' (but \n     not ``reported'' pursuant to state law). However, if these \n     funds are not reported to relevant state agencies, the FEC \n     will have difficulty determining whether they were \n     ``donated'' in accordance with state law. Congress should \n     clarify whether it intends to exempt non-Federal amounts \n     spent on ``Federal Election Activity'' from state reporting \n     requirements, or to require dual (Federal and state) \n     reporting.\n       5. Does Congress intend to repeal the requirement that \n     Independent Expenditure reports be received (rather than \n     ``filed'') within 24 hours? Just over a year ago Congress \n     revised the FECA to require that last-minute Independent \n     Expenditure reports be received by the Commission within 24 \n     hours. Previous provisions required filing by mail, which \n     sometimes resulted in a several day delay in receipt of ``24 \n     hour'' reports. Section 212 of H.R. 2356 would impose \n     additional reporting requirements for Independent \n     Expenditures. However, Section 212 appears to be based on the \n     pre-2000 version of the FECA and thus, presumably \n     inadvertently, would have the effect of repealing the \n     recently-imposed requirement that 24-hour reports be received \n     within 24 hours. Similarly, Congress should consider whether \n     personal expenditure notifications under Sections 304 and 319 \n     of H.R. 2356 must be received or merely filed within 24 \n     hours. (See item 6 below for additional comments on Sections \n     304 and 319)\n       6. Does Congress intend to repeal the requirement that \n     reports of Independent Expenditures in support of or \n     opposition to Senate candidates be filed with the Secretary \n     of the Senate? Section 212 (discussed above) in restating the \n     Independent Expenditure reporting requirements also omits the \n     provision in 2 U.S.C. 434(c) providing for Senate-related \n     reports to be filed with the Senate, and requires all \n     Independent Expenditure reports to be filed with the FEC. \n     Congress may wish to consider whether this change is \n     intended.\n       7. Are the existing and proposed new ``coordination'' \n     provisions intended to be read consistently? Section 202 of \n     H.R. 2356 treats an electioneering communication \n     ``coordinated'' with a candidate or party as a contribution \n     to that candidate or party. Earlier versions of H.R. 2356 \n     included a definition of ``coordination,'' but that \n     definition was deleted in preference to retention of the \n     existing statutory rule addressing ``cooperation, \n     consultation or concert'' (441a(a)(B)(i)). Congress should \n     harmonize the terminology between existing subparagraph (B) \n     and proposed new subparagraph (C) of this section, lest \n     confusion arise as to whether Congress intended a common \n     regulatory standard to apply. Similarly, Congress should \n     clarify the relationship between ``expenditures'' addressed \n     in subparagraph (B) and ``electioneering communications'' \n     addressed in proposed new subparagraph (C). We are also \n     concerned that the instruction (Section 214(c) of H.R. 2356) \n     that a new coordination regulation ``not require agreement'' \n     could be read so broadly as to encompass virtually any \n     communication whatsoever (even `'disagreement'') between \n     candidates and persons making expenditures of electioneering \n     communications.\n       8. Does Congress intend to punish inadvertent solicitations \n     of foreign nationals? Section 303 of H.R. 2356 helpfully \n     strengthens the ``foreign money ban.'' It appears that \n     Congress intends to hold foreign nationals strictly liable \n     for violations of this provision. However, the provision also \n     prohibits ``solicitation, acceptance or receipt'' of funds \n     from a foreign national, read most naturally to apply even \n     when the solicitor is unaware that the contributor is a \n     foreign national. Thus, candidates signing direct mail \n     fundraising appeals could be held in violation of this \n     provision if the mailing list included the name of a foreign \n     national Congress should consider instead prohibiting the \n     ``knowing solicitation, acceptance or receipt'' of foreign \n     national funds. The ``knowing'' standard is distinct from \n     ``knowing and willful,'' thus, this change would protect \n     genuinely inadvertent solicitations while still \n     distinguishing between simple and aggravated violations.\n       9. Does Congress intend for the FEC to audit all self-\n     financing candidates and their opponents? The ``millionaire'' \n     amendments (Sec. 304 and 319 of H.R. 2356) include eight \n     variables (two of which will change as often as daily). \n     Section 304 additionally provides for graduated increases in \n     contribution limits.\n       We are concerned that candidates who may be entitled to \n     benefit from this provision will be prevented from doing so \n     because of both its complexity and the lag time between \n     personal expenditures and resulting increases in contribution \n     limits. The complexity will also make it difficult and costly \n     for the Commission to enforce, likely requiring an audit of \n     every campaign in which this provision comes into play. (The \n     Commission currently has resources to audit approximately two \n     Senate campaigns per election cycle. At least twelve Senate \n     campaigns would have been affected (by triggering or being \n     eligible for increased contributions) had these provisions \n     been in effect for the 2000 elections.)\n       The distinction between primary and general elections could \n     allow wealthy candidates (particularly in states with late \n     primaries) to spend unlimited funds attacking a prospective \n     general election opponent during the primary without \n     triggering increased contributions limits. Similarly, wealthy \n     candidates might contribute excess funds during the primary \n     and carry them over to the general election, making \n     potentially unlimited amounts of personal funds available \n     without triggering increased contribution limits. Further, \n     the intended application of the ``gross receipts'' factor \n     (Section 316) is unclear: Are the gross receipts figures from \n     June 30 and December 31 added together, or combined, compared \n     or applied in some other fashion? A provision with a higher \n     initial threshold, fewer offsetting factors, and a non-\n     graduated response (similar to the House provision) might \n     strike a better balance among the goals of aiding candidates, \n     limiting the size of contributions and reasonable simplicity \n     of application.\n       Finally, the provisions require candidates benefiting from \n     increased contributions limits to return unspent funds within \n     fifty days of the election. However, the bill requires \n     reports on the disposal of these contributions ``in the next \n     regularly scheduled report after the date of the election.'' \n     For general elections, this date would fall only thirty days \n     after the election, and for many primaries, the relevant date \n     would be less than thirty days following the primary. Thus, \n     committees would be required to report on how they had \n     disposed of funds before they are required to dispose of \n     them. Congress should consider requiring the ``disposal \n     report'' in a report due sixty days or more (allowing fifty \n     days for return of excess contributions and some time to \n     complete the report) after the relevant election.\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\n       10. Does Congress intend to extend the Commission's \n     ``allocation window'' during the soft money transition \n     period? A floor amendment to H.R. 2356 clarified that the \n     national party soft money transition rule (Section 402(b)) is \n     not intended to allow parties to pay ``hard money'' debts \n     with soft money. However, the statutory provision allowing \n     payment of debts through December 31, 2002 would appear to \n     override the Commission's regulation which requires that \n     party committees make non-Federal reimbursements to their \n     federal accounts between 10 days before and not later than 60 \n     days after expending funds. Congress may wish to clarify \n     whether it intends for national party committees to comply \n     with the Commission's existing allocation regulations \n     (including the 70-day allocation window) during the \n     transition period.\n       11. Does Congress intend for the expedited Judicial Review \n     and exclusive jurisdiction provisions of Section 403 to apply \n     in perpetuity? Section 403 provides for a special three-judge \n     District Court panel and expedited appeal to the Supreme \n     Court for any constitutional challenge to the Act. However, \n     by not limiting the provision to initial challenges (brought \n     within a specified period), Section 403 would require \n     convening of a three-judge panel and expedited appeal to the \n     Supreme Court for actions filed years in the future. All such \n     future challenges would have to be filed only in the District \n     of Columbia, and circuit court review would be permanently \n     foreclosed. Special FECA procedures governing constitutional \n     challenges enacted in 1971 and 1974 have been employed in the \n     Third Circuit and District of Columbia in the past two years. \n     Congress may wish to set a time limit for these special \n     judicial review provisions and allow normal judicial \n     procedures to govern constitutional claims raised in \n     subsequent years.\n           Sincerely,\n     David M. Mason,\n       Chairman.\n     Bradley A. Smith,\n       Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Detroit News, Mar. 15, 2002]\n\n                  Donations Don't Seem To Change Votes\n\n                         (By John R. Lott Jr.)\n\n       A lot of politicians have been explaining the money they \n     have gotten from Enron. When U.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-\n     Mich.), the powerful ranking Democrat on the House Energy and \n     Commerce Committee, was asked about the donations he \n     received, he said: ``when somebody gives me money, they, I \n     assume, are supporting one thing: good government. And that's \n     what they got, and that's what Enron got.''\n       In recently passing new campaign finance regulations, \n     public interest groups and the press insist that donors \n     supposedly only give money to politicians to buy influence. \n     There is little doubt that campaign contributions and voting \n     records often go together. But few mention that this \n     relationship might simply reflect that donors only support \n     candidates whose views they share.\n       Fortunately, there are cases where we can separate these \n     two motives. Consider a retiring politician. He has little \n     reason to honor any ``bribes,'' for re-election is no longer \n     an issue. Even if earlier there were corrupting influences \n     from donations, the politician would now have freedom to vote \n     according to his own preferences. Therefore, if contributions \n     are bribes to make the politician vote differently from his \n     beliefs, there ought to be a change in the voting record when \n     the politician decides to retire.\n       Yet, this proves not to be the case. Together with Steve \n     Bronars of the University of Texas, I have examined the \n     voting records of the 731 congressmen who held office for at \n     least two terms during the 1975 to 1990 period. We found that \n     retiring congressmen continued voting the same way as they \n     did previously, even after accounting for what they do after \n     their retirement or focusing on their voting after they \n     announce their retirement.\n       Despite retiring politicians only receiving 15 percent of \n     their preceding term's political action committee (PAC) \n     contributions, their voting pattern remains virtually the \n     same: They only alter their voting pattern on one issue out \n     of every 450 votes.\n       If anything, these statistically insignificant changes even \n     move in the wrong direction. Retiring politicians are \n     slightly more likely to favor their former donors. This makes \n     no sense if contributions had been buying votes.\n       The voting records also reveal that politicians are \n     extremely consistent in how they vote over their entire \n     careers. Those who are the most conservative or liberal \n     during their first terms are still ranked that way when \n     they retire. Thus the young politician who does not yet \n     receive money from a PAC does not suddenly change when \n     that organization starts supporting him.\n       The data thus indicate that politicians vote according to \n     their beliefs, and supporters are giving money to candidates \n     who share their beliefs on important issues.\n       A reputation for sticking to certain values is important to \n     politicians. This is why political ads often attack policy \n     ``flip-flops'' by the opponent--if a politician merely tells \n     people what they want to hear, voters lack assurance that he \n     will vote for and push that policy when he no longer faces \n     re-election. Voters instead trust politicians who show a \n     genuine passion for the issues.\n       If donations were really necessary to keep politicians in \n     line, why would individual donors ever give money to a \n     politician who is running for office for the last time? If \n     politicians simply took positions to get elected, why would \n     voters ever elect such a politician who would then be able to \n     vote anyway that he likes?\n       Proponents of campaign finance reform have managed to claim \n     the mantle of dislodging the entrenched political \n     establishment. But, in fact, the reverse is true: Allowing \n     large contributions is instead the key to letting new faces \n     into politics. Existing federal and state donation limits \n     have entrenched incumbents, who can rely on voters' greater \n     familiarity with them as well as use their government \n     resources to help them campaign and generate news coverage.\n       It is very difficult for challengers to raise numerous \n     small donations. Incumbents have an advantage here, as they \n     have had years to put together long mailing lists as well as \n     making a wide array of contacts. Allowing large donations \n     would make it easier for newcomers to raise a large sum from \n     a few sources. The long start required for fundraising mean \n     that if a candidate falters, it is virtually impossible for \n     other candidates to enter in at the last moment.\n       For example, Sen. Eugene McCarthy, nicknamed ``Clean \n     Gene,'' would--under current restrictive rules--not have been \n     able to challenge Lyndon Johnson for the presidency in 1968. \n     He relied on six donors who bucked the party establishment \n     and almost entirely financed his campaign. McCarthy raised as \n     much money (after adjusting for inflation) as George W. Bush \n     has so far in the last election, but Bush has had to raise \n     the money from 170,000 donors.\n       George McGovern's 1972 presidential primary campaign only \n     succeeded because of extremely large donations from one \n     person, Stuart Mott.\n       Donation limits have reduced the number of candidates \n     running for office; cut in half the rate at which incumbents \n     are defeated; given wealthy candidates an advantage, raised \n     independent expenditures; increased corruption of the \n     political process; as well as led to more ``negative'' \n     campaigns. More of the same will follow if we continue the \n     path of stricter and stricter campaign ``reform.'' The Enron \n     case is no more relevant to advancing campaign finance than \n     the hopes that new rules will somehow make campaigns more \n     competitive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 15, 2002]\n\n                    Now, the Unintended Consequences\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       It was a famous victory. The campaign finance bill now has \n     passed both the House and Senate and likely will become law \n     with President Bush's signature.\n       The bill has one great virtue. It will end the ugly and \n     indefensible practice of federal elected officials extorting \n     six-figure contributions to their political parties from \n     corporations, unions and wealthy individuals. it is clear and \n     definitive about doing that, and it will be effective.\n       Beyond that, the consequences of the bill the Senate \n     approved last year and the House passed early Thursday \n     morning are probably not what supporters have been led to \n     believe. The optimism of the backers is exceeded only by the \n     folly of the House Republican leadership, which must be \n     grateful today of fraudulent Republican amendments so nakedly \n     intended to kill the bill. Their tactics give hypocrisy a bad \n     name.\n       Still, parts of the bill are probably unconstitutional, and \n     other parts largely unworkable or unenforceable. As with \n     previous campaign finance legislation, it is likely to have \n     big unintended consequences.\n       For example, the Democrats who furnished the bulk of the \n     votes for passage may be dismayed to learn that in the view \n     of Michael Malbin, the widely experienced head of the \n     nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute, the bill hands \n     President Bush an enormous advantage in his 2004 reelection \n     campaign.\n       Here's why: In 200, when Bush rejected public financing of \n     his race for the Republican nomination, he assembled a record \n     treasury of ``hard money'' contributions (limited to $1,000 \n     per person) from family friends, Texas supporters and allies \n     in the business world. As an incumbent president, he can \n     probably double or triple his take, while at the same time \n     avoiding the spending limits that go with public financing.\n       No Democratic challenger is likely to be in a position to \n     reject the taxpayer subsidies, and in a serious contest, on \n     the accelerated calendar Democrats recently adopted, all the \n     Democrats may well hit their spending limit by mid-March. In \n     the past, the winner could turn to the Democratic National \n     Committee and ask it to finance waves of TV ads from its \n     ``soft money'' account at least until August, when the \n     convention formally made him the nominee and a Treasury check \n     for the autumn campaign arrived.\n       If this bill becomes law, Malbin points out, the Democrats \n     will have no federal soft money account; their nominee may \n     well be off the air and invisible for five months, while Bush \n     dominates the political debate.\n       Another unintended consequence may well be to shift the \n     flow of soft money from national parties to state and local \n     parties. Contrary to the impression left by many editorials, \n     this bill does not make all soft money contributions illegal. \n     The amendment sponsored by Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl \n     Levin allows state and local parties to receive individual \n     soft money contributions of up to $10,000 a year ($20,000 per \n     election cycle), as long as they do not spend the money on \n     ads for federal candidates.\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n       Theoretically, one wealthy individual could drop $1 million \n     or more into his favorite party, by writing separate checks \n     to 50 state or local party headquarters.\n       You can call this a giant loophole or a wise provision to \n     support grass-roots activity, but it goes against the \n     centralizing forces in our politics--which have strengthened \n     not just recent presidents but congressional leaders of both \n     parties.\n       When the national parties do less for their presidential \n     nominees and their congressional candidates, those men and \n     women become even more individual political entrepreneurs.\n       It is perhaps not a coincidence that all four of the \n     sponsors--Sens. John McCain and Russ Feingold, Reps. Chris \n     Shays and Marty Meehan--are notable for their maverick \n     tendencies. It is likely this legislation will breed more of \n     their kind.\n       Finally, the issue the opponents of this bill tried without \n     success to raise its effect on the relative power of interest \n     groups and political parties. The most dubious parts of the \n     measure are those regulating ``issue ads'' that non-party \n     groups run during election campaigns. These provisions \n     implicate basic First Amendment rights of expression, and if \n     the courts find them unconstitutional, then the net effect \n     may well be to empower interest groups while restricting the \n     parties' participation in campaigns.\n       Interest groups are as American as apple pie. But their \n     agendas are, by definition, narrower than those of the broad \n     coalitions called Republicans and Democrats. It will not help \n     our politics to magnify the power of narrow interests at the \n     expense of the two-party system.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the American Prospect, Mar. 25, 2002]\n\n   With Victories Like These . . . the Glaring Inadequacies of Shays-\n                                 Meehan\n\n                          [By Ellen S. Miller]\n\n       What a cruel twist of fate: campaign finance reform that \n     benefits Republicans and big money.\n       The Shays-Meehan bill is back-to-the-future reform: \n     legislation that takes us back to just before 1980, when \n     there was no ``soft money'' but still a huge imbalance in the \n     influence of the big contributors over the rest of the \n     population. Under the terms of the bill that passed the \n     House, the national parties' committees can no longer raise \n     soft money--the unlimited and unregulated contributions that \n     totaled $498 million in 2000. A very good thing, that. But \n     the tradeoff to eliminate this most notorious campaign \n     finance ``loophole'' will actually enhance the power of \n     wealthy special interests, for it loosens a whole series of \n     strictures on hard-money donations--and hard money has \n     already eclipsed soft. Total hard-money contributions to \n     candidates, political action committees (PACs), and parties \n     in the 2000 election cycle came to $1.8 billion, nearly three \n     times the soft-money total.\n       To ease shock to big-money politics, Shays-Meehan contains \n     three separate increases in the amounts that individual \n     donors can give in regulated hard money, plus a huge \n     exemption that enables campaigns to sidestep the limits \n     altogether. The first increase involves the aggregate \n     contribution limit for individuals. The legislation nearly \n     doubles it to $95,000 per two-year election cycle. The second \n     hike is in what individuals can give to national political \n     parties, which rises from the current $20,000 per cycle per \n     party committee to $57,500. Within these limits, the bill \n     also provides for another dramatic increase: the amount \n     individuals can give to House and Senate candidates doubles \n     to $2,000 per election.\n       But say that a self-funding multimillionaire candidate is \n     running for office, as is frequently the case these days. \n     Should that happen, Shays-Meehan raises the cap on individual \n     donations to that candidate's opponents from $2,000 to \n     $12,000. Another limit--that imposed on the political parties \n     for their coordinated expenditures to supplement the \n     campaigns of party candidates within the states--is lifted \n     altogether.\n       Politically, this provision could prove more unsettling for \n     the Democrats than for the Republicans. While only five of \n     the 19 federal legislative candidates who spent $1 million or \n     more of their personal money in 2000 won their races, four of \n     them were Senate Democrats--three of them newcomers (Jon \n     Corzine of New Jersey, Mark Dayton of Minnesota, and Maria \n     Cantwell of Washington) and one returning (Herb Kohl of \n     Wisconsin).\n       So who would gain power from these fixes? To understand \n     just how off kilter this reform is, you have to understand \n     one primary factor: Today, less than one-tenth of 1 percent \n     of Americans make a contribution of $1,000 to candidates, but \n     these 340,000 individuals accounted for fully $1 billion of \n     the $2.9 billion in hard and soft money that politicians, \n     PAC, and parties banked in 2000. Most of this money comes in \n     large bundles from the ``economically interested''--\n     executives and business associates who've been armed-twisted \n     into supporting a corporation's electoral favorites.\n       Under the new legislation, those bundles will only grow \n     larger. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona admitted to \n     being embarrassed recently by the disclosure that he took \n     431,000 from individuals associated with the now bankrupt \n     telecommunications firm Global Crossing as he argued their \n     case before the Federal Communications Commission. Just how \n     tainted would be feel if he got double that amount (allowable \n     under the new limit) from them the next time he runs for \n     president?\n       After all these years of struggle, why did reformers settle \n     for so little?\n       In fact, after more than a decade of seeing their more \n     ambitious ideas come to naught even as the amount of money in \n     politics grew exponentially, reformers and their editorial-\n     board allies felt that they desperately needed a win. \n     According to Derek Cressman of USPIRG (the only campaign-\n     finance-reform organization to oppose the bill), Kentucky's \n     Republican Senator ``Mitchell McConnell wore down the reform \n     movement by defeating stronger legislation year after year. \n     Legislators kept compromising and the watchdogs let them do \n     that.'' As a result, the reform package grew steadily weaker. \n     ``I can't think of any other legislation that's had a tough \n     fight that ended up actually rolling things back,'' Cressman \n     says. ``This bill could have passed easily 10 years ago.''\n       Speaking not for attribution, some reformers admit that \n     forward movement--even if only one small step forward--became \n     their goal. A second factor, perhaps perversely, was the \n     Democrats' growing proficiency at raising big money \n     themselves--a skill that may have lulled them about the \n     political ramifications of Shays-Meehan. Buoyed by near-\n     parity with the GOP in soft money fundraising, the Democrats \n     generally--and party chairman Terry McAuliffe particularly--\n     came to believe that they could complete in the hard-money \n     game, too. That made the bill's tradeoff between hard money \n     and soft money acceptable.\n       As the proposed reforms grew steadily more modest, their \n     appeal to the center and center-right grew. Moderate \n     Republicans in the Senate and the House took the lead and the \n     Democrats stood back to let them carry the fight. A seemingly \n     enlightened segment of the business community, some of whom \n     were executives tired of being dunned for six-figure checks, \n     jumped on the bandwagon out of their own self-interest. The \n     scope of reform dwindled until hardly anything remained at \n     all.\n       There should be nothing surprising in the spectacle of \n     White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher trying to steal \n     credit for the bill on behalf of his boss. And why shouldn't \n     Bush sign it? Shays-Meehan favors Republicans. The GOP \n     outraised the Democrats in the 2000 cycle $466 million $275 \n     million; and in just released figures for the current \n     election cycle, the Republicans are leading the democrats in \n     hard money $131 million to $60 million. Moreover, Shays-\n     Meehan certainly favors the incumbent president in his 2004 \n     campaign. Bush is a hard-money dynamo: In 2000 he raised $103 \n     million in hard-money donations for the primaries alone, \n     while sitting veep Al Gore raised a paltry $46 million in \n     hard money. Worse yet, signing Shays-Meehan helps to \n     inoculate Bush from the taint of Enron's political money. \n     Nonetheless, Bush taking credit for campaign finance reform, \n     notes Public Campaign analyst Micah Sifry, is ``like Harry \n     Truman claiming credit for sparking the nuclear-\n     disarmament movement by dropping the bomb on Hiroshima.''\n       But this dubious victory may hold the seeds of more \n     sweeping changes. One thing is certain: The kind of \n     incremental reform that the House has enacted is far from the \n     kind of dramatic change that can actually renew people's \n     faith in our political system. But passing Shays-Meehan at \n     least clarifies the challenge. For years, progressives have \n     endorsed public financing, specifically public financing that \n     covers both primary and general elections. The AFL-CIO has \n     long supported it, and recent converts include the NAACP, the \n     ACLU, the Sierra Club, and the National Organization for \n     Women. The small state experiments in Maine and Arizona have \n     shown what a huge difference it can make. Activists on the \n     national front are poised to move forward. The next victories \n     are likely to come at the state level in judicial elections. \n     Spurred by the American Bar Association's endorsement of full \n     public financing for judicial races, activists in North \n     Carolina, Wisconsin, and Illinois are moving to change their \n     state laws. Public financing of campaigns for the \n     legislature, though further down the road, is most likely in \n     Minnesota, New Mexico, and Connecticut.\n       Now that soft-money reform is off the table, it's time to \n     focus on the real deal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          ACLU Campaign Finance Position Protects Free Speech\n\n   [Statement of Nadine Strossen, ACLU President, Ira Glasser, ACLU \n  Executive Director, and Laura W. Murphy, ACLU Legislative Director]\n\n       Washington.--Nine former leaders of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union today released a statement saying that they \n     have changed their positions on campaign finance and now \n     disagree with legal scholars, Supreme Court Justices and the \n     ACLU's long-standing policy to seek the highest \n     constitutional protection for political speech.\n       In their statement, these leaders argue that the Supreme \n     Court misread the First Amendment in 1976 when it issued its \n     ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, which struck down legislative \n     limits on campaign expenditures in a holding that reflected \n     many legal precedents and has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Our \n     former ACLU colleagues say that our opposition to current \n     legislation allows members of Congress to hide behind an \n     unjustified constitutional smokescreen.\n       We are untroubled by the questions they raise and believe \n     that it is they who allow members of Congress and President \n     Clinton to hid behind so-called reforms that are both\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\n     unconstitutional and ineffective. As long as measures like \n     McCain-Feingold or Shays-Meehan are allowed to masquerade as \n     reform, neither Congress nor President Clinton will get \n     serious about adopting true reform, which we believe lies in \n     the direction of fair and adequate public financing.\n       Just last year, we offered Burt Neuborne, a former ACLU \n     Legal Director and one of the principal opponents of our \n     campaign finance policies, the opportunity to argue his \n     position before the ACLU's 83-member National Board. After \n     hours of debate and discussion, Neuborne completely failed to \n     shift the ACLU Board to his view. Many Board members in fact \n     argued that Neuborne's position was in direct conflict with \n     the First Amendment rights that form the foundation of our \n     democracy. Ultimately, the one Board member who had offered a \n     motion to radically alter our long-standing policy withdrew \n     it rather than allowing it to come to a vote.\n       Yet our former ACLU colleagues persist, offering sweeping \n     proposals that would constitute a wholesale breach of First \n     Amendment rights and that ignore the real-world impact of \n     limits on speech. They speak approvingly of efforts to impose \n     ``reasonable limits on campaign spending'' without saying \n     specifically what such regulations would do. But when we look \n     at those consequences it becomes clear that current campaign \n     finance measures would do immeasurable damage to political \n     speech. The devil, as the cliche goes, is in the details.\n       A key provision of both McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan \n     would, for example, establish limits that effectively bar any \n     individual or organization from explicitly criticizing a \n     public official--perhaps the single most important type of \n     free speech in our democracy--when the official is up for re-\n     election within 60 days. If that kind of law had governed the \n     recent New York City mayoral election, it would have \n     effectively barred the ACLU (and other non-partisan groups) \n     from criticizing incumbent Mayor Giuliani by name on the \n     subject of police brutality in the wake of the horrific Abner \n     Louima incident precisely during the pre-election period when \n     such criticism is most audible. That prohibition would have \n     gagged us even though the ACLU has never endorsed or opposed \n     any candidate for elective office and is barred by our non-\n     partisan structure from doing so. Similarly, anti-choice \n     groups like the National Right to Life Committee would be \n     effectively barred from criticizing candidates who support \n     reproductive freedom. Yet such criticism of public officials \n     is exactly what the First Amendment was intended to protect.\n       In contrast, there are many reform measures the ACLU \n     supports that would protect and increase political speech. \n     These include instituting public financing, improving certain \n     disclosure requirements, establishing vouchers for discount \n     broadcast and print electoral ads, reinstating a tax credit \n     for political contributions, extending the franking privilege \n     to qualified candidates and requiring accountability of and \n     providing resources to the Federal Elections Commission. None \n     of these proposed reforms would run afoul of the First \n     Amendment.\n       Still, our former ACLU colleagues press proposals that \n     would inevitably limit political speech. We continue to shake \n     our heads, wondering how such measures can be regarded as \n     ``reforms'' by anyone who is genuinely committed to the First \n     Amendment.\n\n  Mr. DODD.
