Madam President, I want to take a few moments, as we \nare working in earnest this week to complete the session and focus on \nwhere we are as it relates to the critical issue of prescription drug \ncoverage and making sure that our seniors have help in Medicare and \nalso that we are lowering prices for everyone. This has been quite a \nchallenge for us.\n\n[[Page S7506]]\n\n  We knew when we started, we were facing daunting odds; that the \nsystem, as it is situated right now, heavily favors the industry and \nthat as a result of the fact that it heavily favors them, and the rules \nfavor them and allow them to stop competition and to be able to set \nprices on Americans much higher than in other countries, we knew this \nwas going to be an uphill battle.\n  We often talk about the fact that there are six drug company \nlobbyists for every one Member of the Senate and what that means in \nterms of challenges. But we have an opportunity today, and many of us \nhave been working across the aisle in good faith. In fact, I would say \neveryone has been working in good faith. There are different \nphilosophies--two very different approaches--that are being developed. \nBut everyone is working in good faith to try to get something done. I \nthink today is the day when we really decide are we going to at least \ntake the first step. If we can't get all the way there, to give \ncomprehensive Medicare coverage for all seniors and disabled, we have \nto at least begin the process to do that.\n  We are being called upon by AARP and the other senior groups to at \nleast take the first step. So we are working hard today. I commend my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been working with us to \nbe able to do that. We still have two different philosophies--one put \nforward predominantly by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nand by the House Republicans, which I believe moves us in the direction \nof privatizing Medicare. It would use private sector insurance, HMOs, \nas the mechanism for providing prescription drug coverage.\n\n  In my home State, we have seen Medicare+Choice, basically a failure \nin terms of covering people, pulling out. My own mother was in the \nprogram and lost her HMO coverage. We have seen over and over again \nwhere the private sector market has not worked for our seniors as it \nrelates to Medicare.\n  I argue that it is the wrong direction to go to try to prop up this \nsystem--private sector HMOs. There have been proposals that would prop \nthem up to the tune of Medicare paying 99 percent--covering 99 percent \nof the risk in order to go through private insurance companies. To me, \nthat seems a little ridiculous.\n  What we should be doing is what seniors across the country are asking \nus to do and that is update Medicare. We have had colleagues who have \ncalled Medicare a big government program. As I have said before, I \nbelieve it is a great American success story--Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  So we have an opportunity today to begin to modernize Medicare. I \nhope we are going to do that. Ultimately, we know that Medicare--the \nhealth care system for older Americans--needs to cover prescription \ndrugs for everyone on Medicare. But at a minimum, we need to start with \nour lower income seniors, who are deciding: Do I eat or get my \nmedicine? Do I pay the utility bills or pay the rent? Maybe I should \ncut my pills in half. Maybe I should ask for a 1-week supply instead of \na month. Maybe I will share them with my spouse because we both need \nthe same blood pressure medicine.\n  There are so many real stories. I have read many of them on the floor \nof the Senate--real-life stories of people in Michigan who are \nstruggling to make life-and-death decisions.\n  We have an opportunity at least to do something for them. We have an \nopportunity also for those who are the sickest, who have the biggest \nbills, who are finding themselves trying to decide between having their \nhome, their retirement, being able to have any life whatsoever, or \nhaving thousands and thousands of dollars in drug bills. We have the \nopportunity to, as well, put in place for everybody the ability to know \nthat they will not lose their home or their retirement and savings as a \nresult of the cost of their medicine.\n  If we could simply start with the neediest and the sickest under \nMedicare, I believe that would be a wonderful first step for us and \nsomething we could do today in a bipartisan way within the integrity of \nMedicare.\n  I hope, Madam President, we will take the challenge that the seniors \nare calling on us to do across the country: To step up and provide \nleadership, to do more than talk, and begin to get something done for \nthe seniors and others on Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later this week, the Senate is expected to \nbegin debate on the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. \nThe debate, however, will not be about whether to create a new \nDepartment, but rather how to create a new Department.\n  Since the President unveiled his legislative proposal 6 weeks ago, \nthe Congress seems unwilling--or unable, perhaps--to resist the \nstampede moving it towards the creation of this new Department. Indeed, \nthe momentum behind the idea seems almost unstoppable.\n  With the level of endorsement the Congress has given to this idea, \none would think that the proposal for a new Homeland Security \nDepartment had been engraved in the stone tablets that were handed down \nto Moses at Mount Sinai. But in reality, the idea was developed by four \nPresidential staffers--four--in the basement of the White House. For \nall we know, it could have been drafted on the back of a cocktail \nnapkin.\n  The administration did not consult with Members of Congress about the \nPresident's proposal. We were not asked for our input. The week the \nPresident unveiled his proposal to the American people, only a select \ncircle of Washington insiders were even aware of its existence.\n  I remember the events of that week. The administration was under fire \nabout whether U.S. intelligence agencies had adequate information to \nprevent the September 11 attacks. FBI whistlerblower Coleen Rowley was \ntestifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee--the same day, in \nfact, that the President addressed the Nation to announce this new \nDepartment. The President's poll numbers were dropping as the American \npublic began to question the effectiveness of the administration's plan \nto protect our homeland.\n  The Congress was taking the initiative on the homeland security \nfront. Senator Lieberman's proposal to create a new Department of \nHomeland Security was slowly gaining momentum in the media. White House \nPress Secretary Ari Fleischer just a few weeks earlier criticized the \nLieberman plan by saying that ``a [new] cabinet post doesn't solve \nanything.'' That was Mr. Fleischer talking: ``a new Cabinet post \ndoesn't solve anyting.''\n  This was the political environment in which the President unveiled \nhis hasty proposal, and that proposal was widely reported in the media \nas helping the administration to retake the initiative in protecting \nthe homeland. The President's address to the Nation helped to restore \nthe confidence of the American public in the administration's efforts \nto protect the homeland, and even provided the President with a boost \nin his approval ratings.\n  So the President's proposal was crafted in the bowels of the White \nHouse, cloaked in secrecy, and presented by an administration trying to \nregain political ground. Those are hardly the conditions that should \ninspire the Congress to rally around a Presidential proposal, but that \nis exactly what is happening.\n  The Congress is coming around, rallying around a massive, massive \ngovernmental reorganization with little discussion about whether such a \nreorganization is desirable or even necessary. What is worse, the \nCongress is so eager to show itself united beside the administration in \nour Government's efforts to protect the homeland, that it has committed \nitself to a timetable that would allow for only minimum debate about \nthe President's proposal--a plan of dubious origins--so that we can \nexpedite its passage before the 1-year anniversary of the September 11 \nattacks. Think of that!\n  Have we all completely taken leave of our senses?\n  The President is shouting ``Pass the bill! Pass the bill! Pass the \nbill.'' The administration's Cabinet Secretaries\n\n[[Page S7507]]\n\nare urging the adoption of the President's proposal without any \nchanges. And the House of Representatives eagerly complied last week by \npassing legislation that essentially mirrors--mirrors--the President's \nplan.\n  If ever there was a need for the Senate to throw a bucket of cold \nwater on an overheated legislative process that is spinning out of \ncontrol, it is now--now. But what are we doing instead?\n  In the Senate, the Governmental Affairs Committee marked up its \nlegislation just 5 weeks after receiving the President's legislative \nproposal. Until last week, Senators were being urged to finish \nconsideration of the bill before the August recess begins this Friday. \nThink of that. The Senate would have had just 1 week to consider this \nbill, before it passed and was sent to conference before the August \nbreak. Considering that the committee-reported bill was only made \navailable yesterday afternoon, this schedule would have given Senators \nonly 4 days to read and understand what was crafted by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. And to finish the bill within a week, Senators would \ncertainly have been discouraged from offering amendments and debate \nwould have been stifled.\n  That was the process being urged by some for the Congress' \n``deliberative body''--the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  I certainly understand that no Senator wants to be seen as delaying \nour Government's efforts to protect our homeland. But in trying to \navoid being labeled as obstructionists, we must not be willing to \nignore even the most pertinent questions about the proposal--such as \nwill a new Homeland Security Department actually make the public safer \nfrom terrorists?\n  Prior to the President's address, there were at least eight different \nproposals pending before the Congress to reorganize the Government to \nbetter protect the homeland. Those proposals ranged from creating a \nhomeland security czar to establishing an independent Homeland Security \nOffice to authorizing in statute certain powers for the White House \nOffice of Homeland Security. All of them have been trumped by visions \nof political advertisements attacking Members of Congress for not \nmoving fast enough to create a new Homeland Security Department.\n  If we are going to be totally honest here, we need to put aside \nvisions of campaign ads and do some good old-fashioned thinking.\n  This proposed merger constitutes the largest--the largest--Government \nrestructuring in our Nation's history--bringing together pieces of 22 \nagencies, involving as many as 170,000 or more Federal employees from \nperhaps over 100 bureaus and branches. A governmental reorganization of \nthis size involves more than just reorganizing the Federal Government \non a flow chart. It means physically moving the bureaus and agencies to \na new Department, transplanting tens of thousands of people, desks, \ncomputers and phones, hooking them together and making them work again. \nIt also means changing the culture, power structures, and internal \ndynamics of the relevant agencies and bureaus. It means dealing with \nconfusion, bureaucratic conflict, and unclear lines of authority.\n  As Norman Ornstein recently wrote in The Washington Post: ``This \nwould be a Herculean task for even one agency. It is beyond Herculean \nfor twenty-two agencies.''\n  If we take this giant step, our homeland defense system will likely \nbe in a state of chaos for the next few years, and amid this upheaval, \nwe run the risk of creating gaps in our homeland defenses. If our \nenemies are planning to attack the seams in our defenses, this massive \nreorganization will likely provide them with some excellent \nopportunities. That helps to explain, in part, why the much touted \nreorganization that consolidated the armed forces within the Defense \nDepartment took place after World War II, and not immediately after the \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Even then, it took a number of years and a number of legislative \nefforts to get that reorganization into decent, effective working \norder.\n  How long will it be before this new Homeland Security Department is \nin decent, effective working order? What if Osama bin Laden does not \nwait until we have finished restructuring? What if bin Laden is tempted \nto strike at the exact moment that these agency officials are dragging \ntheir desks up Pennsylvania Avenue to their new office assignments? I \nwould like to see a risk analysis regarding the creation of the DHS. \nWill Americans be exposed to more risk for an unknown time period as a \nresult of establishing an additional mammoth bureaucracy?\n  The Brookings Institution emphasized this point in a report issued \nthis month urging the Congress to move cautiously as it considers the \ncreation of a new department. ``The danger,'' the report states, ``is \nthat top managers will be preoccupied for months, if not years, with \ngetting the reorganization right--thus giving insufficient attention to \ntheir real job: taking concrete action to counter the terrorist threat \nat home.''\n  The Wall Street Journal agreed in an editorial this month saying that \n``The middle of a crisis, and only weeks before an election, isn't the \noptimal time to debate and pass the biggest transformation of \nGovernment in fifty years. The Administration has plenty else to focus \non before rearranging the bureaucracy.''\n  If the purpose of this reorganization is to increase accountability \nfor our homeland defense agencies, then it doesn't make any sense to \nprovide those agency chiefs with opportunities for new excuses. How \neasy would it be for the INS Commissioner to blame that agency's next \nhigh profile blunder on problems associated with the transition to the \nnew department?\n  The Congress hasn't even developed a standard to determine which \nagencies should be moved to the new department--contributing to a \ngrowing concern that too many agencies are being shifted around, with \ntoo little focus on preventing future attacks. A strong case can be \nmade for consolidating the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nCustoms Service, and other border security agencies, but the arguments \nfor moving the Secret Service, for example, are hardly compelling. The \nlitmus test for moving these agencies does not appear to be why, but \nrather why not.\n  Another point the Congress needs to remember is that this new \ndepartment will assume the non-homeland security related functions of \nthe agencies that are transferred to it. But if we are unhappy with the \nTreasury Department's oversight of the Customs Service's efforts to \ninspect the cargo entering U.S. ports, we will probably be just as \nunhappy with the Homeland Security Department's oversight of the \nCustoms Service's efforts to enforce our trade laws. Creating a new \nDepartment is unlikely to solve the problem of departments neglecting \nkey functions of their agencies; it only alters which functions are \nlikely to be neglected.\n  These are basic problems which the Congress appears ready to push \naside in order to meet the administration's call for quick action on \nthis legislation. And this is not exactly an administration that has \nbeen open with the Congress about its plans for reorganizing the \nFederal Government.\n  The administration has not issued a cost estimate of the President's \nproposed merger and insists that the transition costs will be kept to a \nminimum. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \nPresident's proposed merger will cost $3 billion, with a capital ``B,'' \nover 5 years. The White House says not to worry, however, because the \ntransition costs will be repaid through long-term savings. That sounds \nlike a neat trick. The administration wants to create a new bureaucracy \nwith a secretary, a deputy secretary, five undersecretaries, 16 \nassistant secretaries, and as many as 500 senior appointees, without \nappropriating any additional money to finance the transition. The new \nmanagerial level alone will cost scores of millions of dollars.\n  And there is the rub. Protecting our homeland requires resources and \npersonnel, and they cost money. We have to pay our border patrol \nagents, our sky marshals, and our national guardsmen. But this \nadministration, in trying to appease its own party base, is refusing to \nspend the money necessary to make America safer, and instead is pushing \nfor this reorganization of Government. But this massive governmental \nreorganization is going to be costly. It is going to require the \ninvestment of real money, your money. It\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\ncannot be done with the kind of creative accounting gimmicks you might \nexpect to find at Halliburton Company and Harken Energy Corporation.\n  When the White House makes these kinds of ridiculous comments about \nlong-term savings, the Congress and the American people better get \nready because the White House has got something up its sleeve.\n  The Bush administration has already sought a blanket waiver of civil \nservice law to set up a new personnel system for the new Department. \nThe President's proposal would give the new Secretary broad power to \noverhaul the pay, benefits, and workplace rules for over 200,000 \nFederal workers. The proposal would also exempt the new Department from \nprocurement laws, such as the Competition in Contracting Act and the \nContract Disputes Act. This sounds to me like an attempt to contract \nout homeland security-related services so that the administration can \nmake the artificial claim that they are shrinking Government and \nreducing Federal costs.\n\n  My larger concerns, however, reside deeper in the administration's \nrecent comments on managing the new Department. These comments, I fear, \nindicate that the administration has something far more unpalatable up \nits sleeve.\n  The President said in a pep rally for Federal workers this month that \nthe administration needs the ``freedom to manage'' the new Department. \nTo clarify those comments, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge said \nthat ``we need all of the flexibility we can get,'' and suggested that \nclose congressional oversight could cripple the new Department's \nability to respond to terrorism.\n  That kind of a statement from an administration official ought to \nmake us all very nervous.\n  To make the point crystal clear, the OMB Director said last week, \n``Our adversaries are not encumbered by a lot of rules. Al-Qaida \ndoesn't have a three-foot-thick code. This department is going to need \nto be nimble.'' Ha-ha. How nimble was the administration when we sought \nto pass the supplemental appropriations bill, with $3 billion more \nmoney for homeland security above the President's budget proposal? How \nnimble was the agency? How nimble was the administration? They held us \nup for 5 months.\n  Rules like holding this new department accountable to the Congress \nand the American people, Mr. OMB Director? Al-Qaida may not be \nencumbered by constitutional limitations on its powers, but, unlike the \nOMB Director, I would scarcely argue that al-Qaida sets an example for \nthis Government to follow.\n  I find comments like that to be incredibly ignorant. For all of their \nblustering about how al-Qaida is determined to strike at our freedoms, \nthis administration shows little appreciation for the constitutional \ndoctrines and processes that have preserved those freedoms for more \nthan two centuries.\n  This administration has made clear its intent to ``reassert'' \nexecutive authority, and, to date, it has aggressively tried to curtail \nCongress's powers of oversight. The President refused to allow the \ndirector of the Office of Homeland Security to testify before the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and other committees, in his capacity \nas our chief homeland security official.\n  The administration has been secretly planning to introduce special \noperations troops into Iraq without the consent of the Congress. We had \nbetter watch that one, too. That's to say nothing of this \nadministration's attempts to block congressional access to information \nabout executive actions.\n  In reorganizing the Federal Government, the Congress has a \nresponsibility to guard against attempts to also reorganize the checks \nand balances of the constitutional system. The greatest risk in moving \ntoo quickly is that we will grant unprecedented powers to this \nadministration that would weaken our constitutional system of \ngovernment.\n  Pay attention, the Congress should be seriously concerned about the \ntransfer authority that is being sought by this Administration. The \nPresident's proposal provides that ``not to exceed five percent'' of \nany appropriation available to the Secretary of Homeland Security in \nany fiscal year may be transferred between such appropriations, \nprovided that at least 15 days' notice--that is all that Congress \ngets--15 days' notice is given to the Appropriations Committees prior \nto the transfer. No congressional approval is required after these 200 \nyears.\n  In addition, the President's plan would authorize the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to allocate or reallocate functions and to \n``establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue'' organizational units \nwithin the Department, even if established by statute, simply by \nnotifying Congress ninety days in advance. Again, no congressional \napproval is required. Again, no congressional approval is required.\n  These provisions make clear the administration's attempt to erode \nCongress' ``power of the purse''.\n  I identified these problems in the President's proposal and wrote to \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Stevens, ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee joined, requesting that these powers not be \nincluded in his proposal. What concerns me most is not those problems \nthat I have identified, but rather the assaults on the legislative \nbranch which still remain hidden inside the administration's proposal \nand are on track to being adopted by the Congress.\n  I am not the only Senator who believes that this process is moving \nalong too quickly. We are all talking about this in the privacy of our \noffices, behind the closed doors of elevators and in our hideaways. But \nwe ought to come out onto the Senate floor and discuss it before the \nAmerican people. We are rushing ahead to pass legislation, which many \nof us think is bad policy. We are rushing headlong to pass a massive \nbill that few if any of us fully understand.\n  The executive branch is flexing its muscles and worrying about its \npolitical backside. The legislative branch needs to protect our \nconstitutional system and consider what will truly protect the homeland \nand the safety of our people. We must flex our brainpower and analyze \nthis idea carefully.\n  We cannot be brain dead on these vital issues. The stakes are too \nimportant.\n  Madam President, I know the administration will be out there across \nthe country saying, let's pass this homeland security bill, and the \nSenate will be criticized, the Senate leader will be criticized, I will \nbe criticized, other Senators will be criticized, for not having taken \nup this behemoth proposal and passed it before we close business this \nweek.\n  When the President signs the supplemental, he will have 30 days to \ndecide whether to designate over $5.1 billion as an emergency. That is \n$5.1 billion. We so designated it. If the President designates one item \nof that $5.1 billion, he has to designate all items. I have heard that \nhe is not going to sign that; I have heard that he is not going to \nrelease that $5.1 billion, by his signature, making it an emergency. \nThe Congress provided that it had to be all or nothing.\n  That is what the Senate and House did to President Clinton when he \nwas President. I voted for that provision. He had to sign all or \nnothing. I voted for it. And now we have put that same provision in \nthis bill.\n  There is $5.1 billion available to the President upon his signing \nthat as an ``emergency.'' What are we talking about? Within the $5.1 \nbillion is nearly $2.5 billion for homeland security. If the President \ndoes not make the designation ``emergency''--get this--the President \nand others in the administration will lambast the Senate for not having \npassed the homeland security bill before it goes out for the recess. \nBut what the Senate did pass is a bill, the supplemental bill, which \nmakes available for homeland security at least $2.5 billion of homeland \ndefense funding. All the President has to do is designate it as an \n``emergency''.\n  Here is what is involved in the $2.5 billion: Firefighting grants, \n$150 million; nuclear security improvements, $235 million; $100 million \nfor grants to make police and fire equipment interoperable; port \nsecurity grants, $125 million; airport security, $480 million; Coast \nGuard for port security, $373 million; Secret Service, combating \nelectronic crimes, $29 million; law enforcement resources for State and \nlocal government--hear this--$150 million; $82 million for the FBI for \ncounterterrorism and information technology\n\n[[Page S7509]]\n\nenhancement; $54 million for urban reserve and rescue teams; $147 \nmillion for cybersecurity improvements to protect our economy; food and \nwater security, $165 million; border security, $78 million; dam and \nreservoir security, $108 million; the Customs Service, to increase \ninspections, $39 million.\n  And homeland security is not the only issue, when the President makes \nthe decision to do the ``emergency'' designation. If he decides not to \nmake the emergency designation, he will be blocking funding for the \nfollowing activities: Election reform, $400 million; combating AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria overseas, $200 million; flood prevention and \nmitigation in response to recent flooding, $50 million; Department of \nDefense, over $1 billion for the National Guard and Reserve for \nchemical demilitarization and for classified projects; for foreign \nassistance, including embassy security and aid to Israel and disaster \nassistance to Palestinians, $437 million.\n  For assistance to New York City--I see that one of the distinguished \nNew York Senators has just been presiding. Let me remind her that in \nthis ``emergency'' designation package, the assistance to New York City \nin response to the attacks of September 11, including funds to monitor \nthe long-term health consequences of the World Trade Center attacks on \nthe health of police, fire, and other first responders, and for \nrecovery costs for the Securities and Exchange Commission office that \nwas in the World Trade Center, there is $99 million.\n  Hello, Governor of New York! Get in touch with the administration. \nUrge the President to sign his name to the package that should be \ndesignated ``emergency''. It should be designated emergency by the \nPresident so that the moneys will be released for New \nYork. Firefighting suppression funding, $50 million; emergency highway \nrepair funding, including funds to repair the I-40 bridge that was \nrecently destroyed in Oklahoma.\n\n  Hello, Oklahoma! Get in touch with the White House about this. \nNinety-eight million dollars!\n  Hello Oklahoma, are you listening?\n  I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Assistance to victims of the Sierra Grande fires, $61 \nmillion; veterans medical care--Hi there, veterans, get in touch with \nthe White House. Tell the President to sign his name on that emergency \ndesignation package because it includes $275 million for veterans \nmedical.\n  Madam President, I thank all Senators for listening. I will have more \nto say, the Lord willing, in due time.\n  (Applause in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Expressions of approval are not permitted by \nthe galleries.\n  Under the previous order, the time from 11:10 to 11:45 shall be under \nthe control of the Republican leader or his designee. The Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, it is my understanding staff arranged \nfor me to have 20 minutes of that 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President I rise today to discuss the one year \nanniversary of the bipartisan tax relief package. On June 7, 2001, \nPresident Bush signed the legislation. On Friday, June 7 of this year, \nthe President marked the first anniversary of that event in Des Moines, \nIowa. I was pleased to join the President for that anniversary \ncelebration.\n  One year ago this week, the Treasury Department started sending out \nrebate checks to every American taxpayer. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record an announcement from the Treasury Department \ndated July 26, 2001.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Office of Public Affairs]\n\n           Treasury To Mail Out 8.1 Million Checks On Friday\n\n                            (July 26, 2001)\n\n       Tomorrow the Treasury Department will send out 8.1 million \n     advance payment checks to taxpayers for more than $3.4 \n     billion in tax relief. These checks will be sent to taxpayers \n     whose last two digits of their Social Security numbers are \n     10-19.\n\n     Week Two (July 27) Social Security Numbers 10-19\n       Number of Checks 8.1 million\n       Amount of Relief $3.4 billion\n     Week One (July 20) Social Security Numbers 00-09\n       Number of Checks 7.9 million\n       Amount of Relief $3.3 billion\n\n       The Treasury Department will announce every week the number \n     of checks that are being mailed out for that week, and the \n     amount of tax relief that is being sent to taxpayers. Checks \n     will be mailed over a ten-week period, according to the last \n     two digits of the taxpayers Social Security number. Notices \n     from the Internal Revenue Service that tells taxpayers the \n     amount of their check and when they should expect it have \n     been mailed. Single taxpayers will get a check up to $300, \n     head of household up to $500 and married couples filing \n     jointly will get up to $600.\n       Because the Social Security number determines when checks \n     are mailed, taxpayers may receive their checks at different \n     times than their neighbors or other family members. On a \n     joint return, the first number listed will set the mailout \n     time.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   If the last two digits of your Social       You should receive your\n            Security number are                   check the week of\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n00-09.....................................

Generally, single taxpayers got a $300 \ncheck and married couples got a $600 check.\n  What I would like to do today is first put the tax cut in historical \ncontext. Second, I would like to set the record straight in terms of \nthe progressivity of the tax relief and its budget effects. Finally, I \nwould like to illustrate what the tax relief legislation means in terms \nof typical families across America.\n  I am going to use a series of charts as I move through the \ndiscussion.\n  Let's start with historical context. In the last 20 years, there have \nbeen several pieces of major tax legislation. When I use the term \nmajor, I am referring to net tax hikes or net tax cuts in the \nneighborhood of $100 billion or more.\n  In the last generation, frankly, the American taxpayer has come out \non the short end of the deal. By and large, the tax-and-spend \nWashington crowd prevailed. There have been four major tax increase \nbills. There have been three major tax cut bills, with one of those, \nthe 1997 tax relief package, barely breaking into the major category.\n  Let's take a look at the tax increase bills first. There were No. 1, \n``TEFRA'' in 1982, No. 2, ``DEFRA'' in 1984, No. 3, ``OBRA'' in 1990, \nand, as then Finance Chairman Pat Moynihan said, No. 4, the ``world \nrecord tax increase'' of President Clinton's 1993 tax package. Senator \nMoynihan's description was verified by a Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimate. It showed the 1993 tax increase raised taxes by over $1 \ntrillion.\n  In the same generation, taxpayers have received net tax cuts three \ntimes. The three events occurred in 1981, in 1997, and last year. In \n1981, the Reagan tax cuts brought down the top rate of 70 percent to 50 \npercent. In 1997, modest bipartisan tax relief, had, as its \ncenterpiece, the $500 per child tax credit. Of course, last year, all \ntaxpayers received a tax relief.\n  When you look over the last generation, the bipartisan tax relief of \nlast year, in effect, helped tip the balance back a little bit toward \nthe American taxpayer. I say a little bit, because, by any reckoning, \neven when fully in effect, last year's bill still leaves the balance \ntoward higher taxes and more government. More on that in a minute.\n  For another point of historical context, take a look back at the \nfundamental tax reform of 1986. You will recall that effort was a grand \ncompromise between liberals, led by Congressman Rostenkowski, and \nconservatives, led by President Reagan. We came up with a revenue \nneutral package by broadening the tax base by shutting down tax \nshelters. The revenue raised was used to create two rates--15 percent \nand 28 percent. In addition, millions of low income families ceased \npaying income tax.\n\n[[Page S7510]]\n\n  During the tax reform debate, today's House Democratic Leader, \nCongressman Gephardt, pursued a tax reform plan with former Senator \nBradley. The Bradley-Gephardt plan contained three rates of tax. The \nthree rates were 35 percent, 25 percent, and 15 percent. Former Senator \nMitchell, who would become the Democratic Leader and a great champion \nof the liberal wing of the Democratic Caucus, supported a top rate of \n35 percent as well. Indeed, the House, at that time controlled by \nDemocrats, passed a tax reform bill with a top rate of 35 percent.\n  So, at the watershed event of 1986, the leaders of the Democratic \nCaucuses, said individual income tax rates should not exceed 35 \npercent. As everyone knows, 35 percent is the top rate when the \nbipartisan tax relief package is in full effect in 2006. I guess I find \nit a bit ironic that today the Democratic Leadership says individual \ntax rates must be above 35 percent.\n  It makes you wonder why today's Democratic Leadership, in historical \ncontext, is so fixated on higher taxes. Why is Congressman Gephardt, \nthe House Democratic Leader, insisting on tax rates at higher levels \nthan his 1986 era plan? Why is Senator Daschle, today's leader of the \nDemocratic Caucus, insisting on tax rates at higher levels than his \npredecessor, Senator Mitchell?\n  Isn't 35 percent of a person's income enough of a contribution for \ntheir share of the burden of the Federal Government?\n  That is where the Democratic Leaders were during tax reform. That is \nwhere the bipartisan tax relief plan leaves us when fully in effect in \n2006. Unfortunately, that's not where the Democratic Leaders are today.\n  The question of why 35 percent isn't enough leads in the second part \nof my discussion. What I would like to do is set the record straight on \nthe progressivity and budget effects of the bipartisan tax relief plan.\n  It seems to me that the Democratic leadership has moved its tax \nreform target away from tax relief for a very simple reason. The reason \nis to provide resources to grow the Federal Government by increasing \nspending.\n  It is part of a larger of agenda of moving a society, America the \nengine of capitalism, to look more like European socialism. It means \nmore Government and less individual responsibility. It means less \nreward for work and more money from the pockets of working people for \nthe Federal Government. It means opportunity defined less by a dynamic \nmarket and more by political criteria.\n  Now, a lot of inaccurate information has been spread about the \nbipartisan tax relief package. At the head of this campaign, is the \nDemocratic Leadership. Perhaps unwittingly, perhaps by design, much of \nthe media has worked hand in glove with this partisan campaign.\n  The misinformation comes forward in three bogus assertions. The first \nincorrect assertion is that the bipartisan tax relief was a partisan \nRepublican product. The second is that the bipartisan tax relief \npackage is the source of our current budget problems. The third \nincorrect assertion is that the tax relief favored the wealthy over low \nand middle income taxpayers.\n  I would like to turn to the first incorrect assertion. Often we hear \nthe phrase Republican tax cut or partisan tax cut. In fact, the tax cut \nwas bipartisan. Twelve Democratic Senators voted for the conference \nreport. Senator Jeffords also voted for the conference report. That is \nover one-fourth of the Democratic Caucus.\n  The tax relief legislation was bipartisan by design. In a Senate \ndivided down the middle, the tax relief had to be bipartisan to pass. \nThere was no other way.\n  Democratic members of the Finance Committee played a key role in \ncrafting the bill. LEd by our current Chairman, Max Baucus, they \ninsisted on a bill that reflected their priorities. Senators Breaux, \nTorricelli, Lincoln, all contributed to the formation of this bill. \nRepublican moderates like Senator Snowe also played a key role. Without \nthese Senator's input and support, we would not have the tax relief in \nplace.\n  Anyone who characterizes the tax relief as partisan is flat out \nwrong.\n  I would like to move on the second incorrect assertion. How many \ntimes have we heard on this floor or seen written in the media the \ncharge that the bipartisan tax relief caused the current and projected \ndeficits. If I have a dollar for every time I've heard or read this \npoint, I could put the budget in balance.\n  Cold hard numbers tell a different story. Cold hard numbers from the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and \nprivate sector sources reveal the truth.\n  Here is what the numbers say. You can check it out on the CBO \nwebsite.\n  According to CBO's January baseline, for the current fiscal year, the \ntax cut represents barely 14% of the total change in the budget since \nlast year. For instance, for the same period, increased appropriations \noutranked the tax cut by $6 billion. So, spending above baseline, \ntogether with lower projected revenues, accounted for 89 percent of the \nchange in the budget picture. Let me repeat that. Bipartisan tax relief \nwas a minimal, 11 percent factor, in the change in the surplus.\n  Over the long-term, the tax cut accounts for 45 percent of the change \nin the budget picture. Stated another way, the 10 year surplus declined \nfrom $5.6 trillion to $1.6 trillion. Of that $4.0 trillion change, the \ntax cut represented about $1.7 trillion of the decline. That is less \nthan one-half of the change. Let me repeat that for our friends in the \nDemocratic Leadership and their allies in the media. The tax relief \npackage accounts for less than 45 percent of the decline in the \nsurplus.\n  The second incorrect assertion, that the tax cut ate the surplus, is \nincorrect, according to CBO.\n  I would like to turn to the third incorrect assertion about the \nbipartisan tax relief package. That assertion is that the tax relief \npackage was a tax cut only for the wealthiest Americans.\n  How many times have we heard the statistic that 40 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax cut went to the top 1 percent of taxpayers?\n  Where did the statistic come from? Did it come from the non-partisan \nJoint committee on Taxation? The answer is no. The statistic cited by \nthe media and the Democratic Leadership came from the liberal think \ntank known as the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. How do they \nget their numbers? Here's an example. Let us talk about how they \ndistribute the benefits of the death tax. The liberal think tank \nassumes that the person benefitting from death tax relief is the dead \nperson. Imagine that. Only in Washington, D.C. do they assume you can \ntake the benefit of tax relief with you to the grave.\n  It takes these kinds of distortions in methodology to get the \nconclusion the liberal think tank wants. That's why our friends in the \nDemocratic Leadership rely on the Center for Budget Policy and \nPriorities. Unfortunately, some in the media accept these statistics at \nface value.\n  Once again, facts can be ugly things for harsh critics of the \nbipartisan tax relief package. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, Congress' official non-partisan scorekeeper, the tax code is \nmore progressive with the tax relief package. Let me repeat that fact. \nJoint Tax, not a liberal or conservative think tank, says the \nbipartisan tax relief package made the Tax Code more progressive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record a distribution \nanalysis, prepared by Joint Tax.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\n\n\n

Madam President, some might ask how does Joint Tax \nconclude that the bipartisan tax relief made the tax code more \nprogressive.\n  The answer is that the bipartisan tax relief returns to taxpayers, on \na progressive basis, a small portion of the record level of Federal \ntaxes.\n  Take a look at this chart. It shows that the largest tax cut went to \ntaxpayers in the lower and middle income brackets. For instance, \ntaxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, will see their \ntaxes reduced by almost 14 percent when the tax cut is fully in effect. \nTaxpayers with over $200,000 will see their taxes reduced by barely 6 \npercent.\n  The Democratic Leadership and many in the media, will focus, not on \nthe burden taxpayers bear, but on the benefits of the tax cut. In other \nwords, they will try to ignore the progressive nature of our current \nsystem and use isolated examples. For instance, they will say that a \ntaxpayer at $50,000 of income gets more of a tax cut than a taxpayer at \n$10,000 of income. In fact, a taxpayer at $50,000 of income, pays \nconsiderably more tax than a taxpayer at $10,000 of income. Comparing \ntwo different taxpayers' tax relief benefits without looking at the \nburden is comparing apples to oranges.\n  Let us compare apples to apples. That is, the burden born by groups \nof taxpayers before and after the tax relief bill.\n  What I showed you before was the change in the tax burden for \ndifferent categories of taxpayers. This chart allows you to see how \nprogressive the current system is and how the tax relief bill made the \ntax system even more progressive. Keep in mind that this table includes \nall taxes. That's income taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, and \ncorporate income taxes.\n  Let us compare the same two groups I talked about before. Taxpayers \nwith incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 bore 1.2 percent of the \nFederal tax burden before the tax relief bill and 1.1 percent after the \ntax relief bill. Taxpayers with over $200,000 maintained their burden, \n32.1 percent, before and after the tax relief bill.\n  You can see the bipartisan tax relief bill lightened everyone's \nFederal tax burden but did it in a progressive way.\n  What the tax relief bill aimed to do was send back to the American \npeople a portion of the record-high levels of taxation. But the \nbipartisan tax relief bill sent the money back in a progressive manner.\n  Let us take a look at where we were early last year. You'll see the \nFederal Government was taking in record-high levels of individual \nincome taxes. For instance in 2000, Federal taxes were taking 20.5% of \nGDP and individual income taxes were taking 10.2 percent of GDP.\n  According to CBO, those upward record-high level trends were going to \ncontinue throughout this decade. In fact, even when fully in effect, \nthe bipartisan tax relief bill leaves both Federal and individual \nincome taxes at near record levels.\n  Chairman Greenspan gave us a green light to provide broad-based tax \nrelief because he foresaw a long-term economic problem. The record \nlevel of taxation, if left on track, would have been a drag on economic \ngrowth.\n  As a matter of fact, there is substantial agreement that the tax cut \ncame at just the right time. The rebate checks and other relief arrived \njust as the recession started to hit home. According to the Department \nof Commerce, the tax relief boosted personal incomes by the highest \namount in almost 10 years.\n  You can now see that those three widespread incorrect assertions \nabout the bipartisan tax relief package have been countered. One, the \ntax relief package was bipartisan; not partisan as its critics claim. \nTwo, the tax relief package did not cause either the short-term or \nlong-term budget problems we face. Three, the tax relief package \nprovides broad-based relief in a progressive fashion.\n  I would like to turn to the final part of my discussion. This is the \nmost important part because it describes what the tax relief package \nmeans to typical taxpayers.\n  We took as a starting point President Bush's efforts to provide \nincome tax relief to all Americans. This legislation includes the four \nmain elements of President Bush's goals of providing tax relief to \nworking families.\n  These goals are to: No. 1, provide tax relief for working families \nthrough reducing marginal rates; No. 2, reduce the marriage penalty; \nNo. 3, expand the child tax credit; and No. 4, eliminate death taxes. \nLet's look at each one.\n  First, this legislation reduced marginal rates at all levels and \ncreates the new 10 percent level proposed by the President. We also \nbegan to address the hidden marginal rate increases such as PEPS and \nPEASE that complicate the Code.\n  The 10 percent bracket means a tax cut for every American taxpayer. \nIt was the source for the rebate checks that every taxpayer received \nlast year. That's $600 for every family and $300 for every single \nperson.\n  America is a society of opportunity. Over 60 percent of all families \nwill at one time or another be in the top fifth of income in this \ncountry. A man will make more at 55, after 30 years of hard work, than \nhe did at 25. A family should not face a crushing marginal rate tax \nburden when they finally get a good paycheck for a few years as a \nreward for years of hard work.\n  For those that have worked hard over the years, there is some \nmarginal tax rate relief. Here, I am referring to small business. Small \nbusiness generates 80 percent of the new jobs in this country. Small \nbusiness owners receive 80 percent of the benefits of the marginal rate \nreductions. When fully phased in, the marginal rate paid by a \nsuccessful small business will be the same as that paid by General \nMotors. I don't know how Senators can argue that 35 percent is an \nappropriate top rate for General Motors, but too low for Joe's Garage.\n  While I am on the topic of marginal rate relief one political \ndevelopment continues to surprise me. Those on the other side most \nopposed to the marginal rate relief come from the higher income states, \nthe so-called high-tax or ``blue states'' that tend to be on each coast \nand around the Western Great Lakes. Taypayers in those states, in \nparticular, bear the brunt of higher marginal rates.\n  It continues to surprise me that Senators from those high-tax paying \nstates attempt to obstruct tax relief that is most meaningful to their \nconstituents.\n  Federal taxes squeeze harder in those states where incomes are higher \nand the cost of living is higher. To this day, I do not understand the \nvirgourous opposition these members have to relieving the high tax \nburden their constituents face. Instead, members from these states tend \nto focus on those who don't pay income tax. Maybe members from the \nother side of the aisle and who are from these states seem oblivious to \nthis disproportionately heavy tax burden. Or maybe they think Federal \ntaxes should be higher. Maybe it's liberal guilt. I cannot figure it \nout. One has to wonder what the folks in those states who work hard and \npay high taxes would think if they took a look at these charts. One has \nto wonder what they'd think about higher taxes those on the other side \nseem to yearn for.\n  The first part of the package provides progressive income tax relief \nto every American that pays income tax. Let's move on to the second \npart.\n  The second part provides income tax relief for married families--for \nfamilies where both spouses work and where only one spouse works. In \naddition, thanks to the advocacy of Senator Jeffords, we expanded the \nEarned Income Credit for married families with children. Further, there \nwas wide bipartisan agreement to simplify the Earned Income Credit \nwhich will mean that hundreds of thousands of more children will \nreceive the EIC benefits.\n  This package contains the first marriage penalty relief in 33 years. \nLet me repeat that. For the first time in 33 years, we're delivering \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  Third, the President's desire to expand the child credit to $1000 was \nmet\n\n[[Page S7513]]\n\nin the bipartisan tax relief package. And in response to the concerns \nof Senators Snowe, Lincoln, Breaux, and Jeffords the child credit was \nexpanded to help millions of children whose working parents do not pay \nincome tax.\n  Let's take a look at an example. For a single mother with two \nchildren at $16,000 of income, this tax relief package means $600 more \nin her pocket for this year. That's an increase of almost 4 percent in \nthis single mother's budget. I'm sure she can use the money.\n  The fourth part of the package dealt with the death tax. The death \ntax is reduced and finally eliminated--as called for by President Bush. \nWe were successful in this effort due to the work of many Senators but \nI would particularly note the efforts of Senators Kyl, Phil Gramm, and \nLincoln.\n  Thus, this legislation contained the four main elements of President \nBush's efforts to provide tax relief for working families--marginal \nrate reduction, relief for married families, the expansion of the child \ncredit and the reduction and ultimate elimination of the death tax.\n  I would remind my colleagues again that the hallmark of this \nlegislation is that relief for low income families comes first. The \nmarginal rate drop to 10 percent was immediate, the child credit \nexpansion to low income families was immediate, the expansion of EIC \nwas immediate.\n  The greater progressivity of the tax relief legislation is certainly \ndue in no small part to the work of Senator Baucus.\n  Everyone knows Senator Baucus and other Democrats who crafted this \npackage took a lot of heat from the liberal core of the Democratic \nCaucus. His objective, like mine, was a bipartisan tax relief package. \nIt seems that while many are happy to talk about bipartisanship they \ncan't stand to see bipartisanship practiced.\n  In addition to President Bush's proposals to provide tax relief to \nworking families, the tax relief package included legislation that had \nbeen considered by the Finance Committee previously.\n  I believe that not all good ideas come from just one end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. Thus, we included the Grassley/Baucus pension \nreform legislation which probably would not have made it in the bill \nwithout the longtime support of Senators Hatch and Jeffords.\n  That package means $50 billion in tax benefits for enhanced \nretirement security. That figure will be compounded many times over in \nretirement assets. A lot of folks like to play political football with \nretirement security issues. The bipartisan tax relief package actually \nmoved the ball forward on retirement security.\n  Let's take a look at an example. Under the tax relief legislation, \nworkers will be able to raise their IRA contributions to $5,000 \nannually. Workers will also be able to put away up to $15,000 annually \nin their 401(k) accounts.\n  In addition, the legislation contained over $30 billion in tax \nbenefits targeted for education. Elements of this package included \nlanguage to expand the prepaid tuition programs to help families pay \nfor college--long advocated by Senators Collins, McConnell, and \nSessions. In addition, the package provided a college tuition deduction \nthanks to Senators Torricelli, Snowe, and Jeffords, private activity \nbonds for school construction in response to Senator Graham's concerns, \nas well as an expansion of the education savings accounts--in honor of \nSenator Coverdell--thanks to the work of Senator Torricelli and Senator \nLott.\n  Let's take a look at an example. Under this legislation, a young \ncouple can contribute $2,000 per year per child to an education IRA. \nThe account enjoys inside buildup tax-free and is available to pay \ntuition and other college costs.\n  None of us should forget the great winners of this legislation--the \nAmerican taxpayer. We provided the American taxpayer the greatest \namount of tax relief in a generation. And they deserve it.\n  With the bipartisan tax relief legislation in place, all taypaying \nAmericans have a little bit more of their money in their pockets. \nStruggling families will have more money to make ends meet; parents and \nstudents will be able to more easily afford the costs of a college \neducation; a successful business woman will be able to expand her \nbusiness and hire more people; a father finally getting a good paycheck \nafter years of work will be able to better provide for his aging \nmother; and, a farmer can pass on the family farm without his children \nhaving to sell half the land to pay estate taxes.\n  As an illustration of the breadth of this relief, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a State-by-State analysis of the \nper taxpayer benefits, prepared by the Tax Foundation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              BUSH 2001 TAX REDUCTION BY STATE FY 2001-2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Total\n                                   (Dollars in   Per capita      Per\n                                    millions)                 household\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama..........................       $1,151         $257         $663\nAlaska...........................          233          363          939\nArizona..........................        1,689          320          826\nArkansas.........................          603          224          578\nCalifornia.......................       15,539          451        1,165\nColorado.........................        2,044          463        1,196\nConnecticut......................        2,558          750        1,938\nDelaware.........................          309          388        1,003\nFlorida..........................        6,532          400        1,032\nGeorgia..........................        2,928          350          903\nHawaii...........................          336          272          703\nIdaho............................          330          247          638\nIllinois.........................        5,789          465        1,201\nIndiana..........................        2,003          327          845\nIowa.............................          852          291          752\nKansas...........................          899          333          859\nKentucky.........................        1,033          254          656\nLouisiana........................        1,112          249          642\nMaine............................          337          263          678\nMaryland.........................        2,354          438        1,130\nMassachusetts....................        3,611          567        1,465\nMichigan.........................        3,860          388        1,001\nMinnesota........................        2,045          411        1,063\nMississippi......................          584          204          527\nMissouri.........................        1,785          317          818\nMontana..........................          209          228          589\nNebraska.........................          547          318          823\nNevada...........................          913          436        1,127\nNew Hampshire....................          615          488        1,261\nNew Jersey.......................        4,953          585        1,511\nNew Mexico.......................          420          227          586\nNew York.........................        9,392          496        1,283\nNorth Carolina...................        2,534          310          800\nNorth Dakota.....................          159          248          641\nOhio.............................        3,788          333          860\nOklahoma.........................          819          236          611\nOregon...........................        1,123          322          833\nPennsylvania.....................        4,566          372          960\nRhode Island.....................          363          344          890\nSouth Carolina...................        1,081          267          689\nSouth Dakota.....................          228          299          772\nTennessee........................        1,820          316          816\n\n[[Page S7514]]\n\n \nTexas............................        7,719          362          936\nUtah.............................          595          260          673\nVermont..........................          197          320          828\nVirginia.........................        3,069          426        1,102\nWashington.......................        3,169          527        1,362\nWest Virginia....................          363          201          518\nWisconsin........................        1,888          349          902\nWyoming..........................          207          411        1,061\nDistrict of Columbia.............          317          559        1,445\n                                  --------------------------------------\n      Total......................      111,571          392        1,013\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes. Includes provisions that only affect individual income tax\n  liabilities.\n \nSource. Tax Foundation.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this chart illustrates the benefits of \nthe income tax rate reductions State by State. As you can see, all \ntaxpaying families in all States benefit. The examples are endless of \nthe great benefits that we realize when we give tax relief to working \nfamilies.\n  While I am pleased about the first anniversary, I won't be satisfied \nuntil we make these bipartisan measures permanent.\n  Let's tell every taxpayer they can count on the 10 percent bracket 10 \nyears from now. Let's tell the small business owner that, after 10 \nyears of hard work, they won't face a tax rate of 39.6 percent. Let's \ntell the single mother with two children that her taxes won't rise by \n$1,200. Let's tell the newlyweds that 10 years from now they don't have \nto face a marriage penalty. Let's tell family farmers they won't face \nthe death tax 10 years from now. Let's tell workers saving for \nretirement that they can put away $5,000 in their IRA 10 years from \nnow. Let's tell a young couple that 10 years from now they will \ncontinue to be able to save $2,000 each year per child for college \nsavings.\n  I would like to sum up. In historical context, the tax relief package \nprovides a modest refund to all taxpayers at a level previously \nsupported by the Democratic leadership. Over time, the Democratic \nleadership's notion of what the top rate of tax should be has moved up.\n  Three assertions about the tax relief package, repeated almost daily \nby its critics, are incorrect. I will correct them once again. The tax \nrelief package is bipartisan. The tax relief package did not cause our \ncurrent or long-term budget problems. The tax relief package is \nprogressive.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the tax relief package provides \nimportant resources for families, small businesses, retirement \nsecurity, and education. These resources are valuable and should be \navailable to the American people on a permanent basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, today is a very important day because it \nis the 37th anniversary of the passing of the Medicare legislation \nproviding universal coverage of health care for all seniors. Everybody \ngot it. No matter what your income was, there was no gap. Those with \nlow income got Medicare, hospital, and doctor coverage. If you were of \nmoderate income, you got it. If you were upper income, you got it. It \nwas a concept 37 years ago that Medicare should be a universal health \ncare plan for all seniors.\n  Today, we are at some point going to be debating a fundamental change \nin Medicare by saying that only a portion of seniors are going to get \nreal prescription drug coverage--not all seniors, but we are going to \nmeans test it. According to the piece of paper provided by the \nsupporters of that approach, individuals below 200 percent of poverty--\nwhich is $13,300 for an individual--are going to have a Cadillac-type \nof coverage plan. But if you make $13,301, tough luck. You are going to \nhave to pay 95 percent of your drug coverage if you are not below 200 \npercent of poverty until you reach a figure of about $3,300 worth of \nout-of-pocket drug expenses, and then the Government will make up 90 \npercent.\n  It is really interesting to see whom are we talking about covering. \nIt is also important to think about whom we are not covering under this \nscaled-down version.\n  The average number of people in the United States below 200 percent \nof poverty is 30 percent. That means 70 percent of the American elderly \nwould not qualify by being under 200 percent of poverty. These are \nworking people who have paid taxes when they were working, who are \nretired, and now, because they don't qualify as being 200 percent under \npoverty, all of a sudden we are going to leave them out of a Medicare \nProgram that was supposed to provide universal health coverage for all \nAmericans. This is a fundamental break with what Medicare was all \nabout, which was a universal plan for all seniors, not just for seniors \nmaking under 200 percent of poverty.\n\n  Seventy percent of America's elderly would not qualify for the 200 \npercent poverty standard. That is not what we signed into law 37 years \nago and celebrate today, the advent of a Medicare Program that was \nuniversal coverage for all citizens.\n  I understand why we are attempting to do that. That is because we are \ntrying to spend less money. The tripartisan plan said we could spend \n$370 billion and reform Medicare by giving seniors new options and also \nprovide a universal prescription drug plan that covered all seniors, \nnot just those under 200 percent of poverty.\n  If I were a senior who had an income of $13,301, according to their \nchart, I would be very unhappy with what the Senate is considering now. \nSeventy percent of America's seniors would not qualify under 200 \npercent of poverty. We can do better than that. We can do far better \nthan that. We can do more for less, if we do it correctly and we do it \nin the proper fashion.\n  We had a plan under the tripartisan plan that was a comprehensive \nplan. It was a $24-a-month premium for seniors who have to meet a $250 \ndeductible, and\n\n[[Page S7515]]\n\nthen, after that, it was universal coverage for all seniors. They paid \n50 percent coinsurance, but everybody participated. Every senior was \ntreated equally, not just spending a substantial amount of money for a \nselective number of people.\n  Medicare is not an antipoverty program; Medicaid is. Medicare is \nuniversal coverage. It is not just saying to 70 percent of our seniors, \nyou are not going to get any real help. Some will say we are helping \nthose over 200 percent of poverty. You are not helping them very much \nwhen you tell them they have to pay 95 percent of the cost of their \nprescription drugs. Ninety-five percent, what kind of coverage is that? \nWe are going to say: We will help you with 5 percent, but 95 percent is \ngoing to have to come out of their pocket after 200 percent of poverty. \nThat doesn't seem to be a very good deal to me.\n  Then you say: When you get $3,300 worth of out-of-pocket drug costs, \nthe Government will help you again. It is not really the best we can \ndo. We can do far better than that. I think we ought to.\n  I don't know why we are actually voting. No. 1, everybody should \nrealize the bill did not come out of the Finance Committee, where all \nof this type of work should have been done, where all the compromises \nshould have been accomplished, instead of trying to go to the floor and \nhaving one bill one day without 60 votes, another bill without 60 \nvotes, and yet today another bill that does not have 60 votes.\n  We are putting people on the spot unnecessarily. I suggest we put \nthis off and begin the real work that is possible and get something \nthat works.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add 3 \nadditional minutes to my 12.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would be glad to yield further to my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. No, thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7515-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7515-S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE TRIPARTISAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nprescription drugs and how we intend to proceed on the Senate floor. I \nconcur with my colleague from Louisiana, with whom I have had the \nprivilege to work in crafting a tripartisan plan for more than a year, \nin hopes of avoiding a political showdown and confrontation on this \nmost significant issue facing seniors in this country.\n  I, too, agree with my colleague from Louisiana, in the hope that we \ncan avoid having another vote on two competing plans that will not get \nthe necessary 60 votes to proceed. I hope we can avoid a collision at \nthe crossroads on this most significant domestic issue facing our \nNation's seniors.\n  We have been negotiating all weekend to try to work out an agreement. \nSenator Grassley is here in the Chamber, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee. He has been working consistently and diligently to \ntry to negotiate an agreement. Now we are faced with a political \nshowdown; we are faced with a decision to either vote for the lowest \ncommon denominator or for no prescription drug coverage at all.\n  I do not believe in letting the perfect become the enemy of the good, \nbut we certainly should not countenance the political becoming the \nenemy of the practical, the attainable, and the doable. We should not \nfind ourselves in this situation today because we have been working for \nmore than a year and a half in developing a plan to avoid having \npolitics undermine that process.\n  That is why we reached across the political aisle, Republicans to \nDemocrats and Independents, and vice versa, so that we can begin to \nsort out our ideas. That is not to say we had all the right ideas, but \nwe did it to begin that process that should have begun in the Finance \nCommittee--to debate, to amend, to work through competing ideas in \norder to achieve a consensus that would give impetus to the passage of \nthis legislation. We should have had that markup. We have been saying \nthat for weeks. In fact, we anticipated we would have a markup on that \ncritical legislation. But we were denied that opportunity for unknown \nreasons. So now we are hearing we are going to have a vote regardless--\nthe all-or-nothing proposition that seems to overtake and mire the \npolitical process to the point that it really jams the monkey wrenches \ninto this institution.\n\n  I hope we will avoid having another vote for the sake of having a \nvote, drawing lines in the sand so people's positions become more \nintractable. I hope we can avoid that kind of situation and \nconfrontation. We have been spending more than a week and a half on \nlegislation that is very important to America. Using generics would \nsave the American Government $8 billion. It would also save our \nNation's consumers more than $60 billion over 10 years. We have been \nspending more than 2 weeks on that proposition in the Senate. It has \nhad consideration in the committee of jurisdiction for several days as \nwell.\n  Compare that to our initiative on prescription drug coverage--no \nconsideration in the Senate Finance Committee, up-or-down votes on the \nfloor of the Senate on a $400 billion program--$400 billion. That is \nmore than the annual spending of the Defense Department. It is more \nthan the newly organized Department of Homeland Security that we will \nbe considering as well.\n  So now we are being asked to have one vote, as we did last week, on \neach competing plan on prescription drug coverage--it will presumably \ncost $400 billion over the next 10 years--with no committee \nconsideration, no up-or-down votes on the Senate floor, no ability to \namend--$400 billion. When was the last time we created a domestic \nprogram that cost $400 billion, with no consideration in the committee \nand hardly any consideration on the floor of the Senate? When?\n  We have spent weeks and weeks in the committees considering the \nhomeland security legislation. We have spent 2 weeks on the floor of \nthe Senate on a bill that will save the Nation's consumers $60 billion \nover 10 years. And we have heard announced consideration for a domestic \nprogram that will cost our Government more than $400 billion. It is \nreally hard to understand why we are in the circumstances that we are \nin today. That is why I ask that we put off any polarizing votes, so \nthat we can further work to achieve a consensus on the broader plan.\n  There were criticisms against the tripartisan plan--that it created a \ndonut, it created a gap in coverage between $3,450 and $3,700 under \ncatastrophic.\n  The legislation being put forward by the Senator from Florida will \nonly provide coverage to seniors at extremely high costs and low \nincomes, or very low income coverage. More than half of our Nation's \nseniors will have no coverage at all. Above 200 percent, there will be \na cliff because an individual earning $17,721 will get zero coverage \nuntil they spend $3,300. A couple with an income of $23,880 will get \nzero coverage. So until they spend $3,300 in prescription drug coverage \ncosts, they have no coverage whatsoever. Well, I would say that is an \nenormous gap in coverage.\n  Our plan is to the contrary. It minimizes that gap in coverage. It is \n\\50/50\\ coverage above 150 percent, to $3,450; 80 percent will not even \nreach that benefit limit, and we provide a catastrophic coverage \nbeginning at $3,700. Ninety-nine percent of all seniors will \nparticipate in our program, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. But under the legislation proposed by the Senator from Florida, \nmore than half of our Medicare beneficiaries will have no coverage at \nall. They will have no coverage at all. That is creating a huge gap in \ncoverage. It is a huge gap, and I think we can do better.\n  We have worked with the Senator from Massachusetts on concerns about \nthe delivery mechanism in our legislation. So we have agreed to modify \nthat to provide an absolute, ironclad agreement that there will be a \nfallback mechanism in the event the insurance risk delivery system \nfails. So there will be a guarantee, regardless of where you live in \nAmerica, that you will have a benefit of the standard program that we \noffer in our legislation.\n  But we even went further and agreed to increase our program from $370 \nbillion to $400 billion. So we have been flexible. We are willing to \nwork across\n\n[[Page S7516]]\n\nparty lines to avoid the political showdown by having this up-or-down \nvote at all costs, not trying to search for a common ground, not having \nan adequate, thorough debate in the committee and on the floor, and a \n$400 billion program.\n  I would like to know, when is the last time the Senate has created a \n$400 billion social program that has had no consideration in the Senate \nFinance Committee, or any committee of the Senate, and has had \nvirtually no consideration on the floor, no amendments, just an up-our-\ndown vote? If you do not get your 60, tough luck: Is that what the \nSenate is all about, Madam President? Is that what it is all about? It \nis winning at all costs?\n\n  Who is going to pay for those costs? Our Nation's seniors. Our \nNation's seniors are going to pay the cost--that is what this is all \nabout--and they are going to pay a high cost because so many will \neither have minimal coverage or no coverage at all. This is how many \npeople, when one looks at this chart, will be omitted from coverage in \nthe plan offered by the Senator from Florida: 26 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I know we can do better. We worked for more than a year to create a \nplan that included Democrats, included our Independent, Senator \nJeffords from Vermont, so that we could avoid this kind of impasse.\n  I would hope that we would avoid this unnecessary political showdown \ntoday or tomorrow. I hope we can put aside our differences and forge \nsolutions to the problems that our Nation's seniors face when it comes \nto catastrophic costs for our Nation's seniors who have a chronic \nillness.\n  In fact, there was an op-ed piece in the New York Times yesterday \nwhich indicated that most people face costs of $1,200 to $1,500. They \nare the chronically ill. Guess what. Under the plan offered by the \nSenator from Florida, many of those individuals will not get any \ncoverage until they spend $3,300. They will get no coverage whatsoever.\n  Won't they be surprised when we pass a so-called prescription drug \nbenefit coverage that says the Nation's seniors are now covered and \nwhen they find out, no, not exactly. You will pay an annual fee of $25 \nand then discover you do not have any coverage because, if you earn \n$17,721 as an individual, you get zero coverage until you spend $3,300. \nIf you are a couple and earn $23,881 in income, then you have to spend \n$3,300 in prescription drugs before you get any coverage. That is a \nhuge gap in coverage.\n  Last week, in the two votes we did have on the two competing plans, \nthere was a common thread. That common thread was continuing to embrace \nuniversal coverage in the Medicare Program, which is a principle that \nmost of us--97 percent, 97 votes--supported continuing in the Medicare \nProgram. If we take the approach of low income and catastrophic \ncoverage solely as the kind of benefit we decide to enact in the \nSenate, we are abandoning the principle of universal coverage in the \nMedicare Program.\n  I hope we do not plan to move in that direction. That clearly will be \nthe wrong approach. It will be the wrong approach for Medicare and \ncertainly will be the wrong approach for our Nation's seniors. We can \ndo better, and I hope we will do better. We have the ability to do \nbetter.\n  I urge my colleagues to reconsider and I urge the leadership to avoid \nany votes so we can continue to work on this issue, if it takes August \nand come back in September, if we cannot do it this week. But let's \navoid the kind of confrontation that will manifest itself in the vote \nthat is recommended on the one plan alone.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7516-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Until 5 to 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I thank Senator Reid for that \nclarification so we can get some further time for debate on this \nimportant issue and so that Senator McConnell can talk more about the \nspecifics.\n  I believe in this country we have a medical malpractice crisis. There \nis a huge problem with frivolous lawsuits being filed and large \nverdicts being rendered. Let me read some of what is happening in my \nown State where within a few days the legislature is going to have a \nspecial session to try to deal with this crisis because doctors are \ngetting out of obstetrics; they are getting out of the business of \ndelivering babies. And they are getting out because the doctors cannot \nget medical malpractice insurance coverage. As they lose their coverage \nthey are also leaving the State. We now have huge areas of the State \nwhere there are few, if any, doctors available to deliver babies.\n  In Mississippi we are expected to lose an estimated 400 doctors this \nyear because they are retiring, getting out of practice, or moving to \nother States, including Louisiana. Why Louisiana? Because in Louisiana \nthey have some caps on punitive damages that help limit the size of the \nverdicts against doctors.\n  Madam President, last year, in Bolivar County, there were six doctors \nproviding obstetrical care. Today there are three. In neighboring \nSunflower County, all four doctors who delivered babies quit private \npractice. So there is a large area where the citizens of my state \ncannot get medical care for pregnant mothers and for delivering babies \nbecause their doctors cannot get or cannot afford malpractice \ninsurance.\n  Some expectant mothers now have to drive 100 miles just to get to a \ndoctor, let alone a regional hospital. In the northern half of the \nState last year, there were nine practicing neurosurgeons; now there \nare just three on emergency call. And it does not appear that the \nsituation is going to get any better soon. The North Mississippi \nMedical Center, a hospital that serves 22 counties and 600,000 people, \nis finding it impossible to recruit new doctors.\n  But not only is the next generation of doctors being scared away from \nthe\n\n[[Page S7517]]\n\nState by Mississippi's tort friendly medical malpractice environment, \nsoaring insurance premiums, and word of multi-million dollar jury \nawards, so are the insurance companies themselves. There used to be 14 \ncompanies underwriting liability in my State, now there's one willing \nto write new policies.\n  And those companies that are staying in Mississippi are being forced \nto charge exorbitant rates to cover their liability exposure to \nfrivolous lawsuits and large verdicts. For instance, maternity care \nused to make up about 30 percent of family practitioner Scott Nelson's \npractice in his hometown of Cleveland, MS. But Nelson got out of the \nbusiness October 1 when his annual malpractice premium jumped from \n$30,000 to $105,000.\n  Had he had continued his practice, Nelson would have had to pay that \neven more exorbitant premiums in the future, and in these small \ncommunities, the amount of money doctors make is not so great that they \ncan afford to pay over $100,000 in medical malpractice insurance year \nin and year out.\n  Madam President, the Clarion Ledger in my home state a couple of days \nago quoted a report from the National Law Journal which found that of \nthe 50 firms in America that had the largest verdicts from juries, 9 of \nthem are in my State of Mississippi, with one firm getting 5 verdicts \ntotaling $177.5 million, the largest of which was against Janssen \nPharmceutica for $100 million. Another firm got $171.27 million, $150 \nmillion of which was from a single verdict against AC Manufacturing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article I am about to refer to from \nthe Clarion-Ledger on July 28, 2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed to \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, July 28, 2002]\n\n              Top 50 Law Firm List Shows 9 in Mississippi\n\n                            (By Sid Salter)\n\n       Mississippi takes the rap for being last in so many indices \n     of economic and social progress. The list of ``worst firsts'' \n     is endless.\n       But there is one index in which Mississippi shines like a \n     new penny. That news comes via the pages of The National Law \n     Journal. It's called the ``Litigation 50.''\n       Seems that nine of the nation's ``winningest'' 50 law firms \n     in 2001 are in Mississippi--a measure based on The Journal's \n     assessment of the gross amount of money awarded by juries \n     during trials concluded between Jan. 1, 2001, and Dec. 31, \n     2001.\n       Quoth The Journal: ``A firm's rankings is based on the \n     total amount from all cases tried to a verdict before a jury, \n     but does not include any money obtained through settlements \n     or through bench trials. The ranking also does not take into \n     account any post-trial changes in the judgment.''\n\n\n                           Meet the top dogs\n\n       Take a look at Mississippi's players in the ``Litigation \n     50'':\n       No. 11, Shannon Law Firm, Hazlehurst, five verdicts \n     totaling $177.5 million, the largest a $100 million verdict \n     against Janssen Pharmceutica Inc.\n       No. 12, Blackmon and Blackmon, Canton, six verdicts \n     totaling $171.27 million, the largest a $100 million verdict \n     against Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc.\n       No. 14, Isaac Byrd and Associates, Jackson, seven verdicts \n     totaling $150 million, the largest a $150 million verdict \n     against AC Manufacturing Inc.\n       No. 15, Porter and Malouf, Greenwood, two verdicts totaling \n     $150 million, the largest a $150 million verdict against AC \n     Manufacturing Inc.\n       No. 24, Grenfell, Sledge and Stevens, Jackson, four \n     verdicts totaling $100 million, the largest a $100 million \n     verdict against Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc.\n       No. 25, Owens Law Firm, Jackson, four verdicts totaling \n     $100 million, the largest a $100 million verdict against \n     Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc.\n       No. 26, Upshaw, Williams, Biggers, Beckham and Riddick, \n     Greenwood, 26 verdicts totaling $100 million, the largest a \n     $100 million verdict against Janssen Phanaceutica Inc.\n       No. 29, Langston Sweet & Freese, Jackson, 13 verdicts \n     totaling $94.27 million, the largest a $71.27 million verdict \n     against Washington Mutual Finance Group.\n       No. 37, former Gov. Bill Allain, one verdict totaling $77.5 \n     million against St. Paul Fire Insurance.\n\n\n                          Blackmon's other job\n\n       Certainly, this ranking speaks volumes about every law firm \n     represented in the ``Litigation 50'' ranking and of \n     individual litigators employed by those firms.\n       But it also once again calls into question whether state \n     Rep. Ed Blackmon--whose law firm was ranked by The Journal as \n     the 12th most successful plaintiffs' law firm in the country \n     in 2001--should be made co-chairman of the Mississippi \n     Legislature's special joint committee studying tort reform.\n       A legislator who is a pharmacist just spent years in the \n     courts defending a conflict of interest charge simply because \n     his pharmacy accepted Medicaid.\n       But we're told by the legislative leadership that the \n     state's business and medical community shouldn't worry when \n     one of the nation's top trial lawyers is appointed to oversee \n     proposed tort reforms that could take millions out of his own \n     pockets?\n       Foxes? Hen houses? Bingo.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The ability to have verdicts reach companies--even when \ncompanies are not directly involved in the alleged wrongdoing--through \nthe use of joint and several liability is also causing huge problems in \nthe medical malpractice and other fields. Despite the fact that they \noften have only tangential relationships to alleged wrongdoers, the \nplaintiffs' lawyers often include companies in lawsuits simply because \nthey have the deep pockets and the companies all too often end up \ngetting stuck having to pay the lion's share of multi-million dollar \nverdicts even though they actually did very little wrong.\n  I often wonder what government officials and responsible citizens in \nmy State think is going to happen over the long term to companies that \nare faced with this kind of threat from juries in my State? What do \nthey think is going to happen as the verdicts against doctors continue \nto go up and the insurance premiums to cover medical malpractice \ninsurance costs continue to go up. They are finding out very quickly as \nmany doctors and other medical providers are literally closing up shop \nand leaving town.\n  Madam President, this is a very important issue that is affecting \nhealth care in America, that is driving up the costs of health care all \nacross America, that is making medical malpractice insurance \nunaffordable even for doctors, and which is limiting Americans' access \nto health care. What is the solution?\n  Senator McConnell has the solution in his amendment. It would put \nreasonable limits on punitive damages. It would provide for \nproportional liability so one company with marginal involvement is not \nheld responsible for the entire costs of a verdict handed down by a \njury.\n  There are also limits on attorney's fees. That provision when you \nthink about it is really about the patients, the people who are hurt, \nand not about the attorneys who get 40, 50, 60 percent of a judgment in \nmany cases.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment also has collateral source reform, to \nstop lawyer's double dipping from both their client's insurance \ncompanies and the defendants they drag into court.\n  The amendment also has alternative dispute resolution. Is that not a \nbetter way to go, to find a solution without having to go through the \nexpense of trials, litigation and jackpot verdicts. Would it not be \nmuch better to first try to get a quick resolution of the matter \noutside of the courtroom?\n  Senator McConnell's amendment should be included as part of this \ndebate we are having about health care accessibility and the cost of \nprescription drugs. I should note that nearly identical language passed \nthe Senate in 1995 by a vote of 53 to 47, but it was later vetoed by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment is an important one. I understand that \nDemocrats will perhaps move to try to table it, but this is a critical \nissue in America that has to be addressed. The American Medical \nAssociation announced last month that because of astronomical \nmalpractice premium increases, 12 States are in a health care crisis \nmode, with 30 other States on the brink of crisis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a compendium of news accounts about the \nmedical malpractice crisis affecting the Nation, which was written by \nthe Republican Policy Committee and titled ``Overzealous Trial Lawyers \nAre Denying Medical Care to Expectant Mothers,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOverzealous Trial Lawyers Are Denying Medical Care to Expectant Mothers\n\n\n                 The Need for Medical Liability Reform\n\n       Mothers and children are being denied medical care because \n     physicians' liability premiums are soaring and forcing many \n     to move to more doctor-friendly states, curtail their \n     practices, or close up shop entirely:\n       ``The malpractice crisis has been building for years but \n     culminating last December\n\n[[Page S7518]]\n\n     when the country's largest medical malpractice issuers, the \n     St. Paul Companies, dropped tens of thousands of physicians. \n     Other issuers have also cut back on clients or jacked up \n     premiums.

Clines, ``Insurance-Squeezed Doctors \n     Fold Their Tents,'' The New York Times, 6/13/02]\n       ``Bluefield Regional Center, a major hospital in the \n     state's hardscrabble south, lost 12 doctors in the last two \n     years and has been able to replace only 2.'' [Francis X. \n     Clines, ``Insurance-Squeezed Doctors Fold Their Tents,'' The \n     New York Times, 6/13/02]\n\n\n                         an untenable situation\n\n       How bad has the medical liability environment become? As \n     one article states [Michael Freedman, ``The Tort Mess,'' \n     Forbes.com, 5/13/02]:\n       ``In some parts of the country, doctors say, it is almost \n     better to let a patient die than to attempt heroic surgery, \n     fail and risk a lawsuit.''\n       If the medical liability system is making doctors think \n     twice about saving lives, that system needs to be reformed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if we do not get some control of these \noutlandish lawsuits and the verdicts that are being handed down both in \nthe field of medical malpractice and in the broader area of tort \nreform, the never-ending stream of lawsuits that are being filed in \nthis country is going to continue putting good men and women out of the \npractice of medicine, good companies out of business, and good men and \nwomen out of work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Under the previous order, the \ntime until 12:55 will be equally divided and controlled by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and the Senator from Kentucky or their designees.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So we have how much time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we have heard some discussion earlier today about the \nstate of the debate on the prescription drug program. To remind all of \nour colleagues, that legislation would have been tied up in the Finance \nCommittee for over 5 years. It was only because of the leadership of \nSenator Daschle that\n\n[[Page S7520]]\n\nwe were able to ensure that we had some debate on the floor of the \nSenate on a matter of central importance to families all over this \ncountry. With the leadership of Senator Graham, Senator Miller, and \nothers, we have had a good debate.\n  We had some votes in the Senate on some very important comprehensive \nmeasures. There was the vote, which I was proud to support, on Senator \nGraham's amendment, which received 52 votes. If we had had 8 votes from \nthat side of the aisle, this legislation would be on its way now to a \nconference and there would be a real possibility of gaining \ncomprehensive coverage. That program provided a $25 premium, no \ndeductible, and limited copays at $10 for generic drugs, $40 for brand \nname drugs. It also had a catastrophic program. That was the way to go. \nBut it was defeated. No one supported it.\n  Now, 10 days later, can we make a difference and provide some relief \nto the seniors in our country? Senator Graham will have the \nopportunity, after the disposal of this amendment, to make his case, \nwhich I intend to support for reasons I will outline during the course \nof that debate. But none of us should be under any illusion of where \nthe responsibility lies in terms of our failure to get a comprehensive \nprogram. We were able to gather the support of virtually every Member \non this side of the aisle for a very comprehensive program with low \npremiums and no deductibles, and a very reasonable copay that had the \nsupport of all of the senior groups.\n  When I listen to those who were opposed to it talk about their \nalternative, they clearly did not have the support of a single senior \ngroup.\n  Now let us get back to what is at hand, and that is the medical \nmalpractice amendment introduced by my friend from the State of \nKentucky.\n  On Friday, the sponsor of this amendment, Mr. McConnell--which has \nalso been characterized by the Senator from Tennessee--described it as \n``pro-victim and pro-consumer.'' He claimed that since his amendment \ndid not contain a cap on non-economic damages, it would not ``adversely \naffect'' an injured patient's ability to recover compensation for \ninjuries caused by a health care provider. In fact, the McConnell \namendment is pro-HMO, pro-drug manufacturer, and pro-insurance company, \nat the expense of patients.\n  Make no mistake about it. There is a great deal in this amendment \nwhich would deprive serious injured patients of fair compensation. At \nvirtually every stage of the legal process, the amendment \nsystematically rewrites the rules of civil law to tip the balance in \nfavor of defendants. It would arbitrarily shield health care providers \nand their insurance companies from basic responsibility for the harm \nthey cause.\n  At a time when the American people are calling for greater corporate \naccountability, it is unbelievable that our Republican colleagues would \nbring to the floor an amendment which would do just the opposite. The \nMcConnell amendment would allow the entire health care industry to \navoid accountability for the care they provide and that is not \nacceptable.\n  While those across the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real \nbeneficiaries will be insurance companies. This amendment would enrich \nthe insurance industry at the expense of the most seriously injured \npatients; men, women, and children whose entire lives have been \ndevastated by medical neglect and corporate abuse.\n  This proposal would also shield HMOs that fail to provide needed \ncare, nursing homes that neglect elderly patients, drug companies whose \nmedicine has toxic side effects, and manufacturers of defective medical \nequipment.\n  It would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the entire \nhealth care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they \nhave suffered. When will the Republican Party start worrying about \ninjured patients and stop trying to shield big business from the \nconsequences of its wrongdoing? Less accountability will never lead to \nbetter health care.\n  There is no real question about the effect of their amendment. It \nwould, in fact, place major new restrictions on the right of seriously \ninjured patients to recover fair compensation for their injuries. Let's \nlook at what the amendment actually does.\n  It abolishes joint and several liability for non-economic damages. \nThis means the most seriously injured people may never receive all of \nthe compensation that the court has awarded to them. Under the \namendment, health care provides whose misconduct contributed to the \npatient's injuries will be able to escape responsibility for paying \nfull compensation to that patient. The patient's injuries would not \nhave happened if not for the misconduct of both defendants, so each \ndefendant should be responsible for making sure the victim is fully \ncompensated.\n  The bias in the McConnell amendment could not be clearer. It would \npreempt State laws that allow fair treatment for injured patients, but \nwould allow State laws to be enacted which had greater restrictions on \npatients' rights than the proposed federal law. This one-way preemption \nshows how result-oriented the amendment really is. It is not about \nfairness or balance. It is about protecting defendants.\n  The amendment preempts state statutes of limitation, cutting back the \ntime allowed by many states for a patient to file suit against the \nhealth care provider who injured him.\n  It mandates that providers and insurance companies be permitted to \npay a judgment in installments rather than all at once. Allowing health \ncare providers, including HMO's, large drug manufacturers and their \ninsurance companies to pay on the installment plan transfers \ncompensatory dollars that rightfully belong to an injured patient back \nto the wrongdoer. If the patient does not receive the money for years, \nhe in reality is getting less money than the court concluded that he \ndeserves for his injuries.\n  The amendment makes it much harder to sue a physician for injuring a \nbaby or its mother during the delivery process if the doctor had not \npreviously treated the mother. It requires a much higher burden of \nproof, clear and convincing evidence, than is normally provided for in \na civil case. There is no reason why a practicing physician should not \nbe held to the normal standard of medical care merely because he had \nnot previously treated the patient. Such a provision is grossly unfair \nto pregnant women. In essence, their doctors are held to a lower \nstandard of care than all other medical professionals.\n  The places extremely restrictive limitations on when an injured \npatient can receive punitive damages, and how much punitive damages the \nvictim can recover. It would cap punitive damages at twice the amount \nof compensatory damages, no matter how egregious the defendant's \nconduct and no matter how large its assets. This would destroy the \ndeterrent effect of punitive damages in the very few cases where \npunitives would still be allowed.\n  Even more outrageous is the language on page 23 which appears to say \nthat the government would take half of any punitive damages which the \ninjured patient did receive. This amounts to a confiscatory tax on \npunitive recoveries, which is extremely unfair to the victims. It is \nthe victims who have been harmed by the malevolent conduct. The \ngovernment should not arbitrarily take half of the jury award.\n  It imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the contingent fee \nwhich a client and his or her attorney can agree to. This will make it \nmore difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their \nchoice in cases that involve complex legal issues. It can have the \neffect of denying them their day in court. Again the provision is one-\nsided, because it places no limit on how much the health care provider \ncan spend defending the case.\n  If we were to enact all of these arbitrary restrictions on the \ncompensation which seriously injured patients can receive, what \nbenefits would result in our health case system? Certainly less \naccountability for health care providers will never improve the quality \nof health care. Substandard medical care is a growing problem.\n  The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality at HHS found that the \nnumber of adverse effects from medical treatment has more than doubled \nin recent years. These disturbing statistics make clear that we need \nmore accountability in the health care system, not less. In this era of \nmanaged care and cost controls, it is ludicrous to suggest\n\n[[Page S7521]]\n\nthat the major problem facing American health care is ``defensive \nmedicine.'' The problem is not ``too much health care,'' it is ``too \nlittle'' quality health care.\n  In the time remaining, I will cover two or three other points. This \nchart asks, Do malpractice premiums drive up medical costs? It shows \nhealth care and malpractice inflation. Look at health care costs they \nhave gone up 74 percent since 1988; medical malpractice costs, 5.7 \npercent.\n  For States without caps on damages, the average cost of medical \nmalpractice insurance is $7,715 for internal medicine; in States with \ncaps on damages, it is $7,887. For general surgery, it is $26,144 for \nStates without and $26,746 for States with caps on damages; for OB/GYN, \nit is $43,000 for States without caps versus $44,000 for States with \ncaps.\n  The impact on general health care issues has been considerably less. \nThe fact remains that the number of doctors per 100,000 people in \nStates which do have the caps versus those that do not are virtually \nidentical. The costs of the premiums are exactly the same.\n  Let's get focused on where the needs are and the beneficiaries and \nthe losers of this amendment. The beneficiaries will be the insurance \ncompanies; the losers will be the patients who are going to suffer \nbecause of negligence. That is wrong. That proposal should not be \naccepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this amendment is related to the crisis \nof medical malpractice that we have across our country due to the \nfailure to impose accountability and responsibility on big, powerful \ntrial lawyers who are running roughshod over doctors and taking \nadvantage of their clients. That is what this debate is about.\n  Senator Hatch is here and I yield him 2 minutes. After Senator Hatch, \nSenator Frist would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just to inquire, are we going to go back \nand forth? I didn't know the Senator had the right to yield successive \nperiods of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order at this point.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Frist had to go to a meeting. \nHe is only asking for 3 minutes, and Senator Hatch is only taking 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to the impassioned speech of the \nSenator from Massachusetts. The fact is, there will not be any medical \nliability insurance companies. One major company has gone out of \nbusiness because of what amounts to unreasonable litigation all over \nthe country.\n  It used to be that all you had to do was show that you met the \nstandard of practice in the community and that was enough to alleviate \ndoctors from medical liability. When the doctor of informed consent \ncame into being, then every case from that point went to a jury. The \nreason is because they could make any claim they wanted, and ingenious \nlawyers can write the claims so they go to the jury.\n  We have a crisis in this country. I estimated 15 years ago that at \nleast $300 billion a year was being wasted in unnecessary defensive \nmedicine. If anything, that number has gone up. Mr. President, 50.5 \npercent of family practitioners in Utah have given up obstetrical \nservices or never practiced obstetrics. Of the remaining 49.5 percent \nstill delivering babies, 32.7 percent plan to stop providing OB/GYN \nservices within the next decade. Most plan to stop within the next 5 \nyears.\n  The people who are really going to be hurt will be the most \nvulnerable people in our society, the children.\n  Frankly, we have to stop letting this medical liability situation go \nstock wild. It is way out of control. This is an amendment that does \nmake intelligent approaches to trying to resolve the problems.\n  This is an important issue about which I have spoken on previous \noccasions. I am pleased to see that on July 25, President Bush \nannounced his desire to address the medical malpractice problem. We \nwelcome his support in this effort.\n  As many of you will recall, we debated, and passed, the exact \nprovisions that are contained in the McConnell amendment during the \nCommonsense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act debate back in 1995. \nUnfortunately, the language was stripped from the bill in conference. I \nwill say many of the same things now that I said back then, because, \nregrettably, they still apply and need to be said. I am sorely \ndisappointed that in the ensuing seven years we have still not acted to \naddress the fact that medical malpractice costs have spiraled out of \ncontrol and are forcing many doctors and hospitals out of the \nprofession. The situation has gotten worse, not better. We must act now \nif we are at all serious about fixing the crisis in healthcare delivery \nthis has caused in many parts of this country.\n  Make no mistake, we have a healthcare crisis in this country, one \nthat is due in large part to litigation that is out of control. Many \nmay not be aware of just how serious the ramifications of the crisis \nare.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a July 18 \nAssociated Press article, ``Soaring Malpractice Insurance Squeezes out \nDoctors, Clinics,'' which highlights these problems. The article points \nto the ``national problem that doctors say is obliging many of them to \nflee certain states or give up certain specialties--or the entire \nprofession--because of skyrocketing insurance premiums linked to \nsoaring jury awards.''\n  The article goes on to note that, as I am sure my colleagues from \nNevada are acutely aware and Senators McConnell and Frist already \nmentioned--the University Medical Center trauma clinic in Las Vegas--\nthe only Level 1 trauma center in Nevada--closed down on July 3 of this \nyear. The 58 doctors who were associated with the trauma center had \ninsisted on much-needed relief from the soaring cost of medical \nmalpractice insurance. Consequently, the day after the center closed, a \nvictim of a serious traffic accident had to be transported to the next \nnearest emergency room which was an hour away. The trauma center was \nhurriedly reopened on July 13, but with only 10-15 doctors working on a \ntemporary basis, with limited liability, while the Governor tries to \nenact legislation limiting awards in medical malpractice cases. We \ndon't know if that trauma center will be forced to close again. \nCommenting on the trauma center's closure, its Director, Dr. John \nFildes, stated that ``the standard of care in our community was set \nback 25 years.''\n  No one knows whether the life of that tragic accident victim in Las \nVegas could have been saved had he been treated at the nearby hospital. \nWould any of us want that to happen to our loved ones--traveling an \nhour to receive emergency care? I certainly wouldn't, and the Senate \nshould take the necessary steps to ensure that it does not happen to \nanyone else.\n\n  The problem of providing necessary healthcare in the face of rising \ninsurance costs and the threat of excessive litigation cuts across \nmultiple specialties, not just emergency services.\n  Ensuring the availability of adequate obstetric care continues to be \na rising problem. According to the same article, one Arizona hospital, \na clinic in Oregon, and two Pennsylvania hospitals recently have closed \ntheir obstetrics units. Several counties in upstate New York have no \nobstetricians covering night shifts. There is an increasing shortage in \nmy home state of Utah as well. Studies by both the Utah Medical \nAssociation and the Utah Chapter of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists underscore the problem in my state:\n\n       50.5 percent of Family Practitioners in Utah have already \n     given up obstetrical services or never practiced obstetrics. \n     Of the remaining 49.5 percent who still deliver babies, 32.7 \n     percent say they plan to stop providing OB services within \n     the next decade. Most plan to stop within the next five \n     years.\n\n  According to this Utah Medical Association study:\n\n       Professional liability concerns [was] given as the chief \n     contributing factor in the decision to discontinue \n     obstetrical services. Such concerns include the cost of \n     liability insurance premiums, the hassles and costs involved \n     in defending against obstetrical lawsuits and a general fear \n     of being sued in today's litigious environment.\n\n  Mr. President, ensuring the availability of quality prenatal and \ndelivery\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\ncare for the most vulnerable members of our society is imperative for \nobvious reasons.\n  The newly-released Department of Health and Human Services report \n``Confronting the New Health Care Crisis: Improving Health Care Quality \nand Lowering Cost by Fixing our Medical Liability System'' released by \nHHS Secretary Tommy Thompson includes a detailed review of recent \nstudies on the consequences of out-of-control medical liability crisis \nthat is threatening healthcare in many parts of America. Even volunteer \nmedical services are threatened. According to the report, ``[m]any \ndoctors cannot volunteer their services for a patient who cannot pay, \nand the proportion of the physicians who provide charity care at all \nhas declined, because doctors cannot afford the required liability \ncoverage.'' It further details the rising costs of insurance premiums:\n\n       Doctors alone had to pay over $6 billion in medical \n     liability premiums last year, and premiums this year in many \n     states have increased by more than 20 percent on average and \n     more than 75 percent for specialties in some states. . \n     .Excessive liability also adds $30 billion to $60 billion \n     annually to Federal government payments for Medicare, \n     Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \n     Veterans' Administration health care, health care for Federal \n     Employees, and other government programs.\n\n  The HHS study further details how reasonable medical \nmalpractice reforms in some states have been working to reduce \nhealthcare costs and improve access and quality of care. I urge my \ncolleagues to read this report.\n\n  Our entire medical system--which everyone knows is heralded as the \nbest in the world--is based on a total reliance on the abilities of the \nhealth care professionals who treat us, professionals who have \nsacrificed immeasurably to get the requisite training and \ncredentialing. These are professionals who spend long and hard hours in \nschool and at work to make our system the best in the world.\n  Will there be mistakes? Of course there will be; we are only human. \nAnd while we must strive for perfection, that by definition cannot be. \nMy heart goes out to each and every person who has suffered an adverse \nmedical event, whether it was caused by the medical delivery system or \nnot.\n  I was a trial attorney before I came to Congress. I saw heart-\nwrenching cases in which mistakes were made. But I also saw heart-\nwrenching cases in which mistakes were not made and doctors were forced \nto expend valuable time and resources defending themselves against \nfrivolous lawsuits. I have litigated these cases, both as an attorney \nfor the plaintiff and as an attorney for the defendant.\n  No one in this body knows better than I--perhaps with the exception \nof our colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist--what the defects are in \nthis system. Mr. President, I wish we could design a system which would \nprotect each and everyone from harm, but that is not possible. Our job \nis to design the best system we can. But in a country as large and \ndiverse as this one, problems are inevitable. The task before us is to \nmake sure the system minimizes those problems. Thus the question before \nus is: how to design a system which protects both the patient and the \nprovider? I do not believe that a protracted war between trial \nattorneys and health care professionals is the way to accomplish that \ngoal.\n  Why do we need to pass this amendment dealing with medical \nmalpractice liability? Medical liability costs are out of control, as I \nhave already stated. President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers \npublished a paper in April estimating that the U.S. tort system, \ncosting $180 billion, of which medical torts comprise a large part, is \nthe most expensive in the world as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct, equivalent to a three percent tax on wages. Professional \nliability rates are rising in response to our runaway tort system. And \nliability costs are having a direct impact on healthcare spending.\n  It is often the case that doctors feel compelled to run diagnostic \ntests that are costly and unnecessary, in order to cover themselves--it \nis defensive medicine. It is wasteful, but unfortunately has become \nnecessary. The only way to stop this is to get some reason into the \nsystem.\n  Senator McConnell's amendment attempts to address many of the \nproblems in this area by instilling a much needed measure of stability \ninto our legal lottery that will benefit both patient and provider.\n  How? This amendment would take the following, necessary, steps: To \nstart, the amendment sets standards for punitive damages. In order for \na claimant to receive such damages, he or she must prove by clear and \nconvincing evidence that either:\n  The defendant intended to injure the claimant for a reason unrelated \nto health care;\n  The defendant understood the claimant was substantially certain to \nsuffer unnecessary injury and yet still deliberately failed to avoid \nsuch injury; or\n  The defendant acted with a conscious, flagrant disregard of a \nsubstantial and unjustifiable risk of unnecessary injury, which the \ndefendant failed to avoid in a manner which constituted a gross \ndeviation from the normal standard of conduct.\n  Furthermore, punitive damages would be limited to two times the sum \nof compensatory damages, which includes both economic and non-economic \ndamages.\n  With our current system, defendants who are only one percent at fault \ncould be held responsible for 100 percent of the award--which certainly \ndoes nothing to encourage doctors to continue to provide care. Under \nthis amendment, there would be proportionate liability for non-economic \nand punitive damages, so that doctors are only liable for their actual \nshare of damages if culpability is established. However, joint \nliability would remain for economic damages.\n  In addition, courts would be allowed to require periodic payments for \nlarge awards rather than lump sums, which makes it easier for insurers \nto judge their appropriate reserves. I would note that under Utah law, \nperiodic payments for awards of over $100,000 are mandatory. This does \nnot reduce the claimant's award. Past and current expenses will \ncontinue to be paid at the time of judgment, while future damages can \nbe funded over time with less risk of bankrupting the defendant. Awards \nin malpractice cases also would be reduced by the amount of \ncompensation received from collateral sources, in order to prevent the \npractice of ``double dipping.''\n  This amendment also limits attorneys' fees, but I think, in a \nreasonable manner. Attorneys' fees that could be paid out of an award \nwould be limited to 33 percent of the first $150,000 and 25 percent of \nany amount awarded above that. I have to say, I am concerned about any \nlimitation on attorneys' fees, but there have been some colossal rip-\noffs in this area and this appears to be a reasonable approach in the \nMcConnell amendment. Lawyers should be compensated, and they should be \nfairly and reasonably compensated. But studies have shown that a \nsurprisingly low proportion of every dollar spent on liability \nlitigation ever reaches patients. That is a strong indication that our \nliability system has been turned squarely on its head. Despite all the \ntremendous litigation costs, the beneficiaries seem to be lawyers, not \npatients. This important provision ensures that the injured party will \nreceive more of the award, and the attorney less.\n\n  The amendment would further require that a medical malpractice \ncomplaint must be filed within two years after the claimant discovered, \nor in the exercise of reasonable care should have discovered the injury \nand its cause. This is similar to the law in Utah, which provides for a \n2-year statute of limitations, with a 4-year maximum.\n  And with regard to obstetric care, to address the rising number of \nlawsuits filed against emergency room doctors who deliver babies of \nwomen they have not previously treated, this amendment incorporates an \namendment offered by Senator Thompson back in 1995 which passed \noverwhelmingly. Under this provision, for obstetric services, if a \nhealth care provider had not previously treated the pregnancy, the \nprovider shall not be found to have committed malpractice unless proof \nof the malpractice meets the standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n  This amendment also encourages states to develop a state-based \nalternative dispute resolution mechanism to avoid the necessity of \ngoing to court. I have long felt that our fault-based liability system \nmay not be the most equitable or the most efficient. it is expensive, \ntime consuming, and unpredictable.\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\n  The McConnell amendment also requires that a portion of all punitive \ndamage awards be set aside to: No. 1, improve state licensing, \ninvestigating, and disciplining of medical professionals; and, No. 2, \nreduce medical malpractice expenses for physicians who volunteer to \nprovide care in medically under served areas.\n  Finally, the scope of this amendment applies to all federal and state \nmedical malpractice cases, except in those states that already have \nstronger medical malpractice reforms.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that we need to do something to deal with \nthis crisis, and I believe the McConnell amendment is a step in the \nright direction. What is important is that we take steps to benefit \nboth the patient and the health care provider, not the trial lawyers--\notherwise we are in danger of losing access to necessary healthcare. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. First, I want to go back to the theme that I introduced \nlast Friday: This is not about insurance companies or injured patients \nbut about patients broadly. The debate boils down to patients broadly; \nto the American people versus a broken system of runaway, skyrocketing \npremiums secondary to the trial lawyers.\n  As I paint the picture, look at the skyrocketing medical premiums \nwhich we know are out there. They have an impact that is directly \ntranslated to access of health care. This is important to everyone \nlistening to me today because they want access to health care, and \naffordable access to health care.\n  What is happening is that the skyrocketing costs, coupled with these \nrunaway jury awards, have an impact on physicians in the following way. \nAs the Senator from Mississippi said a few minutes ago, physicians are \nleaving parts of the country. They are relocating. They are stopping \ncertain riskier procedures, such as delivering babies. Because of these \nskyrocketing premiums, obstetricians are having to stop delivering \nbabies and neurosurgeons are beginning to limit their practices. We \nwill hear shortly about trauma centers closing in Nevada and elsewhere. \nTrauma centers provide highly specialized care, and they are actually \nclosing because of these skyrocketing premiums.\n  We also talked a little yesterday about defensive medicine. It \nincreases costs the system overall, but these costs also translate down \nto how much you pay every time you go see a doctor or pay an insurance \npremium.\n  Ask your physician about defensive medicine. Eighty percent of \nphysicians practice defensive medicine to the tune of billions of \ndollars. Patients are hurt in terms of poor access to health care and \nin terms of greater costs to them.\n  Let me just close, by asking the following: Who do you believe? Is it \nthe insurance companies? Is it the trial lawyers? I will simply say, go \nback and ask somebody you trust for your health care. Ask your doctor \nwho is telling the truth about the impact of skyrocketing medical \nmalpractice costs; ask your doctors why physicians are leaving States \nto practice in other States where there is some sort of control on \nthese runaway costs. Ask your doctor why physicians are retiring early \nor refusing to see certain patients. Ask your doctor why obstetricians \nare refusing to take new patients, or adjusting their practice just to \npractice gynecology and not obstetrics. Ask your doctor why trauma \ncenters are closing today because of these skyrocketing premiums. Ask \nyour doctor whether legal reform in the area of medical malpractice is \ngood for patients.\n  I do not care about the insurance companies. They can come or go; \nthey can deny business. The people I care about are the patients, who \nneed access to better care. To better understand this debate ask your \ndoctor, somebody you trust. Call them on the phone today, and I \nguarantee the answer they will give you is that the judicial system \ntoday is out of control and must be reformed. That is what the \nMcConnell amendment does.\n  To summarize, States across the country are experiencing a health \ncare liability crisis. Medical liability insurance premiums are \nskyrocketing as medical liability claims and damage awards are \nexploding. This problem is not limited to just a few States or a few \nareas of the country. It is nationwide, and it is getting worse.\n  The end result of this national crisis is simple: patients suffer. \nPatients suffer because in many areas because their access to care is \nin grave danger due to rising medical liability insurance premiums. \nDoctors are being forced to leave their practices, to stop performing \nhigh risks procedures and to drop vital services. Specialists are \nleaving certain areas or simply retiring. Women suffer the most. One \nout of 10 OB/GYNs no longer delivers babies because of the high cost of \nliability insurance. In addition, emergency departments are losing \nstaff and scaling back certain services. This can literally be a life \nor death problem.\n  The problem is so sever that, according to the AMA, there is a crisis \nin 12 States where patient access to care is now seriously threatened \nAnd there are 30 more States that are near crisis, including my home \nState of Tennessee.\n  Patients also suffer because of the large costs of defensive \nmedicine. To avoid situations in which a contingency fee attorney can \nclaim injury occurred because certain tests were not performed, doctors \nengage in ``defensive medicine'' by performing testes and prescribing \nmedicines that are not necessary for health reasons. This costs our \neconomy billions.\n  As a doctor I know this problem is real. I don't need to know all the \nfacts and figures because I have heard from many of my colleagues from \nacross the country who are concerned about their liability insurance. I \nhave heard from many who are seriously considering leaving an area or \ndropping a service because of the liability problem. They don't want to \nleave or change their practice, but the are being forced to do so.\n  My colleagues are demanding action by Congress to address this crisis \nin order to help their patients and to continue to provide quality \nhealth care.\n  So we are we in this crisis? Why are malpractice premiums \nskyrocketing? Why is patient access in jeopardy? Why are trauma centers \nclosing? Why are OB/GYNs refusing to deliver babies? Why are maternity \nwards shutting down?\n  The answer is simple--medial malpractice suits are out of control. \nBetween 1995 and 2000 the average jury award jumped more than 70 \npercent to $3.5 million, and more than half of all jury awards today \ntop $1 million. However, payouts aren't the only problem. Simply \nDefending a malpractice claim costs on average over $20,000, whether or \nnot a doctor or hospital is at fault.\n  Of course, this litigation is having a major impact on medical \nliability premiums. In 2001, physicians in many states saw rates raised \nby 30 percent or more and in some areas in some specialities, \nmalpractice insurance is rising by as much as 300 percent per year. In \nNew York and Florida obstetricians, gynecologists and surgeons pay more \nthan $100,000 for $1 million in coverage. Soon, the annual premium \nwhich these doctors pay could reach $200,000. In my home State of \nTennessee--a State that is not considered in crisis by th AMA--premiums \nrose 17.3 percent last year and are rising 15-17 percent this year.\n  It should be no surprise that these premium increases are causing \nthis serious health care access problems across the country.\n  We know what must be done--intelligent and reasonable tort reform. \nSuch reform will help solve this problem and, most importantly, help \npatients. Sensible reform will provide for fair and equitable \ncompensation for those negligently injured and stabilize the insurance \nmarketplace which will help maintain patients' access to quality health \ncare.\n  Experience at the state level clearly shows the dramatic benefit of \ntort reform. California tort reform, the Medical Injury and \nCompensation Refom Act, or MICRA, which became law in the mid 1970s, is \nthe most obvious example of what works. California doctors and patients \nhave been spared the medical liability crisis that other States are \nfacing. In fact, California currently has some of the lowest medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums in the country.\n  This is why I strongly support this amendment offered by Senator \nMcConnell. Though this amendment does not include all the measures that \nI think are necessary to address this problem,\n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nit is a good step in the right direction. We know that sensible tort \nreform works. It holds down rising health care costs and helps maintain \naccess to quality health care. We must act now to protect patients and \ntheir accessibility to quality health care before the problem gets \nworse.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote for this important amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the time.\n  I listened to the Senator from Tennessee, who is also a physician, \nspeaking a moment ago. All of us have heard the complaints of doctors, \nof individuals, with respect to premiums. One wishes we were fashioning \na remedy to some of the problems within the medical system that fits. \nThis is not a remedy that fits. This is, in fact, an excuse for people \nwho have always tried to liberate malefactors of one kind or another \nfrom responsibility to the legal system through the normal court \nprocess that is part of our Constitution.\n  People don't like being sued--of course not--so they try to find a \nway, statutorily, to limit their liability for things that they do \nwrong. The fact is, this particular remedy is not going to deal with \nthe problem, No. 1, and, No. 2, it unfairly double victimizes American \ncitizens who are the victims of some kind of incident of malpractice or \nof medical error from being able to seek the appropriate redress for \nthat and being able to keep the level of accountability in our system \nwhich only, today, is provided by that capacity to be able to bring \nsuit.\n  In fact, in our Patients' Bill of Rights, we directly passed the \nright to sue nursing homes and HMOs, which Americans want, when they \nare unfairly treated. This amendment even reaches to undo that right \nwhich the Senate granted but which we have not yet, obviously, put into \nlaw.\n  The fact is, this is not a serious approach to the problem that our \nphysician, Senator, fellow Member, has articulated. Yes, there are some \nhigh premiums, but the president of the American Tort Reform \nAssociation has been quoted as saying:\n\n       We wouldn't tell you that the reason to pass tort reform \n     would be to reduce insurance rates.\n\n  So the McConnell amendment will not result in lower premiums, which \nis what they are screaming about. In fact, California, which enacted \nmedical malpractice tort reform in 1974, has malpractice premiums 19 \npercent higher than the national average. So why are medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums rising? Let's look to what the Wall \nStreet Journal tells us--not known for its liberal stance on tort \nreform. In a June article, they stated:\n\n       Even doctors are beginning to acknowledge that the \n     conventional focus on jury awards deflects attention from the \n     insurance industry's behavior.\n\n  According to the International Risk Management Institute, the reason \npremiums are rising is because throughout the 1990s insurance companies \ncross-subsidized low premiums with profits from investments. This \nenabled them to lower the premiums to attract more policyholders. Now \nthe economy has slowed and investment profits have dried up, and \ninvesting decisions, not tort claims, bear the responsibility for \nrising premiums.\n  Moreover, medical malpractice insurance costs, as a proportion of \nnational health insurance care spending, amounts to less than 60 cents \nper $100 spent.\n  We should ask any American whether they are prepared to pay 60 cents \nof the cost of medical care of all the hundred dollars that are spent \nin order to know that, if something is done wrong to them, they have \nthe right of redress.\n  Moreover, it is false to state that claims have ``exploded'' in the \nlast decade. Closed claims, which include claims where no payout has \nbeen made, have remained constant, while paid claims have averaged just \nover $110,000. Meanwhile, this is the most important point----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, incidents of medical errors are growing. \nCountless Americans risk serious injury because of mistakes made in \nhospitals and in other places. Medical errors occur all over the \nsystem. In hospitals alone, the Institute of Medicine has reported that \nbetween 44,000 and 98,000 Americans are killed by medical errors \nannually. Using the 44,000 figure, medical errors are the eighth \nleading cause of death in the United States, more than breast cancer \nand more than AIDS. So I think to take away from Americans the single \navailable tool they have to try to make the system be accountable, in \nthe absence of any other responsible effort, is wrong.\n  Using the 98,000 figure, medical errors would be the fifth-leading \ncause of death in this country.\n  As the IOM report puts it,\n\n       These stunningly high rates of medical errors--resulting in \n     deaths, permanent disability and unnecessary suffering are \n     unacceptable in a medical system that promises first to do no \n     harm.\n\n  Now, clearly, some medical errors are the direct result of physician \nnegligence and many are not. But it is clear that we ought to think \nlong and hard before placing an arbitrary cap on the financial value of \nhuman life.\n  Knowing that the McConnell amendment would have virtually no impact \non insurance premiums, let's look at the merits of the legislation: The \namendment before us is not simply about preventing excessive \nmalpractice actions.\n  When the Senate flipped to Democratic control a little more than a \nyear ago, the Senate finally passed a real Patients Bill of Rights. For \nthe first time, the Senate sought to hold HMOs truly accountable for \ntheir actions. But this amendment would severely limit suits not only \nagainst standard medical malpractice actions, but also actions against \nHMOs and nursing homes. This amendment is extremely broad in scope and \nis directly opposite of the Senate's position on the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  The amendment's restrictive statute of limitations are similarly \nmisguided. The amendment reduces the amount of time a patient has to \nfile a lawsuit to 2 years from the date the injury was discovered. So \nif someone contracts HIV through a negligent transfusion but learned of \nthe disease 5 years after the transfusion, he or she would be barred \nfrom filing a claim. This statute of limitations would cut off claims \nfor diseases with long incubation periods. Even shareholders, investors \nand others have 5 years under the just-enacted accounting reform bill.\n  This amendment would also punish injured patients who have prudently \npurchased insurance policies to protect themselves and their families. \nSenator McConnell would require a judge to reduce the amount of damage \naward by all collateral sources, such as life or disability insurance \npayments. So if you are thoughtful enough to purchase health care--a \ngrowing difficulty for too many Americans--you will be less likely to \nbe compensated for someone else's negligence. This just does not make \nsense.\n  I know how difficult is for hospitals to find specialized doctors and \nnurses today. The Nation's shortage of nurses has reached crisis stage, \nand we do need to keep experienced health care professionals on the \njob. But this amendment will not help control malpractice premiums.\n  I am prepared to talk about reasonable ways to do this. In \nMassachusetts years ago we put in a screening system. There are many \nways to approach this, but this is an arbitrary limit, which will be \nunfair to the average American and will not result in lowering \npremiums.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the pending amendment should be called \na clients' bill of rights because it is designed not to in any way \nhandicap the recovery of the victim, but to rearrange the relationship \nbetween the lawyer and the victim so the victim can get more of the \nmoney he or she justly deserves and to deal with the problem of runaway \npunitive damages--which are not for the purpose of rewarding the \nplaintiff anyway; they are for the purpose of punishing the defendant.\n  I was in Henderson, KY, which is right on the Ohio River, Friday \nnight.\n\n[[Page S7525]]\n\nThere were four doctors at the meeting I attended. Every single one of \nthem was on the verge of moving over to Indiana--it is very easy for \nthem; they just go across the Ohio River--in order to escape this \nmalpractice crisis which has afflicted, of course, my State of \nKentucky. It hasn't afflicted Indiana because they have reasonable caps \non recovery and have had for years.\n  The next day, on Saturday, I was in Morganfield, KY, and there were \nsome people there who have a son who lives in Mississippi. The \ndistinguished Republican leader was talking about the crisis in \nMississippi. The son of one of the people in Morganfield is an \nobstetrician in Mississippi, getting ready to pack his bags and move to \na State where they have dealt this issue.\n  Speaking of a State that has a crisis, there is no State that has a \ngreater crisis than the State of Nevada, and our colleague from Nevada \nis here to discuss the crisis in Nevada. It is my understanding that \nthere is a special session going on this very week.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Kentucky \nfor yielding time.\n  There is a serious crisis going on in the State of Nevada. We have \nheard here today that insurance rates are not going up. Let me tell you \nthat they are dramatically going up in Nevada, and it is because jury \nawards are out of control.\n  About one-half of the doctors in southern Nevada have their homes up \nfor sale because they cannot afford increased medical liability \npremiums. Whether these are OB/GYNs or neurosurgeons or orthopedic \nsurgeons, many of the specialists are taking their practices and moving \nthem to States that have enacted tort reform and/or medical liability \nreform measures that are similar to the McConnell amendment we are \nconsidering here today.\n  In my State right now, obstetricians are telling pregnant mothers in \nlate stages of pregnancy they will not deliver their babies. We are the \nfastest growing county--Clark County--in America. Yet these \nobstetricians are saying they are not taking any new patients. OBs are \nsaying they will not take any new patients because they cannot afford \nto, and those are the ones who are staying in town. Unfortunately, many \nof them are leaving.\n  Let me give you an example. There is a couple who are both OB/GYNs \nwho practice together. In fact, they delivered my wife's and my three \nchildren. They have already been in several meetings to move their \npractice to either northern or southern California where their medical \nliability insurance rates would be about one-fifth of what they would \npay in the State of Nevada.\n  On July 3, our only level 1 trauma center closed for 10 days. This \ntrauma center services four States. If someone has a serious accident \nand has severe trauma, this is where they would get the kind of care \nnecessary for saving their life. The reason it is closed was, once \nagain, was because doctors were afraid they would not be able to get \nthe kind of insurance coverage they needed and they would lose \neverything they worked for their whole life if they were sued. The only \nreason it was reopened was because they were afforded insurance \ncoverage that included a $50,000 cap on damages. They were told--If you \npractice here, and there happens to be some kind of a malpractice, we \nwill cap the jury award at $50,000.\n  Now, there are no such caps in the McConnell amendment we are \ndiscussing. However, I believe very strongly in caps on non-economic \ndamages. I wish they were part of this amendment.\n  As a matter of fact, yesterday Nevada's Governor proposed and laid \nout a compromise with Republican and Democrat legislators in which \nthere would be a $350,000 cap on jury awards for non-economic damages. \nYou would be able to recover, through economic damages, everything you \nwould have ever earned and expenses you incurred for medical bills. But \non non-economic damages there would be a $350,000 cap, except in cases \nwhere treatment was received at the trauma center--that would be kept \nit at a $50,000 cap. They did this because they know that it is the \nonly way they can keep the trauma center open.\n  In any case, there are several other provisions in the McConnell \namendment that are very important. This idea of joint and several \nliability was mentioned. The Senator from Massachusetts talked about \nthis; that it is important to keep joint liability so the patient would \nbe able to get the whole award.\n  Now let me tell you what this really means. If you are practicing in \na trauma center, and if you are responsible for 1 percent of the \nmedical malpractice that happened in a particular case, you can be held \nresponsible for 100 percent of the jury award.\n\n  Is that fair? That isn't fair.\n  That is also one of the reasons rates continue to go up across the \ncountry.\n  Neurosurgeons are leaving our State. This isn't about trial lawyers \nversus doctors. This is about availability of doctors. This is about \nwhether we are going to have people such as Senator Bill Frist--a very \ntalented heart surgeon--continue to go into the practice of medicine \nand who want to save lives. We have people who are not only leaving our \nState, but who are just retiring their practices early because of this \ncrisis.\n  One of the best surgeons in Las Vegas--a gastrointestinal surgeon--\nwas planning on retiring in 1 year. He actually retired this year \nbecause had he stayed in the practice an additional year, he would not \nhave only had to pay $200,000 for insurance this year, but he would \nhave faced what is called ``tail coverage''. Tail coverage is what a \ndoctor pays when they quit practicing or change insurance companies in \norder to cover any claims which might arise from when they were covered \nunder the previous company or while they were still practicing. He \nwould have had to pay another $400,000 just for tail insurance. He \nmakes about $200,000 a year. So, it would have cost him $600,000 to \npractice while he would have only earned $200,000 for the year. It was \nobviously ridiculous to stay in business, so he quit practicing.\n  Las Vegas and southern Nevada lost one of their best surgeons because \nof early retirement, leaving even more patients without the services of \na highly-trained, highly respected physician. That kind of situation is \nindicative of how badly broken the system is.\n  Let me briefly mention just one of the abuses in our civil justice \nsystem and how that contributes to the overall problem we are having in \nrunaway jury verdicts. If you are accused of medical malpractice you \nare brought into the courtroom, at which time the case is laid out. At \nsome point during the case, ``expert'' witnesses are called to testify. \nI put ``expert'' in quotations because many physicians can be brought \nin as an expert. Unfortunately, there are physicians who are now \nworking in concert with trial lawyers, and it is really their business \nto become expert witnesses even though they are not experts. Not to \nimpugn their motives, but certainly this happens, and many times the \nabuse is blatantly outrageous. Yet the jury hears from the supposed \n``experts,'' and in main part of that testimony, medical malpractice is \nfound by the jury.\n  This illustrates what is happening in States and cities all across \nthe United States. It is a system that is prejudiced toward finding \nmalpractice. While the McConnell amendment does not specifically \naddress this issue, it does help bring some accountability and \nfeasibility back to our civil justice system.\n  I am a veterinarian, and I have worked in the health care profession \nfor some time. Anybody who has worked in health care understands human \nerror. Do you know why? It is because we are humans who practice. And \nanytime you have human beings practicing a profession, you are going to \nhave errors--sometimes errors that can't be helped. There are some very \nsad cases, and we want to ensure those people continue to be able to \nhave a remedy. But, outside of providing appropriate compensation, our \nsystem of secondary recovery it is out of control. The system needs to \nbe brought back into balance.\n  The bottom line is when you have human beings, there are errors. \nHowever, we must remember that often times those errors are not \nmalpractice. The physician did not intend to hurt his or her patient. \nBut more often than\n\n[[Page S7526]]\n\nnot, it can appear as malpractice to a jury. We need to make sure that \nwe have a system in place that most justly adjudicates each and every \ncase on its merits, and fairly places culpability where it should be \nplaced.\n\n  Under the current system, juries are out of control with awards that \nwe are all paying for. Medicare costs and private insurance premiums \nare higher, and they keep going up every year. There are several \nfactors that contribute to this rise in costs, but none more than the \nexcessive, unfounded awards given out by juries on a seemingly regular \nbasis.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, let me finish my statement, and then I \nwould be happy to yield.\n  In the State of Nevada last year, the average OB/GYN made about \n$200,000. Now, taking into consideration that figure, their insurance \nrates went from about $35,000 a year to about $130,000 a year. We can't \npass that cost on anymore. That means basically every OB/GYN in \nsouthern Nevada is going to have to either see double the number of \npatients they are seeing now or just quit practicing altogether.\n  There is a huge incentive for these doctors to go to California where \ntheir rates will not only not go up, but they will actually go down \nfrom what they were the previous year.\n  I keep mentioning California because California enacted the Medical \nInjury Compensation Recovery Act (MICRA). MICRA has all the reforms \nthat are in Senator McConnell's amendment--plus they have the $250,000 \ncap on noneconomic damages.\n  MICRA has been challenged in the courts four times. It has been \nupheld four times. It is not that people in the State of California do \nnot receive injury awards. It isn't that the people in California are \ndisadvantaged in some way so the patients don't get what they need.\n  There was a situation in 1975 that California recognized as a crisis. \nBecause of court challenges, the bill didn't actually take effect until \n1985. But since that time, they have had a stable situation where \ninsurance companies know approximately what is going to happen and know \nhow much their costs are going to be. Consequently, their rates have \nstabilized.\n  There are about 12 States right now, according to the American \nMedical Association, that are in crisis, Nevada being the worst of all.\n  Because of this crisis, Nevada's Governor had to call a special \nlegislative session. Now, we only meet every 2 years in our \nlegislature. Therefore, he had to call a special session just to deal \nwith this severe crisis that is going on right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Let's enact this amendment to bring about some reasonable \nreforms to our medical liability system in the United States.\n  There is a crisis happening right now in my home State of Nevada. \nObstetricians are telling pregnant mothers in late stages of their \npregnancy that they can't deliver their babies.\n  On July 3, our only Level One trauma center closed for ten days, \nleaving victims of car accidents and gun shot wounds without \nappropriate care. Officials are saying it will probably have to close \nagain.\n  Neurosurgeons are canceling operations with patients who have spinal \ncord injuries that adversely affect every second of their daily lives.\n  In fact, as I talk to you right now, the Nevada Legislature has been \nforced to meet in a special session with Governor Kenny Guinn to \naddress this crisis.\n  What is the common thread between these events? It lies in the fact \nthat all of these health care providers are unable to afford the \nskyrocketing cost of their medical malpractice insurance.\n  So, if this is a Nevada problem, then why would I bring this issue to \nthe floor of the United States Senate?\n  Because it is no longer just a Nevada problem; it is now a nationwide \nproblem. President Bush recognized this fact last week when he called \nour medical liability system ``badly broken,'' and emphasized the \nimmediate need for Federal medical liability reform.\n  In order to illustrate this urgent need, let me give you some \nexamples of what I am talking about:\n  In Bisbee, AZ, the only maternity ward has closed. Expectant mothers \nmust now drive more than a half hour to the nearest town to deliver;\n  In Broward County, FL, 14 of the 16 practicing neurosurgeons are \nuninsured;\n  In Mississippi, 324 doctors have stopped delivering babies in the \nlast decade. Today, only 10 percent of family doctors will deliver \nbabies;\n  In Wheeling, WV, all of the neurosurgeons have stopped practicing. I \ncould go on and on about a number of different States.\n  We have to examine why this current crisis is happening. What it \nboils down to is two factors: affordability and availability.\n  On affordability, let me give you a statistic from the American \nMedical Association. In 2000, medical liability insurance rates \nincreased by at least 30 percent in 8 States, and by at least 25 \npercent in more than 12 States. I don't know too many physicians that \ncan afford such rates. These rates are forcing more physicians, \nhospitals, and other health care providers to limit their practices or \nleave the profession altogether.\n  On availability, thousands of doctors nationwide have been left with \nno liability insurance as major liability insurers are either leaving \nthe market or raising rates to astronomical levels.\n  Now, why are insurers raising rates and/or leaving the market? \nBecause there is no stability in the marketplace for providing medical \nliability insurance.\n  Why is there no stability in the marketplace? Because our healthcare \nsystem is being overrun by frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury \nawards.\n  Let me give you some statistics to illustrate these points. This \ninformation is according to the Physician Insurers Association of \nAmerica's Data Sharing Project:\n  Since 1998, the average claim payment value has risen from \napproximately $130,000 in 1988 to $330,000 in 2001. Likewise, since \n1988, the median claim payment values have risen from approximately \n$50,000 in 1988 to $175,000 in 2001.\n  In 1985, less than 1 percent of the claims that were paid were equal \nor greater than $1 million. Contrast that to 2001 when 7.9 percent of \nthe claims paid were equal or greater than $1 million.\n  This excessive litigation is leading to higher health care costs for \nevery American and an unstable piece of mind for our health care \nproviders. To fend off litigation, healthcare professionals are forced \nto practice defensive medicine by ordering unnecessary tests just so \nthat they will not be sued for ``under-diagnosing'' their patients.\n  A recent study by the Department of Health and Human Services found \ndefensive medicine is costing the Federal Government an estimated $28 \nbillion to $47 billion in unnecessary healthcare costs.\n  And who else pays for those unnecessary costs? Every American with \nhealth insurance, in the form of higher premiums. Gone are the days \nwhen our civil justice system was used to help protect patients. Now we \nare left with a system that is used to primarily fatten the wallets of \npersonal injury attorneys.\n  More often than not, medical liability claims are more financially \nbeneficial to the lawyers than they are to the injured and sick \npatients.\n  According to the Physician Insurers Association of America's Data \nSharing Project, only fifty cents of every dollar paid in medical \nliability awards go to the patients. Only 50 cents.\n  Additionally, nearly 70 percent of all medical liability claims \nresult in no payment to the plaintiff.\n  So what does all this mean? It means that we need to bring some \naccountability back to the civil justice system by way of medical \nliability reform.\n  Not only would this allow physicians to continue to concentrate fully \non providing superior care to their patients, it would help \ntremendously in curbing the skyrocketing costs of healthcare for \nconsumers.\n  In addition, and probably even more staggering, is the success rate \nof most medical liability claims. Consider this information:\n  In 2001, only 1.3 percent of all claims filed ended in a verdict for \nthe plaintiff. In contrast, 61.1 percent were dropped or dismissed for \nvarious reasons.\n  These numbers highlight the significant amount of frivolous lawsuits \nthat\n\n[[Page S7527]]\n\nare filed, costing healthcare professionals valuable patient time, and \nultimately costing every insured American millions in increased health \ncare costs.\n  Medical liability reform is not something that is new to the Senate. \nDuring debate on the 1995 Product Liability Bill, the Senate considered \nand voted on medical liability reform proposals. In fact, one of those \nproposals is the exact amendment that we are considering here today.\n  This amendment takes a sincere and aggressive approach toward helping \nreign in our out of control civil justice system. It does so in the \nfollowing ways: sensible limits on punitive damages; elimination of \njoint liability on most damages, making sure that defendants are only \nliable for their fair share; modest limits on attorney's fees in \nmedical malpractice cases to maximize patient recovery; collateral \nsource reform to prevent plaintiffs and attorneys from ``double \ndipping'' for compensation; alternative dispute resolution to encourage \nstates to develop mechanisms to help resolve disputes before they go to \ncourt; and periodic payments for large awards.\n  Although I am strongly in favor of this proposal, I must mention that \nthe one significant provision it is missing is a cap on non-economic \ndamages. I believe this cap could only strengthen the proposal we are \nconsidering today. However, every other reform in this amendment has \nproven to be effective in bringing accountability back to the civil \njustice system.\n  This amendment was passed in 1995 on a vote of 53-47. Therefore, with \nthe number of Senators who supported this proposal before, coupled with \nthe number of senators whose States are facing a medical liability \ncrisis, I think we have an excellent chance to pass this amendment. \nJust to highlight that point, a recent study conducted by Wirthlin \nWorldwide found that 78 percent of Americans express concern that \nskyrocketing medical liability costs resulting from the current system \ncould limit their access to care. Clearly, the American public sees the \ncrisis we care facing and are calling for nationwide reform. Americans \nare afraid they will not have anyone to deliver their babies or perform \nlife-saving procedures on their loved ones in emergencies, and they \nshould not have to be. If there are senators here today that are still \nnot convinced about the need and overall effectiveness of medical \nliability reform, let me briefly explain how to put your doubts to \nrest.\n  Let's take a look at the wildly successful Medical Injury \nCompensation Reform Act (MICRA) of 1975 that California has in place. \nNow, I will concede that the amendment before us is not identical to \nMICRA, but it does incorporate all but one of the major provisions that \nMICRA contains.\n  To further explore the impact of MICRA, just look at the difference \nbetween how medical liability premiums have risen in California versus \nthe rest of the United States. According to the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners, from 1976 through 1999, California's insurance \npremiums has risen 167 percent, while the other 49 States' premiums \nhave risen 505 percent.\n  Obviously, MICRA has brought about real reform in California's \nprofessional liability system, while still protecting the rights of \ninjured patients. Studies have shown the following. The number of \nfrivolous lawsuits going to trial has declined dramatically; injured \npatients receive a larger share of their awards; the number of \ndisciplinary actions against incompetent health care providers has \nincreased.\n  The bottom line is that California's medical liability system works. \nShouldn't these types of outcomes be shared by every state, and \nultimately every patient, in America?\n  Again, the amendment before us contains all but one of the major \nprovisions that MICRA entails, so each senator has something to \nsubstantiate their vote. And let us remember one important point we are \nNOT limiting the amount of economic and non-economic damages that can \nbe recovered by the patient.\n  All we are doing is bringing some accountability and reasonability \nback to our civil justice system in the form of common-sense reforms \nwhich I know will lead to lower health care costs for every American.\n  I know it is possible to pass these types of reform measures through \nthe Houses of Congress, because while I was a member of the House of \nRepresentatives we passed some type of medical liability reform measure \nsix times. Unfortunately, each time it was stalled in the Senate and \nreal reform was never enacted.\n  But the next time around I am hopeful that it will be different. And \nthere is no better time than now for the Senate to make a strong \nstatement on behalf of American patients.\n  Let's make sure there are no more expectant mothers turned away at \nthe door and refused pre-natal care.\n  Let's make sure trauma patients receive immediate and appropriate \nmedical services.\n  And, let's make sure that we continue to provide patients everywhere \nthe opportunity to receive affordable, accessible, and quality health \ncare for years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, let me address what I consider to be the \nreal issue, really the only issue, as far as I am concerned. It is not \nwho the bad guys are and who the good guys are. I have seen excesses on \nboth sides of this issue. It is not a matter of what is best for the \ntrial lawyers or best for the insurance companies or even what is best \nfor the patients. It is a question of whether we have a limited form of \ngovernment, whether we have a Federal Government with enumerated \npowers. That is the underlying issue. It is amazing to me that we can \nhave a debate on something such as this without it even being brought \nup.\n  What we have is an amendment which will take things that have been \nunder the purview of the State governments for 200 years and federalize \nthem. This is getting to be such a common occurrence that nobody pays \nmuch attention to it anymore. I pay attention to it. I think it is a \nbad trend. I think it goes against the system of government that our \nFounding Fathers set up and has worked in our favor for 200 years.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the State of Nevada is in a \nspecial session to work out malpractice problems, and does the Senator \nbelieve that is the way we should go?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The answer to that question is yes. I am amazed to hear \nthat we have a problem in a particular State and that the solution is \nfor the citizens of the small town in that State maybe to drive past \nthe courthouse and drive through the capital, past the statehouse, and \nget on an airplane and fly to Washington, DC, to talk about a Federal \nsolution against their own State.\n  Tennessee just had a discussion about a State income tax and a State \nsales tax. One of the points made against a higher State sales tax was \nthat the State of Kentucky and the State of Mississippi and the State \nof Arkansas, all these other surrounding States, had a lower sales tax \nand people would go to those States to buy their goods, just as \napparently people are going from one State to another to take advantage \nof a better medical malpractice case.\n  The answer to that is, that is the way it is supposed to work. That \nis our system of government. That is the reason we have States, to have \ncompetition among States. If we extend the commerce clause to this, \nafter having been told by the Supreme Court in the Lopez case that the \ncommerce clause does not extend to guns in the local school, after \nhaving been told in the Morrison case by the Supreme Court that the \ncommerce clause does not extend to a sex-based crime at a local level--\nif we extend the commerce clause to the delivery of a baby in \nLawrenceburg, TN, there is nothing to which we cannot extend the \ncommerce clause. I regret to say, it is some of us who talk about \nlimited government and enumerated powers who are doing this. I do not \nthink it is sound policy.\n  It does not matter whether or not there are excesses on one side or \nanother. States are supposed to address these matters. I would not come \nhere\n\n[[Page S7528]]\n\nand say the State of Tennessee is inadequate in this regard unless I \nwas willing to go back to the State of Tennessee and fight for a change \nin the laws. Senator Kennedy and I, are we supposed to write the laws \nfor the State of Tennessee with regard to something that has been under \ntheir purview for 200 years? I don't think so.\n\n  We can disagree on what those laws should be, but we cannot disagree, \nsurely, on the principle that underlies this debate. The proposed \namendment goes so far as to require that each State require 50 percent \nof all punitive damage awards be used for licensing, investigating, \ndisciplining, and certifying health care professionals and the \nreduction of malpractice costs for the health care professional \nvolunteers.\n  This requirement would get us into the management of the licensing \nand regulation of health care professionals in every State in this \ncountry. This is just one step away from national standards and \nnational regulation, not just in the health care area but potentially \nin any other area.\n  Regardless of whether you think medical malpractice premiums are too \nhigh or lawyers are terrible people, or whatever, if we walk away at \nthis time from this principle, when we want to assert this principle, \nwe are not going to have any principles to stand on because we will \nhave ignored them so often for the particular causes we want at the \nmoment that they will be totally eroded. I submit to the Chamber that \nis too high a price to pay.\n  I yield back whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I commend him for being very consistent in his concern \nabout federalism and States rights. He has raised that issue not just \non the occasion of today's amendment but across the board. He has \ncertainly been consistent. I do find it somewhat amusing to hear it \ninvoked from time to time by those on the other side of the aisle for \nwhom States rights are rarely a concern.\n  Let me say to my good friend from Tennessee, he raises exactly the \npoint I wanted to address in my remaining time this morning. This is a \nnational crisis, a national crisis in the delivery of medical services. \nThis is a national problem, and it demands a national solution. States \nall across the country--in the West, the South, the Midwest, and the \nEast--are in crisis. Many more States are experiencing serious \nproblems, including my own State of Kentucky. Because it is a national \nproblem, it demands a national solution. Furthermore, it is necessary \nand appropriate for the Federal Government to be involved in fixing \nthis problem.\n  Let me give you my first reason. As the single largest purchaser of \nhealth care, the Federal Government has a compelling interest in health \ncare liability reform. In 2002, the Federal Government will spend $223 \nbillion on Medicare, $145 billion more on Medicaid, and $11.3 billion \nmore on Federal employee health benefits. That is a total of $400 \nbillion by the Federal Government on health care.\n  Furthermore, a 1996 study by Stanford economists projected that \ncommonsense medical malpractice reforms, many of which are included in \nmy amendment, could reduce health care costs by 5 to 9 percent without \njeopardizing the quality of care. Using this study, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services projects that reducing the practice of \ndefensive medicine could save the Federal taxpayers between $23 and $42 \nbillion.\n  Finally, Federal legislation is necessary because of the increasingly \ninterstate character of health care. I just mentioned, a few moments \nago, the four physicians I saw Friday night in Henderson, KY, on the \nverge of moving to Indiana. That is fine for them. It doesn't do much \nfor their patients who are left without care on the Kentucky side. \nPatients in the Washington, DC, area receive care not only here but in \nMaryland and Virginia. Many of the Nation's finest health care \nfacilities--the Mayo Clinic and M.D. Anderson--treat patients from \nacross the country.\n  While a Federal solution is necessary and appropriate, my amendment \ndoes not wholly preempt State medical malpractice reforms. The \namendment would not preempt those States that have already developed \nstrong medical malpractice laws.\n  This crisis has been created by the failure of the National \nGovernment to act. That has caused a problem. This crisis is due to the \nfailure to impose accountability and responsibility--the same things we \nhave been talking about around here the last few weeks with regard to \ncorporate America--on big, powerful trial lawyers who are running \nroughshod over doctors and in many instances taking advantage of their \nown clients.\n  As a result of our failure to act, there has been an explosion in \nmedical malpractice awards. Let us take a look at this chart which \nshows the explosion in medical malpractice awards from roughly $500,000 \nin 1995, up to $1 million in 2000.\n  Now, I gather my friends on the other side apparently think doctors \nhave become twice as incompetent in the last few years or that medical \nschools are now turning out graduates who are inept. But I am inclined \nto believe that the medical professionals at the AMA and other health \ncare organizations don't agree with that. The standard of care of \nphysicians has not radically deteriorated in just the last few years. \nRather, from looking at the problem, I believe the AMA and other health \ngroups when they say it is our medical malpractice liability system, \nnot our delivery system, that is badly broken.\n  The amendment I offer is a modest one. As I have said repeatedly, it \ndoesn't in any way cap compensatory damages to the victim. It simply \nseeks to cap lawyer's fees so more money will go to the injured victim, \nand caps punitive damages, which are not designed to compensate the \ninjured party in any event but to punish the defendant--cap that at \ntwice the balance of the compensatory damages. So this doesn't take any \nfunds that are needed to put the injured victim back on his or her \nfeet. It simply addresses the issue of lawyer abuse and of excessive \npunitive damages, which are not designed to enrich the injured party in \nany event.\n  It is a very modest amendment. The AMA supports this amendment. They \nwould have liked it to be much stronger, but I crafted this amendment \nin a very modest way in order to make it more palatable to more \nSenators. We have had a vote on this amendment before, back in 1995. At \nthat point, it got 53 votes, including Senators Feinstein, Lieberman, \nand Jeffords, who are still in the Senate.\n  As I said, this is a pro-victim amendment. There is no cap on \nnoneconomic pain and suffering damages, no cap on compensatory damages. \nThere is simply a reasonable cap on lawyer's fees and a cap on punitive \ndamages at twice the balance of the other damages.\n  So I think this is clearly a national problem requiring a national \nsolution. I hope the amendment will be approved.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, just a very brief response. I think the \nlogical extension of this amendment would mean if we could pass any \nlarge Federal program--as we have--such as Medicare, Social Security, \nand I guess our defense appropriations bills, and so forth, then we \ncould take any activity, even noncommercial activity in the smallest \nhamlet of the smallest town in America, anything they would do that \nmight arguably impact on the cost of those programs would be fair game \nunder the spending clause.\n  If that is the case, that is not a direction in which we need to go. \nI would contrast what we are doing here with regard to delivery of a \nbaby, let's say, in Lawrenceburg, TN, and the rules the State of \nTennessee imposed upon that we would abrogate--I contrast that with a \nproduct liability debate we had. I voted for that bill. That is an \ninherently interstate commerce, commercial activity. I have concluded \nthat there was a legitimate reason to have some national standards with \nregard to that. I think our Founding Fathers would have approved of \nthat. I think it is a far cry from where we are with regard to this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will have a very \nbrief\n\n[[Page S7529]]\n\ntime after the break. I point out that the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners study shows that in 2000--the latest year for \nwhich data is available--the total insurance industry profits, as a per \naverage premium for medical malpractice insurance, were twice as high \nas overall casualty and property insurance profits. In fact, \nmalpractice insurance was a very lucrative area for the industry, \naveraging a 12 percent profit. Over a 10-year period, their premiums \nwent up 1.9 percent, and they are making 12 percent on that.\n  This is about the insurance industry; it is not about the doctors. We \nwill have more to say about this. This is a lucrative aspect of the \ninsurance industry--everyone knows it--and they just want to cash in on \nthis opportunity at the present time.\n  Mr. President, I see our leader on his feet at this time in \nanticipation of a consent agreement, so I withhold further comments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from \n2:15 p.m. this afternoon until 2:45 p.m. be equally divided between \nSenators Kennedy and McConnell or their designees and that at 2:45 p.m. \nSenator Reid of Nevada or his designee be recognized to move to table \nSenator McConnell's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that I have 15 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee who, as we all know, is the only physician in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the McConnell amendment on \nmedical malpractice to the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \nAct. It goes to the heart, I believe, of an issue that has reached \ncrisis proportions in the United States.\n  Much of the argument and debate on Friday and a little bit yesterday \nand today centered on how best to frame this debate. Our opponents to \nthe McConnell amendment have tried to frame this as a debate focused on \ncorrupt insurance companies and HMOs.\n  What is absolutely critical for my colleagues and the American people \nto understand is that this debate is not about insurance companies. \nThis debate is about patients, patients who are suffering today and, \neven more important, unless we act on this crisis, will be hurt in the \nfuture.\n  It is about patients versus skyrocketing medical liability insurance \npremiums that, in large part, are driven by the current medical \nliability system. This amendment strikes right at the heart of that \nproblem.\n  Why is this debate important? I go back to patients. How do patients \nsuffer because of these skyrocketing insurance premiums? They suffer in \ntwo ways: No. 1, lack of access to health care. If in the future you \nare a patient, you will see a decrease in access when you want to go to \na physician, such as an obstetrician or a neurosurgeon or an orthopedic \nsurgeon. They have all seen these skyrocketing premiums, and these \ndoctors are not going to be there. Why? Because they happen to live in \nMississippi where their premiums are $50,000 or $100,000 or in Florida \nwhere an obstetrician premium might be $150,000 or $200,000. They might \ndecide, A, to pack it up and leave and go to another State or, B, to \nstop practicing or, C--and this is what we see happening all over the \ncountry--to stop delivering babies. If your doctor delivered your first \nbaby and you want him to deliver your second baby, you had better call \nfar in advance. Because of these skyrocketing premiums, many physicians \nare leaving that specialty.\n  In addition we saw what happened in Nevada where the trauma surgeons \nbasically said, we cannot stay in business, we cannot keep delivering \nthese services, because malpractice premiums are too high. They were \nactually forced to close down shop for a period of time. Thank goodness \nit was just for a few days.\n  I mention the impact on doctors because this is important. For \nexample, if one is an obstetrician and he pays $200,000 a year for his \ninsurance premiums, as in Florida, and he delivers 100 babies, which is \nthe average for an obstetrician in Florida delivers, that means for \nevery baby the doctor delivers there is a $2,000 tax or premium.\n  Now, one might say that this is the worry of the doctor. Well, the \ndoctor can leave. He can switch specialities. He can relocate or \nretire, early retirement, none of which is very satisfactory. But if a \ndoctor is going to stay in practice, ultimately the doctor is going to \npass the cost on to the patient. Who else will pay it? It has to be \npassed on to the patient.\n  Americans are watching this debate and they hear the ranting and \nraving against the bad insurance companies. Let's go back to the effect \nof the problem, which is on that individual patient. Then let's look at \nthe root cause, which is this runaway tort liability system, which this \namendment takes the first step at fixing.\n  Patients are hurting in two ways. First, they suffer from a lack of \naccess to care. Specialist are leaving areas, and doctors are refusing \nto deliver babies.\n  The second way patients suffer is the overall cost of defensive \nmedicine. Ask your physician right now: Do you practice defensive \nmedicine? According to a recent Harris poll, 76 percent, or three-\nfourths, of physicians believe concern for medical liability litigation \nhas hurt their ability to provide quality care in recent years. Eighty \npercent of physicians say they ordered more tests than they thought \nwere medically necessary because they worried about malpractice \nliability. It is called defensive medicine. It is something the \nconsumer does not see, the patient does not see, but America pays for \nit. How much? Fifteen, 20, 30, 40, 50--about $50 billion.\n  I close by stating my strong support for the McConnell amendment and \nlook forward to continued debate during the course of this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding the \ntime.\n  I readily acknowledge the expertise of Senator Frist. He is a widely \nrespected heart surgeon. He certainly is a man who understands the \npractice of medicine, unlike anyone else in the Senate. I do not come \nas an expert on the practice of medicine. If I have any expertise, it \nis in trial practice because before I was elected to Congress, I was a \ntrial attorney. I made my living defending doctors and hospitals, and \nsuing doctors and hospitals. I understood medical malpractice then, but \nas I read this amendment I am troubled.\n  Let me acknowledge first, yes, there is a national problem with \nmedical malpractice insurance across America. It costs too much in many \nareas, and we are finding that in many parts of the country doctors \ncannot afford to continue to practice because of the cost of premiums. \nBut the answer from Senator McConnell on the Republican side is to \nsuggest that the reason the premiums are so high is because of jury \nverdicts.\n  They overlook the obvious. Let me point to a source of information \nnot considered liberal in nature, the Wall Street Journal, which on \nJune 24 of this year published an article. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7530]]\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 24, 2002]\n\n                      Delivering Ms. Kline's Baby\n\n              (By Rachel Zimmerman and Christopher Oster)\n\n       As medical-malpractice premiums skyrocket in about a dozen \n     states across the country, obstetricians and doctors in other \n     risky specialties, such as neurosurgery, are moving, quitting \n     or retiring. Insurers and many doctors blame the problem on \n     rising jury awards in liability lawsuits.\n       ``The real sickness is people sue at the drop of a hat, \n     judgments are going up and up and up, and the people getting \n     rich out of this are the plaintiffs' attorneys,'' says David \n     Golden of the National Association of Independent Insurers, a \n     trade group. The American Medical Association says Florida, \n     Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania and eight other states face a \n     ``crisis'' because ``the legal system produces multimillion-\n     dollar jury awards on a regular basis.''\n       But while malpractice litigation has a big effect on \n     premiums, insurers' pricing and accounting practices have \n     played an equally important role. Following a cycle that \n     recurs in many parts of the business, a price war that began \n     in the early 1990s led insurers to sell malpractice coverage \n     to obstetrician-gynecologists at rates that proved inadequate \n     to cover claims.\n       Some of these carriers had rushed into malpractice coverage \n     because an accounting practice widely used in the industry \n     made the area seem more profitable in the early 1990s than it \n     really was. A decade of short-sighted price slashing led to \n     industry losses of nearly $3 billion last year.\n       ``I don't like to hear insurance-company executives say \n     it's the tort [injury-law] system--it's self inflicted,'' \n     says Donald J. Zuk, chief executive of Scpie Holdings Inc., a \n     leading malpractice insurer in California.\n       What's more, the litigation statistics most insurers \n     trumpet are incomplete. The statistics come from Jury Verdict \n     Research, a Horsham, Pa., information service, which reports \n     that since 1994, jury awards for medical-malpractice cases \n     have jumped 175 percent, to a median of $1 million in 2000. \n     During that seven-year period, the median award for \n     negligence in childbirth was $2,050,000--the highest for all \n     types of medical-malpractice cases, Jury Verdict Research \n     says. (In any group of figures, half fall above the median, \n     and half fall below.)\n       But Jury Verdict Research says its 2,951-case malpractice \n     database has large gaps. It collects award information \n     unsystematically, and it can't say how many cases it misses. \n     It says it can't calculate the percentage change in the \n     median for childbirth-negligence cases. More important, the \n     database excludes trial victories by doctors and hospitals--\n     verdicts that are worth zero dollars. That's a lot to ignore. \n     Doctors and hospitals win about 62 percent of the time, Jury \n     Verdict Research says. A separate database on settlements is \n     less comprehensive.\n       A spokesman for Jury Verdict Research, Gary Bagin, confirms \n     these and other holes in its statistics. He says the numbers \n     nevertheless accurately reflect trends. The company, which \n     sells its data to all comers, has reported jury information \n     this way since 1961. ``If we changed now, people looking back \n     historically couldn't compare apples to apples,'' Mr. Bagin \n     says.\n       Some doctors are beginning to acknowledge that the \n     conventional focus on jury awards deflects attention from the \n     insurance industry's behavior. The American College of \n     Obstetricians and Gynecologists for the first time is \n     conceding that carrier's business practice have contributed \n     to the current problem, says Alice Kirkman, a spokeswoman for \n     the professional group. ``We are admitting it's a much more \n     complex problem that we have previously talked about,'' she \n     says.\n       The upshot is beyond dispute: Pregnant women across the \n     country are scrambling for medical attention. Kimberly \n     Maugaotega of Las Vegas is 13 weeks pregnant and hasn't seen \n     an obstetrician. When she learned she was expecting, the 33-\n     year-old mother of two called the doctor who delivered her \n     second child but was told he wasn't taking any new pregnant \n     patients. Dr. Shelby Wilbourn plans to leave Nevada because \n     of soring medical-malpractice insurance rates there. Ms. \n     Maugaotega says she called 28 obstetricians but couldn't find \n     one who would take her.\n       Frustrated, she called the office of Nevada Gov. Kenny \n     Guinn. A staff member gave her yet another name. She made an \n     appointment to see that doctor today but says she is \n     skeptical about the quality of care she will receive.\n       In the Las Vegas area, doctors say some 90 obstetricians \n     have stopped accepting new patients since St. Paul Cos., \n     formerly the country's leading provider of malpractice \n     coverage, quit the business in December. St. Paul had insured \n     more than half of Nevada's 240 obstetricians. Carriers still \n     offering coverage in the state have raised rates by 100 \n     percent to 400 percent, physicians say.\n       Dr. Wilbourn says his annual malpractice premium was due to \n     jump to $108,000 next month, from $33,000. The 41-year-old \n     solo practitioner says the increase would come straight out \n     of his take-home pay of between $150,000 and $200,000 a year. \n     In response, he is moving to Maine this summer.\n       Dr. Wilbourn mourns having ``to pick up and leave the \n     patients I cared for and the practice I built up over 12 \n     years.'' But in Maine, he has found a $200,000-a-year \n     position with an insurance premium of only $9,800 for the \n     first year, although the rate rises significantly after that. \n     Premiums in Maine are relatively low because a dominant \n     doctor-owned insurance cooperative there hasn't pushed to \n     maximize rates, the heavily rural population isn't notably \n     litigious and its court system employs an expert panel to \n     screen out some suits, says Insurance Commissioner Alessandro \n     Iuppa.\n       Until the 1970s, few doctors faced big-dollar suits. \n     Malpractice coverage was a small specialty. As courts \n     expanded liability rules, malpractice suits became more \n     common. Dozens of doctor-owned insurance cooperatives, or \n     ``bedpan mutuals,'' formed in response. Most stuck to their \n     home states.\n       St. Paul, a mid-sized national carrier named for its base \n     in Minnesota, saw an opportunity. An insurer of Main Street \n     businesses, St. Paul became the leader in the malpractice \n     field. By 1985, it had a 20 percent share of the national \n     market. Overall, the company had revenue of $8.9 billion last \n     year, with about 10 percent of its premium dollars coming \n     from malpractice coverage.\n       The frequency and size of doctors' malpractice claims rose \n     steadily in the early 1980s, industry officials say. St. Paul \n     and its competitors raised rates sharply during the 1980s.\n       Expecting malpractice awards to continue rising rapidly, \n     St. Paul increased its reserves. But the company \n     miscalculated, says Kevin Rehnberg, a senior vice president. \n     Claim frequency and size leveled off in the late 1980s, as \n     more than 30 states enacted curbs on malpractice awards, Mr. \n     Rehnberg says. The industry's rate increases turned \n     malpractice insurance into a very lucrative specialty.\n       A standard industry accounting device used by St. Paul and, \n     on a smaller scale, by its rivals, made the field look even \n     more attractive. Realizing that it had set aside too much \n     money for malpractice claims, St. Paul ``released'' $1.1 \n     billion in reserves between 1992 and 1997. The money flowed \n     through its income statement and boosted its bottom line.\n       St. Paul stated clearly in its annual reports that excess \n     reserves had enlarged its net income. But that part of the \n     message didn't get through to some insurers--especially \n     bedpan mutuals--dazzled by St. Paul's bottom line, according \n     to industry officials.\n       In the 1990s, some bedpan mutuals began competing for \n     business beyond their original territories. New Jersey's \n     Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange, California's Southern \n     California Physicians Insurance Exchange (now known as Scpie \n     Holdings), and Pennsylvania Hospital Insurance Co., or Phico, \n     fanned out across the country. Some publicly traded insurers \n     also jumped into the business.\n       With St. Paul seeming to offer a model for big, quick \n     profits, ``no one wanted to sit still in their own \n     backyard,'' says Scpie's Mr. Zuk. ``The boards of directors \n     said, `We've got go grow.''' Scpie expanded into Connecticut, \n     Florida and Texas, among other states, starting in 1997.\n       As they entered new areas, smaller carriers often tried to \n     attract customers by undercutting St. Paul. The price \n     slashing became contagious, and premiums fell in many states. \n     The mutuals ``went in and aggravated the situation by saying, \n     `Look at all the money St. Paul is making,''' says Tom Gose, \n     President of MAG Mutual Insurance Co., which operates mainly \n     in Georgia. ``They came in late to the dance and undercut \n     everyone.''\n       The newer competitors soon discovered, however, that ``the \n     so-called profitability of the '90s was the result of those \n     years in the mid-80s when the actuaries were predicting the \n     terrible trends,'' says Donald J. Fager, president of Medical \n     Liability Mutual Insurance Co., a bedpan mutual started in \n     1975 in New York. Except for two mergers in the past two \n     years, his company mostly has held to its original single-\n     state focus.\n       The competition intensified, even though some insurers \n     ``knew rates were inadequate from 1995 to 2000'' to cover \n     malpractice claims says Bob Sanders, an actuary with Milliman \n     USA, a Seattle consultancy serving insurance companies.\n       In at least one case, aggressive pricing allegedly crossed \n     the line into fraud. Pennsylvania regulators last year filed \n     a civil suit in state court in Harrisburg against certain \n     executives and board members of Phico. The state alleges the \n     defendants misled the company's board on the adequacy of \n     Phico's premium rates and funds set aside to pay claims. On \n     the way to becoming the nation's seventh-largest malpractice \n     insurer, the company had suffered mounting losses on policies \n     for medical offices and nursing homes as far away as Miami.\n       Pennsylvania regulators took over Phico last August. The \n     company filed for bankruptcy-court protection from its \n     creditors in December. A trial date hasn't been set for the \n     state fraud suit. Phico executives and directors have denied \n     wrongdoing.\n       In the late 1990s, the size of payouts for malpractice \n     awards increased, carriers say. By 2000, many companies were \n     losing money on malpractice coverage. Industrywide, carriers \n     paid out $1.36 in claims and expenses for every premium \n     dollar they collected, says Mr. Golden, the trade-group \n     official.\n       The losses were exacerbated by carriers' declining \n     investment returns. Some insurers had come to expect that big \n     gains in the 1990s from their bond and stock portfolios would \n     continue, industry officials say. When the bull market \n     stalled in 2000, investment gains that had patched over \n     inadequate premium rates disappeared.\n       Some bedpan mutuals went home. Scpie stopped writing \n     coverage in any state over\n\n[[Page S7531]]\n\n     than California. ``We lost money, and we retreated,'' says \n     the company's Mr. Zuk.\n       New Jersey's Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange, now known as \n     MIIX, had expanded into 24 states by the time it had a loss \n     of $164 million in the fourth quarter of 2001. The company \n     says it is now refusing to renew policies for 7.000 \n     physicians outside of New Jersey. It plans to reformulate as \n     a new company operating only in that state.\n       St. Paul's malpractice business sank into the red. Last \n     December, newly hired Chief Executive Jay Fishman, a former \n     Citigroup Inc. executive, announced the company would drop \n     the coverage line. St. Paul reported a $980 million loss on \n     the business for 2001.\n       As carriers retrench, competition has slumped and prices in \n     some states have shot up. Lauren Kline, 6\\1/2\\ months \n     pregnant, changed obstetricians when her long-time \n     Philadelphia doctor moved out of state because of rate \n     increases. Now, her new doctor, Robert Friedman, may have to \n     give up delivering babies at his suburban Philadelphia \n     practice. His insurance expires at the end of the month, and \n     he says he is having difficulty finding a carrier that will \n     sell him a policy at any price.\n       Last year, Dr. Friedman says he paid $50,000 for coverage. \n     If he gets a policy for next year, it will cost $90,000, he \n     predicts, based on his broker's estimate. ``I can't pass a \n     single bit of that off to my patients,'' because managed-care \n     companies don't allow it, he says.\n       Dr. Friedman says he is considering dropping the obstetrics \n     part of his practice. Generally, delivering babies is seen as \n     posing greater risks than most gynecological treatment. As a \n     result, insurers offer less-expensive policies to doctors who \n     don't do deliveries.\n       Mr. Golden of the insurers' association argues that \n     whatever role industry practices may play, the current \n     turmoil stems from lawsuits. The association says that from \n     1995 through 2000, total industry payouts to cover losses and \n     legal expenses jumped 52 percent, to $6.9 billion. ``That \n     says there are more really huge verdicts.'' Mr. Golden says. \n     Even in the majority of cases in which doctors and hospitals \n     win--the zero-dollar verdicts--there are still legal expenses \n     that insurers have to pick up, he adds.\n       Industry critics point to different sets for statistics. \n     Bob Hunter, director for insurance at Consumer Federation of \n     America, an advocacy group in Washington, prefers numbers \n     generated by A.M. Best Co. The insurance-rating agency \n     estimates that once all malpractice claims from 1991 through \n     2000 are resolved--which will take until about 2010--the \n     average payout per claim will have risen 47 percent, to \n     $42,473. That projection includes legal expenses and suits in \n     which doctors or hospitals prevail.\n       While the statistical debate rages, pregnant women adjust \n     to new limits and inconveniences. Kelly Biesecker, 35, spent \n     many extra hours on the highway this spring, driving from her \n     home in Villanova, Pa., to Delran, N.J., so she could \n     continue to use her obstetrician. Dr. Richard Krauss says he \n     moved the obstetrics part of his practice from Philadelphia \n     because malpractice rates had skyrocketed in Pennsylvania. \n     Ms. Biesecter, who gave birth to a healthy boy on June 5, \n     says Dr. Krauss was the doctor she trusted to guard her \n     health and the health of her baby: ``You stick with that guy \n     no matter what the distance.''\n       Dr. Krauss, 53, left Philadelphia last year only after his \n     malpractice premium rose to $54,000, from $38,000, and then \n     was cancelled by a carrier getting out of the business, he \n     says. After getting quotes of about $80,000 on a new policy, \n     he moved. New Jersey hasn't been a panacea, however. His \n     policy there expires July 1, and the carrier refuses to renew \n     it. The doctor says he hopes to go to work for a hospital \n     that will pay for his coverage.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The article points out the reason the premiums are rising \nso high is because the insurance companies miscalculated. They went \ninto the business without adequate reserves. They have seen their \ninvestments plummet, as everyone else has on Wall Street, and they are \ntrying to make it up with new malpractice insurance premiums at the \nhighest possible levels. So, instead of blaming the juries that find a \ndoctor or hospital at fault, let us also take into account the \ninsurance companies' economic and accounting problems which have led to \nthis crisis today.\n  Let's look specifically at this amendment. Senator McConnell is \nconsistent. When we brought up the bill about corporate corruption, he \noffered an amendment relating to trial lawyers. He believes that trial \nlawyers are the root of all evil. That amendment did not pass.\n  Now we come to a bill involving the cost of prescription drugs. \nSenator McConnell returns with another amendment related to trial \nlawyers.\n  It is said that if the only tool you own is a hammer, every problem \nlooks like a nail. It appears that when it comes to the issues in the \nSenate, for some Senators the answer to every problem is to go after \nthe trial lawyers.\n  I suggest that when we take a look at the McConnell amendment, there \nare at least four areas that should be troubling to everyone following \nthis debate. First, Senator McConnell limits the period of time when \nsomeone can discover an injury or act of malpractice and bring a \nlawsuit. If they wait too long, they lose their chance to go to court. \nThat is something we ought to think about long and hard.\n  Secondly, Senator McConnell says that once someone has discovered \nthat they have an injury caused by a doctor or a hospital and go to \nfind an attorney, he limits in this amendment the amount of money that \nan attorney can receive for a contingency fee. A contingency fee is the \npoor man's ticket to the courthouse. If injured victim is not a \nmillionaire, the only way that an attorney will take a complicated \nmedical malpractice case is for a percentage of what they ultimately \nrecover. If they recover zero, they are paid zero. But if they recover \na substantial amount, they receive a percentage. Senator McConnell \nwants to limit the contingency fee to limit the number of attorneys who \nwill take these cases to court.\n  The third issue is this: Senator McConnell creates a new tax on \npunitive damages. What he says is, if someone has done something so \noutrageous or deliberate, with conscious malice and disregard, that a \njury would impose punitive damages on that doctor or hospital--and I \ncan give a litany of possibilities--Senator McConnell says, sorry, the \nGovernment is going to take away half of the punitive damages verdict; \nalbeit, for good reasons. But nevertheless, this is a new tax created \nby Senator McConnell on a jury verdict.\n  Finally, what the Senator says in this bill is, if one had the \nforesight to buy medical or life insurance, for example, to cover their \nhealth or life, and they are injured or killed because of medical \nmalpractice, any jury verdict will be reduced by the amount of the \ninsurance payment that one happens to receive from the policy they took \nout on their own life. These people invest in insurance and pay for it \nover a lifetime. But the amendment would take away part of that amount \nfrom a jury award. Those four things are fundamentally unfair.\n  We have talked in the corporate corruption debate about \naccountability. We have said corporate officials should be held \naccountable for their conduct. The same is true of people in the \npractice of medicine. They should be held accountable, too. If they are \nguilty of wrongdoing, injuring innocent people, then they should be \nheld accountable.\n\n  Unfortunately, the McConnell amendment goes too far and takes away \naccountability. It is certainly the type of an amendment which \ninsurance companies are happy to see. It reduces their ultimate \nexposure, but what it does is close and limit the courthouse doors for \nordinary people who have become victims.\n  To give one illustration from my State: A young woman in April of \n1989 went into a hospital for treatment for breast cancer. The doctor \ninserted a 16 centimeter-long catheter in her vein in her upper chest. \nAfter her chemotherapy was completed, the catheter was supposed to be \nremoved. In July of the following year, the doctor removed the \ncatheter, but he did not take it all. In December 1991, over 2 years \nafter her initial treatment, she went in for an X-ray and discovered \nthat 9 centimeters of this catheter was lodged in her heart, causing \npain, causing her discomfort all of the time.\n  Ultimately, the doctors decided it was too risky to engage in surgery \nto remove the fragment, and so they decided to let the catheter piece \nremain lodged inside her heart. She will live with that foreign object \ninside her for as long as she lives. The doctor's mistake will be a \npain that she feels every moment for the rest of her life.\n  Under Senator McConnell's amendment, there is a serious question as \nto whether or not she could have ever brought the lawsuit. Did she wait \ntoo long? It took more than 2 years to discover this situation. She \nwould have to fight, under the McConnell amendment, to prove that this \nwas a reasonable amount of time, that the pain should not have alerted \nher sooner.\n  Secondly, the amendment limits the attorney's fees. If this woman \ngoes to consult an attorney and says, ``I am in pain; the doctor did \nsomething wrong; I\n\n[[Page S7532]]\n\nhave the X-ray,'' Senator McConnell would say her attorney cannot be \npaid more than a limited amount on contingency fees to go to the \ncourthouse. Is that reasonable?\n  Fortunately, those provisions in the McConnell amendment did not \napply and this lady went to court. She ultimately was awarded $1.5 \nmillion for pain and suffering, and an additional $500,000 for the \nincreased risk of future injury.\n  Sadly, there are cases such as this that happen every day in America. \nThe vast majority of doctors in our Nation are conscientious, hard-\nworking, wonderful people, but mistakes are made. Sometimes they are \ntragic, sometimes they show gross negligence, and sometimes they are \nintentional, such as the removal of the wrong kidney when they leave a \ncancerous kidney in a person and remove the wrong one. What Senator \nMcConnell is saying is that person who has been aggrieved and injured \nwould be limited in their opportunity to recover.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address the pending McConnell \nmedical malpractice amendment. I have long agreed with my colleague \nfrom Kentucky that our legal system needs reforming, and I have joined \nhim in supporting a bill in many ways similar to this amendment in the \npast. But I cannot support him today, because I do not believe that \nthis prescription drug debate is either the right time or the right \nplace to address the medical malpractice issue.\n  The Senate has been debating the critical and urgent issue of how to \nprovide seniors with prescription drug coverage for 2 weeks. As my \ncolleagues know, we are having a very hard time finding common ground \non the issue. The last thing we need now is to inject into this debate \na highly controversial issue which we all know for a certainty will \nprevent us from ever fulfilling our goal of giving seniors the \nprescription drug benefits they need. We should be focused on debating \nand passing a prescription drug bill, not other issues. For that \nreason, I will vote to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I will address several of the myths \nthat have been stated during the course of this debate. Myth No. 1 is \nthat average medical malpractice premiums in California are higher than \nthey are in States that have not enacted medical malpractice reform.\n  Obviously, that statement is absurd on its face. The fact is, the \nopponents of my amendment cited numbers from the Medical Liability \nMonitor arrived at by some playing of games with the numbers to prove a \npredetermined result. The editor of that publication, the Medical \nLiability Monitor, takes issue with the manner in which the other side \nhas fudged the numbers. She states unequivocally that: We do not \nbelieve an average premium exists, nor do we attempt to produce such a \nspurious number. She concludes in her letter to Senator Frist: I find \nit particularly offensive, especially when I have spent my entire \ncareer pursuing objectivity, honesty, and balance in everything I \nproduce.\n  She also noted in a recent National Journal article that insurers in \nCalifornia hold the lines fairly well because they have tort reform in \nplace.\n  Myth No. 2: Medical malpractice premiums are not a burden on health \ncare costs. It has been said on the other side, they account for only \n.6 percent of all health care costs--so it is said.\n  First, the studies cited by my Democratic friends do not take into \naccount large segments of the medical malpractice community. Moreover, \na 1996 study by two Stanford economists found that commonsense medical \nmalpractice reforms, many of which are included in my amendment, could \nreduce health care costs by 5 to 9 percent without jeopardizing quality \nof care. Using this study, the Department of Health and Human Services \nprojected that reducing the practice of defensive medicine would save \nFederal taxpayers between $23 and $42 billion.\n  Myth No. 3: It has been stated that companies have to raise premiums \nbecause they lost money on bad investments such as Enron. The fact is, \nthe American Academy of Actuaries states insurers typically invest the \nvast majority of premiums in fixed income investments, not stocks. They \nalso state that insurers do not set rates to recoup investment losses.\n  It has been suggested that somehow the door to the courthouse will be \nclosed because there is a reasonable cap on attorneys' fees, which of \ncourse would guarantee that the victim got more of the money and the \nlawyer a little bit less--but certainly not enough to make them \nunwilling to take cases.\n  My friend from Illinois says contingency fees are the poor man's \nticket to the courthouse. Apparently our trial lawyer friends will only \npunch the ticket if they can get more than a third of their clients' \nawards. My amendment limits the lawyer's fee to 33 percent of the award \nup to $150,000 and 25 percent above $150,000. So the suggestion is \nbeing made that if the lawyers do not get more than a third of the \nmoney involved, they somehow will not represent the injured victim.\n  One of our colleagues on the other side in a previous life got an \naward of $27 million, as the Washington Post reported. Under my \nformula, he would have gotten only $6.75 million, plus costs. I don't \nthink that is much of a disincentive to represent an injured victim.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Directly on this point, I learned in law school sometimes it \nis hard for people to get a lawyer to take their case if they do not \nhave a very good case. Lawyers charge a higher and higher and higher \ncontingency case. But if the case was a pretty good case, back when I \nwas in law school, contingency fees were pretty low.\n  As I understand your amendment, limiting the contingency fee to one-\nthird of what is recovered is a pretty high contingency fee. Under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act, since the late 1940s, the limit has been 25 \npercent, and there has been no dearth of cases. It is actually higher \nthan we already have under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n  Continuing this line of thought, if you have a good case, then the \ncontingency fee tends to be lower. The worse the case is--the less \nlikelihood of succeeding--generally, the higher the contingency fees.\n  What would you say to the argument that we have to have no limit on \nthe contingency fees or cases will not be taken?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona there is no evidence \nthat there are not lawyers willing to take the cases. What this \nunderlying amendment is about is protecting the victim and giving the \nvictim more of the money and giving the lawyer a little bit less \nwithout taking away any incentive.\n  Statistics indicate the poor victims, on the whole, get about 48 \npercent of the money; 52 percent goes to the lawyers and the costs and \nthe courts. This is a pro-victim amendment that benefits these injured \nparties over whom many have expressed so much concern.\n  Mr. KYL. One final question: Your amendment in no way limits the \namount that the individual can recover in economic damages, or pain and \nsuffering damages, at all, but it would put at least an upper limit of \none-third on a contingency fee that the lawyers could charge for that \nplaintiff or victim?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My amendment would cap attorneys' fees at 33 percent \nof the first $150,000 awarded and 25 percent of the award above \n$150,000.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the amendment is an excellent amendment in support \nof victims, and therefore I am very pleased to support it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Arizona very much.\n  This is a national problem that affects States all across the \ncountry. It has been caused by the failure of the National Government \nto act. The Federal Government is the single biggest purchaser of \nmedical services. It buys $400 billion in medical services each year. \nThe purchase and delivery of medical services substantially affects \ninterstate commerce. Patients and doctors routinely cross State lines. \nParties buy medical services from doctors and hospitals in other \njurisdictions. And doctors and hospitals sell medical services to \ncitizens from different\n\n[[Page S7533]]\n\nStates. Indeed, our most famous hospitals, such as the Mayo Clinic, are \nknown for this.\n  Does anyone deny this is a substantial commercial activity? Thus, \nthere is a commerce clause and a spending clause basis for the Federal \nGovernment to act.\n  Regardless of the problem caused by our civil justice system, some of \nour colleagues will point the finger at anyone but big personal injury \nlawyers. No matter what the trial lawyers do, no matter what abuses \nthey may commit, some colleagues absolutely refuse to admit that there \nare any abuses or excesses in our civil justice system. Some of our \ncolleagues say they are for accountability and responsibility in \nhelping average Americans. They say that is what the debate is all \nabout on corporate governance and prescription drugs. But when it comes \ndown to it, some of our colleagues are for accountability and \nresponsibility and helping average people only when it does not affect \nthe interests of big, wealthy, powerful trial lawyers. In short, they \nare about accountability for everyone but the personal injury bar.\n  Our friends who share that view will do anything that will impede big \npersonal injury lawyers being able to run rampant through our legal \nsystem. We have seen them over the last few weeks. They will protect \nbig, powerful trial lawyers over American victims of terrorism when it \ncomes to punitive damages. We have seen that those colleagues will \nshield big, powerful trial lawyers from having to disclose basic \ninformation about their fees and costs to their clients. We have seen \nthat some will not restrict big, powerful trial lawyers from ambulance \nchasing victims by reserving a respectful period of bereavement before \nsoliciting business. And now we have seen those same folks urging the \nSenate not to help medical professionals by adopting the most modest of \npro-victim reforms to our medical malpractice liability system. The AMA \nwould like to go further than this amendment goes.\n  And now we've seen that my Democrat friends urging the Senate not to \nhelp medical professionals by adopting the most modest of pro-victim \nreforms to our medical malpractice liability system. Again, my \namendment is pro-victim because it: doesn't limit pain and suffering \none penny; ensure that the victims, not their lawyers, get most of the \ncompensation; allows them to get punitive damages; and improves overall \npatient care by providing that half of a punitive damages award goes to \nimproving medical standards and practices.\n  My colleagues: this is a chance to do something to help doctors, to \nhelp patients, to help our medical delivery system without capping by \none nickel a patient's pain and suffering damages. The question, then, \nis whether you are going to vote with the trial lawyers or are you \ngoing to vote with the doctors and their patients.\n  If my Democrat friends are serious about doing something to improve \nthe delivery of medical services, they'll break with the trial lawyers \nfor a change and listen to the medical community and adopt my \namendment--an amendment that has already passed the Senate once.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have 6\\1/2\\?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute and a half to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask that Senator Enzi be added as a cosponsor to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Senator from Kentucky and I agree on a variety of \nissues that relate to what we are talking about. Tomorrow, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee holds hearings on class action reform. I think it \nis a situation that calls for a national or a Federal solution.\n\n  Many of us heard from our constituents around the country that we as \na Congress need to do something to address asbestos reform legislation \nbecause there are a lot of folks who are being hurt from asbestosis and \nthey are not getting anything out of it. Their damages are not being \ncovered. Meanwhile a lot of people who are not sick, will never be \nsick, are diluting the money that should be going to people who really \nhave asbestosis or diseases related to asbestos. Those are issues that \nI think cry out for a national solution.\n  The one we are talking about here today, medical malpractice, is a \nproblem in a number of States--I will acknowledge that--but it is a \nproblem that can be fixed in a number of States. Delaware is one of \nthose States in which legislation is pending today to address this \nissue and where it is most appropriately addressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the remaining time.\n  At a time when the American people are calling for greater corporate \naccountability, it is unbelievable that our Republican colleagues would \nbring to the floor an amendment which would do just the opposite. The \nMcConnell amendment would allow the entire health care industry to \navoid accountability for the care they provide.\n  The Amendment would deprive seriously injured patients of fair \ncompensation. At virtually every stage of the legal process, the \namendment systematically rewrites the rules of civil law to tip the \nbalance in favor of defendants. It would arbitrarily shield health care \nproviders and their insurance companies from basic responsibility for \nthe harm they cause.\n  While those across the aisle like to talk about doctors, the real \nbeneficiaries will be insurance companies. This amendment would enrich \nthe insurance industry at the expense of the most seriously injured \npatients; men, women, and children whose entire lives have been \ndevastated by medical neglect and corporate abuse.\n  This proposal would also shield HMOs that fail to provide needed \ncare, nursing homes that neglect elderly patients, drug companies whose \nmedicine has toxic side effects, and manufacturers of defective medical \nequipment.\n  It would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the entire \nhealth care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they \nhave suffered. When will the Republican Party start worrying about \ninjured patients and stop trying to shield big business from the \nconsequences of its wrongdoing? Less accountability will never lead to \nbetter health care.\n  Substandard medical care is a growing problem. The Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality at HHS found that the number of adverse \neffects from medical treatment has more than doubled in recent years, \nrising from 302,000 in 1993 to 710,000 in 2000. A Healthcare Research \nand Quality study also found that adverse effects of medical drugs have \nincreased by more than 44 percent in recent years, rising from 657,000 \nin 1993 to 992,000 in 2000. A 1999 study, by the Institute of Medicine \nat the National Academy of Sciences determined that at least 44,000 \npatients, and perhaps as many as 98,000 patients, die in hospitals each \nyear as a result of medical errors. That is more than die from auto \naccidents, breast cancer, or AIDS each year. Despite these alarming \nnumbers, less than one-half of 1 percent of the nation's doctors face \nany serious sanctions from Medical Review Boards each year.\n  These statistics make clear that we need more accountability in the \nhealth care system, not less. In this era of managed care and cost \ncontrols, it is ludicrous to suggest that the major problem facing \nAmerican health care is ``defensive medicine.'' The problem is not \n``too much health care,'' it is ``too little'' quality health care.\n  The restrictions on compensation for seriously injured patients which \nthe McConnell Amendment seeks to impose would not even result in less \ncostly care. The cost of medical malpractice premiums constitutes less \nthan two-thirds of 1 percent 0.66 percent of the nation's health care \nexpenditures each year. Malpractice premiums are not the cause of the \nhigh rate of medical inflation. Over the decade from 1988 to 1998, the \ncost of medical care rose 13 times faster than the cost of malpractice \ninsurance. Did you get that? The cost of medical care rose 13 times \nfaster than the cost of malpractice insurance.\n  The restrictions in this amendment are not only unfair to patients, \nthey are also an ineffective way to control medical malpractice \npremiums. There\n\n[[Page S7534]]\n\nis scant evidence to support the claim that enacting malpractice limits \nwill lower insurance rates. There is substantial evidence to the \ncontrary. Malpractice premiums are no higher on average in the 27 \nStates that do not place limitation on malpractice damages, than in the \n23 States that do have such limits.\n  Do we understand that? The premiums are no higher where you do not \nhave these kinds of limitations than in the States that do. And you \nknow what that means. The doctors are paying the higher premiums. Who \ndo you think is keeping the difference? The insurance companies. The \ninsurance companies. They are the ones that are making out.\n  The evidence clearly demonstrates that placing arbitrary limitations \non the malpractice damages does not benefit the doctors it purports to \nhelp. Their rates remain virtually the same. It only helps the \ninsurance companies earn even larger profits.\n  The malpractice premiums are not affected by the imposition of the \nlimits on recovery, so it stands to reason the availability of \nphysicians does not differ between the States that have limits and the \nStates that do not.\n  I will use the chart that shows the difference between the States \nthat do have limits and those that do not.\n  Physicians In Patient Care: States without caps on damages, with 233 \nper 100,000 residents; the States with caps on damages, 223--virtually \nidentical.\n  The point here, in summation, is accountability and responsibility in \nthe whole area of the health care industry and the profits that are \ngoing to result if this amendment is successful. It will not mean \nbetter health care. It will mean, less attention to protecting patients \nall the way through the health care system.\n  It will mean larger profits. It will mean larger profits for an \nindustry. It will mean less corporate responsibility. I hope this \namendment will not be successful.\n  Since malpractice premiums are not effected by the imposition of \nlimits on recovery, it stands to reason that the availability of \nphysicians does not differ between states that have limits and states \nthat do not. AMA data shows that there are 233 physicians per 100,000 \nresidents in states that do not have medical malpractice limits and 223 \nphysicians per 100,000 residents in states with limits. Looking at the \nparticularly high cost specialty of obstetrics and gynecology, states \nwithout limits on damages have 29 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women while \nstates with limits have 27.4 OB/GYNs per 100,000 women. Clearly there \nis no correlation.\n  If this amendment were to pass it, it would sacrifice fair \ncompensation for injured patients in a vain attempt to reduce medical \nmalpractice premiums. Doctors will not get the relief they are seeking. \nOnly the insurance companies, which created the recent market \ninstability, will benefit.\n  Even supporters of the industry acknowledge that enacting tort reform \nwill not produce lower insurance premiums:\n  Victor Schwartz, the American Tort Reform Association's General \nCounsel, told Business Insurance,\n\n       . . . many tort reform advocates do not contend that \n     restricting litigation will lower insurance rates, and `I've \n     never said that in 30 years.'\n\n  Debra Ballen, Executive Vice-President of the American Insurance \nAssociation even released a statement earlier this year (March 13, \n2002) acknowledging,\n\n       [T]he insurance industry never promised that tort reform \n     would achieve specific premium savings . . ..\n\n  A National Association of Insurance Commissioners study shows that in \n2000, the latest year for which data is available, total insurance \nindustry profits as a percentage of premiums for medical malpractice \ninsurance was nearly twice as high 13.6 percent as overall casualty and \nproperty insurance profits 7.9 percent. In fact, malpractice was a very \nlucrative line of insurance for the industry throughout the 1990s, \naveraging profits of 12 percent per year. Recent premium increases have \nbeen an attempt to maintain high profit margins despite sharply \ndeclining investment earnings.\n  Insurance industry practices are responsible for the sudden dramatic \npremium increases which have occurred in some states in recent months. \nThe explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in \nlegislative halls or in courtrooms, but in the boardrooms of the \ninsurance companies themselves.\n  There have been substantial increases in recent months in a number of \ninsurance lines, not just medical malpractice. In 2001, rates for small \ncommercial accounts have gone up 21 percent, rates for mid-size \ncommercial accounts have gone up 32 percent, and rates for large \ncommercial accounts have gone up 36 percent. According to industry \nsources, auto insurance rates are projected to climb by 23 percent \nbetween 2000 and 2003, and homeowners insurance is projected to climb \nby 21 percent over the same period. These increases are attributable to \ngeneral economic factors and industry practices, certainly not medical \nliability tort law.\n  Insurers make much of their money form investment income. During \ntimes when investments offer high profit, companies compete fiercely \nwith one another for market share. They often do so by underpricing \ntheir plans and insuring poor risks. When investment income dries up \nbecause interest rates fall and the stock market declines, the \ninsurance industry then attempts to increase its premiums and reduce \nits coverage. This is a familiar cycle which produces a manufactured \ncrisis each time their investments turn downward.\n  One of the leading insurance industry analysts, Carol Brierly Golin, \neditor of Medical Liability Monitor, concluded:\n\n       As the economy enjoyed a magic carpet ride in the 1990s, \n     insurers kept rates artificially low because they earned more \n     money investing than by writing policies . . . The insurance \n     companies wouldn't be in this position if they hadn't been so \n     hungry for investment profits . . . (Dec. 19, 2001).\n\n  This analysis of why we are seeing a sudden spike in premiums was \nconfirmed by a June 24, 2002 Wall Street Journal article describing \nwhat happened to the malpractice insurance industry during the 1990s.\n\n       Some of these carriers rushed into malpractice coverage \n     because an accounting practice widely used in the industry \n     made the area seem more profitable in the early 1990s than it \n     really was. A decade of short-sighted price slashing led to \n     industry losses of nearly $3 billion last year.\n       I don't like to hear insurance-company executives say it's \n     the tort [injury-law] system--it's self-inflicted, says \n     Donald J. Zuk, chief executive of Scpie Holdings, Inc., a \n     leading malpractice insurer in California . . .\n       The losses were exacerbated by carriers' declining \n     investment returns. Some insurers had come to expect that big \n     gains in the 1990s from their bond and stock portfolios would \n     continue, industry officials say. When the bull market \n     stalled in 2000, investment gains that had patched over \n     inadequate premium rates disappeared.\n\n  Proponents of the McConnell amendment justify the extreme \nrestrictions they would place on the rights of injured patients as \nnecessary to control medical malpractice premiums. The real \nbeneficiaries of the amendment would be the insurance industry, which \nwould pocket the money it saved on claims. The insurance premiums which \ndoctors pay would not significantly change. The real losers, of course, \nwould be the most seriously injured patients, who were denied fair \ncompensation for their life-altering injuries. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

I say to my friend, the amendment which is a step in the \ndirection of helping senior citizens who need prescription drugs is \navailable. It is just being copied.

It is good to know we are going to have a chance to take a \nlook at this piece of legislation.\n  Do we expect to vote on this piece of legislation that is just hot \noff the press today that is a $400 billion expansion of the expenditure \nof the Federal Government over the next 10 years?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, it is our purpose to allow the Senate \nto vote on a good prescription drug benefit for senior citizens, \nsomething that is long overdue and, as the Senator knows, in 1965 when \nwe passed Medicare, there was not a prescription drug benefit. This \nwill be a downpayment for that. Yes, we would like to vote on it today.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the next amendment to be offered is from the \nSenator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. I have an amendment that we have worked \non for a couple of years dealing with prescription drugs and allowing \nthose people who have health insurance plans to have prescription drug \nbenefits for contraceptives. I am not going to be able to do that \nbecause this legislation is, of course, winding down one way or the \nother. Everyone seems to have focused on a prescription drug benefit \nfor Medicare. That does not take away from how important I believe my \namendment is.\n  I am terribly disappointed, and I suggest there are advocacy groups \nall over America that are disappointed as they hear me say this. \nMembers of my own staff are terribly disappointed because they have \nworked on this sometimes days at a time. We have been able to get \nlittle bits and pieces of it over the years.\n  Federal employees, for example, have a benefit that other people in \nthe country do not have; that is, in their prescription drug plans, \ntheir health care, they can have contraceptives under the benefits of \ntheir plan. That should apply to everyone in America. We are not going \nto be able to do that today, and I am disappointed.\n  I am happy, though, to designate Senator Graham to offer the \namendment on which he has spent such an inordinate amount of time. \nSenator Graham and I came to the Senate together. He was a very \nsuccessful and popular Governor. It is said that he is probably the \nmost popularly elected official to ever come from the State of Florida. \nWhether that is true or not, I do not know. I do know he is a great \nlegislator. The work he has done on this amendment has been exemplary. \nThere is not anyone who understands Medicare and the tax aspects of it \nbetter than the Senator from Florida. He has spent not hours, days, or \nweeks; he has spent months on this legislation. Always available to \nanyone who has a question, he explains it in detail so it is \nunderstandable.\n  I would only say that the people of Florida are well served by the \nwork he has done, and I hope this amendment that he is going to offer \nwould pass the Senate. It is something that not only the people of \nFlorida need but the people of Nevada, Delaware, and our entire country \nneed. It is not everything that I want, but it is certainly a giant \nstep forward. So I, under the unanimous consent order that is now in \neffect, designate my spot to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 4345 to Amendment No. 4299, As Amended\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I wish to express my appreciation for the graciousness of \nour colleague from Nevada for his very kind remarks. I share his sense \nof the importance of the debate we are about to begin. It is a debate \nwhich has been waiting for 37 years.\n  As history would have it, it was exactly 37 years ago today, July 30, \n1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law that created the \nMedicare Program. President Johnson did not sign the legislation in \nWashington, but he went to Independence, MO, the home of an American \nwho had spent much of his political career attempting to secure a \nhealth care benefit for older and poorer Americans, President Harry S \nTruman, and his wife Bess. He wanted them not only to be able to \nwitness the signing of the Medicare legislation, but President Johnson \nthen went the next step and gave to President Truman and his wife the \nfirst two Medicare cards.\n  President Truman had been fighting for decades for help for insurance \nfor America's senior citizens, most of whom had been denied private \ninsurance coverage because of preexisting conditions. In his remarks at \nthe signing of the Medicare legislation, President Johnson declared: No \nlonger will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern \nmedicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings they \nhave so carefully put away over a lifetime, so they might enjoy dignity \nin their later years. No longer will young families see their own \nincomes, their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are carrying \nout their deep moral obligations to their parents and to their uncles \nand to their aunts. And no longer will this Nation refuse the hand of \njustice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and \nlabor to the progress of this progressive country.\n\n[[Page S7536]]\n\n  There was one thing left out of the law President Johnson signed on \nthat day 37 years ago. That was prescription drug coverage. Today, \nbecause prescription medications are so much more vital to health care \nin the 21st century and, frankly, because they are so expensive, we \nhave the opportunity and the challenge to finish the job. Today we are \npoised to give this, the greatest generation, what they deserve. Today \nwe can add a meaningful prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nProgram so that nearly 40 million older and disabled Americans who rely \non Medicare are not choosing between medicines and the necessities of \nlife.\n  In 1965, the average older American spent on prescriptions $65. That \nwas not $65 a week or $65 a month but $65 for an entire year. What is \nhappening today, July 30, 2002?\n  Today the average senior American spends $2,149 on prescription drugs \neach year. The average senior today has to worry about what will happen \nto his or her health and financial security if, like about 20 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries today, his or her prescription drug needs \nescalate, grow to a level of $3,300 or greater.\n  The average senior today has to work because the options for \nprescription drug coverage are few and those that are available are \nwithering.\n  Medigap coverage is expensive and generally is capped. \nMedicare+Choice coverage is available only to some, and it is almost \ntotally unavailable in rural areas of America. Employer-funded retiree \ncoverage has been shrinking dramatically over the last decade.\n  The Senate has been debating a Medicare prescription drug benefit for \nthe past 2 weeks. It has been actively considering such a benefit for \nthe past 6 years. In 2000, I was proud to vote for a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. It lost. In \n2001, I introduced another version of a comprehensive, universal bill. \nIt lost. With my friends and colleagues, Senators Miller and Kennedy, I \nintroduced an amendment a week ago today in hopes of again providing a \ncomprehensive, affordable prescription drug benefit for all seniors. \nThis proposal gained 52 votes, a majority of the Senate, but we did not \nhave the 60 votes necessary to prevail against the point of order.\n\n  What now? One thing we know, time is not our friend. It is certainly \nnot America's seniors' friend. In another year, if we put this off from \n2002 to 2003, the average senior will be spending $2,439 on drugs. If \nwe wait 2 years, the average senior will be spending $3,059 on \nprescription drugs. In another year, the percentage of seniors spending \nmore than $3,300 on drugs will not be the 20 percent today but will \nexceed 24 percent. By 2005, the number will have grown to about 35 \npercent of our seniors. In another year, Medigap coverage will be more \nexpensive, fewer seniors will have access to Medicare+Choice, and fewer \nseniors will be covered by a previous employer's retiree program.\n  There is no basis for delay. Whatever we do, the time to act is now. \nI am offering a proposal, and I am joined by Senators Gordon Smith--and \nI thank Senator Smith for the great contribution he has made to the \ndevelopment of this proposal--Zell Miller, who has been a stalwart for \nmonths in this effort, and Senators Lincoln, Bingaman, Kennedy, and \nStabenow. Together, we are offering this amendment which will make a \nsignificant difference in the lives, the health, and the financial \nsecurity of our grandparents, our parents, our aunts and uncles, our \nneighbors, the people we love the most, who will be affected the most \nby this legislation.\n  The bipartisan Medicare Prescription Drug Costs Protection Act is \nestimated by the CBO to cost $390 billion over 10 years. It offers all \nseniors protection against catastrophic drug bills, and it provides \nspecial assistance for seniors with the lowest income.\n  What will this plan do? First, for a low annual fee of $25, this \nlegislation will offer all seniors who decide to voluntarily enroll up \nto 30 percent discounts and Federal supplements on the drugs they \npurchase--a very substantial benefit. This will also bring to all \nseniors the peace of mind in knowing, if I should have that heart \nattack, if I should be diagnosed with cancer or diabetes or any of the \nperils of old age, I will have, once I have paid $3,300 out of my \npocket, or in conjunction with a stated prescription drug benefit, \nbeyond that, I will have my prescription drugs paid, with only a $10 \ncopayment per prescription. That will give enormous peace of mind to \nour seniors who are fearful of that catastrophic health event that will \ndrive them into economic poverty.\n  Moreover, this legislation will offer to those seniors who are the \nneediest, coverage for all of their costs. It will cover all seniors \nwho are 200 percent, or lower, of poverty in their income. That means \nfor an individual who earns less than $17,720, or a couple with an \nincome of less than $23,880, all of their costs will be covered except \nfor a copayment of $2 for each prescription which is generic, $5 for a \nbrand name prescription.\n  According to some recent information submitted by the Urban \nInstitute, in the year 2002, a 200 percent of poverty standard would \nrepresent 47 percent of the almost 40 million Medicare beneficiaries in \nthe United States.\n  There is also an important consideration of the effect of this \nlegislation on employers. Today, the largest segment of seniors who get \nsome assistance with their prescription drugs, do so because a previous \nemployer is providing that assistance. More people get assistance \nthrough that means than through a Medicare+Choice, HMO, or through a \nMedigap policy they have purchased. So it is very important that \nemployers have a continuing commitment to participate in the health \ncare costs of their retirees.\n  I am pleased, therefore, to State that the Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that no employer will drop existing coverage because of \nthe benefit that is in this legislation. This is a very important \nassurance for seniors who are receiving assistance today.\n  I might say that competing plans have been evaluated by the \nCongressional Budget Office as causing up to one-third of the seniors \nwho are currently receiving employer retiree benefits with their drug \ncosts to lose those benefits.\n  Is this proposal the perfect Medicare prescription drug benefit? I \nmust admit it is not. I had hoped we could provide a more comprehensive \nand more affordable drug benefit which would be universally applicable \nto all seniors. This proposal is a responsible step towards providing \nwhat seniors want and need. While providing assistance for all seniors, \nit targets the seniors who need help the most--the sickest and those \nwith the lowest income.\n  There are always, here, voices for delay: Why do we need to do this \non July 30? Why can't we wait? Why can't we wait until September? Or \nwhy can't we wait until next January? Why can't we put off the hard \ndecisions?\n  If we wait until January of 2003, and if we start this process again \nin the next Congress, and if we go to the Congressional Budget Office \nand say, then: Here is the same plan that was introduced on July 30, \n2002; please tell us what it is going to cost over the next 10 years--\nwe have been told as of today it will cost $390 billion--the estimate \nis that same bill in January of 2003 will be given a 10-year cost of \n$470 billion.\n  Why? Why in the world would the same plan just 6 months later cost \napproximately $80 billion more over 10 years? The answer is, the \nperfect storm of economic circumstances. It is the convergence of, \nfirst, the fact that the cost of prescription drugs, including both \ninflationary cost of the drugs, plus increased utilization has been \ngoing up at a rate of approximately 18 percent every year. You just ask \nthe people who buy substantial amounts of prescription drugs what their \ncosts are today in comparison to what their costs were just 12 months \nago. And the number of seniors who will be participating is increasing \ndramatically.\n  I was born in 1936. The year 1936 was the second lowest birth rate \nyear in the 20th century in the United States. The reason? We were in \nthe middle of a depression. Not very many families were adding to their \nsize in 1936. So last November, when I reached 65, had I not been \nemployed here in the Senate, I would have become a Medicare \nbeneficiary. But you know what? I would not have had to have stood in a \nvery long line to sign up because there are not a lot of people who \nbecame 65 in November of last year because there weren't very many \npeople born in November of that year 65 years ago. But if\n\n[[Page S7537]]\n\nwe wait another 10 years, we are going to be on the leading edge of one \nof the most significant bubbles of population in the history of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  Today, we have 40 million Americans eligible for Medicare. Do you \nknow how many Americans we are going to have eligible for Medicare in \nthe year 2013? Fifty-one million. That is what is driving these costs. \nEvery year that we delay, it becomes that much more expensive to \ninitiate the program, to look at a 10-year window of how much this is \ngoing to cost. The time for the Senate to act is now.\n  If we act now, in July, we will have the full month of August to work \nwith our colleagues in the House where a bill has already been passed, \na bill that is substantially different than the one we will be \nconsidering in this amendment but one which I think is the basis of \nreasonable compromise.\n  Just a few hours ago the President signed corporate governance \nlegislation. I know my good friend, Senator Smith, was at the signing \nof that legislation. I commend him for his role in the creation and \npassage of that legislation. Many people thought that it was going to \nbe impossible to reach agreement between a different House bill and a \nSenate bill. But, in fact, it was only a matter of a few days when \nserious, conscientious people came to such an understanding. I believe \nwe can do the same thing with our conference with the House on this \nlegislation, but we need to use the month of August as the time to \nbegin to build that consensus towards a common piece of legislation.\n  There is no benefit in the cry for delay, delay, delay. We need every \nday that we can have to see that we arrive at a consensus that will \nlead the Congress to develop legislation which it can pass and the \nPresident can sign into law. We need to avoid adding yet another year \nof inflation and millions of additional seniors coming into the \nMedicare population, so we can pass this at today's price of $390 \nbillion and not wait until next year when the same program is going to \ncost $470 billion.\n  This is the type of good-faith compromise that I hope will bring all \nparties together. It has the best chance of becoming the law of the \nland and providing to our grandparents and parents and all of our loved \nones who depend upon Medicare this critical additional benefit.\n  In closing, I would like to remind all of you of something else that \nPresident Johnson said 37 years ago today when he signed the Medicare \nbill into law:\n\n       Many men can make many proposals. Many men can draft many \n     laws. But few have the piercing and humane eye which can see \n     beyond the words to the people [those words] touch. Few can \n     see past the speeches and the political battles to the doctor \n     over there . . . trying to tend to the infirm; to the \n     hospital that is receiving those in anguish, or feel in their \n     heart the painful wrath at the injustice which denies the \n     miracle of healing to the old and to the poor.\n\n  This debate is not about specific concepts. It is not about \neconomics. It is not about public administration. This debate is about \nreal people, people, as President Johnson said 37 years ago, who served \nthis Nation with honor and dignity. The lives of almost 40 million of \nour fellow citizens are going to be impacted by the vote we are going \nto cast today. They are America.\n  On our behalf, I ask all our colleagues to support this legislation. \nOn behalf of the cosponsors, I send to the desk the amendment and ask \nit be immediately considered. The sponsor's names are Senator Smith of \nOregon, Senator Miller, Senator Lincoln, Senator Bingaman, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), for himself, Mr. \n     Smith of Oregon, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4345 to amendment No. 4299 as amended.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

This preliminary estimate is subject to revision upon such\n  review.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Graham-Smith \namendment. This is our best and perhaps our last opportunity to come \ntogether and actually pass a meaningful prescription drug benefit in \nthe Senate this year. I admit that this is a difficult issue. It is a \nprivilege to work on it, though, because I hear of no single issue more \non the minds of the American people--particularly our senior citizens--\nthan this issue. It is critical that we give them more than a war of \nwords for yet another year--we must give them some results that work \ntoward wellness rather than just rhetoric.\n  I know I have colleagues on the left who don't believe we are \nspending enough. I know I have colleagues on the right who do not like \nthe delivery system that is provided in this bill. But I believe it is \ncritical we clear the 60-vote hurdle because if we don't, the seniors \nwill get nothing for yet another year. That I think is unacceptable.\n  We are running out of time. Seniors are running out of money to pay \nfor their prescription drugs. They can't afford to wait another year \nfor us to reach a compromise. We simply have to act now on a proposal \nSenator Graham and I bring to the floor that is affordable for them and \naffordable for the Government.\n  I believe this is a focused plan that we all ought to support so we \ncan at least keep this process going to get something to conference, so \nthen we can get something to vote on in September, and so that our \nseniors can get the medicine they need.\n  To review this bill: First and foremost, it is voluntary and it is \ncomprehensive. Our bill focuses on providing a comprehensive benefit to \nour neediest low-income seniors--people who are least able to pay for \ntheir prescription drugs. Those who are below 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level will never have to choose between food and \nlifesaving drugs again.\n  I think that is a remarkable and significant proposal in itself. We \nvoted on different iterations of that before. We are bringing it \ntogether again in this amendment.\n  The latest figures from the Urban Institute say 47 percent of our \nNation's seniors live with incomes below 200 percent of poverty, which \ntranslates into $17,720 for individuals and $23,880 for couples. We \ndon't have the money for us to do everything in the world, to enact a \nprescription drug benefit that covers every cost for everybody. But \nunder our plan, low-income seniors receive the most help because they \nneed the most help, and they need it today. But even they have a copay. \nSome will say it is too small. But it is, I believe, enough to at least \nget the attention of low-income seniors when you ask them to pay $2 for \na generic drug prescription or $5 to get a branded product. I think \nthat promotes good consumerism among our seniors.\n  Second, our proposal addresses the fear that millions of seniors feel \nevery day--the fear that the loss of their\n\n[[Page S7538]]\n\nhealth will result in the loss of their home. Our bill will ensure that \nno senior, no matter what their income, will ever have to pay more than \n$3,300 per year in prescription drug costs. I think that is \nsignificant. Some will describe it as a doughnut; others will say it is \na cliff.\n  But I will tell you that I believe seniors in this country appreciate \nthat in this bill they will get a discounted price, a discount card, \nand those in combination may equal up to 30 percent of the cost of a \nprescription. Moreover, they get an insurance policy that says you \ndon't have to lose your home if you lose your health because, as to \nyour prescription drug costs, the Government will be there to make sure \nthat doesn't happen. The Graham-Smith amendment will ensure that they \ndon't have to spend themselves into poverty, but it does ask them to \npay something in addition to the copay. Each American who voluntarily \nsigns up for this bill will pay $25 per year. In terms of discounted \nprices, a discount card, and an insurance policy against catastrophic \nillness, $25 is a well priced policy.\n\n  Finally, with this, every senior can expect, as I indicated before, \nsomewhere between 20 percent to 35 percent of the cost of each of their \ndrugs to flow to them in a discount. That is because we are using the \ndelivery system--as all Republicans, or nearly all the Republicans, \nalready voted on--in the Hagel-Ensign bill.\n  The Graham-Smith amendment would allow all employer-sponsored plans, \nthe Medicare supplemental plan, the Medicare+Choice plan, \npharmaceutical benefit managers, PBMs, pharmacies, and even States \nworking with private companies to compete to deliver the benefits. This \nmarket-based competition, which so many of my Republican colleagues \nhave already supported, will generate lower prices for all of our \nseniors.\n  Another provision we took from the Hagel-Ensign bill--a provision \nthat was critical if this was to win my support--which all of my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle have already supported, was the \nHagel-Ensign formulary language.\n  When I first talked to Senator Graham about this, I told him my \nreluctance to vote for his bill in the first instance was, in large \nmeasure, over the formulary issue because, as set out in the bill \npreviously before us, it essentially took 90 percent of current \nprescription drugs available to seniors and said they are not available \nunder this plan. So 10 percent of available drugs, in my view, is too \nrestrictive.\n  While under the Hagel-Ensign language there is a formulary which is a \npart of this bill, we make no such restriction, but leave to the \nexperts the ability to make a more liberal formulary plan that will \nserve the health needs of our seniors. We did not want to limit drug \nchoices for seniors. I think this is an important part of this bill \nthat ought to attract the support of many of my colleagues.\n  Americans across the country are asking for our help. There are \nAmericans who cannot afford to wait one more year because we have been \nunwilling to compromise on a prescription drug plan. This is our last \nchance to keep this process moving forward. I need 60 votes, America \nneeds 60 votes on this bill, because seniors deserve more than lip \nservice from the Senate. They deserve a prescription drug benefit from \nthe U.S. Government--and a process and a plan that build on what we \nalready have at a cost we can afford, at a cost that allows seniors to \nbe included, and in a way that seniors themselves can afford this plan \nas well.\n  It is critical that we do this now, so that during the August recess \nwe stop the haggling over whether we have a bill in the Senate, but get \nsomething to conference so that we can work out with the House and the \nWhite House the kind of bill that ultimately will win the support and \nthe hearts and the minds of the American people.\n  I say to all of my friends in this body--whether you are a Republican \nor Democrat, whether you like this bill or not--it is the last train \nleaving the station, in my view. It has enough in it that ought to \nattract your support because it keeps the train moving instead of \nderailing it, to the great disadvantage and harm of the senior citizens \nof this country.\n  I plead with you for your support. If we can get it up and get past \n60 votes, we can make amendments. We can make improvements. Then we \nwill get to the House of Representatives and a conference, and to the \nkind of product that ultimately can pass muster for the White House, \nthe House, and all of us.\n  I thank you for the time. I plead with my colleagues: Don't lose this \nopportunity.\n  I ask for their votes and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 37 years ago today President Lyndon \nJohnson traveled to Independence, MO, to the home of Harry Truman to \nsign Medicare into law. In signing the bill, LBJ said:\n  No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of \nmodern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings \nthat they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they may \nenjoy dignity in their later years. . . .\n  No longer will young families see their own incomes, and their own \nhopes, eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral \nobligations to their parents, to their uncles, and their aunts.\n  Medicare, he stated, would provide light and hope to older Americans \n``fearing the terrible darkness of despair and poverty.''\n  To a remarkable degree, Medicare has fulfilled that promise.\n  But today the high cost of prescription drugs, combined with seniors' \nincreasing need for such drugs, is once again destroying the life \nsavings and threatening dignity and security of millions of older \nAmericans.\n  We have debated many important questions over the last 2 weeks, but \nthe fundamental question facing us is, Are we willing to work together \nconstructively to renew the promise of Medicare? Or will we refuse to \nhelp even the most hard-pressed seniors with prescription drugs?\n  We have considered three very different plans so far. The bill I \nsupported, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill, was the only true Medicare \nprescription drug benefit among the three plans. It would have created \na guaranteed Medicare prescription benefit for all seniors. It included \nreasonable premiums of $25 a month. It included affordable copays of \n$10 for generic prescriptions and $40 for brand name ones.\n\n  Our Senate Republican colleagues offered a very different plan, not a \nguaranteed Medicare benefit. It would have forced seniors into HMOs to \nget prescription drug coverage and given HMOs billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer subsidies and seniors' premiums to entice them to offer \nseniors a prescription drug plan.\n  There were no guarantees. HMOs and insurance companies would decide \nwho gets prescription drug coverage, what coverage is included, and how \nmuch it costs. The plan used accounting gimmicks to hide huge costs to \nseniors. A coverage gap meant millions of seniors would have no \ncoverage at all over a period beyond a few hundred dollars, even if \nthey continued paying premiums. A new $10 copay for home health visits \nwas also required. But basically and fundamentally their premise was \nthat HMOs could deliver prescription drug benefits and all health care \nbetter than Medicare.\n  Well, HMOs don't even exist for the most part in South Dakota and \nrural States. In areas where they do exist, HMOs have proven to be a \npoor fit with health needs of seniors. More and more HMOs are pulling \nout of Medicare+Choice. Many that are not leaving the program have \ndramatically cut benefits or increased premiums or both.\n  Two fundamentally different plans, one fundamental similarity: \nNeither plan got 60 votes. Our proposal, the Medicare benefit, got 52 \nvotes, a majority of the Senate. Their plan to create pharmaceutical \nHMOs received 49 votes.\n\n[[Page S7539]]\n\n  But still, we didn't give up. The Hagel-Ensign bill was offered, and \nfor the first time Medicare would have linked seniors' benefits to \ntheir incomes, which was a major concession. The Hagel-Ensign bill did \nnot get 60 votes either.\n  Now we are considering a fourth proposal, the Graham-Smith amendment. \nIt is not the comprehensive coverage that Democrats all voted for, but \nit is an important first step. The Graham-Smith proposal offers real \nprotection for every senior for just $25 a year. Let me emphasize, $25 \na year. Seniors get up to a 30-percent discount on all prescriptions, \ncoverage against catastrophic expenses over $3,300 a year. Low- and \nmoderate-income seniors would receive extra help. The program would pay \nfor all of their benefits for just a small copay on prescriptions of $2 \nfor generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs.\n  CBO predicts that the Graham-Smith proposal would result in few or no \nemployers dropping retirees prescription coverage, versus an estimated \none-third of seniors who would have lost benefits under the Republican \nplan.\n  I have to say that the two Senators responsible for this plan deserve \na great deal of credit for their persistence, for their effort to come \nup, yet again, with another approach, with a recognition that perhaps \nthere are those unwilling to spend more than about $400 billion in \nresources on a drug plan. They have come up with a way to address \nhealth benefits for all seniors, yet recognizing the limited resources \nwe have to do so. I don't know that you could come up with a better \nframework than the one they have proposed.\n  I will say this: I met a woman in Mitchell, SD, a few weeks ago when \nI was home in Mitchell. Her name is Margaret McBrayer. She is 75 years \nold. She and her husband raised 11 children. Since 1956, she has had 21 \nsurgeries, 3 aneurisms, and 1 stroke. She takes 11 prescriptions a day. \nHer average prescription costs are $814 a month, if she takes all brand \nnames. If she uses generic brands, she can still spend $625 a month, \ntwo-thirds of her total monthly income.\n  Medicaid used to pay all but $2 per month per prescription. But this \npast February, Mrs. McBrayer lost her husband to bone cancer. She also \nlost her Medicaid coverage. As a widow, rather than half of a couple, \nher income is now too high for Medicaid--less than $12,000 a year, but \ntoo high for help.\n  So Margaret McBrayer is left to figure out how to pay for her own \nprescriptions. Her children help, but she is worried that they will end \nup spending all of their retirement savings on her prescription drugs, \ntoo.\n  Some doctors who know Margaret McBrayer call her ``the Miracle \nWoman'' because of all the health difficulties she has overcome, and \nthe courage and dignity with which she has done it.\n  Fortunately, it doesn't require a miracle for us to help her--and \nMedicare's 40 million other beneficiaries--with the high cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  The reason LBJ traveled to Independence 37 years ago today to sign \nthe Medicare bill was to honor Harry Truman--the man who had begun the \nfight for medical insurance for seniors 20 years earlier.\n  In his remarks that day, LBJ said Americans loved Harry Truman not \nbecause he gave 'em hell, but because he gave people hope.\n  We can walk away from this effort and give each other hell--blame \neach other for failure--or we can accept good-faith compromise and give \nthe American people hope, and continue working to provide an \naffordable, reliable prescription benefit for all seniors. the choice \nis in our hands this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in support of this very important downpayment on a \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  First, I commend my friend, the senior Senator from Florida, for his \ntremendous leadership on the comprehensive proposal that received 52 \nvotes, as well as this proposal to move it forward in the right \ndirection. He has been a stalwart. I commend Senator Graham and his \nstaff, who have worked very hard in pulling all this together. Also, I \nthank Senator Smith of Oregon for his willingness to step forward in a \nbipartisan way and work with us to do what can be done.\n  As has been indicated, we had two competing proposals put forward \nlast week, with very different philosophies--one with a private sector \ninsurance company, HMO model; the other with a model to expand Medicare \nas we know it today. One, the Medicare expansion effort, received 52 \nvotes. The other, private insurance, received 48 votes. Neither one had \nthe 60 votes that are necessary to make this law and move it forward.\n  So we went back to the drawing board and, as is true in this great \ndemocracy of ours when you are not able to get exactly what you would \nlike to see happen, you listen to people and you find a way to move \nforward, to take a step forward in the right direction.\n  That is what this amendment is. This is a downpayment on \ncomprehensive coverage. It is a step in the right direction. It will \nlower prices for all of our seniors. Every person who is on Medicare \nwill see the prices, the costs, of their prescription drugs going down. \nThat is important.\n  I also mention that the underlying bill, and the efforts we have been \nusing to add more competition, will lower prices for everyone, whether \nyou are in business, a farmer, a worker, or part of a family struggling \nwith prices. The goal is to bring down prices for everyone.\n  This amendment addresses specifically those on Medicare. It has been \nsaid that the promise was made 37 years ago today that we would provide \nfor older Americans and the disabled universal health coverage; they \nwould know that health insurance, health coverage, was there for them. \nUnfortunately, because the way we provide health care has changed, that \npromise has been eroded; so we are trying to fix that, trying to \nmodernize Medicare so it covers the way health insurance is covered \ntoday.\n  This amendment begins that process. It says to those in the category \nof up to 200 percent of poverty--and in my home State of Michigan, that \ninvolves 46 percent of Michigan's beneficiaries who are on Medicare--46 \npercent of Michiganians on Medicare will find that, without a monthly \npremium, without a deductible, with a very small copay of $2, or up to \n$5, they can receive the prescription they need, the medicine they \nneed. No longer will they have to choose between food and medicine and \npaying the rent or paying the electric bill.\n  So we have accomplished one goal in this amendment right off the bat, \nwhich is making sure that those with the greatest need are not having \nto choose between the daily necessities of life and getting their \ncritical medicine.\n  We then said that for everybody else, we want to make sure we start \nthis downpayment with a discount. That discount will fall somewhere \nbetween 20 and 30 percent of the cost of a prescription. That is a good \ndiscount to begin the process of lowering prices and creating the kinds \nof prescription drug coverage that people need and deserve.\n\n  Then we have said that, for a simple $25 annual fee--I might say, \nthis is not per month, per week, it is just once a year for $25--you \ncan become part of an insurance policy that says once your out-of-\npocket costs equal $3,300 for your prescriptions, you will then be able \nto get your costs covered. There will be, I believe, a small copay \ninvolved. But we are talking about the ability for people to--with a \nminimum of $10--be able to get coverage for any prescription drugs \nabove $3,300 out of pocket a year.\n  This is a major insurance policy. There are many seniors who are \npaying $400 or $500, and some are paying more. I have read stories from \nconstituents paying $700 or $800 a month, who are literally selling \ntheir homes, losing their retirement, and are not able to get the \nmedications they need for cancer, for heart conditions, for diabetes, \nfor a variety of other serious ailments. For them, we are saying that \nyou are not going to have to go through that. We will put in place a \nmaximum amount that someone has to spend out of pocket, and, beyond \nthat, they are going to have their prescription drugs\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\ncovered. That is very important for those who are the sickest in the \ncountry.\n  So we have addressed both of those aspects--those who are struggling \nto meet the daily needs of life, those who are the sickest and have the \nhighest bills and are finding themselves in extremely difficult \nsituations. We are also making sure that everyone is getting their \nprices lowered through substantial discounts.\n  We have also guaranteed there are no new State costs, and we have \naddressed a number of other issues raised by colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. I simply say again that this is a critical day to get \nsomething done.\n  You know, there are those who have accused folks on both sides of the \naisle of playing politics, of just wanting to have an issue, of not \nwanting to get things done. Well, if that were the case, the votes were \ntaken last week, the issues have been laid out. If that were all this \nwere about, we would have ended it. But we know that people expect more \nfrom us. They are tired of talk, tired of another election coming \naround, with everybody talking about the high prices of prescription \ndrugs and the need to modernize Medicare and still nothing getting \ndone.\n  So this is an effort on both sides of the aisle to bring people \ntogether and do what we can do, to do the achievable, make the \ndownpayment, to take the first step.\n  I hope we do not lose this opportunity. I believe this is a very \nimportant day--in fact, a historic day--for all of us, and hopefully we \nare going to see colleagues wanting to come together and showing \nleadership on both sides of the aisle to make an important step forward \nto begin to modernize what has been a great American success story \ncalled Medicare.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to be very brief because \nSenator Mikulski and others wish to speak as well. I actually did not \ncome with prepared remarks, but I do have a bit to say about my State \nof Minnesota. I will make one or two points and then thank some of my \ncolleagues for their fine work.\n  There are 644,000 Minnesotans enrolled in Medicare. By the way, one \nof the reasons I am glad of what we are doing as part of the Medicare \nframework is that Medicare was an enormous step forward, not just for \nsenior citizens but for our country. Senior citizens means we are \ntalking about our parents or grandparents.\n  For my mother and father, who never made a lot of money, Medicare \nmade an enormous difference. Both of them have passed away. Both had \nParkinson's disease. My father had advanced Parkinson's disease. \nMedicare was a huge step forward.\n  A second factor, if you will, is the median income of senior citizens \nand the disabled enrolled in Medicare is $15,173 in Minnesota.\n  There is this stereotype about how you have all of these high-income \nsenior citizens who are playing all the swank golf courses around the \ncountry. The fact of the matter is, the income profile of senior \ncitizens is not that high. It certainly is not in my State. It \ncertainly is not for the Medicare enrollees.\n  The impact of this amendment is 644,000 beneficiaries and 258,000 \nMinnesotans--that is 40 percent of the population--with incomes below \n200 percent of poverty are going to be eligible and will receive all \nthe needed drugs for nominal copayments. I do not have such \nintellectual distance from this issue that I think this is \ninsignificant. That is important. That is very important.\n\n  Mr. President, 386,000 Medicare beneficiaries will be receiving the \ndiscount which could go from 20 to 30 percent. That is the estimate. \nThen finally, 119,000 senior citizens and disabled Medicare \nbeneficiaries will benefit from the catastrophic coverage, and that is \nthe catastrophic stop-loss protection.\n  Of course, it is an insurance policy that means a lot to people who \nworry: My God, we are going to go under because of catastrophic \nexpenses.\n  I have two or three points to make. The first one is--and I hope \nSenator Graham, Senator Smith, and Senator Lincoln, who have done so \nmuch work on this legislation, believe me--I would far prefer to have a \nbroader, more inclusive piece of legislation. Senator Stabenow, who is \nleaving the Chamber, has also done tremendous work. I say to Senator \nStabenow, I am sorry I did not mention her name from the go.\n  I would rather this legislation be much broader in scope of coverage, \nno question about it. We had a bill before us earlier, the Graham-\nMiller bill, on which we received 52 votes, but we did not get 60 \nvotes. By the budget rules, we were not able to pass it.\n  We are trying to get 60 votes to pass legislation that will be a \nfirst installment. We have to do more. We have to have coverage of all \nrecipients. It has to be broader coverage, and we know that. We are \ntrying to make sure we get something done that is concrete and makes a \npositive difference in the lives of people. That is why we are here as \nlegislators. That is what this effort is about. That is why it deserves \n60 votes. That is my first point.\n  My second point is, if I have my way--I guess I get to say it once \nbecause I am not going to have my way with this proposal, and this \nwould get not 60 votes, I say to Senator Graham, but far fewer--I would \nhave more cost containment so we could cover more people. I still \nbelieve--and I want to do a careful examination of how CBO makes some \nof its analyses--Health and Human Services ought to say to the \npharmaceutical industry that has been making these huge what I call \nViagra-like profits over the years: We represent 40 million Medicare \nrecipients; we want a discount; we want the best price; we want what \nyou give in Canada; we want the price you give to veterans.\n  We can get the prices down and cover a lot more people. Someday we \nare going to get to this whole question of cost containment because \nthat is where this is heading ultimately.\n  My last point is, if you take this Graham-Smith initiative--and I \nthank all colleagues. I have been in some of the meetings. I cannot \nimagine the zillions of hours they have been in meetings. I have been \nin plenty of discussions.\n  If we add this to drug reimportation, albeit a little weakened on the \nfloor of the Senate, and we add access to generic drugs, then we have \nthis amendment and the Stabenow amendment that enables States to do \nbetter by way of Medicaid and by way of providing a discount for people \nwho do not have any health insurance coverage at all for prescription \ndrugs--if we put that package together, I would call this a significant \nfirst step. It is a first step only, but it is an important one. It \nmakes a difference for people. Then we are going to have to build on it \nand do better in the future.\n  Last point--I promised that four points ago--I hope this gets 60 \nvotes. I think it should. I think it is obviously an effort to stay \nunder this $400 billion. That is another issue that drives me nuts. I \nam so glad I did not vote for these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts. \nThey have eroded the revenue base and have made it impossible for us to \nmake investments in education and health care. We are stuck now with \nthis arbitrary number to keep it under $400 billion. We have done that.\n  We have tried to bring people together. We have tried to have a \nbipartisan initiative. We need 60 votes. I hope colleagues will vote \nfor this so we can move forward. As for the naysaying--I am opposed; I \ndo not like it; I do not want it--enough. Let's pass this and then \nimprove it and then leave with legislation of which we can be proud as \nan important first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today I thought very long and hard making up my mind \nwith respect to the legislation we are presently debating. I tell my \ncolleagues that I am going to support the Graham-Stabenow plan.\n  The reason I am going to support this benefit is that it provides \ncatastrophic coverage for those who have drug bills over $3,300 a year. \nFor a $25 annual fee, it will provide catastrophic coverage for those \nwho have prescription drug bills over $3,300 a year. This is absolutely \nessential to those seniors who have illnesses that cause them to pay \nthis tremendous amount of money and who fear they could lose their life \nsavings just to stay alive.\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\n  This benefit also provides a comprehensive benefit for seniors with \nmeager incomes. For the middle class, it provides a discount, ranging \nfrom 20 to 30 percent, plus a 5-percent subsidy.\n  This bill has three parts to it: Catastrophic coverage, which I \nreally like; help for those with meager incomes, which I think is a \nnational necessity; and discounts for those in the middle class.\n  For those who worked very hard on this bill, I salute them. It is a \nbeginning. It is the first step. It is a downpayment on a comprehensive \ndrug coverage. But it cannot be the only step.\n  Today we are giving the middle-class seniors a discount card, but we \ncannot discount the middle class.\n  They are the ones who are going to get squeezed between shrinking \nsavings and rising prescription costs, and they are the ones I will \nfight to help.\n  I think about ordinary Americans, those in manufacturing whose jobs \nare either on a fast track to Mexico or a slow boat to China, where \nthey are afraid their companies, like my steelworkers, are going to go \ninto bankruptcy and they are going to lose their pension, they are \ngoing to lose their health care. Then I think about the retail clerks \nwho work in little shops, many of whom are in Baltimore, and in my \nlittle rural communities. Many of them work for 25 or 30 years, barely \nmaking the minimum wage, and though they had some savings, they are now \njust over the line in terms of qualifying for the benefit. Yet at the \nsame time, we are going to give them a discount. I could go through \nexample after example.\n  My preference was expressed last week when we voted for a universal \nMedicare coverage bill, one that was under Medicare, covered all \nseniors, no means testing, no deductibles, and modest copays. I \nsupported that plan without reservation. We got 52 votes, a majority of \nthe Senate, but we have a new Senate now, and the majority is not good \nenough. We now need to have a supermajority, or 60 votes, to waive the \nBudget Act. We did not get those last eight votes because some of my \ncolleagues thought the benefit was too expensive to provide a universal \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Last year, many of those same colleagues who now say we do not have \nthe wallet, were the first in line to pass excessive tax cuts. Those \ntax cuts went to the top 1 percent. Those who got it did not need it, \nand it certainly did not help the economy. When we were deliberating \nthose tax bills last year, I knew this year would come. I knew we would \ncome to the point where we would not have enough revenue to pass a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I am really agitated about this because for many years, particularly \nworking with President Bill Clinton, we exercised fiscal discipline. I \npersonally worked for balanced budgets. I worked very hard to create a \nsurplus, the first surpluses since the Johnson administration. Why did \nI work so hard? I mended old ways and old habits. Well, I worked \nbecause I knew it was going to be good for the economy and that also \none day we would need it for a prescription drug coverage.\n  Instead, Congress gave the tax cut to the wealthiest, those who live \noff of expense accounts, while I worry about the middle class who have \nto live off a budget.\n  So we cannot afford it? I am not so sure about it because when we \nhave the will, we often find the wallet. Today is not the day where we \nare going to be able to find that wallet. I believe with the \ncatastrophic coverage for those with the situation over $3,300, we do \ntake a very important step. I think the sensitivity to those meager \nincomes is what we in America should be all about.\n  For the middle class, we get them started, but we need to let them \nknow we have to be able to do more.\n  The limited coverage bill that I am supporting today is not \neverything I wanted, but it does give seniors peace of mind that an \nillness with huge drug bills will not push them into financial ruin. \nFor that $25 annual fee, there will be catastrophic coverage.\n  For some time, the whole issue of the consequences of health care has \nbeen an obsession of mine. I know the costs of long-term care. I know \nthat when I came to this Senate the cost of nursing home care was \nenormously expensive, but to qualify for Government help under Medicaid \nfamilies often had to push themselves into family bankruptcy, couples \nmade out better if they divorced, or seniors were forced to spend down \ntheir savings to get help for nursing home care. Widows were \nimpoverishing themselves so their husbands could qualify for Medicaid \nand nursing home care. I said then, as I say now, I believe in family \nand personal responsibility but not family bankruptcy because of the \ncruel rules of Government. The cruel rules of Government should not \nforce people into family impoverishment.\n\n  When it came to long-term care, I wrote something called the Spousal \nAnti-Impoverishment Act. I made sure the senior could keep the home or \nthe family farm and some savings to get help when a spouse was in a \nnursing home. That was a very important step. I hope we can do more.\n  Today, seniors are worried about going broke for their prescriptions. \nThis limited coverage will help lift that fear and ease the burden of \nmany seniors. For that catastrophic coverage alone, this bill is worth \nvoting for.\n  In closing, later on this week the Senate will be voting on \nlegislation to defend the homeland. It is called homeland security. But \nI ask, What does the ``homeland'' stand for and what are we trying to \nmake secure?\n  I absolutely salute our military, law enforcement, and intelligence \nagencies that are working against terrorism, but I have senior citizens \nliving in terror of whether they can afford their prescription drugs.\n  I believe not only in universal freedom, I believe in universal \npublic education, and universal health care for seniors. If we want \nAmericans to live free from fear, we need to take the fear away of \nlosing their savings and not keeping up with the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Today is a downpayment. We must do more. I intend to vote for \nthis bill today and return to find other alternatives later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich I have been proud to promote over the last couple of weeks. I \nwant to especially thank Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Senator \nGordon Smith for their leadership in drafting this amendment. The hours \nand the patience that they have put into this is forthcoming in what we \nhave been able to produce.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Bingaman for his \nguiding vision and the eloquence with which he first offered this \nproposal to our colleagues in meetings last week, and to Senator Debbie \nStabenow. If we could harness the kind of energy, dedication, and \ncommitment that Senator Stabenow has for our seniors in providing them \na quality prescription drug benefit, we would certainly be doing our \njob for the benefit of the seniors in this country.\n  I also thank Senator Feinstein who has been very instrumental in \nmaking sure that we do not adjourn without helping low-income seniors \nand those with the highest drug costs. This amendment is the product of \nmany long hours of discussions among many of these Senators and so many \nothers who bridge the spectrum of political philosophies in this body, \nand I believe that it represents the deliberative process envisioned by \nour forefathers for what the Senate was intended to do.\n  Through this debate, I have been firm in my conviction that we must \nhelp as many seniors as possible this year--not next year, not the year \nafter, but this year. This amendment allows us to help everyone while \nproviding the most help to the neediest and the sickest.\n  We have had two opportunities to vote on more expansive prescription \ndrug packages, and I was pleased to support an amendment offered by \nSenators Graham and Miller that would have done far more for our \nseniors. Regrettably, that package did not garner the 60 votes needed \nto overcome a Senate procedural rule. So we stand today with a new \nopportunity that I believe offers the best hope for Arkansas seniors.\n  I have said all along we must help the neediest and the sickest of \nour seniors and provide drugs at a reduced cost for those in between. I \nam not willing to tell seniors, who spend more than $3,300 a year on \ndrugs, that we\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\ncannot help them this year. I am not willing to tell the seniors who \nstruggle to live on less than $1,500 a month for their rent, groceries, \nutility, and health care costs that we cannot help them this year. So I \nam proud to support this amendment, which will ensure that seniors who \nare at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level will get \nprescription drugs through Medicare.\n  For all seniors who spend more than $3,300 a year on drugs, I want to \nbe able to say to those seniors: Stop worrying. The Government will \ncover the rest of your prescription drug costs with a minimal copay.\n  What does this mean for the seniors of Arkansas? It means a great \ndeal. Under this plan, one of every two seniors in Arkansas will have \nall of their prescription drug costs covered under Medicare with a \nminimal copayment. There will not be any additional paperwork as part \nof this program, and there will not be fees to enter the program. If \nyou are on Medicare, you can be automatically enrolled in the \nprescription drug program. That should be welcome news for the 56 \npercent of Arkansas seniors whose annual income is below the 200 \npercent of poverty level.\n  For those individuals who have annual incomes above $17,720 and those \ncouples whose income is over $23,880, there is also a benefit. In \naddition to the peace of mind that will come from knowing the \nGovernment will cover drug costs that exceed $3,300 a year, these \nseniors will also benefit from drug discounts negotiated by the \nGovernment and a 5-percent subsidy. Drug costs could be reduced by as \nmuch as 30 percent.\n  I wish we could do more for this group of seniors, and I publicly \npledge to keep pushing until we have done so. Is it an ideal benefit? \nNo, but it is a start. I have always said in this body that legislation \nis not a work of art; it is a work in progress. That is what this body \nwas intended to do, to deliberate and work through these issues to come \nup with a solution.\n  Last week's votes were like a flashing neon sign declaring it is not \npossible to get a more generous drug benefit this year. A 5-percent \nsubsidy negotiated drug discount and a catastrophic benefit for middle- \nand high-income seniors is better than no benefit at all, especially \nconsidering the ever increasing costs of prescription drugs, an issue \nwe will have to address. We will have to continue to address the ever \nincreasing costs of prescription drugs in the years to come and the \ncost of what it is going to mean to us and the seniors of this Nation.\n  We must also remember and never underestimate, with the out-of-pocket \nlimit for all seniors in this proposal, we will be providing for the \ninitiative to bring down the costs of employer-sponsored plans, as well \nas any supplemental plans, such as Medigap or others. That is a real \nsavings and a benefit to all of these individuals who need prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  I thank John and Betty Scroggins of Monticello, AR, who took the time \nover a series of phone calls with my staff to share their health care \nstruggles. The Scroggins are now retired. They worked all of their \nlives driving trucks. After they pay their drug bill each month, they \nhave less than $1,000 to cover utilities, groceries, and other living \nexpenses. For John and Betty, under this plan, the Government will pay \nfor all of their prescription drugs with a minimal copay.\n  I also thank Lila Lee Moore, a volunteer social worker at a health \ncare clinic in Little Rock, who told me about a couple whose Social \nSecurity income is $1,100 a month but their drug costs exceed $800 a \nmonth.\n  I also send a very special thank you to 18-year-old Jessica Mann of \nJonesboro, AR, who wrote asking me to help her grandparents who \nstruggle just to make ends meet due to the high cost of medical care \nand prescription drug medicines.\n  Jessica said: I believe that when people such as my grandparents have \nworked hard their whole lives, they deserve a better and less worrisome \ntime in their retirement years. They have given so much to make it \nbetter for my generation, please help us to make it better for theirs.\n  Each of these people have helped me form the template against which I \nhave measured these prescription drug proposals. The amendment before \nthe Senate helps meet these needs. We are talking about moving forward \non behalf of the seniors of this Nation, not saying, once again, that \nwe are going to put it off for another year or another day, but that we \nare bound and determined to do what we can to make each and every one \nof their lives a little bit better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the Senate \nmove forward in the efforts on behalf of the seniors of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank my colleague and friend for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am here to support my \ncolleague from Florida and to thank him for his leadership, which has \nbeen bipartisan in nature. It reflects the bipartisan yearning and \ndesire of the people of this country, and particularly of our State.\n  Most people understand that Florida has a higher percentage of those \nover age 65 than the rest of the country. That is true. But wherever \nyou are, age 65 and older, there are seniors who are facing choices in \nthe year 2002 that seniors should not have to face. The choice that \nmany seniors have to face is: Do I buy groceries or do I buy medicine?\n  It is unimaginable to me that in this land of plenty, in this time of \nabundance, in this land of beneficence, in this land of great \ngenerosity, that we have among us, the generation that we owe so much \nto, our seniors, the generation that has built the strong economy upon \nwhich all now enjoy, the generation that has reestablished and secured \nthe freedoms with which each of us participate in each day and \nsometimes takes for granted, it is unimaginable to me in the year 2002 \nthat of that great generation there are those who would have to make a \nchoice--because they cannot afford it--between buying groceries to eat \nand the medicine they need on a daily basis.\n  Why are we trying to do what we are trying to do? It is because \nMedicare was set up 37 years ago when health care was centered around \nacute care in hospitals. If Medicare had not been set up in 1965, but \ninstead, if we were designing a system which would take care of senior \ncitizens by designing a health insurance plan funded by the Federal \nGovernment for senior citizens, would we include prescription drugs? \nThe answer is, obviously, yes, because prescription drugs are so much a \npart of our health care today, so much a part of our quality of life, \nso much a part of the miracles of modern medicine that give us a \ngreater quality of life. So if that is how we would design it, and yet \nit was designed 37 years ago, should we not modernize that system? The \nanswer to that is, obviously, yes.\n  Then it comes to a question of cost. And if the cost is such that we \ncannot get through this Senate because we have to operate with 60 out \nof 100 votes in order to pass anything, and we got to 52 votes with \nSenator Graham's and Senator Miller's amendment--that was a much more \ncomprehensive plan than trying to find a plan that we can fashion, that \nwe can get 60 votes to get it through this Chamber, this is what we \nhave come up with. Some would say it has two prongs, but it really has \nthree. There is the one that would take care of the most poor; i.e., it \nwould take care of those up to 200 percent of the poverty level. They \nwould have a fully funded Medicare prescription drug benefit. It would \nalso take care of those the most sick. It would take care of the most \npoor and the most sick, the most sick being those stricken by a \ncatastrophe, who have to spend a lot of money out of pocket. When they \nget to a certain level, a level in excess of $3,000 out of pocket, the \nFederal Government is going to take care of that, and, indeed, you are \ngoing to be able to buy that protection for $25 a year. That is called \ncatastrophic coverage, and that is a pretty good deal.\n\n  There is a third element, or prong, to this amendment. Those who \nwould detract from this amendment would say it doesn't take care of the \nmiddle class. It certainly doesn't take care of the middle class as \nmuch as the original amendment offered by Senators Graham and Miller, \nbut of course that costs a lot of money. What does this do\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\nfor the middle class besides the catastrophic coverage for $25? It has \na system in place that will have discounts up to 30 percent of the cost \nof those drugs, through a system designed to use bulk buying, plus an \nadditional 5-percent reduction by virtue of a Federal subsidy.\n  So it takes care of the most needy--that is, the poorest--by taking \ncare of those with incomes up to 200 percent of the poverty level. It \ntakes care of the most sick--when we have a catastrophic illness--for \n$25 a year, for anything out of pocket over something just in excess of \n$3,000 per year it takes care of that. And for everybody else it \nclearly reduces the price, up to 30 percent plus another 5-percent \nsubsidy.\n  That is not everything we want. That is not a total across-the-board \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. But it is clearly a step in \nthe right direction so we go about doing what we need to be doing: \nModernizing Medicare that was set up 37 years ago.\n  That is why I rise to add my voice to the support for this amendment \nand encourage its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to make a couple of comments--I \nwill not be that long--on the pending business, prescription drugs. It \nwas said before that this is sort of a unique day in the sense that \nthis is the 37th anniversary of the signing of the Medicare Act back in \n1965. What we did in 1965 was unique. It was very important. It was \nvery special. What we did in 1965, with Medicare, was to say: We are \ngoing to establish a Medicare Program for our Nation's seniors that is \ngoing to be comprehensive. It is going to cover all seniors. It is \ngoing to be universal, in the sense that all seniors will be eligible \nfor the same benefits under the Medicare Program. So we had a program \nthat said to every senior: We are going to cover you. Regardless of \nwhere you live, regardless of your status in life, you are going to be \ncovered for hospital care and other related conditions as well.\n  We should have, at that time, added prescription drugs. Congress did \nnot. Prescription drugs were not as important in 1965 as a hospital bed \nwas in 1965. So Congress, in its wisdom, at that time said we are going \nto provide comprehensive coverage for hospitals, and later on it became \nalso coverage for doctors and physicians as well.\n  The unique feature about that bill is that it covered everybody and \nit treated everybody equally. I think when you look at a proposal we \nhave before us today that says this program is going to be \nfundamentally changed. In the sense that it is no longer universal, it \nis no longer comprehensive, we are going to pick and choose who gets \nwhat, and different people who are eligible for Medicare will get \ndifferent things--I think that is fundamentally breaking faith with the \nAmerican people who, when they look at Medicare, think of it as being \nuniversal and comprehensive. That is the first mistake.\n  Many people who talked about the tripartisan bill--some of our \ncolleagues on the floor, some in the private sector--said we don't like \nthe tripartisan bill because it has a gap. They called it a doughnut. \nThe gap in the tripartisan bill was between $3,450 worth of drug \nexpenses and $3,700 of prescription drug expenses. If you were poor, \nyou still got your drugs taken care of through that gap, but if you \nwere not under 150 percent of poverty, you did not get coverage in that \nrelatively small gap between $3,150 and $3,700. Why? Because of the \nextreme cost associated with covering even that small gap.\n  The point I made is that many people who were critical of the \ntripartisan bill said: You have a gap, so we can't support it. If we \nhad a gap, this plan has a canyon, because it says to the Nation's \nseniors: If you are under 200 percent of poverty, we will cover your \ndrugs, but if you make one dollar more, you are in a different \ncategory.\n  I think the figures I have seen indicate it is approximately $17,720 \nof income as an individual. I think is the number. But if you make one \ndollar more than 200 percent of poverty, you are in a totally different \ncategory, you are in a category that says you have to pay about 95 \npercent of the drug costs. Ninety-five percent of the drug costs? What \nkind of help are we giving to someone who makes one dollar above 200 \npercent of poverty?\n  One of the charts I saw said 70 percent of seniors are over 200 \npercent of poverty. Are we going to say to that group of seniors: \nSomehow you are going to be treated differently than anyone else the \nGovernment treats under Medicare because you make one dollar more than \n200 percent of poverty? You are going to be required to pay 95 percent, \nand the Federal Government will pick up 5 percent of your drug costs? \nIs that fair? That is not what we did in 1965 when we said everybody \nwould have comprehensive, universal coverage and access to a health \ncare plan.\n\n  That is not an insignificant number of people you are talking about. \nI looked at some of the statistics with regard to how many people you \nare talking about. In my State--and my State is a poor State--it is \nabout 230,000 people making over 200 percent of poverty. What am I \ngoing to tell the seniors in Louisiana: If you are poor, you are going \nto get all this help, but if you make one dollar more, excuse me, you \nare out of luck?\n  What are they going to say? They are going to say: I paid taxes all \nmy life, I worked hard all my life, but now, for the first time under \nMedicare, you are going to treat me differently than anybody else? My \nState is a poor State, and 230,000 people would fit into that category \nof being outside of 200 percent of poverty.\n  Now I have the numbers. In the United States, nationwide--these are \nthe numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation--there are about \n18,450,000 seniors who are eligible for Medicare who are outside the \n200 percent of poverty--18 million people plus. We are telling those 18 \nmillion-plus seniors they are going to be treated quite differently \nwhen they are called upon to pay 95 percent coinsurance on their \nprescription drugs. Are we telling them that we are giving them \nsomething? We are not giving them what we are giving other parts of our \nsociety who are seniors. These are working people who have paid taxes \nand in their retirement think, if you are going to have a National \nGovernment program, they should be treated like everybody else.\n  The 200 percent of poverty is nice to talk about--how many people we \nare helping. But a substantial portion of the 200 percent under poverty \nare already covered with prescription drugs under the Medicaid Program. \nAt about 75 percent of poverty, you have coverage under Medicare for \nprescription drugs already. They already have prescription drugs under \nthe State Medicaid Program. If you are about 75 percent of poverty, in \nmy State, you are covered for prescription drugs--the poorest of the \npoor.\n  So we are really saying: Between 75 percent of poverty and 200 \npercent of poverty, we are really going to give you a great deal of \nhelp. But if you are over 200 percent of poverty, you are out of luck.\n  They say we have a catastrophic plan. I am all for catastrophic \ncoverage. It should be there. But let's be honest about how many people \nit covers.\n  If you look at $3,300 of catastrophic coverage where the Government \npicks up the lion's share of 90 percent--I take it, in their plan--of \nthe cost of drugs after you reach the $3,300 out-of-pocket costs, how \nmany people is that? I am told approximately 10 percent of the seniors \nare going to have actual out-of-pocket costs of $3,300 and above on an \nannual basis, not including insurance, not including a union package, \nnot including a former employer's package, and not including any \nMedigap coverage they have.\n  If it has to be out of pocket $3,300, you are talking about \napproximately 10 percent of the remaining number of seniors. What do we \nhave? We are spending almost $400 billion, and we are selectively \nsaying some are going to get it, some are not going to get it, and some \nare going to get a little bit more.\n  The tripartisan bill had about $370 billion of Medicare reform, plus \nprescription drugs--$340 billion on prescription drugs. That was \nuniversal and comprehensive and at a $24-a-month premium. It had a $250 \ndeductible and 50 percent coinsurance. Everybody was treated alike. \nEverybody would know what they were going to get and how they were \ngoing to get it.\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\n  Some say: We want a Government-run program. We want private insurance \ncompanies delivering prescription drugs.\n  What are we coming to? It is the exact same system that I have as a \nMember of the Senate and that 9 million other Federal employees have. \nDo you think we do not have a Government-run health program? Of course \nit is a Government-run program. It is run by the Office of Personnel \nManagement--a Federal agency that goes out and solicits bids from \nprivate companies, such as Blue Cross and Aetna, to provide 9 million \nFederal workers with comprehensive, universal health coverage which \nincludes doctors, hospitals, and, yes, it includes prescription drugs.\n  We are talking about saying that these providers who are big, healthy \ninsurance companies ought to assume some risk. Why do we say that? \nBecause if they are doing the providing and they make a bad deal, they \nshould have to pick up the cost of making a bad deal. That is the risk. \nThat is what makes them negotiate with pharmaceutical companies, to get \nthe best possible deal from pharmaceuticals for prescription drugs at \nthe best possible price.\n  If I am a pharmacy benefit manager--so-called PBM--and I have no risk \nother than my contract, why am I worried about what type of price I get \nfor prescription drugs if I know the Government is going to eat the \ncost of anything over what I bid? There is no risk. If there is no \nrisk, there is not going to be any incentive to go out and get the best \npossible deal on prescription drugs.\n  But to get back to the program that we have, some of my colleagues \nsay we have to have a Government-run program. The Government-run \nprogram we have as Federal employees is exactly the same program we \nhave recommended under the tripartisan approach. The Office of Health \nand Human Services' Medicare office would contract. They would do the \napprovals. They would supervise it. They would make sure it was being \nrun properly. They would make sure no one was trying to scam it. And \nthey would make sure that every part of the country had a competitive \nmodel to deliver drugs in their area.\n  Some have said: I am from a rural area. We are not going to have a \nlot of private companies coming to the most rural part of the country. \nWe said: All right, we understand your concern. We will modify our \nbill. We will say that if there is a rural part of the country or any \npart of the country where you do not have private providers competing \nto bring prescription drugs to individuals at the best possible price--\nif that doesn't happen in your area--the Federal Government will do it \njust as under the Graham model. The Federal Government will contract \nwith the PBM. They will have only the management fee at risk when they \nhave that provision for those drugs. And in the most rural areas, you \nwould be guaranteed a Government-run program just like in the Graham \nmodel, if you did not have the private system to be available because \nthey just did not want to go to any part of the country.\n\n  As to the concerns that have been expressed about wanting a \nGovernment-run program, ours is a Government program that utilizes the \nbest of what Government can do combined with the best of what the \nprivate sector can do.\n  Some on their side of the aisle may say we only need a private sector \nprogram. Some on my side of the aisle may say we need a Government-run \nprogram. The answer truly is somewhere in between. You need the best of \nwhat Government can do merged with the best of what the private sector \ncan do in order to get a delivery system that would have Government \noversight, Government supervision, and Government guarantees when the \nprivate sector does not participate to make sure the beneficiaries get \nthe product. That is what the tripartisan bill attempted to do.\n  The final point I will make is that this fight is not over. This \nproposal, our tripartisan proposal, and the previous Graham proposal--\nnone will have had 60 votes. The fact is that we are not going to be \nable to do anything unless we find a way to get 60 votes to provide \nprescription drugs. For the past several years, we have been giving \nseniors excuses. I daresay this time we are going to give them one more \nexcuse.\n  The Republicans will say: It is the Democrats' fault that we didn't \nget this done. The Democrats will say: No. It is the Republicans' fault \nthat we didn't get this done. What we will have given seniors once \nagain is a bucket of excuses. They can't take those excuses to a \ndrugstore and buy one prescription.\n  It is time that we as Members of Congress try to recognize we have to \ncombine the best of ideas from both sides of the aisle and come up with \nan agreement that can get the job done. We are dedicated, and we will \ncontinue to work in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Louisiana leaves the \nfloor, let me just say we have people on both sides of the aisle--\nespecially on this side of the aisle--who look to him for guidance. He \nknows these numbers, having been a member of the Finance Committee as \nlong as he has, and having served in Congress for as long as he has--\nboth in the House and in the Senate. He does commendable work. His work \non this legislation is no different.\n  Mr. President, the Republican leader is going to be here shortly, I \nam told.\n  How long does the Senator from New Mexico wish to speak?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. About 6 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. When the Republican leader shows up, we certainly will----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can't we go back and forth?\n  Mr. REID. I don't know. I guess whoever gets recognized. How much \ntime is the Senator talking about?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. About 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, be recognized \nfor 7 minutes; following that, the Senator from New Mexico be \nrecognized for 6 minutes; and following that, the Senator from Texas be \nrecognized forever.\n  (Laughter.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I see my colleague from Nevada. I ask unanimous consent \nthat he follow Senator Gramm.\n  I ask for the courtesy of both Senator Grassley and Senator \nBingaman--that when the Republican leader appears, they allow us to \nmove forward with an important unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment before \nus. For the third time in as many weeks, a mostly partisan Democrat \nprescription drug bill is about to fail on this floor. And beyond \nfailing here, today's amendment, from what I've heard of it, fails \nseniors and taxpayers as well. I still haven't seen the bill language \nitself. But from what I've heard, it fails seniors because it fails to \ncover most of them. From what we know of the proposal--and we are only \nthis afternoon getting the details--most middle income seniors will get \nnext to nothing when it comes to prescription drug coverage.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have accomplished quite a \nfeat--they have managed to write a Medicare prescription drug proposal \nthat does less with more money. Their proposal provides generous \ncoverage to beneficiaries below 200 percent of poverty. There is \nnothing wrong with that. I agree that scarce resources should be used \nwisely by Congress to target money where it is needed the most.\n  However, their proposal provides almost no assistance to Medicare \nbeneficiaries whose incomes exceed $18,952 a year. A senior at 201 \npercent of poverty will receive no meaningful coverage under the Graham \nproposal until she has spent 17 percent of her income on drugs. A \nmarried couple at 201 percent of poverty will spend 25 percent of their \nannual income on drugs before both gain catastrophic coverage \nprotection. To make matters worse. Three-quarters of seniors above 200 \npercent of poverty have other prescription drug coverage. Since these \nplans cover some drug expenses, and because the Graham plan does not \nhave a basic benefit, these folks will receive no help even if they \nhave total drug expenses over $3,300. A typical senior above 200 \npercent of poverty will receive approximately $6 of assistance every \nmonth\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\ntoward their prescription drug expenses.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has given Graham a preliminary cost \nestimate of $389.5 billion. Keep in mind, though, that CBO did not have \nlegislative language to review at the time they completed their cost \nestimate. So, depending on what legislative language is included in the \nGraham proposal--it could cost more than $400 billion.\n  The tripartisan bill with an official CBO cost estimate of $370 \nbillion provides a solid benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Lower-\nincome enrollees are provided with additional protections, which, as I \nsaid before, is appropriate.\n  What the tripartisan bill has that Graham does not is a significant \ndrug benefit for every single Medicare enrollee. Under our 21st Century \nMedicare Act, enrollees will save on average 50 percent off their drug \nbills. And, lower-income enrollees will see a 95 percent savings in \ntheir drug bills.\n  The Graham bill fails these people. It fails them badly. Indeed, \nthese failures amount to a massive failure for this body. Under Senator \nDaschle's leadership, Democrats and Democrats alone have tried to write \npartisan legislation on the Senate floor time and time again this \nsummer.\n  That has gotten us nowhere. It has led to chaos, to partisanship and, \nas I said just a minute ago, to failure.\n  So, where are we now? It looks like we are ready for another mostly \npartisan vote on a pretty much partisan bill--another vote that will \nfail to get 60 votes, and will fail to give seniors the help they need.\n  We could have been somewhere far different from this. The House \npassed a bill. We could have been in conference with the House at this \npoint. The President wants a bill. We could have been in the Rose \nGarden. Senator Daschle says he wants a bill, but what has taken place \nhere over the last 3 weeks means he really wants something else: an \nissue.\n  Had regular order been followed, had the Finance Committee been given \nthe right to work its bipartisan will, we could have had far more than \njust an issue. We could be far closer to providing real, affordable and \nuniversal prescription drug benefits than we are today. The sponsors of \nthe Tripartisan bill, the only bipartisan bill in all of Washington to \nprovide comprehensive, universal coverage on at a cost that is far \nlower than that in the amendment before us now, were ready and willing \nto talk to anyone about compromises. We still are.\n  But we were denied the right to a markup in the Finance Committee. I \nbelieve that if it had been given the chance to work its will, the \nFinance Committee would have reported out a bipartisan proposal, based \non the tripartisan 21st century Medicare Act we introduced earlier this \nmonth.\n  I've said it before, everyone in this chamber knows that for anything \nof this magnitude to pass--and adding a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare is the single greatest entitlement expansion in history--it \nneeds to get 60 votes.\n  And everyone in this chamber knows that the only way to get 60 votes \nis to have bipartisan support. The proper place to find bipartisan \nsupport is in the Finance Committee, not on the Senate floor.\n  By bypassing the Finance Committee entirely and doing drafting on the \nfloor--literally on the backs of envelopes--the Democrat leadership has \nled us to where we are today: In shambles.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to sweep up the shambles on the \nSenate floor and start over. We can and should do better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement by several organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 29, 2002.\n\nThe Graham-Smith Proposal: Changing the Nature of Medicare is No Way to \n               Celebrate the 37th Anniversary of Medicare\n\n     To: Members of the United States Senate:\n       On June 14, 2002, our organizations sent a letter to \n     Chairmen Tauzin and Thomas in support of their Medicare \n     legislation. We were very clear when we gave our support that \n     our goal was to ensure a voluntary prescription drug benefit \n     which would be available to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n       The Graham-Smith low-income/catastrophic amendment provides \n     complete drug benefits for only the very poor. The Washington \n     Post reports that ``millions of seniors `in the middle' would \n     not qualify for any prescription drug benefits at all under \n     the Graham-Smith legislation.'' In short, the middle class \n     would, in fact, receive no meaningful coverage under the \n     Graham-Smith amendment. This means test violates the \n     fundamental principle of Medicare social insurance that it is \n     a universal program, not an anti-poverty program. It is \n     ironic that on the same day that America's senior celebrate \n     the 37th anniversary of the enactment of Medicare (July 30, \n     1965), the United States Senate will be considering a \n     proposal that takes us a very significant step away from the \n     general entitlement that Medicare has always been.\n       The passage of such legislation would change the nature and \n     intent of America's 37-year-old Medicare program. We \n     respectfully ask you to oppose this amendment and enact \n     meaningful prescription drug coverage which would give all \n     Medicare beneficiaries access, coverage and choice.\n       American Osteopathic Association, Kidney Cancer \n     Association, Cancer Research Institute, Pancreatic Cancer \n     Action Network, Pulmonary Hypertension Association, Center \n     for Patient Advocacy, Endocrinology Associates, National \n     Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7545-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 812\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that later today when the Senate considers the nomination of D. \nBrooks Smith to be a U.S. circuit court judge, there be a time \nlimitation for debate of 4 hours equally divided between the chairman \nand ranking member of the Judiciary Committee; that at the conclusion \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate return to legislative session; \nthat following the vote on final passage of S. 812, the Senate return \nto executive session and vote on confirmation of the nomination; that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table; the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; and the Senate return to \nlegislative session; and that the preceding all occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is also then my intention to invoke \nthe authority given Senator Lott and I last week with regard to DOD. It \nwould be my intention to move immediately to the DOD appropriations \nbill, and we will seek a time agreement on that, perhaps sometime \ntomorrow morning. Let me thank all of our colleagues for their \ncooperation and I certainly thank the distinguished Republican leader.\n  Again, let me outline the schedule, as a result of these unanimous \nconsent agreements, tonight and tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\n  We are now in a position to move shortly to the nomination of D. \nBrooks Smith. There is a 4-hour time agreement that has been allocated \nto that debate. We will then resume consideration of the Graham \namendment tomorrow morning at 9:30. The debate will last an hour and a \nhalf. It is equally divided. There will be a vote on the Graham \namendment, a vote on the Dorgan amendment, as amended, and a vote on \nfinal passage, to be followed by a vote then on the judicial \nnomination.\n  I would then move to the DOD appropriations bill, in consultation \nwith the distinguished Republican leader. I should also note that it is \nmy intention to call up the fast-track conference report, and we will, \nif necessary, file cloture on that motion as well.\n  Senators should be prepared, if necessary, to be on the floor to \naccommodate that desire as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for a couple of clarifications, first of \nall, with regard to the trade promotion authority, from what I believe \nthe majority leader was saying, it would be his intent to call it up \ntonight and, if there is objection, you would file cloture on the trade \npromotion authority bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is correct. I have been informed \nthat there are those who will object, so it is unlikely that we would \nbe able to complete our work on the trade promotion authority \nconference report tonight. Expecting that, I would intend then to file \ncloture on the conference report itself.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, continuing, I would like to get a \nclarification because I believe the Senator indicated that after the \nDorgan amendment was agreed to, then the Senate would vote immediately \non cloture on the underlying generic drug bill, and only if cloture is \ninvoked would you then go to final passage. If cloture is defeated, of \ncourse, then that issue would still be pending.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. I anticipate that we would get \ncloture. If we don't, of course, we will stay on the bill for whatever \nlength of time it takes and be unable to complete our schedule as it \nhas been announced.\n  Obviously, cloture on the motion to proceed to a conference report is \nnot necessary. This would actually be cloture on the conference report \nitself with regard to the trade promotion authority.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for those who are following this, I \nemphasize that nobody has given up any position here or lost any \nrights. We are trying to set up a process so Senators would know what \nis going to be the business for the rest of the evening and what would \nbe the sequence of votes tomorrow.\n  Tonight, we will have the debate on the nomination of D. Brooks Smith \nfor the Sixth Circuit. I thank Senator Daschle for going forward with \nit. Time is required for the debate, and that can occur tonight. The \nvote will be tomorrow in the stacked sequence along with votes on the \nGraham-Smith alternative and then on cloture on the underlying bill.\n  Depending what happens, we would go to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill, which we have made a commitment to complete this \nweek. We will try to get a reasonable time agreement on that. We would \nhave the trade bill following, too. This is a large agenda to \naccomplish. This agreement is to try to put into place when the votes \nwill occur.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, the distinguished Republican \nleader is correct. Because the motion to proceed to the conference \nreport on trade promotion authority is subject to a vote, I announce \nthat that vote will take place at 6:15 this evening. That will be the \nlast vote of the day.\n  We will accommodate Senators who have already expected to speak on \nthe pending legislation, and the 6:15 vote will accommodate all \nSenators who have come to the floor with an expectation of being \nrecognized.\n  I yield to the assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Is it the intention of the majority leader, when we \ncomplete that vote, that we would go to the judicial nomination at that \ntime, and then the 4 hours will start on or about that time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We would start debate at \napproximately 6:45 on Mr. Smith. Senators should be here. The debate \nwill be completed tonight. It is a 4-hour debate. So Senators will have \nample opportunity to come to the floor and express themselves. It must \nbe done tonight. There will be no time tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, within that 45-minute \ntime block that has now been designated for debate prior to the vote at \n6:15, Senator Kennedy be accorded 10 minutes of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, we are well past the time when the 39 \nmillion older Americans and disabled citizens should be receiving \naffordable, comprehensive, and reliable prescription drug coverage. \nMore tan 225,000 of these citizens live in New Mexico.\n  Medicare must be brought into the 21st century and that includes \nadding a prescription drug benefit. We must pay special attention to \nthe needs of the most vulnerable--low-income seniors and people with \ndisabilities. This is particularly important to New Mexico, where the \nmedian income of our senior citizens is just $11,370, or 15 percent \nbelow the national average.\n  Under the current system, an unconscionable number of these people \nare forced to choose every day between filling a doctor's prescription \nwith limited incomes or paying for some other basic need.\n  As we consider the drug proposal before us, there are some important \nprinciples that I believe we should adopt.\n  The first principle should be that we ensure that the most vulnerable \nare protected. That includes the neediest, or poorest, the sickest, or \nthose with the greatest health care needs. With the Federal Government \nnow running significant deficits, we clearly have a limited amount of \nmoney and cannot ensure all senior Americans and disabled citizens will \nget everything they need, but we should be sure the most vulnerable are \nprotected.\n  The second principle should be that we must use a delivery mechanism \nthat is stable and that seniors can rely on. It must be a system that \nis accessible and not an untried or untested system. It must be a \nsystem that is reliable and stable and not one that potentially leaves \nseniors without prescription drug coverage or is in transition from \nyear to year, as is often the case with the Medicare+Choice program \nnow.\n  Before us is the Graham-Smith-Lincoln-Bingaman amendment that meets \nthese principles. It has been a pleasure to work with all three of them \non this compromise and others with a similar desire to provide the most \nhelp to the neediest and the sickest, including Senators Chafee, \nFeinstein, and Nelson. This compromise offers the best hope for a \nprescription drug benefit this year and also compares well to the \nGrassley-Breaux amendment that received 48 votes in the Senate last \nweek.\n  In comparing these plans to ensure that the principles of protecting \nthe most vulnerable and to ensure that the proposal is stable and \nreliable, the Graham-Smith amendment is the only one that meets the two \nbasics, but critical, principles I have outlined.\n  With regard to protecting the most vulnerable, the Graham-Smith \namendment ensures that Medicare beneficiaries below 200 percent of \npoverty receive drug program assistance. This provides the 12.3 million \nlow-income seniors, or over one-third of elderly beneficiaries, with \nsome protections from rapidly increasing drug costs. In New Mexico, \nthis protects over 100,000 low-income seniors, or 47 percent of elderly \nbeneficiaries.\n  For these financial vulnerable seniors, they will receive a \ncomprehensive benefit under the Graham-Smith amendment that would be \nquestionable under Grassley-Breaux. Briefly, the Graham-Smith amendment \nprovides coverage up to 200 percent of poverty; limits low-income out-\nof-pocket expenses to just $2 and $5 per prescription compared to up to \n$3700 for beneficiaries below 200 percent of poverty in the alternative \nplan; and, provides coverage for low-income elderly that is as \ncomprehensive as state pharmacy assistance programs and without a drop \nin employer coverage, which again, is\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\nin sharp contrast to Grassley-Breaux. That amendment provides more \nlimited coverage than some elderly get through employer coverage or \nstate pharmacy assistance programs.\n\n  It makes little sense to spend almost $400 billion and have a \nconsequence that some elderly will receive drug coverage worse than \nthey currently receive, but that would be the consequence of Grassley-\nBreaux. I appreciate all the hard work Senators Grassley, Breaux, \nJeffords, Snowe, and Hatch have put into their bill and I understand \nthis aspect of their proposal is certainly an unintended consequence, \nbut it is a consequence that CBO estimates will cause one-third of \nemployer to drop retiree health coverage.\n  Of great significance, the Graham-Smith amendment eliminates the \nassets test in Grassley-Breaux, which bars low-income beneficiaries \nfrom having total assets of more than $4,000 a year. Own a car under \nthat proposal and you will likely be denied financial protections \notherwise.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, it is estimated that up to \n40 percent of low-income elderly would not pass the assets test even if \nthey are willing to undergo it. In New Mexico, coverage of low-income \nelderly in Graham-Smith is twice that of Grassley-Breaux--102,000 \nelderly covered to just 50,000.\n  In comparing the two proposals for those that are the sickest in \nsociety and have the most health care needs, Graham-Smith has a \ncatastrophic limit of $3,300 out-of-pocket or 12 percent less than the \n$3,700 in the competing proposal.\n  How do the plans fare with respect to providing health and financial \nsecurity for the elderly and disabled? Again, Graham-Smith is a \nstronger proposal.\n  The comparisons are stark. Graham-Smith requires a $25 annual fee \ncompared to $288 per year or more under Grassley-Breaux.\n  Graham-Smith builds on the current employer and state-based systems \nand does not supplant employer coverage in stark contrast to the \nunintended drop of one-third of retirees from employer-sponsored plans \nin the alternative proposal.\n  Furthermore, the Grassley-Breaux amendment relies upon a virtually \nuntried and untested system. For the full 37 years of the Medicare \nprogram, private insurance companies have had every opportunity to \noffer the elderly drug-only insurance plans. None have done so. This, \nmy friends, is the definition of ``market failure'' and the very reason \nwe have a Medicare program.\n  We have evidence of only one instance in which we have a drug-only, \nprivate insurance model and that was attempted by the State of Nevada. \nIt is estimated that their current effort cost taxpayers almost 60 \npercent more through private insurance than if the State had run the \nprogram itself. Yet, this is the model the Grassley plan would require \nall 39 million Medicare beneficiaries to participate in.\n  This is clearly a risky proposition. Moreover, the proposal allows \ninsurance companies to bid on an annual basis. Even if we can spend the \nbillions of dollars necessary to induce private insurance companies to \nparticipate, we are not buying stability or reliability for the \nelderly. Bids would come in every year with plans coming and going, \njust as they do in the Medicare+Choice program.\n  A prescription drug benefit should provide the elderly some security \nand not place them in some kind of grand experiment. We should not \nexperiment with the health of our Nation's seniors and disabled.\n  Furthermore, the Grassley-Breaux model allows insurance companies to \ncharge whatever the market will bear. Beneficiary premium costs could \nbe very high and vary by geographic area and vary by year-to-year.\n  To deal with the similarity with Medicare+Choice, whereby health \nplans often pull out and leave seniors without their health plan, the \nGrassley bill requires the Secretary to provide the plans with whatever \ninducement or incentives necessary to ensure that people have a choice \nof at least two plans.\n  The language reads:\n\n       [T]he Administrator may provide financial incentives \n     (including partial underwriting\n     of risk) for an eligible entity to offer a\n     Medicare Prescription Drug plan in that\n     area. . . .\n\n  This could cost billions and billions of dollars without giving the \nelderly any assurance that the plans will be affordable.\n  For these reasons, I support the Graham-Miller amendment. It meets \nthe principles of providing protections and security to our Nation's \nmost vulnerable citizens through a system that is both reliable and \nstable. It is for these reasons that AARP and the National Council on \nAging support Graham-Miller as well.\n  This amendment appears to offer us the final opportunity to pass \nprescription drug coverage for our Nation's elderly this year. To those \nthat criticize it because it does not do enough for the middle class, I \nagree and point out this should be seen as a first step and downpayment \non more comprehensive coverage for the Nations elderly and disabled.\n  However, if we do not take this first step, we are giving our \nNation's seniors absolutely nothing. For those that voted for the \nHagel-Ensign bill, I note that this proposal is very much like Hagel-\nEnsign in design, with a low-income benefit. Why is protecting the most \nfinancially vulnerable among our elderly objectionable?\n  I think this is a terrific compromise that takes aspects from both \nthe Democratic and Republican proposals.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment Senators Graham and Smith have \noffered is a very good-faith effort to provide a genuine benefit to \nMedicare recipients. I am glad to support it. It is a product of a lot \nof discussion. Senator Lincoln deserves substantial credit, as do \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Feinstein, Senator Chafee, and Senator \nMiller. A great many Senators have worked on this issue, in addition to \nSenators Graham and Smith, and I particularly appreciate their \nleadership.\n  Let me say that the need is enormous. I see it in my home State. Many \nof the most vulnerable in our society do have very difficult choices to \nmake about whether to fill the prescriptions they are given by their \ndoctors or to meet their other needs--pay their rent, pay their \nutilities, buy food for the family, whatever.\n  We need to solve that problem, and we need to do so in a way that \nmakes sense for all the people who benefit from the Medicare Program.\n  There are some important principles that I think we need to keep in \nmind as we craft a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  The first principle: We need to ensure the most vulnerable are \nprotected.\n  The second principle: We need to have a benefit for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and I believe we are meeting both of those principles \nwith this proposal.\n  The third obvious principle: We need to have a delivery mechanism \nthat is stable and upon which seniors can rely. It needs to be an \naccessible system. It should not be something that is untried and \nuntested so that we do not get into the same kind of mess we had with \nMedicare+Choice in my State, and I think in many States around the \ncountry. I believe this amendment meets those principles. I believe it \nis a great benefit to us.\n  Let me say briefly what the amendment does. I have a chart, which may \nbe difficult for some to read, but let me go through it very briefly.\n  The estimated cost of the Graham-Smith compromise is in the range of \n$390 billion. I think that is a reasonable price for this kind of a \nvery major benefit.\n  There is a benefit for all seniors. All seniors under the Medicare \nProgram have a negotiated drug discount of something in the range of 30 \npercent, with a 5-percent Medicare payment and an additional discount \nadded on to whatever discount can be negotiated through this program.\n  In addition to that, the seniors have catastrophic insurance coverage \nabove $3,300. So if any Medicare beneficiary pays $3,300 out of pocket, \nafter that, with a small copayment of not more than $10, they will have \nthe Government cover the cost of any additional drugs needed that year.\n  There is a substantial benefit for low-income seniors. We are saying \npeople with incomes of 200 percent of poverty or less are covered for \nall of their prescription drug needs, with a very small nominal $2 or \n$5 copayment, depending upon whether they purchase generic drugs or \nbrand name drugs.\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n  This proposal is designed so that no employer will drop coverage for \nthose who are presently covered. That is a very important provision. \nThis amendment is also designed so there are no additional costs added \nto the States. Many of our States are faced with real financial \ndifficulties because of the economic downturn, and this is not a time \nto be adding additional cost to the States. We have guaranteed in this \nproposal that they not be given additional costs.\n  That is a summary of the amendment as it is drafted.\n  What does it mean for my State? It means that all the Medicare \nbeneficiaries in my State, everyone over 65, does get this very \nsubstantial catastrophic benefit, as well as the discounts.\n  It also means that 47 percent of the senior Medicare beneficiaries in \nmy State will fall into the category of 200 percent or less of poverty \nand will have all of their drug costs paid.\n  Obviously, the choice we have to make is a difficult choice. We can \ndo what is possible. Politics is the art of the possible, and I think \nall of us who have served in public office know that politics is the \nart of the possible. Maybe the possible plus 10 percent, but it is not \na whole lot more than that. We need to get 60 votes. We need to get a \nprescription drug benefit that is understandable, that is \nstraightforward, that is an add-on to the Medicare Program, and that is \nwhat we have proposed.\n  We can do what is possible and adopt this amendment or we can take \nthe approach that the perfect is the enemy of the good and that we are \nbasically not going to go home with anything. We will continue to tell \nthe senior citizens of our States that we were not able to come up with \nanything and give them excuses.\n  I hope very much the Senate will not take that latter course. I hope \nthe Senate will embrace this amendment and move ahead so that we can, \nin fact, deliver a prescription drug benefit. The time is well passed \nfor us to do this. I believe it is very important work that we need to \nget accomplish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Chair for the recognition. Mr. President, I \nhope people who are following this debate realize that we are having a \ndebate about politics; that this is a debate about the next election; \nthat this is hardly a debate about Medicare.\n  How extraordinary it is that we are here talking about an entitlement \nprogram that represents the largest single commitment of Federal \nspending in 37 years, one program that will cost in and of itself more \nthan defending the national security of the United States. Yet no bill \nhas ever been reported out of committee.\n  This was a process from beginning until end--and I hope we are \napproaching the end--that was designed to fail. It was designed to fail \nbecause we did not follow the normal procedure; we did not report a \nbill out of committee. We violated the budget. So, therefore, by not \nreporting a bill out of committee and by violating our own budget, it \nmeans that each of these proposals that are made have to get 60 votes.\n  We have already had one proposal that had we followed the regular \norder, the normal procedure of the Senate, would have already been \nadopted.\n  I have to note that basically what is going on is a political debate. \nOne of the issues I find alarming about this debate is that it is \nobvious that some people believe the way to win the political debate is \nto spend money. I wish to remind my colleagues of a little history.\n  In 1999, we had a report of the Bipartisan Commission on the Future \nof Medicare. Senator Breaux from Louisiana was the chairman. We had a \nclear majority of Members who were in favor of the recommendations for \nreform, but we had to have a supermajority of 11 Members to make a \nrecommendation to the Congress and to the President.\n  That bill would have funded prescription drugs with the savings that \nwe would have obtained by reforming Medicare. Until the last minute, it \nlooked as if we would get the 11, but President Clinton had his four \nappointees all vote no.\n  When that happened, President Clinton held a press conference and \nreleased a program and said: If you would give me $168 billion, I can \nfund prescription drugs for American seniors. That was in 1999.\n  Then in the year 2000, the Senate debated a proposal, that Senator \nRobb was the sponsor of, that basically said if you will give us $242 \nbillion, we can provide prescription drugs for America's seniors.\n  Then last year, Senator Baucus said we could fund a program that \nmeets every need that the American people have, all the needs of our \nseniors, for just $311 billion.\n  Then when we wrote a budget, the Democrat proposal in the Budget \nCommittee, which was never adopted by the Senate, and we were told--\nactually $168 billion, $242 billion, $311 billion--that is not enough, \nwe need $500 billion. Then on the bill on which we did not waive the \nbudget point of order last week, we were told that it would require \n$600 billion.\n  When we fill up the gaps, when we project out for 10 years, we have \nbeen seriously debating on the floor a proposal that would spend a \ntrillion dollars, that has never been reported by any committee, that \nhas never had a systematic consideration by a committee of the Senate, \nand that was designed from the beginning to fail.\n  I wish to conclude by making the following points: The proposal by \nSenator Graham of Florida and Senator Smith of Oregon that is before \nus, that we are going to vote on in the morning, is being sold as a \ncatastrophic coverage proposal that is quite similar to a proposal that \nSenator Hagel, Senator Ensign, and I offered that got over 50 votes.\n  I would like my colleagues to understand that this proposal is \nnothing like our proposal. It is better than the original Graham-Miller \nproposal, it is more affordable, but it is not the proposal that \nSenator Hagel, Senator Ensign, and I made. Our proposal said that we \ncan set up a simple program where every senior in America will be able \nto engage, through a private company, in buying pharmaceuticals \ncompetitively so that we can bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals \nbetween 20 and 40 percent for everybody.\n  Then we had a stop loss, a maximum out-of-pocket expenditure, that \nfor moderate-income seniors was about $100 a month. They would be \nspending that $100 a month through these private companies that would \nbe purchasing pharmaceuticals competitively, and they would be spending \ntheir own money and therefore would be cost conscious. When they reach \nthat $100 a month and the Federal Government starts picking up the \ncost, they have already entered into a situation where they are buying \npharmaceuticals competitively.\n  Secondly, we did not have the same stop loss for everybody. One of \nthe reasons the bill before us costs $400 billion over 10 years and \nprovides such little coverage is that Bill Gates has the same stop loss \nthat my mother has. Ross Perot has the same stop loss that the poorest \nrecipient of Medicare in America has. This is not at all like the \nHagel-Ensign bill, where the stop loss was dependent on one's income.\n  I remind my colleagues that was an affordable proposal. It was the \nonly proposal that we have voted on that was within our budget, for the \nsimple reason that it put the money toward helping the people who \nneeded the help the most.\n  The problem with all of these other proposals is that for every 10 \npeople they help, 8 people do not need it. We are displacing massive \namounts of private health insurance in the name of helping people who \ndo not have health insurance. The advantage of the Hagel-Ensign \nproposal, the reason it was within budget and these other proposals are \nnot, is that it put the focus of attention on helping people who fell \ninto two categories. Either they had relatively low income and \nsubstantial drug bills, or they were moderate and upper income with \nastronomical drug bills. In either case, they got help. But if their \ndrug bills are low relative to their income, they did not get help and, \nquite frankly, people who have incomes and retirement that run into the \nhundreds of thousands of dollars and have private health insurance are \nnot the people in need. It is the people who do not have health \ninsurance and who are having a very difficult time with\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\npaying for their pharmaceuticals who need help.\n  I hope this amendment will be rejected. When we do not have enough \nunity of purpose to pass a bill out of the committee of jurisdiction, \nin this case the Finance Committee, we should not be engaged in a \npolitical exercise on the floor where we are literally committing \nourselves to a trillion dollar expenditure over the next 10 years. We \nare talking about the largest commitment of money that this Nation has \nundertaken in 37 years, and yet there is no substantial bipartisan \nagreement. Every proposal is tailored to some political constituency. \nWe are dealing with a process that was designed to fail by not \nreporting a bill out of committee, by not staying within budget and, \ntherefore, having to get 60 votes. So my own opinion is that the sooner \nthis charade ends, the better off America will be.\n  Let the record show there has been only one proposal that was within \nbudget. There has been only one proposal that was fully funded by the \nbudget and that was logically consistent, that encouraged efficiency \nand economy and met the needs of the people who need the help the most, \nand that was the Hagel-Ensign bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment that is currently \npending before the Senate. We are going to vote tomorrow. It has a \nbudget point of order. It is $100 billion above the budget. When we \nadopted this year's budget last year, we said we were going to spend up \nto $300 billion on providing prescription drug assistance. This \namendment, by the most generous scoring that can be made, costs $400 \nbillion. I urge my colleagues, do not waive the budget point of order, \nsustain the budget process, and reject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I wish to talk about the Graham-Miller \namendment for prescription drugs. First, I compliment the people who \nhave been working on it. We think they are at least going in the right \ndirection. They have adopted some of the parts of the bill that Senator \nHagel and I had proposed, but I believe there are some fundamental \nflaws in the amendment as currently drafted.\n  I was in a working group yesterday. I tried to point out some of \nthese flaws, and I want to point those out on the floor because I think \nthese are very important issues that we get fixed in any prescription \ndrug bill that we eventually, hopefully, pass out of the Senate and \nsomeday get to the desk of the President.\n  In the Graham-Smith amendment, for the people above 200 percent of \npoverty, they use the catastrophic bill; they use basically what \nSenator Hagel and I had talked about, where seniors pay out of pocket \nfor the first x dollar figure and then above a certain dollar figure \nthe Government would step in and take care of the costs.\n  The problem is in the category of people below 200 percent of \npoverty, they basically give them full coverage with very little \nexpected of the senior--only $2 for generic drugs on a copay and $5 for \nname brand drugs. Those seniors in that income category are not going \nto be held accountable. That is not enough money out of pocket to \naffect their behavior, in my opinion. The reason they have to be held \naccountable for the behavior is because we do not want people abusing \nthe system and taking drugs.\n  People say, well, these are prescription drugs. Why would anybody \njust get prescriptions? I happen to be a veterinarian by profession and \nhave worked with people coming in with their pets. Talk to any \npediatrician, any family practitioner in human medicine, it does not \nmatter, they will tell you that people come to them, however they are \nfeeling, if they are feeling ill, regardless of whether they need \nantibiotics, they expect them or they expect some kind of a \nprescription. With children in this country, we understand when their \nparents bring their kids to the doctor for an ear infection--almost all \nof those ear infections are caused by viruses.\n  Viruses do not respond to antibiotics, yet almost every time when \nsomebody walks out of the doctor's office for their kids' ear \ninfection, that child is put on antibiotics. It is one of the reasons \nwe have so many drug-resistant secondary bacterial infections in ear \ninfections--because we treat with antibiotics. The virus is there, it \nkills normal-growing bacteria, and you get a secondary bacterial \ninfection, which is a reason that a lot of kids need to have tubes put \nin their ears, along with all kinds of other problems.\n  It is the same problem with a lot of seniors. If you are sick, you go \nto the doctor--you have a virus, whatever it is; you have a complaint, \nyou expect to get better. A lot of times, physicians will prescribe \nmedicine simply as a placebo effect. They know if I do not give this \nperson something, they will go to another doctor. If the person is \npaying out of pocket, there is some incentive to ask the questions: Do \nI need these medications? Can I get a better price? Maybe I should buy \nthe generic. The only difference between $2 and $5, generic versus \nbrand name, is not necessarily that great incentive, but if they paid \nthe first dollars out of their pocket, which is what our bill required, \nbased on income--a sliding scale based on income--they would pay the \nfirst dollars out of pocket.\n  For instance, somebody who made around $15,000 to $17,000 a year \nunder our bill would pay, on average, $100 to $120 a month out of \npocket. After that, other than a small copay, the Government would pick \nup the costs. That person with diabetes, taking five or six different \ndrugs, would have gotten the help they need without losing all of their \nassets. Right now, they get no help, and our bill would have given them \nthe help.\n  Because we had some complaints about our bill--that if you make $1 \nmore than $17,700 a year, you went from a maximum out-of-pocket expense \nof $1,500 to $3,500--we are trying to build more of a gradual scale \ninto our bill so there will not be the dramatic dropoffs. We are also \ntrying to put some of the money and give low-income seniors a little \nmore help under our bill. We think we will be able to do this and still \nbe within the $300 billion budget.\n  What is important about being in the $300 billion budget? The fact \nis, unless we are within $300 billion, we are violating the budget we \nset up. That is the reason it needs a 60-vote point of order. If our \nbill were reported out, if it were done properly, if we would take our \nbill, report our bill out of committee, and take all of the bills that \nhave been voted on, report them out of committee, our bill is the only \none that could become law because it is the only one that only would \nhave needed 51 votes. Our bill got 51 votes.\n  The bill tomorrow that will be voted on, from what I understand, will \nonly get 54 or 55 votes and therefore will not be able to waive the \nbudget point of order.\n  If the majority leader would take our bill to the Finance Committee, \nlet that bill be reported out of the Finance Committee, we actually \ncould have this process go forward. Our bill, within the budget, would \nnot need the 60 votes. It does not seem as though any proposal will get \nthe necessary 60 votes. So let's work together, go through the process, \nthrough the Finance Committee, and report out a bill like this. We are \nwilling to work with people on the numbers. As long as we can fit \nwithin the $300 billion budget number, we will not have to get the 60 \nvotes and we can get a bill reported out of the Senate.\n  If we want to look at seniors this next year and say, we are really \ngoing to be helping you, I believe our proposal should get serious \nconsideration from people. For those seniors who truly need the help, I \ndon't believe we should look at them, especially with the November \nelections coming up, and say, sorry, politics got in the way again.\n  The Republicans are blaming Democrats, Democrats are blaming \nRepublicans, and the bottom line is seniors are not getting the help \nthey need. I truly believe we need to give the seniors some \nprescription drug benefit. However, I also believe we need to do it in \na fiscally responsible way for the young people in the United States. \nIf we do not do that, we will regret it in the future. Let's work \ntogether on this and pass a real prescription drug benefit that we can \nafford.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand I have 10 minutes. I yield myself 9 \nminutes.\n  I have had the opportunity to spend a good deal of time in the Senate \nover the past days and had the chance again this afternoon to listen to \nmany colleagues describe what is before the Senate. I have listened to \nthe recent comments of my friend from Texas, saying this is just all \nabout politics, and others saying we cannot consider the proposal of \nSenator Graham or Senator Smith because of gaps and loopholes. I have \nheard a great deal of characterization of what is before the Senate.\n  What is before the Senate is an opportunity to make a very important \ndownpayment for the seniors of this country, in a partial fulfillment \nof the promise we made to them in 1965 when we passed Medicare. That \nwas a solemn pledge to the senior citizens of this country that said, \nplay by the rules, pay into the system, and you will have health \nsecurity when you retire.\n  That was the commitment. That is what everyone remembers. And I had \nthe opportunity of being there. Our majority leaders, our minority \nleaders, those in support of that program made that commitment to the \nAmerican people. They made it to the workers at that time and to the \nparents and to the grandparents of that time: Health security will be \nyours.\n  We all have an opportunity now to travel back to our hometowns and to \nlisten to our seniors. Anyone who does that knows that we are failing \nthat commitment every single day. Why? Because we provided \nhospitalization and we also provided physician services, but we have \nnot provided prescription drugs. That is something we all understand. \nNo one can say to our senior citizens: We have met our responsibility \nto you.\n  If we do not pass a good benefit package here, we are continuing to \nfail our senior citizens.\n  That may be described as politics to the Senator from Texas, and it \ncan be described as $400 billion by the Senator from Nevada. Our \nproposal that provided the comprehensive care, where we got 52 votes \nand if we would have had 8 votes from our Republican friends, we would \nbe on our way to conference this evening to try to guarantee that kind \nof protection. But no, we say we cannot do that. Then all afternoon, we \nhad hearings about gaps in this proposal or that proposal. If you go \nfrom approximately $800 billion down to $400 billion, you are going to \nfind out that you are not going to have the same benefit package. And \nif that is what you want on that side to agree to, we will agree to \nthat. But I tell you something else we agree to: We make our commitment \nwhen we get this passed, and passed with the help of some courageous \nRepublicans, we are not stopping there; we are coming back and we are \ngoing to complete the job. That is our commitment to the seniors \ntonight and tomorrow, that this is a downpayment. But it is only the \nbeginning, no matter how concerned you are about why we are considering \nthis legislation on the floor of the Senate.\n  I was here for 4 of the last 5 years when we could never get this \nbill out of the Finance Committee--buried, buried, buried by Republican \nleaders on the floor of the Senate and leaders on the Finance \nCommittee. Finally, we have a courageous Democratic leader who puts \nthis before the Senate.\n  Then we hear: Oh, no, we cannot consider that because that is \npolitics. What was political was denying the ability for the Senate to \nconsider this over the period of the last 4 years. Where have you been? \nWhere have you been?\n\n  I can tell you where we are. I can tell you where Bob Graham is, and \nSenator Smith is, and that is here tomorrow and they are going to be \nsaying: This is a downpayment. This doesn't do all the job. We all want \nto have a better benefit package, but we are denied that opportunity. \nWe were denied that by the failure of the votes on that side; make no \nmistake about it.\n  Who are the people we are talking about? We are talking about, as has \nbeen described earlier in this debate--we are talking about the \ngreatest generation, those who have fought in World War II, who have \ncome back, and are now in their golden years. Those are the people we \nare talking about. That is what is at issue here. Are we going to meet \nour responsibility to men and women who fought in World War II, fought \nin the Korean war, some, perhaps, could even be qualified from the \nVietnam war--men and women who brought the country out of the \nDepression, served, and built the Nation to the great Nation it is; and \nthey need prescription drugs. And we are rattling around down here \nwondering how we gain political advantage. That is what is motivating \nthose of us on this side, to meet that responsibility, Senator.\n  We heard the same arguments I heard when we were battling Medicare. I \nhave read the history and we heard the same arguments when they were \npassing Social Security: We cannot do it. We should not do it. We can't \nmake that kind of commitment. Medicare was the exact same thing: We \ncan't afford it. It is socialized medicine. I haven't heard about \nsocialized medicine out here since 1994 when we were debating a \ncomprehensive health care program. I have not heard socialized \nmedicine, but that is what we were talking about in the Medicare \ndebate. They spared us that, but they still bring it up in opposition. \nAnd I don't question that because that side of the aisle was opposed to \nMedicare, and they were opposed to Social Security. Are we in any doubt \nthey are opposed to this endeavor?\n  Tomorrow, make no mistake about it, this will be the key vote in \nterms of prescription drugs. I wish we were back to the time that we \nwere considering the more comprehensive program that made sure we were \ngoing to attend to all the needs of our senior citizens, all of those \nneeds. That is what we ought to be doing, but we cannot do it because \nwe have been defeated on that. But we are not giving up. We are coming \nback again. We are making the commitment, if we are able and \nsuccessful, to get this downpayment. It will make an important \ndifference to the quality of lives for millions of our senior citizens.\n  Look what the CBO talks about. The program will reach almost half--49 \npercent of our neediest senior citizens, and for those above the \n$3,300--another 15 percent. If you add those together, it is virtually \ntwo-thirds of all of our seniors. We wish it were 100 percent, but they \nwouldn't give us the eight votes. This is two-thirds. It may not have \nall the benefits, let alone the other advantages in terms of the lower \ndiscount rates that will benefit those even in that third. But it is a \nsincere effort, the best effort that could be done over the period of \nthese last 2 days, to try to continue this battle and continue the \nstruggle.\n  That is what this is all about. We reject those who say this is not \nthe time, this is not the place. I listened with great interest to \nthose who were defending the program that was advanced earlier last \nweek. That had a drug program for $330 billion, and they are trying to \ncompare that to the one that was introduced by Senator Graham, saying \nit was more comprehensive, it was more complete, it would provide our \nseniors with better services? Then why didn't the seniors support it? \nThat is our simple answer. Why didn't the seniors support it? You \ncouldn't get the support because it failed to do that.\n\n  We welcome the fact that the senior organizations support the Graham-\nSmith program. They supported our efforts a week ago when we were \ntrying to get the comprehensive program. Over the period of these last \ndays, they have looked the range of different options being proposed. \nThese groups that represent seniors understand what is at risk and what \nopportunities lie before us now, and they are supporting our efforts to \nget this downpayment.\n  When we get this downpayment, that is what it will be. It will be a \ndownpayment. We will hear voices continuing to harp on the other side \nthat would really like to take even more hundreds of billions of \ndollars and give it to the wealthiest individuals in this country and \nreduce their taxes, but this is about making sure that we are going to \nwalk the walk and give to our senior citizens that same kind of \nprescription drug program that my friend Phil Gramm has, right over \nhere, in the well of the Senate. He has a comprehensive program. He \npays about a 25-percent copay on his program. Every Member of the \nSenate has it.\n  Should we retreat on a commitment to try and do for the people of \nthis\n\n[[Page S7551]]\n\ncountry what the Members of the Senate have already done for \nthemselves? I say vote for the Graham proposal. We will make the \ncommitment that this will be a downpayment and we will see the day when \nour senior citizens will be able to raise their heads high and know \nthey will not have to fear when they hear from their doctors that they \nneed prescription drugs in order to live a healthy and happy life.\n  I think the time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BROOKS SMITH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I now ask that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session, as provided under the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to executive session, \nand the clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of D. Brooks \nSmith, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 hours for debate, evenly \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, it is with considerable pride that I \nurge my colleagues to vote to confirm a very distinguished Federal \njudge, D. Brooks Smith, now Chief Judge of the Western District of \nPennsylvania, whose nomination is now before the Senate for the Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Judge Smith comes to this position with an outstanding academic \nbackground, having received his bachelor's degree from Franklin and \nMarshall College in 1973, his law degree from Dickinson Law School, and \nthen engaged in the active practice of law for 8 years before becoming \ndistrict attorney of Blair County, PA, a populous county whose county \nseat is Altoona.\n  He then became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Blair County \nin 1984, serving for 4 years until he became a judge for the United \nStates District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania where he \nis now the chief judge, and for now almost 14 years has had very \ndistinguished service there.\n  I came to know Judge Smith when he appeared before the bipartisan \nnominating panel which had been established by Senator Heinz and \nmyself, and I found him very well qualified and have known him on a \ncontinuing basis rather well over the course of the past 14 years. I \nhave talked to him on many occasions and met with him on many \noccasions, discussing problems of the courts administratively, and \nissues that may come before the Judiciary Committee. He has been an \noutstanding jurist.\n  Judge Smith enjoys a unique reputation among all of the people who \nknow him. During his confirmation hearings, large groups of people who \nknew him rallied to his defense and came forward to attest to his \nerudition, his scholarship, his good character, and his judicial \ntemperament.\n  Certain issues have been raised which had delayed the confirmation. \nOne involved a fishing club in which he was a member, but that club did \nnot practice what is called invidious discrimination because it was a \nsocial club only. While in confirmation hearings for the district \ncourt, he had said he would resign from the club if they did not change \ntheir membership rules. It was later determined in 1992 in an opinion \nof precedential value that the club did not engage in invidious \ndiscrimination, so there was no reason for him to leave the club.\n  An issue arose on a case, where he presided for a relatively brief \nperiod of time, as to whether there should have been an earlier \nrecusal. The matter was inquired into, investigated at length by former \nGov. Dick Thornburgh and former Attorney General of the United States, \nand in an elaborate statement, he went through the case in detail and \nfound, as I concluded as well, that the judge had made a timely \nrecusal.\n  Some issues were also raised as to a speech which Judge Smith made on \nthe Violence Against Women Act. He had concluded that there was not \nFederal jurisdiction for that particular statute.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n  I, frankly, disagreed with him about his conclusion on that, as \nlawyers are wont to do, even lawyers who become judges or lawyers who \nbecome Senators. In fact, the Supreme Court of the United States \nultimately agreed with Judge Smith on the point.\n  I mention these issues in passing because I think they are not worth \nany more comment. The issues were considered at great length by the \nJudiciary Committee, and in a 12-to-7 vote, the Judiciary Committee \nrecommended Judge Smith's confirmation.\n  As is well known, Judge Smith's nomination came before the Judiciary \nCommittee at a time of considerable controversy involving the timing \nand the confirmation of nominees submitted by President Bush.\n  Senator Biden, Senator Kohl, and Senator Edwards all voted to confirm \nJudge Smith in an atmosphere where there was, to say the least, at \nleast some element of partisanship.\n  I only mention those issues. I think they do not bear any more \ncomment than I have given them.\n  When a man such as D. Brooks Smith undertakes public service in a \nFederal judgeship, I think it ought to be noted that there is a very \nconsiderable personal and financial sacrifice. I thank Judge Smith for \nserving on the Federal bench, and I thank all the Federal judges for \nserving on the Federal courts which are the pillars of justice and the \npillars of our democratic society.\n  Judge Smith has undergone a difficult period in this confirmation \nprocess which has taken quite a considerable period of time. I \ncompliment him for his steadfastness and for his determination in \nstaying the course and in working through on this confirmation.\n  There is no doubt of Judge Smith's qualifications--his educational \nbackground, temperament, judicial experience, and experience being a \ndistrict attorney. Judge Smith has a broad range of experience.\n  The Third Circuit is in desperate need of judges. They are in an \nemergency situation. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Chief \nJudge Edward R. Becker be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am confident, based on my personal knowledge of Judge \nSmith and his outstanding record, that he will be a credit to the Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Utah and my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont for permitting me to speak at this time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                             U.S. Court of Appeals\n\n\n                                        for the Third Circuit,\n\n                                  Philadelphia, PA, July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: Because the exercise of my \n     responsibility to assure that efficient administration of \n     justice for over 21 million Americans within the Third \n     Judicial Circuit is being seriously impaired by the current \n     impasse in the Senate over judicial nominations, I feel \n     constrained to cry out. A total of eleven--yes eleven--judges \n     within the Third Circuit, whose presence is desperately \n     needed, would, I believe, have been confirmed and entered on \n     duty but for the impasse.\n       Let me begin with the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Third Circuit. But for the impasse, Judge D. Brooks Smith \n     would now be on my Court, which has three vacancies, two of \n     them of long standing. I have scheduled him to sit in the \n     early Fall, and we need him. We ``borrow'' judges in 45% of \n     our cases, which is too much. But that situation pales in \n     comparison with that of the District Court for the Western \n     District of Pennsylvania. There are five vacant judgeships on \n     that Court; as of September 30, 2002, these judgeships will \n     have been vacant for a total of 161.7 months. If it were not \n     for the impasse, the following judges would likely have \n     entered on duty: Joy Flowers Conti, who I understand has \n     resigned from her law firm partnership, anticipating a July \n     swearing-in-date (and is now without income); David S. \n     Cercone; Terrence F. McVerry; and Arthur J. Schwab. The \n     Western District is in desperate straits. Motions are piling \n     up, and trials are being delayed.\n       Other courts within the Third Circuit are similarly \n     disadvantaged. Two nominees to the Middle District of \n     Pennsylvania are awaiting floor votes: John E. Jones, III and \n     Christopher C. Conner, both nominated to fill vacancies that \n     are well over a year old. Two nominees to the Eastern \n     District of Pennsylvania, one of the busiest courts in the \n     nation, are also being held up: Timothy J. Savage and James \n     Knoll Gardner. We also have problems in New Jersey where we \n     have five vacancies. Stanley R. Chesler and William J. \n     Martini are awaiting floor votes. There are also putative \n     nominees for the other three vacancies: Jose Linares, Freda \n     Wolfson, and Robert Kugler, whose progress is obviously being \n     slowed by the impasse. Their presence is needed there to take \n     up the slack caused by my assignment of Senior Judge Alfred \n     Wolin, who had a full docket, to handle the mega-asbestos \n     bankruptcy cases in Delaware, one of the nation's most \n     important judicial assignments.\n       I have always respected the processes of the United States \n     Senate. I came to the bench from politics, and understand the \n     senatorial prerogatives. I have been tempted to speak out \n     before, yet because of my background, held back. But the \n     current impasse is too much even for me, hence this letter. \n     As a judge of over three decades of experience on the federal \n     bench, I understand the weighing and balancing process, and I \n     believe that it is out of all proportion to the exercise of \n     senatorial prerogative that these eleven nominees (and scores \n     of others) be held up so long. I urge you to press my plea \n     before your colleagues.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Edward R. Becker.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for \nyielding me some time, and I also thank the Senator from Vermont for \nallowing Senator Specter and I to speak first on this nominee.\n  I, too, like Senator Specter, am very proud tonight to praise the \nnomination of Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and to \ncongratulate the President on an excellent nominee. I certainly urge \nall of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for his \nconfirmation. I truly hope they look at his record of 17 years of \njudicial service and experience on both the Federal and State level.\n  He is someone of paramount integrity, someone who is obviously \nacademically qualified, having been confirmed already as a Federal \njudge some 13 years ago. He has impeccable credentials academically and \nprofessionally prior to being a judge, and I think his service on both \nthe trial court level and the common pleas court of Blair County, as \nwell as on the Federal bench of the western district, now serving as \nchief judge of the western district, has been exemplary.\n  He is someone who has been a model judge, someone who has steered a \ncourse, as most people who have described his nomination, right down \nthe center, someone who follows the law and is very steadfast to what \nthe role of a judge is, which is not to go out and make law but simply \nto serve in the capacity of meting out justice in a fair and equitable \nway that meets the expectations of the litigants. He has been highly \npraised by everyone.\n  He has gotten a letter of support from almost the entire Pennsylvania \ncongressional delegation, Democrats and Republicans alike. He has been \nrated well qualified by the ABA and highly recommended by the Allegheny \nCounty Bar Association, which is their highest rating. Allegheny County \nis the bar where the Western District of Pennsylvania is located. He \nhas gotten support from every prior U.S. attorney from Jimmy Carter on \nthrough President Clinton's appointments to the U.S. attorney position \nin the western district. They have all come out in support of him.\n  His colleagues on the statewide bench from the supreme court, \nsuperior court, on down, have written letters of support, both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, for his nomination.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of this nomination was what some \non the far left-wing groups have done to try to impeach Judge Smith's \nintegrity. Senator Specter reviewed the three things that have been \nbrought up in a 17-year career. Probably the most outrageous of all of \nthem is the fact that Judge Smith belonged--I know this might be \nshocking to some of my colleagues--to a sportsman club that only has \nmale members. I know that none of my colleagues have ever heard of such \na thing, but believe it or not most sportsman clubs in America, I would \nsuggest, have limitations on memberships. If anyone is interested in \nthe opposite, where sportsman clubs limit membership only to women, go \nto www.womensflyfishing.net, and they will find 60 organizations where \nonly women are permitted to be members.\n  At this particular club, the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club, only men \nare allowed to be members, but women certainly are allowed on the \npremises and\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nallowed to use the facilities. They simply cannot be members of the \nclub.\n  This club is a beautiful place. It is right in the heart of \nPennsylvania. It has attracted many people from around the country \nbecause of its fabulous fly fishing. One such person who is an annual \nvisitor, according to his own article on the subject, to this limited \nclub is former President Jimmy Carter.\n\n  Former President Jimmy Carter goes to this club to which Judge Smith \nused to belong. When President Carter was President, my colleagues may \nrecall the incident when the rabbit attacked his boat. That was \nsomewhat of a famous incident during the Carter Presidency. That \nhappened at the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club. This is purely a social \norganization.\n  When Judge Smith was before the Judiciary Committee, it was unclear \nwhether he should continue to belong to such an organization. He was \nconfirmed nonetheless. He promised at that time, when it was unclear \nwhether that membership was unethical in some respects, that he would \ntry to reverse the policy, and if he was unsuccessful he would resign. \nSubsequent to that, in 1992, the judicial code was changed and, as \nSenator Specter said, this kind of club does not fall into the ethical \ncategory of invidious. Therefore, as a result, he was not required \nunder the judicial conduct code to resign.\n  Nevertheless, he tried for several years. Every year at their \nmeetings, he would try to have women allowed to become members, but he \nfailed. Eventually, I think after 9 or 10 years, he decided he would \ngive up that quest and leave. This was some 5 years ago.\n  I understand there are a lot of women's groups that are complaining \nabout this. To be candid, the complaint should be not that he resigned \ntoo late but that he is not still there trying to change it. That, to \nme, would be legitimate, to say he should have continued to stay there \nto try to get women as members. Instead, he gave up the fight, as some \nmight suggest, and decided simply not to belong.\n  I think they have sort of missed the point, and the point is--this is \nridiculous is really the point. The point that he belonged to this club \nhas nothing to do with his ability to be a jurist. Probably the worst \naspect of this whole thing is it brought up this tenor that somehow \nJudge Smith was anti-woman. Well, we had the president of the NOW \norganization in his home county, Blair County, former Democratic county \ncommissioner, come to the Senate, to the LBJ room. She did a press \nconference talking about how Judge Smith, when he was a common pleas \ncourt judge, did more to help her in her role as county commissioner \nthan anybody else she met in county government, and that he had an \nexcellent record in regard to violence on women, and a variety of other \nthings, as he did as a common pleas court judge.\n  Then later on, we heard from members of the women's bar association \nof western Pennsylvania going on at length about how Judge Smith was \nthe best judge they had to deal with, who was the most respectful of \nwomen in the courtroom, most accepting of women in the courtroom.\n  This is the most frustrating part for the judge, and I know Senator \nSpecter commented how difficult a process this has been for him, to be \nattacked for things that are so spurious and tangential to this whole \nprocess, and trying to then frame them for something that he has worked \nall his life to prove that he was not. It was really unfair.\n  Senator Specter went through the other two issues that have been \nhighlighted. One is a case where he should have recused himself \nearlier. The trustee in the case, the former Attorney General and \nGovernor, Richard Thornburgh, who said he would have been the aggrieved \nparty in the case, as it turned out, said, no; that Judge Smith handled \nthe case properly and forthrightly. The judge who eventually was \nassigned the case commented she would have handled the case in the \nprecise manner Judge Smith handled the case. The Securities and \nExchange Commission looked at this and stated Judge Smith did nothing \nimproper.\n  There is absolutely nothing there when it comes to these \n``improprieties'' of Judge Smith on the bench. This is reaching. This \nis trying to find a reason to oppose someone who has an impeccable \nrecord of service in the judicial community of western Pennsylvania, \nsomeone who has been outstanding in everything he has attempted. He is \nan incredibly well-qualified person for this position. He has done \nnothing but prove that his nomination for the Third Circuit is \nwarranted.\n  I am very hopeful that my colleagues again on both sides of the \naisle--and I thank Senator Specter, Senator Edwards, Senator Kohl, and \nSenator Biden for their support of this nominee in committee--will be \njoined by many others on the other side of the aisle to confirm, as the \nABA said, a well-qualified, very solid candidate, for the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I ask consent that following me, the Presiding Officer recognize the \nsenior Senator from Utah; at 7:50 this evening, without using time from \neither side, the senior Senator from New Jersey be recognized for 10 \nminutes; and then we revert back to whichever member of the Judiciary \nCommittee sought recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate is debating the nomination of D. \nBrooks Smith to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. This, incidentally, is the 13th circuit court nominee to be \nconsidered by the Senate since the change in Senate majority and \nreorganization of the Judiciary Committee fewer than 13 months ago. \nThat is an average of one court of appeals judge a month since the \nDemocratic majority has been in place. That does set a record.\n  We voted and confirmed three judges yesterday, one a circuit court of \nappeals judge. There are 10 other judicial nominees on the calendar. \nAll have been approved on the Democratic side of the aisle. We have no \nobjection to going forward with votes on them. I commend the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, the majority leader, Senator Daschle, who worked \nvery hard to overcome the Republican objections so we can vote on \nPresident Bush's nominees to the judiciary.\n  We set a record on the number of courts of appeals nominees who have \nbeen given hearings and votes. We have moved forward, including \nconfirming one yesterday, and we will vote on another circuit court \nnominee tomorrow. That will be 13 in less than 13 months, plus more \nthan 60 other judicial nominees for whom we have held hearings or on \nwhom we have already voted. This seat on the Third Circuit is another \nexample of the different ways in which the Republican majority and \nDemocratic majority have proceeded.\n  Today's debate is taking place in broad daylight. Under the \nDemocratic majority, Judge Smith received a hearing less than 4 months \nafter receipt of his ABA peer review. In contrast, Judge Cindrich was \npreviously nominated for the same vacancy on the Third Circuit by \nPresident Clinton. He sat there for 10 months. You may wonder what \nhappened at his hearing. He never got a hearing. You may wonder what \nhappened on his vote. He never got a vote. He was never allowed a \nhearing; he was never allowed a vote. Four months after Judge Smith \ncame up with his ABA papers, we had a hearing.\n\n  This is one of the many court of appeals vacancies for which \nPresident Clinton nominated qualified and moderate nominees but the \nRepublican majority would not allow a vote--neither a hearing nor a \ncommittee vote. Bonnie Campbell, Allen Snyder, and so many others--I am \nsure they have not been treated as fairly as Judge Smith's nomination.\n  It is not enough to say some of the Republicans did not want those \njudicial nominees to be confirmed. I will vote against this nominee. I \nam the Chairman of the Committee. I could have refused to hold a \nhearing on Judge Smith. I could have refused to put his nomination on \nthe calendar for a vote in our Committee. I did not. Even though, after \nthe hearing, I made my up my mind to oppose this judge, I allowed the \nCommittee to vote on his nomination and, if he got a majority vote in \nthe Committee, allowed it to come to the Senate floor. That has always \nbeen the Democratic practice, and a practice that I follow.\n  Every Senator, Democrat and Republican, will vote his or her \nconscience\n\n[[Page S7554]]\n\nabout the merits of Judge Smith's promotion to the appellate bench. I \ndo not question the conscience of any Senator in doing that. While the \ncourse charted by the Democratic Senate to improve the process and hold \njudicial nominees is an honorable, difficult and time-consuming course, \nit is a road not taken in many instances by the Republicans in the \nrecent past.\n  Some nominees, such as Judge Smith, are a portrait of contradiction. \nThose on the other side can extol his accomplishments and his \npopularity, but they omit his failings. They minimize his troubling \nrecord on ethical issues and his decisions as a judicial officer. Some, \nwe heard tonight, may belittle the genuine concerns raised by many and \nshared by some Members of this Senate. I believe they are legitimate \nconcerns.\n  As I said, I could have refused to allow him to have a hearing. I \ncould have refused to allow him to have a vote in the Committee. I did \nnot. I do have genuine concerns.\n  Some on the other side may try to castigate or caricature those who \nexpress opinions that are in opposition to the confirmation of a \nnominee. They may even choose to vilify those who dare to vote against \na nominee who may be popular but who may be flawed in so many important \nrespects. All of these contrasting views and accusations might cause an \noutside observer to wonder what exactly is the truth. The fundamental \nquestions are whether this particular nominee should be confirmed, \nwhether he should be promoted to a higher court, and whether his record \nof conduct on and off the bench warrants promotion. A lifetime \nappointment to review the decisions of other judges is not a right.\n  With the Supreme Court hearing fewer than 100 cases per year, it is \nthe circuit courts that are really the courts of last resort for \nthousands of cases each year. These cases affect the Constitution, as \nwell as statutes intended by Congress to protect the rights of all \nAmericans; for example, the right to equal protection of the laws, the \nright to privacy, as well as the best opportunity to have clean air and \nclean water, not only for ourselves but for our future generations.\n  These courts are where Federal regulations will be upheld or \noverturned, where reproductive rights will be retained or lost, and \nwhere intrusive Government action will be allowed or curtailed. They \nare courts where thousands of individuals have their final appeal in \nmatters affecting their financial future, their health, their lives, \ntheir liberty. I believe this record does not demonstrate that Judge D. \nBrooks Smith merits this promotion.\n  In saying this, I mean no disrespect to the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, who strongly supported the confirmation of \nthis nominee, nor disrespect to the nominee who is well-liked by many. \nI genuinely mean no harm to Judge Smith, no matter how we vote \ntomorrow. He has a lifetime appointment and a lifetime salary as a \nFederal judge. It is fair to say, however, that this nominee's record \nis problematic in a number of ways. Among my many concerns is the fact \nthat Judge Smith's action creates an appearance that is too often \nbeholden to special interests. The Federal courts are supposed to be an \nindependent judiciary that is not beholden to anyone--the left, the \nright, or any economic interests. An independent judiciary is the \npeople's bulwark against the loss of their freedom and rights.\n  A number of judges and lawyers in Pennsylvania have written to the \nSenate to support Judge Smith's confirmation. A number of individuals \nand groups from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the Third Circuit and \nthroughout the country have written to the Senate, have called and e-\nmailed our office to express their deep concerns about this nomination.\n  We have heard from many Americans who are concerned about Judge \nSmith's record as a judge, including, incidentally, a resolution that \nwas passed by the City Council of the City of Philadelphia. It was sent \nto us after the vote in the Judiciary Committee. It called for his \nnomination to be rejected.\n  I am going to put in the Record at the end of my statement this City \nCouncil resolution, as well as the opinions of two ethics professors.\n  I am disappointed that Judge Smith's record on and off the bench has \nresulted in this kind of controversy. As I reviewed his record as a \njudge, that record raised significant doubts in my mind as well.\n  The issue for me is whether Judge Smith's record justifies this \npromotion from the lifetime Federal judgeship he now holds to the \nhigher lifetime Federal judgeship. In this case, it is to a court that \nis only one step below the Supreme Court. Appellate judges in the \ncircuit courts write opinions that become law, affecting all of us, \nwhether we live in Pennsylvania, Utah, Vermont, or Illinois. I do not \nbelieve Judge Smith's record justifies this promotion.\n  For one thing, he failed to keep his promise to resign from a \ndiscriminatory country club. Incidentally, that was not a promise that \nis something given in a political statement or to somebody in the press \nin response to an impromptu question. This was a promise Judge Smith \nmade in a sworn statement before the Senate a few years ago. He \nbelonged to a discriminatory club for more than a decade after he \nswore, after he took an oath, that he would quit if the rules were not \nchanged to allow women to become members, in 1988.\n  He stood there, he raised his right hand, he swore to tell the truth, \nand he told us that he would resign if women were not admitted by 1989. \nHe did resign from this Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club in 1999, 10 years \nlater.\n  What do you suppose was the thing that finally made him keep his \nword? A cynic would say that a vacancy had arisen on the court he \nwanted to be promoted to, and suddenly he thought: Wait a minute. I \nknow I swore to resign by 1989--I had a lifetime judgeship and why do I \nhave to resign from a club I like--but then suddenly, whoops, I might \nbe promoted to even a higher Federal judgeship, maybe I better dust off \nthat promise. I realize I am 10 years late, but better late than never.\n  I find that extremely troubling.\n  We had testimony by his supporters in letters that, well, the Spruce \nCreek is just a little fishing club, an itty-bitty fishing club of no \nconsequence, kind of like a shack in the woods where a group of male \nfriends might store their gear.\n  It is not exactly an itty-bitty club. This here is the itty-bitty \nclub.\n  I have a little farmhouse in Vermont. My house probably would fit in \nthe garage of this itty-bitty club. Look at this stately club. The \nRepublicans may have missed one thing when they previously referred to \nthis itty-bitty clubhouse, this inconsequential clubhouse as \n``rustic.'' Maybe they didn't realize that, because it is such a \nstately and important place, it is on the National Registry of Historic \nPlaces.\n  I bet your home, Mr. Presiding Officer, is not on the National \nRegistry of Historic Places. Mine is not on the National Registry of \nHistoric Places. I will bet the senior Senator from Utah's home is not \non the National Registry of Historic Places. But this little no-\nconsequence, little tiny fishing club, the itty-bitty fishing club, is \non such a prestigious list.\n  For nearly a century, this itty-bitty fishing club has been an \nexclusive recreational sportsmen's club that hosts its members and \nguests at its beautiful clubhouse. It has dining facilities. This itty-\nbitty clubhouse has fireplaces. It has bedrooms for overnight guests. \nIt is not just a little bend in the road; it sits on hundreds of acres \nof prime real estate.\n  We can joke about it. It is obvious that Judge Smith and his \nsupporters thought we would not actually go and find a picture of the \nclub. I think they probably wish that we would not go back to his sworn \ntestimony in which he promised to resign 10 years before he did. But \nlet us be clear about what this is. The sports club--it does not make a \ndifference whether the sport pursued is fishing or golfing. There are a \nnumber of women's fly fishing clubs attesting to the interest of women \nin that sport, and that is fine.\n  If men want to go off and go fly fishing themselves, that is fine. If \nwomen want to go off and go fly fishing, that is fine. But when they \nhave facilities to conduct business and when businesspeople go there to \nconduct business and that is how you may be able to get ahead in the \nbusiness world if you exclude women from it, if you say, women, if you \nwant to be in business, you are not going to be able to\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\njoin the moguls of the business or legal community here, then it is \nexclusionary.\n  Women anglers who might have a fly fishing association could not walk \ninto the Spruce Creek clubhouse. They could not fish in the stream \ncalled Spruce Creek that runs through the land owned by the club--\nunless a man, who is a member, condescended to invite them.\n  Frankly, it does not make any difference whether you exclude women or \nyou exclude African Americans or you exclude people of particular \nreligious faiths--it is still exclusion. That is why it is particularly \ntroublesome that, when Judge Smith was up here the last time before the \nSenate seeking a lifetime appointment, he swore in sworn testimony to \nthe Judiciary Committee and to the Senate of the United States that he \nwould resign if he could not promptly get the club to change its \nexclusionary rules.\n  Judge Smith did not resign within a year, or 2 years, as he had \nsworn. In fact, he did not resign within the time that the ethical \nrules that he was sworn to uphold as a judge required. He did not \nresign until 10 years later and then only when a new position on a \nhigher court for someone from Western Pennsylvania opened up and he \nhoped to be appointed to it.\n  There is no reasonable, logical explanation for why he waited for \nmore than 10 years to follow through except that one: There is now a \nvacancy on a court that he wanted to go to, the Third Circuit from \nWestern Pennsylvania. Claims that the ethical rules changed to allow \nhis continued membership are groundless.\n  The reason I stress this is that we have judicial nominations \nhearings, and the distinguished Senator from Utah, the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, we have all sat in these hearings. You ask for \ncertain commitments from judicial nominees because once they are \nconfirmed they have a lifetime position.\n  When a nominee comes before the Senate and makes a commitment, we \nmust rely on his or her word to honor that the promise will be kept. \nWith Federal judges that is especially true. Once confirmed, they have \nlifetime appointments. Impeachment is not a realistic way to enforce \nsuch commitments and, unlike Republicans in the House and Senate a few \nyears ago, I have never suggested impeachment of Federal judges.\n  If we allow such a promise, whether it is about club membership or \nsome other issue, to be so flagrantly broken with no consequence, then \npromises and assurances to the United States Senate will mean very \nlittle. I think that is a bad precedent. I think that is a bad message \nto send to future nominees to the courts and to the executive branch: \njust tell us what we want to hear and then ignore those commitments \nwithout any consequence.\n  I cannot think of another occasion in which a judicial nominee has \npromised to take specific actions and then been confirmed, after \nfailing to keep his word. It is true that some judicial nominees have \nbeen confirmed after resigning from a discriminatory club, but none \nhave ever been confirmed after telling the Senate that they would \nresign and then failing for years to do so. The closest analogy I \nrecall is the failed nomination of Judge Kenneth Ryskamp to the 11th \nCircuit, because Judge Ryskamp was on notice that membership in \ndiscriminatory clubs was impermissible, but he continued his membership \nin a discriminatory club anyway.\n  As a district court nominee of President Reagan in 1986, Judge \nRyskamp admitted that he was then a member of the University Club, \nwhich had a rule against allowing women as members, and the Riviera \nClub, which had no race-specific membership rules, but which in \npractice had no Jewish or African American members. During his 1986 \nhearing, Senator Simon asked Ryskamp if he thought he should resign \nfrom the University Club, and Ryskamp promised the Senate, ``I will \nresign from any club the Committee feels is inappropriate.'' In 1986, \nhe was not asked specifically about the Riviera Club, which he later \nsaid he did not consider to be a discriminatory club. He subsequently \nresigned from the University Club, but not the Riviera Club.\n  During his nomination by the first President Bush to the Eleventh \nCircuit, Judge Ryskamp's two-decade long membership in the Riviera Club \nwas questioned extensively. For example, Senator Kennedy noted that the \nfact that the Senate had not specifically asked Judge Ryskamp to resign \nfrom the Riviera Club did not lessen his responsibility to follow the \nethical rules anyway and resign. I recall that Judge Ryskamp told me \nthat he resigned shortly before his confirmation hearing in March 1991 \nbecause his continued membership created the appearance of impropriety, \nnot because, in his view, the Club discriminated. In April 1992, the \nmotion to report favorably Judge Ryskamp's circuit nomination to the \nfloor was defeated. The subsequent motion to send the nomination to the \nfloor without recommendation also failed.\n  Unlike Judge Smith, Judge Ryskamp never promised to resign from the \nclub at issue, although several Senators believed Judge Ryskamp should \nhave done so following his first confirmation. I think it only \nreasonable that Judge Smith's conduct regarding his previous promise to \nthe Senate would lead a reasonable person to doubt the sincerity of his \nassurances to the Senate this year in other areas, as well.\n  Breaking a promise to the Senate, or misleading the Senate into \nbelieving that certain action would be taken, is an independent yet \nunusually strong reason for the rejection of a judicial nominee. I do \nnot think Judge Smith should be given a promotion after failing to keep \nhis word to the Senate. If his statements to the Senate in 1988 were \nnot promises, then he most assuredly misled the Senate into believing \nhe was going to resign, and he did not do so within any period that can \nbe considered reasonable. On this basis alone, I feel I must vote \nagainst Judge Smith's confirmation to the Third Circuit.\n  Spruce Creek invidiously discriminates against women. Prior to his \nnomination to be promoted to the Third Circuit, Judge Smith never \ninformed the Senate that he did not have to keep his promise to the \nSenate. He acknowledged in both his 1988 and 2001 Senate Questionnaires \nthat the Club violated the ethical rules against judges belonging to \nclubs that engage in invidious discrimination. In fact, when Judge \nSmith finally resigned from the Club in December of 1999, he told the \nClub's president that the Club's men-only membership rules ``continue \nto be at odds with current expectations of Federal judicial conduct.'' \nIt is only now that questions have been raised about his very late \nresignation does he belatedly assert for the first time that the Club \nis ``purely social'' and so the rules against discriminatory club \nmembership do not apply. The exception he seeks to create would swallow \nthe rule. His statements on this point really give me pause with \nrespect to how Judge Smith would follow the law as an appellate judge \nor whether he would seek to bend it to his personal purposes. Public \nofficials should not have to be told, repeatedly, not to belong to \nclubs that discriminate.\n\n  We have received a letter from Professor Stephen Gillers, the Vice \nDean of the New York University School of Law, observing that the \nethical rules against discriminatory club membership do not apply to \npurely private social clubs that do not allow business or professional \nmeetings. However, both Professor Gillers and Professor Monroe \nFriedman, a distinguished ethics scholar, have noted that if club \nmembers can or do sponsor events or meetings at the club that are \nbusiness or professionally related then the club cannot be called \npurely private and the club's discrimination against membership for \nwomen is ``invidious'' within the meaning of the Code of Conduct's \nprohibitions. This is true even if women are allowed, by the men who \nbelong to the club, to attend some or all business and professional \nmeetings hosted by the club's members.\n  I understand that, in fact, Spruce Creek has always allowed members \nto host business and professional meetings at its facilities. We know \nthat members have hosted business meetings and gatherings of their \nprofessional colleagues at the Club. The President of the Club, who has \nbeen a member for decades, told Senate staff that members can use Club \nfacilities for any meetings or occasions they want, without any \noversight, but he refused to discuss the specific ways the\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nClub is used by members for business meetings.\n  We also know that the Club's constitution and by-laws do not \ndiscourage the members from hosting business, professional or political \nmeetings at the Club. Women, regardless of their standing in the \ncommunity or in their profession, cannot invite their colleagues to \nSpruce Creek for business meetings because they are explicitly and \nintentionally excluded from membership.\n  Additionally, according to Professor Gillers, Judge Smith had an \nobligation to make sure that the Club maintained a purely social \npurpose, if he was going to claim that his membership was exempt from \nthe ethical rules. He could not merely assume that it did. There is no \n``don't ask, don't tell'' exception to the ethical rules. Given his \nprevious assurances to the Senate and his own admissions up to and \nincluding his resignation in 1999, he can hardly assert that the Club \nis ``purely social'' now, as an after-the-fact justification for his \nconduct. He has made no showing in support of this belated contention.\n  Professor Gillers' view of this obligation to inquire is consistent \nwith the guidance in the Judicial Conference's Compendium to the Code \nof Conduct for United States Judges. Judge Smith also did not follow \nthe Compendium's advice regularly to re-evaluate club membership \npolicies and practices. Judge Smith also did not seek an ethics opinion \nfrom his fellow Federal judges about whether the rules against \ndiscriminatory club membership somehow exempted this Club to which he \nso badly wanted to belong.\n  Judge Smith now says that he did not seek an ethics opinion because \nit was so clear to him that the ethics rules did not apply to this Club \nafter amendments in 1992 that supposedly let him off the hook. This is \nanother implausible and self-serving assertion. As Professor Gillers \nnoted, the 1992 amendments to the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges without a doubt strengthened the prohibition against \ndiscriminatory club membership by adopting the language of the ABA code \nreferred to in the Senate Questionnaire that Judge Smith promised to \nfollow when he swore to the Senate that he would resign. The only \nsignificant difference is that the rule Judge Smith promised to follow \nin 1988 allowed judges one year to get discriminatory rules changed or \nresign, while the 1992 rule gave judges up to two years, from learning \nof discrimination according to the Code's new, tougher rules, to change \nthe club's practices or resign. Yet, Judge Smith did not resign in \n1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, or 1994. He did not resign until a chance \nfor a higher position in the Federal courts became available in 1999.\n  I recall that more than a decade ago the Senate Judiciary Committee \nconsidered this issue at length. There was testimony from women and men \nfrom across the country describing the impact of discriminatory private \nclubs on the women and people of color excluded. From time to time, I \nsuppose, reminders of these lessons are necessary.\n  In 1990, 2 years after Judge Smith was confirmed and promised the \nSenate that he would resign from the mens-only Spruce Creek Club, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee passed a sense of the Committee resolution \non the issue of discriminatory clubs. The resolution stated that \ndiscrimination at clubs where business is conducted and which \nintentionally exclude women and minorities is ``invidious'' and \n``conflicts with the appearance of impartiality required of persons who \nmay serve in the federal judiciary.'' The Committee's resolution that \nwas adopted on August 2, 1990, provides a bright-line rule for public \nofficials. It defines the clubs at issue as those where members bring \nbusiness clients or professional associates to the club for \nconferences, meetings, meals, or use of the facilities. Spruce Creek \nmeets this definition. It is also obviously a place where contacts \nvaluable for business purposes, employment and professional advancement \nare formed. The Club, by arbitrarily and intentionally excluding women \nfrom membership, practices invidious discrimination as defined by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Public officials should not have to be told \nrepeatedly not to belong to clubs that discriminate.\n\n  All judges, no matter how popular, have a solemn obligation to \n``avoid the appearance of impropriety in all activities,'' under both \nthe Judicial Conference's Code of Conduct for United States Judges and \nthe ABA's model code. That is because, in the words of those codes, \n``Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or \nimproper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and \nappearance of impropriety. A judge must expect to be the subject of \nconstant public scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions on \nthe judge's conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary \ncitizen and should do so freely and willingly.''\n  This prohibition applies ``to both the professional and personal \nconduct of a judge.'' The Judiciary Committee's club resolution \nsimilarly sets a high standard of conduct for Federal judges in their \npersonal conduct with regard to club memberships and association. Judge \nSmith has failed in those obligations. He may very well be a nice \nperson and courteous to women litigants in his courtroom, but that does \nnot excuse him from following the ethical rules that govern his conduct \nas a lifetime appointee to the Federal courts. Ethical rules apply to \nall judges equally, regardless of popularity.\n  Judge Smith had an obligation to resign from the Spruce Creek Rod and \nGun Club, both by virtue of his promise to the Senate and because of \nhis responsibilities under the ethical codes, and he failed to do so in \na timely fashion. His conduct should not be rewarded with a promotion.\n  I would also like to set the record straight on one final related \npoint. Supporters of Judge Smith have referenced President Jimmy Carter \nvisiting the Club. According to Carter's memoirs, however, one time in \nthe late 1970s President Carter and the First Lady were invited by the \n``Spruce Creek Hunting and Fishing Club for a day of fishing on a \nportion of their leased stream.'' That day, they met the man who \nactually owned that parcel of land and thereafter they visited and \nstayed at his farm, not the Club. The chapter in his book called \n``Spruce Creek'' relates to the creek, not the Club. There is no \nevidence that President Carter has ever endorsed the Club's \nintentional, invidious discrimination against women.\n  Judge Smith failed to recuse himself promptly from conflicts of \ninterest. I am also concerned about Judge Smith's late recusal, or \ndisqualification, in two cases involving his substantial financial \ninvestments. According to two distinguished professors of legal ethics, \nProfessor Gillers and Professor Friedman, Judge Smith also violated \nethical rules due to his late recusal from the Black cases, a 1997 \ninvestment fraud case and a related 1999 criminal case. This is because \nit is undisputably true that Judge Smith and his wife had substantial \ninvestments (valued at between $200,000 and $500,000 together) in the \nbank or holding company that faced significant financial liability in \nthose cases and because his wife also worked at the bank.\n  In one of those cases, Judge Smith waited five months to recuse \nhimself. In the other case, he waited about a week to recuse himself \nafter realizing that the bank was involved, but he issued significant \norders in the intervening period. In both cases, Judge Smith revealed \nonly his wife's employment at the bank to the lawyers in the cases. He \nnever disclosed their substantial financial investments to the lawyers \nin either the civil or the criminal case. Judge Smith contends that he \nwas not required to recuse himself but did so only in ``an abundance of \ncaution.'' He also contends, basically, that nobody was harmed by his \nlate recusal.\n  In the opinions of two ethics experts, however, Judge Smith was \nrequired to recuse himself from any case in which the judge or his \nspouse has any interest that could be substantially affected by the \noutcome of the case, in accordance with the rules passed by Congress in \n28 U.S.C. Sec.  455 (a) and (b) (4), and with cases of the Supreme \nCourt and Third Circuit. These rules against conflicts of interest, \nwhich are intended ``to avoid even the appearance of partiality,'' are \nlargely self-enforcing. Parties may not know that a judge has \nsubstantial financial investments affected by the case and may not move \nto disqualify a judge unless the judge fully discloses such \ninformation. Judge Smith, again reading ethical rules narrowly, did not\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\ndo so. Such facts do not give one confidence in his conduct on the \nbench.\n  I do think this Senate should take seriously a lifetime appointee's \nfailure to follow ethical rules, in this area and others, such as \ndiscriminatory club membership. It is problematic to confirm someone to \nthe Court of Appeals who would read the ethical obligations so \nnarrowly. This is especially so because, under the structure of the \nFederal courts, it is the circuit court judges who preside over ethics \ncomplaints against lower federal judges. I do not think those who read \nsuch rules narrowly should be elevated and given that special \nresponsibility.\n\n  Judge Smith's remarks as a Federal District Court judge: Another \ntroubling area is Judge Smith's insensitive and activist speeches. A \nnumber of these remarks call into question Judge Smith's judgment and \nfairness. For example, as a sitting federal judge he has given speeches \nin which he calls ``legal spam'' cases that affect the rights of \nordinary Americans, such as cases involving their financial security, \nsocial security appeals, pension plan collection cases, and bankruptcy \nappeals. Such a characterization is shocking for its insensitivity to \nthe importance of such cases to the individuals seeking a fair hearing \nof their claims in federal court. It calls into question how seriously \nJudge Smith has taken his oath as judge to administer justice to all \npersons equally and to ``do equal right to the poor and to the rich.''\n  Judge Smith also spoke out in favor of parties being required to pay \neach other's costs in responding to discovery requests. That idea--like \nthe idea of requiring the loser in a case to pay the winner's expenses, \nwhich he also endorsed has been widely rejected because it would impose \nsignificant financial burdens on individuals suing corporations, for \nexample, for personal injuries caused by a defective product. Such a \nrule could make it impossible for individuals to pursue legitimate \ngrievances for which Congress has provided a federal court forum.\n  Another concern is Judge Smith's speeches to conservative ideological \ngroups in which he basically gives advisory opinions about the \nconstitutionality of federal statutes. For example, in 1993, as a \nsitting judge, he gave a far-reaching speech to the Federalist Society \nin which he advised the audience that the proposed Violence Against \nWomen Act (VAWA) was unconstitutional. He said this landmark \nlegislation could not be justified as within the power of the federal \ngovernment. He was also very critical of Congress's extensive findings \nof fact in VAWA, calling them a ``promiscuous invocation of the \nCommerce Clause.'' This lack of deference and respect to the \nlegislative findings of a co-equal branch of government is troubling.\n  Judge Smith told the Federalist Society his own principles for \ndeciding such cases: ``First, ask whether the subject matter is within \nthe power of the national government by express delegation in the text \nof the [C]onstitution, or impliedly through a historically honest \nreading of the necessary and proper clause. If not stop!'' Such a \nsubjectively narrow reading of the Constitution could ostensibly result \nin the overturning of many laws intended to protect the rights of \nindividuals. He assured the Senate at his recent hearing that he would \nnot read the Constitution so narrowly if he were promoted, but in 1988 \nhe also assured the Senate that he would resign from a discriminatory \nclub the following year, a promise he did not keep. I am not sure his \nassurances on the important issue of the scope of Congressional power \nshould be credited now.\n  Similarly, Judge Smith gave a speech at the 1997 National Convention \nof the Federalist Society on ``The Federalization of Criminal Law.'' In \nit he criticized the invocation of federal jurisdiction via the \nCommerce Clause in a ``routine'' car bombing case under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n844, as well as the ``rape-shield'' amendments to the Federal Rules of \nEvidence which generally bars evidence of a rape victim's sexual \nhistory. Judge Smith took issue with federal intrusion into these areas \nof the law, stating that using that statute in car bombing cases and \nrules like the rape-shield rule reflect ``elitism: a mind set on the \npart of Congress and some federal prosecutors that the state court \nsystems can't be trusted to `get it right' . . . never mind the text of \nthe Constitution.'' Such statements are unsettling. It seems as though \nJudge Smith has a deep distrust that Congress does not follow the \nConstitution, despite the precedent that requires judges to give \ncongressional enactments a presumption of constitutionality.\n  Judge Smith has also written an article endorsing an idea he calls \n``benign judicial activism'' in which a judge intervenes early in a \ncase to help reach a speedy and just resolution. While this idea has \nsuperficial appeal, in practice this approach may not be so benign. In \nabout half of Judge Smith's more than 50 reversals, the Third Circuit \nreversed his decisions either to grant summary judgment in whole or in \npart to defendants in civil cases or to dismiss plaintiffs' complaints \nwith prejudice. In a number of such reversals which span his years on \nthe bench the Third Circuit took issue with his early intervention in \ncases in ways that denied plaintiffs the opportunity to have their \ncases adjudicated or tried on the merits. Thus, the Court of Appeals to \nwhich Judge Smith is now nominated has repeatedly reversed decisions of \nhis which improvidently granted summary judgment or dismissals in favor \nof civil defendants, often big, corporate defendants. This pattern, \ncombined with his speeches and conduct, raises concern.\n  Judge Smith's participation in seminars at resorts paid for by \nspecial interests is problematic. Another area of concern is that Judge \nSmith has attended a large number of educational seminars funded by \ncorporations and groups with an interest in interpreting the law a \nparticular way, in a politically or ideologically conservative way \nfavoring corporate interests. As a sitting federal judge, Judge Smith \nhas spent more than 72 days on junkets at luxury resorts on trips \nvalued at more than $37,000 which were funded by corporations and \nconservative special interest groups. Judge Smith has taken three trips \nto seminars funded by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the \nEnvironment (FREE), which promotes ``free market environmentalism,'' \nopposes environmental regulations, and gives lectures on topics like \n``Liberty and the Environment: A Case for Principled Judicial \nActivism.'' He has also taken nine trips funded by the Law and \nEconomics Center (LEC), which is affiliated with George Mason Law \nSchool and which sponsors seminars with anti-regulatory bent on topics \nlike ``Misconceptions about Environmental Pollution and Cancer.''\n\n  My colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Feingold, has \nspent a great deal of time trying to address the problem of these \njunkets. The current ethical rules do not clearly prohibit such \njudicial education seminars at luxury resorts paid for by special \ninterests, and it is difficult for outsiders to obtain information \nabout who is really footing the bill. According to one report, however, \nJudge Smith has presided over at least two dozen cases involving \ncorporations that funded LEC and he is one of the most frequent fliers \nto such seminars. I do think it is difficult to maintain the appearance \nof impartiality under such circumstances. It is axiomatic that judges \nmust be perceived as fair and impartial, and actually be so, for our \nsystem of justice to work. I am troubled by Judge Smith's insensitivity \nto such matters.\n  Judge Smith's reversals for dismissing plaintiffs' claims: I am also \nconcerned about the unsettling anti-plaintiff pattern in Judge Smith's \njudicial decisions. Judge Smith's published and unpublished decisions \nreveal numerous instances in which he has been more solicitous to \ncorporations than to plaintiffs and pro se litigants. Judge Smith has \nbeen reversed by the Third Circuit dozens of times for denying \nplaintiffs the opportunity to try the merits of their cases. In cases \ninvolving personal injuries, toxic torts, employee rights, and civil \nrights claims by prisoners, Judge Smith has been reversed for \nimprovidently granting defendants' motions for summary judgment, \nprematurely dismissing plaintiffs' complaints, and inappropriately \ndenying motions for injunctive relief without giving the plaintiffs a \nhearing.\n  Overall, Judge Smith has been reversed 51 times, including 18 \nunpublished reversals, in 14 years. In contrast, Judge Pickering was \nreversed 28 times in 11 years and Judge Barrington Parker, one of \nPresident Bush's nominees who was confirmed last fall, was\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\nreversed nine times in 11 years on the district court bench. The Third \nCircuit's reversals suggest that Judge Smith's political philosophy \ngreatly influences the outcome in cases before him. Of the many \nproblematic reversals and published, as well as unpublished, decisions \nof Judge Smith on the district court, three are particularly \nillustrative of his approach to claims of plaintiffs, but there are \nmany others that raise concerns.\n  In Metzgar v. Playskool, 30 F.3d 459 (3d Cir. 1994), for example, \nthree Reagan appointees reversed Judge Smith's dismissal by summary \njudgment to the corporate defendant that had been sued for the death of \na 15-month-old child who choked on a wooden block marketed without a \nwarning label. Judge Smith granted summary judgment to the corporation \non his theory that choking is an obvious danger and therefore no \nexpress warning was necessary. The Third Circuit was ``troubled'' by \nJudge Smith's analysis and his reliance on flawed statistics. The \nappellate court concluded that Judge Smith should have given the jury a \nchance to consider whether the blocks were so obviously dangerous that \nno specific warning was needed for parents of toddlers.\n  In Wicker v. Consolidated Rail Corporation, 143 F.3d 690 (3d Cir. \n1998), Judge Smith was reversed for granting summary judgment to an \nemployer sued under the Federal Employees Liability Act (FELA) for \ninjuries caused by exposure to toxic solvents, degreasers and paints \nillegally dumped and buried by the employer. Smith granted the \ncorporation's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the \nworkers had signed a release settling prior, unrelated injury claims \nagainst the railroad. The Third Circuit reversed and held that FELA was \nintended to protect workers in these situations and that the releases \nseized on by Smith were invalid.\n  In Brown v. Borough of Mahaffey, 35 F.3d 846 (3d Cir. 1994), Judge \nSmith improvidently granted summary judgment to a city that refused to \nallow the plaintiff and his Pentecostal ministry access to tent revival \nmeetings in violation of their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of \nthe First Amendment. The city had intentionally locked a recently-\nerected gate to impede access to the Christian revival meetings. Judge \nSmith concluded erroneously that these actions, even if manifesting \nanti-Christian bias, did not constitute a substantial burden on the \nexercise of their religion. The Third Circuit reversed, holding that \nJudge Smith's analysis was ``inappropriate for a free exercise claim \ninvolving intentional burdening of religious exercise'' because \n``[a]pplying such a burden test to non-neutral government actions would \nmake petty harassment of religious institutions and exercise immunity \nfrom the protection of the First Amendment.'' The Third Circuit \ncompletely disagreed with Judge Smith's hostile decision in which he \nstated that the plaintiff's ``invocation of the First Amendment \nprovisions guaranteeing religious liberty in so glaring a piece of \nspiteful litigation is insulting to the principles protected by that \nconstitutional amendment.'' I was shocked by Judge Smith's rough and \ndisrespectful treatment of the legitimate claims of people of faith in \nthis case.\n\n  This unsettling pattern created by Judge Smith's judicial decisions, \nhis high level of participation in right wing, special interest-funded \njunkets, his activist and insensitive speeches, his late recusal in \ncases involving his substantial financial interests, and his very \nbelated resignation from a discriminatory club create a very \nunfavorable impression. Judge Smith's defense to each of these \nsignificant problems seems to be that he actually is a fair judge \ndespite the appearance that he is not. I am not convinced that his \nrecord warrants a promotion to a higher court.\n  Judge Smith's cramped and self-serving approach to the ethical rules \nthat are supposed to govern federal judges is particularly troubling. \nHe seems to think he is above the rules. His actual record of conduct \non and off the bench creates a negative impression that is not \nreflected in Judge Smith's apparent popularity among his friends. I \nhave no doubt that Judge Smith is an intelligent and charismatic \nperson. What his record as a whole, not just as a colleague or friend, \ncalls into question is his sensitivity, his fairness, his impartiality \nand his judgment. It calls into question how seriously he has taken his \npromises and assurances to the Senate in the past and recently, as well \nas how seriously he has taken his oath as judge to administer justice \nto all persons equally and to do equal right to the poor and to the \nrich. The record Judge Smith's own record of performance as a federal \njudge over these past 14 years does not merit his promotion to one of \nthe highest courts in the land. Based on that record, I will vote \nagainst confirmation.\n  My good friend from Utah is waiting patiently. I withhold the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, hearing my colleague, one might forget that \nthis is the U.S. Senate rather than some whacky politically correct \ncollege campus--Berkeley on the Potomac. The fact is, this judge is one \nof the most respected judges in all of Pennsylvania. He has virtually \neverybody in western Pennsylvania on his side. He has served 14 years \non the Federal bench and has done a very good job in doing so. He is \nhighly respected and has the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation--the gold standard, according to our colleagues from the \nother side. And he did not break his word.\n  The fact is, the law was different than was explained to him when he \nappeared before the committee, and it is still different than the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont has been making out here today.\n  I often hear my colleagues talk about the Clinton nominees who were \nleft at the end of the 106th Congress, but I rarely hear them mention \nthe 54 nominees who were left at the end of the Democratic-controlled \n102nd Congress when George Herbert Walker Bush was President. If we are \ngoing to waste our time looking back on nominations past instead of \nlooking ahead, let's not forget the 54 nominees the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate left at the end of the 102nd. That is 13 more than \nthe number of Clinton nominees left at the end of the 106th whom we \nhear so much about, and about 17 of them didn't have a chance anyway. \nThe rest of them there were for reasons. Some of them, the blue slips \nweren't returned by Senators. You can't call them up.\n  I don't really think to talk about past congressional action on \nnominations in any way furthers the work we have been doing as a \ncommittee. However, it is difficult to listen to only a select portion \nof what has occurred in the past without trying to set the record \nstraight. Those Bush 1 nominees who were never confirmed are just as \nimportant as these Clinton nominees who have been complained about, and \nthere were far more of them than there were Clinton nominees left over. \nIt is just a matter of fact. Whoever is President, you have some \nnominees left over. But there were a lot more left over by Democrats \nthan there were by Republicans.\n  Let me name some of them: Jay C. Waldman of the Third Circuit, \nnominated for the Third Circuit; Franklin Van Antwerpen, Third Circuit; \nLillian R. BeVier, Fourth Circuit; Terrence W. Boyle, Fourth Circuit, \nwho has been sitting here for 14 months, nominated again 10 years \nlater; Francis Keating II, current Governor of Oklahoma, the Tenth \nCircuit; Sidney A. Fitzwater, Fifth Circuit; John G. Roberts, again, \nnominated by the second Bush 10 years later, sat there all those months \nin the first Bush, and now he is sitting here for 14 months in this \nadministration; John A. Smietanka, Sixth Circuit; Frederico Moreno, \nEleventh Circuit; Justin P. Wilson, Sixth Circuit; James R. McGregor, \nWestern District of Pennsylvania; Edmund Kavanagh, Northern District of \nNew York; Thomas Sholtz, Southern District of Florida; Andrew O'Rourke, \nSouthern District of New York.\n  There are plenty of names and an awful lot more than were left at the \nend of the Clinton administration, and with very little justification. \nThey have seldom mentioned that the all-time confirmation champion was \nRonald Reagan with 382 judges. He had 6 years of a favorable party \nSenate. His own party controlled the Senate. He got 382 judges through. \nPresident Clinton, with the opposition party controlling the Senate, \nwith me as chairman,\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\nas a member of the opposition party, got 377 judges through, virtually \nthe same number as the all-time confirmation champion, Ronald Reagan.\n  Continuing my list of judges: Tony Graham, Northern District of \nOklahoma; Carlos Bea, Northern District of California; James Franklin \nSouthern District of Georgia; David Trager, Eastern District of New \nYork; Kenneth Carr, Western District of Texas; James Jackson, Northern \nDistrict of Ohio; Terral Smith, Western District of Texas;, Paul \nSchechtman, Southern District of New York; Percy Anderson, Central \nDistrict of California; recently confirmed; Lawrence Davis, Eastern \nDistrict of Missouri; Andrew Hane, Southern District of Texas; recently \nconfirmed; Russell Lloyd, Southern District of Texas; John Walter, \nCentral District of California; recently confirmed; Gene Vougts, \nWestern District of Missouri; Manuel Quintana, Southern District of New \nYork; Charles Banks, Eastern District of Arkansas; Robert Hunter, \nNorthern District of Alabama; Maureen Mahoney, Eastern District of \nVirginia; James Mitchell, District of Nebraska; Ronald Leighton, \nDistrict of Oklahoma; William Quarles, District of Maryland; James \nMcIntyre, Southern District of California; Leonard Davis, Eastern \nNorthern District of Texas; recently confirmed; Douglas Drushal, \nNorthern District of Ohio; Christopher Hagy, Northern District of \nGeorgia; Lewis Leonatti, Eastern District of Missouri; Raymond Finch, \nNorthern District of Vermont; James McMonagle, Northern District of \nOhio; Katherine Armentrout, District of Maryland; Larry Hicks, District \nof Nevada; Richard Casey, Southern District of New York; Edgar \nCampbell, Middle District of Georgia; Joanna Seyvert, Eastern District \nof New York; Robert Kostelka, Western Northern District of Louisiana; \nRichard Dorr, Western District of Missouri; has had a hearing; James \nPayne, District of Oklahoma, confirmed this congress; Walter Prince, \nDistrict of Massachusetts; George O'Toole, Jr., District of \nMassachusetts; William Dimetroulas, Southern District of Florida; Henry \nSaad, Eastern District of Michigan--not to mention Kenneth Ryskamp, \nwho, like Charles Pickering, was voted down in committee and never \nreceived a full Senate vote.\n  Let me also say I am going to get into this because I didn't think we \nwould get down to the point where we started talking about a 115-member \nclub that is a social club, not a business club, and virtually \neverybody knows it. To make that the big brouhaha that this is supposed \nto be is just almost beyond belief to me. I didn't want to have to talk \nabout that, but I will be happy to.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for Judge D. Brooks Smith \nwhom the President nominated on September 10 of last year for the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals to be confirmed today or tomorrow. It has been \nover 5 months since his committee hearing. It has been over 60 days \nsince the Judiciary Committee reported Judge Smith's nomination \nfavorably to the Senate. I am disappointed, however, with the treatment \nJudge Smith is getting from those whose well-funded business it is to \noppose President Bush's nominees.\n  I have warned before of the growing power of the extreme left of \nmainstream special interest groups upon the judicial confirmation \nprocess. Almost all of them are right here in this town. My colleagues \nknow full well that when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \ndid not welcome conservative groups telling the committee how to vote \nand what to do. I told them to get lost. I even directed my staff to \nrefuse briefings from them and even meetings with them. But the \nevidence indicates a very different relationship now to liberal special \ninterest groups that seem to call the shots.\n\n  Newspapers from the Wall Street Journal to the Washington Post have \ncommented on these liberal special interest groups and on their control \nof this process. But it is not a matter of opinion; here is the \nevidence. I would like to have printed in the Record evidence of this \nunfortunate relationship. First is a fundraising letter from People for \nthe American Way taking credit for the rather shameless defeat of Judge \nCharles Pickering's nomination; second, a letter from a liberal \nHispanic organization telling the committee not to bring up the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada until August to give them time to prepare \na Pickering-like campaign against him. The President nominated Miguel \nEstrada over 1 full year ago. He would be the first Hispanic to sit on \nthe Nation's second most influential court. But the Democratic \nleadership refuses to give him a hearing. Now I think we know why.\n  Lastly, I want to have printed in the Record a press release from the \nNational Organization For Women, issued just hours after the Judiciary \nCommittee voted to report favorably the nomination of Judge Brooks \nSmith to the full Senate. It appears that NOW and other radical liberal \ngroups have demanded that the Democrat leadership come to the floor and \nfight to defeat Judge Smith.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the documents I have just referenced be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  People for the American Way,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2002.\n       In the past couple of weeks, the Wall Street Journal's \n     notoriously right-wing editorial board has twice attacked \n     People For the American Way--and me personally--in \n     particularly venomous language. Being called a ``race-card \n     specialist'' is not the best way to start the day. (You think \n     I'd be used to it given that the Journal's editorial board \n     has run more than two dozen attacks on me over the years, \n     especially during my tenure at the Leadership Conference on \n     Civil Rights as I chaired the successful coalition battle to \n     keep Robert Bork off the U.S. Supreme Court.)\n       But there's good news in those unfair and inaccurate \n     poison-pen editorials. As a longtime progressive ally \n     recently reminded me, they don't come after us like that \n     unless they think we're winning.\n       In this case their fears were well founded. On March 14, \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to reject the nomination \n     of Judge Charles Pickering to a lifetime appointment to the \n     U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. People For the American Way \n     played a crucial leadership role in the broad progressive \n     coalition effort to defeat this nomination in the face of \n     attacks from the far right, the GOP Senate leadership, and \n     the White House. Even before the vote, the far right had been \n     coming after us with all the rhetorical fury they can muster. \n     I can only imagine what will happen now that it is clear we \n     won't let them complete their ideological takeover of the \n     federal courts without a fight.\n       Pat Robertson recently told millions of his television \n     viewers that People For the American Way is ``bad news for \n     America. They don't tell the truth, and what they're doing is \n     essentially smearing this man.'' Robertson's son Gordon, the \n     heir apparent to the evangelist's empire, used the same \n     television platform to accuse People For the American Way of \n     ``anti-Christian bigotry,'' telling viewers we opposed \n     Pickering because he is a Christian. Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle \n     Forum has denounced People For the American Way and our \n     allies as an ``Unholy Alliance'' while calling Democratic \n     members of the Senate Judiciary Committee the ``Tyrannical \n     Ten.''\n       Ultra-conservative senators like Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch \n     and Mitch McConnell have gone after us and other Pickering \n     critics. And right-wing pundits on the Internet are even \n     worse, making totally irresponsible and inflammatory remarks.\n       The increasing frequency and harshness of the attacks \n     directed against People For the American Way reflect more \n     than anything else our leadership role in the progressive \n     movement and the effectiveness of our work. We've been \n     accused of aiding America's enemies for standing up to \n     Attorney General John Ashcroft and his assaults on the \n     Constitution. We've been attacked as anti-Christian bigots \n     for defending separation of church and state. And now we're \n     being attacked for fighting to preserve the federal courts as \n     a refuge for people seeking to have their civil rights and \n     civil liberties protected.\n       The recent Judiciary Committee vote was the first victory \n     in what will certainly be a long and fierce struggle over the \n     future of the federal judiciary and the rights and freedoms \n     protected by our Constitution.\n       I hope that you will take this opportunity to become a \n     member of People For the American Way or to continue your \n     support. At this watershed moment in our history, we would be \n     proud and honored to march forward with you as our partner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ralph G. Neas,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         Mexican American Legal Defense & Educational Fund, \n           National Association of Latino Elected & Appointed \n           Officials, National Council of La Raza, National Puerto \n           Rican Coalition, Puerto Rican Legal Defense & Education \n           Fund,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As national Latino civil rights \n     organizations, we write on a matter of great importance to \n     U.S. Latinos, and all Americans--the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Although \n     historically we have expressed our views on judicial nominees \n     with different levels of frequency, we are united in our view \n     that all federal judicial appointments are important because \n     they are life-long appointments, because they are positions \n     of great symbolism, and because federal judges interpret the \n     U.S. Constitution and federal laws serving as the balance to \n     the legislative and executive branches of the federal \n     government. While the Supreme Court is the highest court, the \n     appellate courts wield considerable power. During its most \n     recent term, the Supreme Court heard only 83 cases, while the \n     circuit courts decided 57,000 cases. As a practical matter, \n     circuit courts set the precedent in most areas of federal \n     law.\n       We are united at this time around our belief that Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination deserves full, thoughtful, and \n     deliberate consideration. The President proposes to place Mr. \n     Estrada, who has no judicial experience, on arguably the \n     single most important federal appeals court to decide a \n     myriad of statutory and regulatory issues that directly \n     affect the Latino community. Every appointment to a powerful \n     court is important as we recently witnesses in the Supreme \n     Court's 5-4 decision in Hoffman Plastics that stripped \n     undocumented workers of certain labor law protections. This \n     decision, which inevitably will result in increased \n     exploitation of the undocumented, as well as weaker labor \n     standards for all low-wage workers, underscores the \n     importance of nominations such as this one, not just to \n     Hispanics, but all Americans.\n       This decision comes on the heels of a series of Supreme \n     Court decisions which, in our view, have unnecessarily and \n     incorrectly narrowed civil rights and other protections for \n     Latinos. While we look to see if judicial nominees meet \n     certain basic requirements such as honesty, integrity, \n     character, temperament, and intellect, we also look for \n     qualities that go beyond the minimum requirements. We look to \n     see if a nominee, regardless of race or ethnicity, has a \n     demonstrated commitment to protecting the rights of \n     ordinary U.S. residents and to preserving and expanding \n     the progress that has been made on civil rights, including \n     rights protected through core provisions in the \n     Constitution, such as the Equal Protection Clause and Due \n     Process Clause, as well as through the statutory \n     provisions that protect our legal rights.\n       We are aware that some are demanding a commitment from you \n     and the Judiciary Committee to announce a date certain for \n     action on Mr. Estrada's nomination. We agree with the \n     proposition that every nominee deserves timely consideration. \n     For this reason, we urged the Senate to act on the nomination \n     of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     who was forced to wait for four years before being confirmed. \n     We also believe, however, that if a nominee's record is \n     sparse the Judiciary Committee should allow sufficient time \n     for those interested in evaluating his record, including the \n     U.S. Senate, to complete a thorough and comprehensive review \n     of the nominee's record. We therefore respectfully request \n     that you consider scheduling a hearing no earlier than \n     August, prior to the scheduled recess. This leaves sufficient \n     time for action prior to adjournment if his record is strong \n     enough to receive substantial bipartisan support.\n       In the interim, we pledge to conduct a fair and thoughtful \n     assessment of Mr. Estrada's record, and to communicate our \n     views on his nomination to you, Ranking Member Hatch, and \n     other Committee members in a timely manner.\n           Sincerely,\n     Antonia Hernandez,\n       President and General Counsel, Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund.\n     Raul Yzaguirre,\n       President, National Council of La Raza.\n     Manuel Mirabal,\n       President, National Puerto Rican Coalition.\n     Juan Figueroa,\n       President and General Counsel, Puerto Rican Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund.\n     Arturo Vargas,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Latino Elected \n     and Appointed Officials.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the National Organization for Women, May 23, 2002]\n\n   Judiciary Committee Vote Insults Women; NOW Vows Campaign in Full \n                                 Senate\n\n                             (By Kim Gandy)\n\n       The field of credible Democrats running for President was \n     significantly narrowed today when two rumored candidates \n     insulted every employed woman, every woman in business, and \n     every woman who has been a victim of violence in this \n     country. In casting their votes to promote Judge D. Brooks \n     Smith to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, only one step \n     below the Supreme Court, rumored candidates Sen. Joseph \n     Biden, D-Del., and Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., disregarded the \n     extensive evidence of unethical behavior and discriminatory \n     conduct that caused the Washington Post, New York Times and \n     Los Angeles Times to oppose Smith's confirmation.\n       In an embarrassingly convoluted rationale, Biden expressed \n     disappointment in Smith's strong criticism of the Violence \n     Against Women Act (VAWA), but said it would be a ``double \n     standard'' to vote against Smith because Supreme Court Chief \n     Justice William Rehnquist held a similar opinion on VAWA. \n     Apparently Biden doesn't recall that his vote for Rehnquist \n     was cast many years before VAWA was even introduced. As for a \n     ``double standard,'' someone should tell Sen. Biden that \n     double nothing is still nothing. Biden's previous leadership \n     on violence against women is just that--previous. He has \n     jettisoned it in favor of friendship--his stated presumption \n     of supporting any nominee sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-\n     Pa. No doubt the people of Delaware will want to know that \n     they have elected a Republican from Pennsylvania to represent \n     them.\n       Another Presidential wanna-be, Sen. Edwards, hid out in his \n     office across the hall from the hearing, and didn't even have \n     the courage to case his ``Yes'' vote in public. Sen. Herbert \n     Kohl, D-Wis., joined all of the committee Republicans, whose \n     cowardly votes betrayed the women of their states by \n     recommending elevation of a judge whose repeated ``ethical \n     lapses'' deserve censure, not promotion.\n       The Senate's reputation as an ``Old Boys Club'' was \n     reinforced by today's vote, in which both of the women on the \n     Judiciary Committee voted against Smith, but he won anyway \n     because 12 of the 17 men voted in his favor. To promote a \n     judge who will have to decide on cases of discrimination, \n     when that judge has himself cavalierly participated in \n     discrimination and even ruled in favor of discriminatory \n     practices, is the height of irresponsibility by those who are \n     charged with that duty.\n       NOW commends both of the women who serve on the Judiciary \n     Committee, Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Maria \n     Cantwell, D-Wash., whose votes against confirming Smith spoke \n     volumes, as well as Committee Chair Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who \n     spoke eloquently about discrimination against women, and \n     Senators Richard Durbin, D-Ill., Russ Feingold, D-Wis., \n     Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.\n       NOW intends to seek a filibuster in the Senate against \n     Judge Smith's confirmation, and will urge every Senator to \n     participate who cares about protecting the last 40 years of \n     progress women have made. The Judiciary Committee's vote for \n     D. Brooks Smith made a mockery of judicial standards. Unless \n     the full Senate reverses, it will send a message to women \n     that they can't expect to have civil rights--or ethics--taken \n     seriously by the Senate or the courts.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Referring in the most vitriolic terms to my friends, \nSenators Biden and Edwards, voting for Judge Smith in committee, NOW \nbegins by saying:\n\n       The field of credible Democrats running\n     for President was significantly narrowed\n     today. . . .\n\n  This is simply because these Senators exercised their independent \njudgment and supported Judge Smith. Honoring the President's \nprerogative to nominate judges should hardly be a cause to attack my \nDemocrat colleagues or take them out of a potential Presidential \ncandidacy or race.\n  Rather than speak further about Judge Smith's enemies, I would like \nto speak about his friends. I think an editorial in the liberal \nPittsburgh Post-Gazette put Judge Smith's nomination best when they \nwrote:\n\n       Outside Washington's world of partisan politics, Smith \n     seems to have no enemies, only admirers. Those who have \n     watched him work say an exemplary 14-year record in the \n     Federal bench in Western Pennsylvania is being twisted by \n     political opportunists. His popularity outside the capital \n     extends even to members of the opposing political party, who \n     describe him as fair, hard-working, and respectful to all.\n\n  I hope I am not alone in this Senate in finding this home-town report \nmuch more reliable and convincing than the hit pieces circulated by the \nWashington left-wing special interest groups, or for that matter the \nNew York Times, which I read faithfully everyday and respect in many \nways--but not in this instance.\n  But given the bipartisan support Judge Smith enjoys from the people \nwho know him best, and his stellar\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nrecord, I find it most difficult to accept that the opposition to him \nhas centered on his belonging to an all-male, family oriented fishing \nclub where his father first taught him to fly fish--the same rustic \nclub that Jimmy and Roslyn Carter have visited to escape, relax, and \nfish.\n  If this is the kind of thing that members of the body use as an \nexcuse for thwarting the President's judicial nominations, then the \nAmerican people will have a big laugh at our expense. And rightly so.\n  In fact, there are hundreds of small, family-oriented fishing clubs \nlike the one Judge Smith belonged to all across this country from \nWashington to North Carolina. I even pointed out the website called \nwww.womensflyfishing.net, which lists the 60 or so women-only fishing \nclubs across the country.\n  We are far from those days when prestigious downtown clubs kept women \nout of their facilities, and in any case that is not the nature of \nJudge Smith's family-oriented, fly-fishing club. The special interest \ngroups out to get Judge Smith on this count are proving that when the \nonly tool you have is a hammer, everything you see starts looking like \na nail.\n  In fact, there is a rich mosaic of single gender social clubs in this \ncountry that are entirely unobjectionable to any reasonable person. You \nshould not be surprised to know, Mr. President, that this country is \nwell-served by over 6,500 women's only clubs of every size.\n  Are Judge Smith's opponents in this Senate really prepared to say \nthat the members of the important Francesca Club in San Francisco or \nthe powerful Raleigh Women's Club, or the Junior Leagues throughout the \nSouth and all over the country, or the Masons, or the Knights of \nColumbus cannot serve as judges?\n  Perhaps the reason for this misguided line of attack on Judge Smith \nlies in the fact that, in his 1988 confirmation hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, he stated that he believed the Judicial Code would \nrequire him to try to open the club to women, and to resign if he \nfailed. But the fact is that he was wrong in that belief. The Judicial \nCode does not require resignation from clubs whose principal purpose is \nsocial, that do not function as public accommodations serving food to \nthe public, or whose principal purpose is other than business.\n  Mr. President, the building you saw has a living room, a kitchen, two \nbathrooms, and six bedrooms on the second floor. It is not a great big \nbuilding, even though they blew up a picture to make it look like it \nwas. Even if it was, it is used only for social purposes, and then by a \nmembership of 115.\n  By the way, that club does not have public accommodations. It does \nnot serve food to the public. It does not do business with the public.\n  No legalistic parsing of words can change this fact, even though any \nmotivated lawyer can certainly confuse the issue, as we have seen in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  It is not surprising, of course, that the Judge Smith's detractors \nhave chosen to disregard the clear constitutional standards articulated \nby the Supreme Court as well as the letter of the public accommodations \nlaw of Pennsylvania. After 1988, when the issue of single gender clubs \nwas at its most heated peak, the Judicial Conference adopted standards \npursuant to Supreme Court's decisions. It made clear that there was \nnothing--absolutely nothing--improper about a judge or nominee \nbelonging to single-gender clubs, which exist in great numbers for both \nwomen and men in this country, so long as the association or club \nexhibits certain attributes of privacy first articulated by the Supreme \nCourt in the 1984 case of Roberts v. Jaycees.\n  Judge Smith was under no obligation to make efforts to open the club \nto women--as he promised this committee--or to resign from the club. \nBut he did both, even though he had no obligation to do so.\n  Opposing Judge Smith because he used to belong to a fisher-men's club \nis most absurd when contrasted with Judge Smith's record. Judge Smith, \nwho currently serves as Chief Judge for the Western District of \nPennsylvania, has earned a reputation for competence, fairness, and \njudicial temperament during 14 years as a Federal judge.\n  I used to practice law in that district and tried cases in the \nFederal District Court of Western Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Smith was appointed to that job at age 36--he was one of the \nyoungest Federal judges in the country--and he came to it with \nexperience as a state court judge, as a prosecutor, and as a private \npractitioner.\n  His nomination is supported by lawyers, judges, and public figures \nfrom across the political spectrum. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a \nrespected newspaper with a liberal editorial viewpoint, has endorsed \nhis nomination three times.\n  The accounts of the people who know Brooks Smith best became real to \nme a few weeks ago when I listened to tremendously moving stories of \nwomen lawyers from Pennsylvania who recounted emotionally powerful \nevents where Judge Smith bent over backwards to help them succeed as \npregnant women and mothers in the practice of law.\n  The truth is that Judge Smith is supported in the strongest possible \nterms by the women leaders and members of the Women's Bar Association \nof Western Pennsylvania, the Allegheny County Bar Association, and the \nBlair Bedford Domestic Abuse Advisory Board, to name a few.\n  The Women's Bar Association gave Judge Smith their Susan B. Anthony \nAward ``because of his commitment to eradicating gender bias in the \ncourt system.'' That is a remarkable laud. The officers of the Women's \nBar have also stated that they ``did not receive a single complaint \nconcerning Judge Smith.''\n  To attempt now to taint Judge Smith as being insensitive to women's \nrights or interests is really beyond the pale of fairmindedness, if not \ndecency.\n  Judge Smith, who is currently the Chief Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, has earned a reputation for competence, \nfairness, and judicial temperament during his 13\\1/2\\ years as a \nFederal judge. He was appointed to that job at age 36--he was one of \nthe youngest Federal judges in the country--and he came to it with \nexperience as a State-court judge, as a prosecutor, and as a private \npractitioner.\n  I briefly recount Judge Smith's record because it highlights the \nnature of the prejudice that occurs when a nominee or any person is \njudged on a single, private and lawful lifestyle choice. It seems to me \nthat the root of all intolerance begins with just that act: to judge a \nperson's entire worth based on a single characteristic, whether it be \nhow a person exercises his or her freedom or religion or his of her \nfreedom of association, which, like religion, has contributed so much \nto this Nation's unmatched vitality.\n  I believe the Senate suffered a great shame when it ruined whole \ncareers in the 1950s by asking a single infamous question intruding \ninto the freedom of association. I was ashamed when the Judiciary \nCommittee echoed this question last year by questioning nominees about \nthe Federalist Society, as distinguished an association of lawyers as \nthere could be. Now the special interest groups are asking the Senate \nto deny the President's nominee a confirmation on the basis of a fly \nfishing club.\n  I fear the American people, are going to roll their eyes at the \nSenate with these type of accusations. But the truth of it is that if \nwe disregard the right of lawful association, it will be no laughing \nmatter.\n  The Supreme Court first recognized the freedom of association in 1958 \nas an extension of first amendment free speech in NAACP v. Alabama, and \nmost recently it reaffirmed the right in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale.\n  It is a right, as Justice Thurmond Marshall wrote, ``which our system \nhonors'' and that encourages ``all-white, all-black, all-brown, all-\nyellow clubs, as well as all-Catholic, all-Jewish as well as all-\nagnostic clubs to be established.'' And, it is a right that applies, \nMr. President, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted, to clubs whose \npurposes would be ``undermined if they were unable to confine their \nmembership to those of the same sex, race, religion, or ethnic \nbackground.''\n  We should be glad that our personal politics are trumped by this \nAmerican freedom because it has protected groups as diverse as the \nCommunist Party and the Moose Lodge, and from the NAACP to the Boy \nScouts of America. The freedom of association has\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nprotected the thousand points of light that have made this country's \npublic life so vibrant. And it helps to distinguish us from those \nforeign places where people are shunned or even imprisoned for mere \nmemberships in unpopular associations.\n  While the constitutional right of association at first related to \nexpressive association and protected unpopular groups, like the NAACP, \nin 1984, the Supreme Court articulated the right of intimate \nassociation concerning clubs such as Judge Smith's small fishing club. \nIt did so while enforcing Minnesota's public accommodations law against \na large single gender organization organized principally for business \npurposes. That is not the case here. The Court described the attributes \nof such intimate associations that the Constitution honors, including \n``relative smallness.'' That is the case here. Judge Smith's former \nclub has only 115 members. It has been around for a lot of years and \nhas had both women and men enjoy the benefits.\n  An intimate association, said Justice Brennan, writing for the Court, \nmust be protected ``as a fundamental element of personal liberty,'' and \n``must be secured against undue intrusion . . . because of the role of \nsuch relationships in safeguarding the individual freedom central to \nour constitutional scheme.'' As Justice Brennan explained, such small \nclubs transmit our culture and ``foster diversity.'' They foster \npluralism.\n  I for one stand by our freedom of association. As Justice Thurmond \nMarshall pointed out, it is a freedom that has helped make this country \ngreat, and a freedom we honor. I hope that all on this Committee do \nalso, and that Judges, or people who might want to be Judges someday, \nare just as free as anyone else to exercise that right lawfully.\n  Now, Senators who do not share my reverence for this First Amendment \nright will be interested to know that the State of Pennsylvania has a \nlaw against clubs that discriminate on the basis of gender. \nPennsylvania has not sought to regulate the club Judge Smith resigned \nfrom--and for a good reason: that club does not violate the law against \ndiscrimination.\n  In fact, Pennsylvania courts have found single-gender clubs to be \npermissible not on the basis of First Amendment rights, but as a \nprivacy right, citing Griswold v. Connecticut. It would certainly be an \nentertaining footnote to Griswold jurisprudence if opponents of Judge \nSmith, who have seen fit to probe Judge Smith's views on Griswold, \nvoted against him for exercising privacy rights emanating from that \nvery case.\n  The special interest groups that are working to discredit Judge Smith \napparently think that President Bush's circuit court nominees deserve \nto have their records distorted and their reputations dragged through \nthe mud. But I don't think that any judicial nominee deserves such \ntreatment, and that was something I practiced as chairman for 6 of \nPresident Clinton's 8 years in office.\n  I strongly agree with the Washington Post editorial of February 19, \n2002, and nobody would suggest the Washington Post is a conservative \nnewspaper, that ``opposing a nominee should not mean destroying him.'' \nThe Post pointed out, ``The need on the part of liberal groups and \nDemocratic senators to portray a nominee as a Neanderthal--all the \nwhile denying they are doing so--in order to justify voting him down is \nthe latest example of the degradation of the confirmation process.''\n  I continue to hope that my colleagues will be sensitive to the \ndangers to the judiciary and to the reputation of this body that will \ncertainly result from the repeated practice of degrading honorable and \naccomplished people who are will to put their talents to work in the \npublic service. I urge my colleagues to examine Judge Smith on his \nrecord, and not on superficial and unsubstantiated allegations.\n  When Judge Smith comes for a vote we will have the opportunity to \nshow that the senate is focused on the merits of President Bush's \nnominees, and is not out to obstruct them in the name of sensibilities \nfar from the mainstream of the American people. I hope we take it. I \nhope we vote favorably on a fine judge.\n  My colleague has made a point in the past that somehow men's clubs \nare problematic and powerful and that women's clubs are somehow \ndifferent and poorer. That is not a problem. I have a photo of an all-\nwomen's club. This is the Sulgrave Club of Washington. I, for one, \nbelieve they have a right to have an all-women's club.\n  If my colleagues have trouble seeing the club, it is a mansion. It is \nnot just a living room, kitchen, and six bedrooms upstairs. It is the \nbuilding behind the Jaguar, the Lexis and, of course, the Mercedes. It \nis not itty-bitty by anybody's stretch of the imagination. And it is \nprobably in a historical landmark situation.\n  My colleague has also mentioned the ethicists who have written to \ncondemn Judge Smith. Other ethicists have written to support Judge \nSmith.\n  One of these Democrat ethicists, by the way, is the one standing on \nthe car. If my colleagues cannot see it because it is a little dark, \nmaybe the camera can come in a little closer. That is one of the \nethicists they can get to write almost any opinion they want. This \nethicist has argued in favor of introducing false testimony into a \ntrial and argued perjured testimony to a jury.\n  This is a photograph of another of the regulars who write to denounce \nPresident Bush's nominees. I might add, again, he is the one standing \non top of the police car. We expect to have a lot of other letters from \nthis particular ethicist.\n  This is the type of stuff we are putting up with. I think it is time \nto stop it. I think it is legitimate for people to differ on a judge's \nqualification from time to time, but there is little or no reason to \ndiffer on this one. This is a good man.\n  I hold a license in that area. I know the top lawyers in that area. I \ntried against a number of the top lawyers in that area. I have to say I \ndo not know any of them who are not in favor of Judge Smith, and that \nought to count more than some of these bits of calumny that have been \nthrown his way by some who do not like President Bush's nominees.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will vote against the confirmation of \nJudge D. Brooks Smith to the United States Court of Appeals for the \nThird Circuit. While Judge Smith is an intelligent jurist, I believe \nthat his serious ethical lapses, and his record of reversals by the \nThird Circuit in cases concerning civil rights, and the rights of \nworkers, environmental protection and consumer safety suggest that \nSmith has not met his burden of showing that he should be elevated to \nthe Third Circuit.\n  Judge Smith's handling of his membership in the Spruce Creek Rod and \nGun club, a club whose by-laws explicitly forbid the admission of \nwomen, gives me great concern. I am disturbed by Judge Smith's failure \nto resign from the Spruce Creek Club in a timely manner despite his \nsworn oral and explicit written promise to this committee at the time \nof his 1988 confirmation hearing. Smith promised that if he was \nunsuccessful in trying to change the club's membership policies he \nwould resign, but he failed to do so for another 11 years, until 1999.\n  Rather than provide a simple explanation, or an apology, for his \nfailure to fulfill this promise, Judge Smith claimed at his hearing \nthat the Judicial Code of Conduct, the ethical rules governing judges, \ndid not actually require resignation from the club. According to Smith, \nthe Spruce Creek Club is purely a social club and is thus exempt from \nthe rules. This strikes me as disingenuous. Judge Smith's 1999 \nresignation letter to Spruce Creek made clear that he was resigning \nfrom the club because its male-only admissions policies ``continue to \nbe at odds with current expectations of Federal judicial conduct,'' \nsuggesting that he knew the club's membership policy was in conflict \nwith the Judicial Code of Conduct.\n  Contrary to Judge Smith's representations, it also appears that the \nSpruce Creek Club is not merely a social club, but a place where \nbusiness is conducted. Three ethicists, including one who wrote at the \nbehest of the Ranking Minority Member of the Judiciary Committee, have \nwritten that if the Spruce Creek Club can be used for business \npurposes, its exclusion of women would violate the Judicial Code of \nConduct. The President of Spruce Creek Club has acknowledged that \nmembers of this club are allowed to host a variety of meetings on the \npremises, and\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\nthe committee has learned that business and political meetings have \nbeen held at the club. The Code of Judicial Conduct is clear that \nexclusion of women, minorities, and others from clubs where business is \nconducted is prohibited. In addition, in 1990, this committee adopted a \nresolution stating that membership in organizations that practice \ninvidious discrimination was inappropriate for a judicial nominee. The \nresolution reflects our belief that because such membership ``may be \nviewed as a tacit endorsement of the discriminatory practices, it \nconflicts with the appearance of impartiality'' that is required of \nfederal judges. We recognized that exclusion of women and racial, \nethnic or religious minorities from social clubs that also perform \nbusiness denies these groups opportunities to make contacts with \nimportant members of the community, contacts that are often crucial to \nprofessional advancement.\n  I am also troubled by Judge Smith's approach to cases implicating \nFederal rights important to victims of discrimination, workers and the \ndisabled, and his disturbing, consistent pattern of favoring business \nand employers in these cases. Judge Smith has been reversed 51 times by \nthe Third Circuit, often by panels of conservative judges. In many of \nthese cases, Smith takes a narrow view of the laws protecting \nplaintiffs against abuses by businesses and employers.\n  For instance, in Wicker v. Conrail, a case brought under the Federal \nEmployer's Liability Act, FELA, Judge Smith was reversed by the Third \nCircuit for dismissing claims by workers who were exposed to toxic \nchemicals at their job site. The company knew the job site was \ncontaminated, but the workers did not, yet Smith found that the workers \nhad waived their claims by signing a general release settling prior, \nunrelated injury claims. The Third Circuit reversed, holding that \nclaims relating to unknown risks cannot be waived under FELA, and \nemphasized the Supreme Court's directive, ignored by Judge Smith, that \nFELA be given a ``proemployee'' construction.\n  Similarly, in Ackerman v. Warnaco, the Third Circuit reversed Smith \nfor granting summary judgment to the company with regard to ERISA \nclaims brought by former employees who were denied promised severance \npay after the company, unbeknownst to the workers, changed its written \npolicy to deny severance pay shortly before laying off the workers. \nAgain, in Unity Real Estate v. Hudson, Smith ruled against workers in a \ncase concerning the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act. \nAmazingly, Smith held that coal act, which Congress passed in 1992 to \nrequire companies to enforce collective bargaining agreements promising \nlifetime health benefits for longtime workers, amounted to an \nunconstitutional taking. One year later, in a similar case, the Third \nCircuit effectively overruled Smith's holding on this score, noting \nthat every Court of Appeals to have considered a ``takings'' challenge \nto the coal act had rejected it.\n  In addition, Judge Smith has a disturbing pattern of ruling against \nplaintiffs in civil rights cases. For instance, in United States v. \nPennsylvania, Judge Smith ruled that an institution for the mentally \ndisabled, whose violations included serving pest-infested food, \nimproperly confining residents, failing to provide appropriate medical \ntreatment, and overmedicating residents--did not violate the \nConstitution's due process clause. In another case, Schaefer v. Board \nof Public Education, Judge Smith was reversed by the Third Circuit, for \ndismissing the sex discrimination claim of a male teacher who claimed \nthat the school board's family leave policy, which entitled women, but \nnot men, to one year of unpaid leave for childbirth or ``childrearing'' \nviolated Title VII.\n  Judge Smith's pattern of ruling in favor of business is particularly \ntroubling when coupled with his frequent attendance at seminars funded \nby pro-business corporations and groups. Judge Smith spent more than 72 \ndays on junkets at luxury resorts. The trips were valued at more than \n$37,000 and sponsored by groups that promote ``free market \nenvironmentalism,'' and oppose environmental regulations. I am troubled \nby the appearance of partiality caused by Judge Smith's frequent \nattendance at such junkets given the pro-business pattern of his \nrulings.\n  Judge Smith's narrow view of congressional power to pass legislation \nunder the commerce clause, as expressed in a 1993 speech to the \nFederalist Society, also gives me great concern. In this speech, Judge \nSmith criticized the Violence Against Women's Act, which passed both \nHouses of Congress by overwhelming majorities, as exceeding Congress's \npower under the commerce clause. Judge Smith advanced a cramped reading \nof Congress' commerce clause power, stating that ``the Framers' \nprimary, if not sole, reason for giving Congress authority over \ninterstate commerce was to permit the national government to eliminate \ntrade barriers.'' Not only would Judge Smith's reading of the commerce \nclause render Congress powerless to pass statutes like the Violence \nAgainst Women's Act but, under Judge Smith's reasoning, it appears that \nany Congressional enactment other than those aimed at eliminating trade \nbarriers would be constitutionally suspect, including statutes such as \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Clean Air Act, and \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  In sum, I do not believe that Judge Smith has shown he has the \nintegrity and commitment to core constitutional values required to \njustify his elevation to the Third Circuit. I therefore oppose his \nnomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. HATCH are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will say a word about the nomination of \nD. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit. For me, my concerns with Judge \nSmith are not about ethics but about ideology. My questions are about \nhis record. My worries are about what kind of judge he has been at the \ntrial level and what kind of judge he will be at the appellate level.\n  Time and time again, the President says he is going to nominate \nconservatives in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas. Every \nindication is that he is following through with that promise.\n  At least by my standards, that is not OK. I certainly want legal \nexcellence at the highest order. Diversity ought to be at the highest \ncourts. We ought not have a bench of all like men. But I also want \nmoderation and ideological balance. Unfortunately, as they nominate \njudge after judge, hard right, out of the mainstream, far further to \nthe right than President Clinton's nominees were to the left, it is \nclear that this administration is committed to imbalance on the courts. \nFrankly, that is a strategy I cannot get behind.\n  When it comes to D. Brooks Smith, there are some red flags raised. As \na city district court judge, he gave a speech in which he criticized \nthe constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, something I am \npretty proud of because I was the author, along with Congresswoman \nLouise Slaughter in the House of Representatives. Senator Biden did a \ngreat job here in the Senate. Now, this was years before the Supreme \nCourt had addressed the Violence Against Women Act and when there was \nstill a possibility it would come before him as a judge. That is some \nvery unjudge-like behavior.\n  I asked him some simple, written questions about his views on the \nlaw. I asked him about his views on the right to privacy. I asked him \nto reconcile his views on VAWA with his views on other Federal laws \nsuch as the Endangered Species Act. The response I got, I regret to \nsay, was inadequate.\n  Judge Smith told me what the precedence said, not what he personally \nbelieves.\n  That might be OK if you are a nominee to the district court where you \ndo\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nnot have as much of a chance to make law. These days when you are \nnominated to an appellate court, when the Supreme Court takes virtually \n75 cases a year, that argument does not fly. So I wrote back to Judge \nSmith, and again I asked him about his views. I made it clear I wanted \nto know about his personal views, not what the law was, but what his \npersonal views were because we all know that influences a judge greatly \nwhen they make decisions.\n  This idea that judges are part of an ideological system and read the \nlaw in the same way is poppycock.\n  Why is it judges nominated by Democratic nominees read the law \ndifferently than judges nominated by Republican nominees? We know \nideology plays a role. There is nothing wrong with that. But we ought \nto let it into our decisionmaking.\n  Judge Smith dodged again.\n  I think I am entitled to know what a nominee thinks. I am not going \nto go about blindly confirming nominees to lifetime seats on the \nFederal courts without those answers. I am not going to vote to give \nthe judge a lifetime appointment, tremendous power, the most \nunaccountable power that our Founding Fathers gave to any single \nperson. I am not going to give that judge the power to invalidate the \nlaws passed in this legislative, duly elected body; laws that protect \nprivacy, laws that protect working people, laws that protect women, the \nenvironment. I am not going to give a judge the power to validate those \nlaws unless I know what they think of our power, the Congress's power \nas a coequal branch of Government, when it comes to these important \nissues.\n\n  I have an obligation on behalf of the 19 million New Yorkers I \nrepresent to learn those views. They want to know if the judge is too \nfar left or too far right. They want to know about things that affect \ntheir lives: How much money they are going to make; safety in the \nworkplace; how the environment is going to be treated; and if they are \na member of a minority group, how the judge regards civil rights. They \nwant to know this. I want to know.\n  I am not going to make the mistake that this body made with Clarence \nThomas, who came before this body. I was not here then. I was in the \nHouse. We don't, of course, vote on judges. He said he had no views on \nRoe v. Wade. I am not making that mistake again. I don't think any \nMember should. We all know Judge Thomas had strong views on Roe v. \nWade, but he came here and said he had none, he had never discussed it.\n  If D. Brooks Smith had given me legitimate answers to my questions, I \nmight have supported him. But his answers were not answers at all.\n  Now, I understand we cannot ask judges to precommit themselves on \nissues that come before them, even though that is what Judge Smith did \nin his VAWA speech. I don't want to put nominees in that position. When \nit comes to issues already decided, when it comes to discussing their \njudicial philosophy, when it comes to Supreme Court cases that will \nnever come before this judge, I don't get why we shouldn't know what \nthat judge thinks.\n  Every semester, first year law students are asked to critique Supreme \nCourt opinions. But someone up for a Federal judgeship will not tell us \nwhat they think about the seminal Supreme Court cases?\n  On the latest nominee for whom we had a hearing, Judge Owen, I asked \nher views. She said she doesn't think that way. She was asked to write \npapers in law school. She was asked to make opinions this way. She did \nnot want to tell us.\n  There is a trend here. There is a trend. They don't want us to know \nwhat they think because they are so far out of the mainstream that they \nnever could get picked if they told us their real views. They would \nnever get supported by this body. They will not be honest about their \nviews regarding Brown v. Board of Education or Korematus v. United \nStates or Miranda v. Arizona or Roe v. Wade?\n  Judge Smith says what he thinks about the constitutionality of a \nstatute the Supreme Court has yet to rule on, but he will not say what \nhe thinks about Supreme Court opinions that have already been issued? \nSomething is wrong with that. This nominee has it all turned around and \nit doesn't make sense.\n  The fact is, we are in the midst of a conservative judicial \nrevolution. The very same people who decried the liberal activists, who \ntook too many things too far--I am very critical of some of those \nopinions--are now doing the same thing themselves. When the hard right \nmembers of the conservative movement in the 1980s realized they could \nonly get so much of their agenda implemented through elected branches \nbecause they were too far over for the American people, they turned \ntheir focus to the courts. They started a campaign that ran through the \nReagan administration, through the first Bush administration, and \ncontinues through this administration. President Bush would like to \nportray himself as a moderate to the American people. Maybe he is. When \nI talk to him he sounds that way to me, one-on-one.\n  But if you look at who he nominates, there is hardly a moderate among \nthem, particularly at the appellate court level. The nominees are \ncommitted to an ideological agenda which turns the clock back to maybe \nthe 1930s, maybe the 1890s. They hate the Government and its power, by \nand large. They think the Federal Government has far too much power, \nwhich, let me tell you, in our post-September 11 world makes no sense.\n  So for the better part of the last decade, the commerce clause has \nbeen under assault and a whole host of laws protecting women, senior \ncitizens, the disabled, and the environment have been invalidated. Now \nthey turn their attention to the spending clause. To the average \nperson, this sounds like mine-numbing stuff. But unfortunately, it has \nreal impact on real people and it has to stop.\n  D. Brooks Smith is going to become a judge. We all know he has the \nvote. Tomorrow morning he will join a long line of judges, confirmed by \nthe Senate, who appear to be intent on curtailing congressional power \nto protect the people who elect us.\n  At some point this Senate needs to wake up to the fact that our \nPresident and his Department of Justice are playing by different rules \nwhen it comes to nominating judges. They are using ideology as litmus \ntests, and then, when we want to ask about ideology, they say no, that \nis off the table. They are doing it to the detriment of the courts and \nthe people the courts are supposed to protect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Nevada, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I remain committed to achieving \nthat goal.\n  I think that Senator Snowe made a good point when she said earlier \ntoday that there is no reason to pull the bill down and halt the \nnegotiations over the Medicare drug benefit at his point. Why not \nencourage these talks to continue over the August recess?\n  Although we got off to a rocky start when the Majority Leader decided \nto by-pass the Finance Committee to avoid the Tripartisan bill being \nreported by the Committee, I remain hopeful that we can come together \nif we stick to it.\n  Whether those talks succeed or fail, the Senate will have to dispose \nof the underlying legislation, S. 812. This is the legislation first \nintroduced by Senators McCain and Schumer that was almost completely \nrewritten by the HELP Committee via the Edwards-Collins substitute \namendment.\n  In many respects, the Committee substitute is an improvement over the \nMcCain-Schumer language. Let me hasten to say, though, there are still \nmajor problems with the language.\n  I have laid out in some detail the shortcomings in the provisions of \nthe bill that purport to fix the problems associated with the statutory \n30-month stay. We designed this stay to permit a reasonable period of \ntime to litigate the status of pioneer drug patents, but has been used \nin several cases by brand name drug manufacturers to forestall \nimproperly generic competition.\n  As this barely three-weeks old language is scrutinized by experts, \nmany are concluding that it comes up short. For example, there is an \ninteresting and growing correspondence between the architect of the \npending legislation, my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and \nthe organization that represents the Nation's biotechnology companies--\nBIO, the Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n  In its letter of July 22, 2002 to Senator Kennedy, BIO complains \nabout the:\n\n     carte blanche authority of FDA to determine testing methods \n     applicable to full NDAs, [New Drug Applications] loss of the \n     ability to protect our intellectual property because of \n     failure to meet new filing deadlines under food and drug law, \n     and an unwarranted private right of action afforded generic \n     companies to sue members in efforts to ``delist'' patents or \n     ``correct'' patent information. Whatever the purposes of \n     these provisions, we fundamentally disagree with their \n     consequences perhaps the result of producing totally new \n     provisions only 36 hours before mark-up.\n\n  Actually, I think this completely new language was not available \nuntil 24-hours before the markup.\n  It is also my information that a meeting last Friday between Senator \nKennedy's staff and BIO staff did little to clear up these objections.\n  I have no doubt that Senator Kennedy is aware this bill is opposed by \nthe Massachusetts-based biotech firm, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, as \nwell as the Massachusetts Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n  As I have laid out previously, in addition to the policy question of \nthe extent to which these new provisions upset the balance of Hatch-\nWaxman, a broad spectrum of legal analysts who range from Susan Estrich \nto Judge Bork have raised a number of concerns about the pending \nlegislation on a wide variety of issues, including concerns that the \nbill runs afoul of the Takings Clause as well as violates the GATT \nTreaty's intellectual property provisions.\n  Last week, I included in the Record a letter from the American \nIntellectual Property Law Association opposing the patent forfeiture \nand private right of action provisions of the bill.\n  This week I want to highlight a letter to Chairman Kennedy from the \nIntellectual Property Owners Association expressing severe reservations \nabout the bill.\n  The IPO represents U.S.-based owners of patents, trademarks, \ncopyrights, and trade secrets. The organization includes some 100 \nAmerican firms that are among the largest patent filers in the United \nStates. The membership of the Intellectual Property Owners Association \nsubmit about 30 percent of all patents filed with the Patent and \nTrademark Office.\n  The IPO letter raises concerns about how the Substitute to S. 812 \nmight conflict with the international Agreement on Trade Related \nAspects of Intellectual Property Rights--the TRIPS provisions. \nSpecifically, the IPO complains about the file-it-or-lose-it and sue-\non-it-or-lose-it provisions of the bill. The letter states, in part:\n\n       We believe these rigid barriers to enforcement of patent \n     rights may conflict with ``normal exploitation of patent \n     rights'' as that term is used in Article 30 of the TRIPS \n     agreement, or could set a very damaging precedent for \n     interpretation of Article 30 that would be used against the \n     U.S. by its trading partners in other areas of intellectual \n     property enforcement.\n\n  The new, untested, Edwards-Collins language has not been embraced by \nthe intellectual property bar nor by the mainstream organizations that \nrepresent the interests of America's inventors.\n  The Administration has already issued a statement in opposition to S. \n812.\n  Before we take any action to adopt the language that has agitated \nnearly everyone in the IP community, don't you think it would be \nprudent to factor in what the Patent and Trademark Office has to say \nabout this new language that completely re-wrote the McCain-Schumer \nbill?\n  Commissioner James Rogan wrote to me today to give us PTO's initial \nreactions to re-write of S.812. Here is part of what the Commissioner \nof Patents and Trademarks says in his letter to me:\n\n       USPTO does recognize that some changes to current law may \n     be necessary to encourage appropriate access to generic \n     substitutes and prevent abuses of the patent laws. But S. 812 \n     clearly is not the answer. In fact, this bill would likely do \n     the opposite of what its title suggests by limiting access to \n     cutting-edge drugs, decreasing innovation, and ultimately \n     harming the quality of treatments available to patients.\n\n  In addition to these significant concerns raised by the PTO, I would \nthink that the report that was issued earlier today by the Federal \nTrade Commission, after a unanimous vote of the Commissioners, would \ncompel my colleagues in the Senate to question the wisdom of adopting \nthe HELP substitute to S. 812. While I am still studying the details of \nthe report, it seems abundantly clear that the major recommendations of \nthe Federal Trade Commission in no way mirror the legislation pending \non the floor.\n  With respect to the 30-month stay, the FTC suggests a policy of one \nstay per generic drug application for all patents listed in the \nofficial FDA Orange Book prior to the date on which the generic drug \napplication is filed.\n  This is precisely the position I advocated before the HELP Committee \nback in May.\n  This is the position that the Ranking Republican Member of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Gregg, attempted to get adopted by the HELP \nCommittee during the mark-up.\n  The narrowly-tailored FTC recommendation in this area should be \ncontrasted with the overly-broad Edwards-Collins language that contains \nthe offensive file-it-or-lose-it and sue-\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\non-it-or-lose-it provisions, the new and unprecedented--and \nunnecessary--private right of action in the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act, as well as the rule that allows the 30-month stay only \nfor those patents issued within 30-days of the approval of the pioneer \ndrug.\n  I know which policy I prefer--and it came from the FTC after its \ncomprehensive year-and-a-half study of these issues, not from any \nsecret backroom drafting sessions of various lawyers and lobbyists.\n  Let me now focus my comments on another major area addressed by the \nHELP Committee substitute to S. 812: the problem of collusion between \nbrand name and generic drug manufacturers with respect to the rules in \ncurrent law that grant 180-days of marketing exclusivity when a generic \ndrug firm successfully challenges or navigates around a pioneer firm's \ndrug patents.\n  The 180-day marketing exclusivity rule has been highly controversial \nin recent years.\n  The reason for this attention is simple. In a few number of \ndocumented cases, generic drug manufacturers entered into agreements \nwith brand name manufacturers not to sell generic drugs.\n  As I will explain, due to the way the existing law--the Drug Price \nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984--is written and has \nbeen interpreted by the courts, some of these arrangements had the \neffect of delaying multi-source generic competition well beyond the \ncontemplated 180-days.\n  I should first note that the existing statute--the Waxman-Hatch Act--\nincluded this 180-day marketing exclusivity as an incentive to \nencourage patent challenges. If patents were found to be invalid, or if \nnon-infringing ways to produce generic drugs were developed, consumers \ncould benefit from the earlier-than-anticipated introduction of generic \ndrugs into the marketplace.\n\n  In enacting these provisions, it was the intent of Congress to award \nthis exclusivity only to a generic drug applicant that was successful \nin defeating a pioneer firm's patents.\n  FDA's 1994 regulations implementing the Hatch-Waxman Act required the \ngeneric drug challenger to defend successfully the lawsuit that a \npioneer firm must initiate within 45-days after being notified that the \ngeneric firm was challenging the patent.\n  It must be emphasized that the reason the generic drug firm is the \nplaintiff in the suit, rather than the defendant, is that the statute \ncontains a special protection allowing generic firms to conduct what \nwould normally be infringing activities in order to secure FDA \nregulatory approval. This is the so-called Bolar Amendment, a provision \nof law that, in my opinion, has not been adequately recognized by the \nproponents of S. 812.\n  Essentially, the Bolar language trumps the general rule against \npatent infringement codified in section 271(a) of the patent code. The \nBolar Amendment, codified in section 271(e) of the patent code, allows \ngeneric drug firm to infringe patents in order to win FDA approval and \ngear up production and creates an artificial act of patent infringement \nat the moment that the generic firm files an abbreviated new drug \napplication with the FDA.\n  Once the application is filed, the pioneer firm has 45-days to file a \nlawsuit in order to take advantage of the statutory 30-month stay \ndesigned to allow the patent litigation to be completed before generic \nmay be permitted to enter the marketplace.\n  For over a decade after Hatch-Waxman was enacted in 1984, it was \nthought that only a generic firm that was successful in the litigation, \nthat is, a firm that had successfully defended the suit brought by the \npioneer firm, could qualify for the 180-days of marketing exclusivity.\n  In 1997, FDA's successful defense requirement was struck down by the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Mova Pharma v. Shalala.\n  The following year, in 1998, the D.C. Circuit decided the case of \nPurepac Pharm v. Shalala. This decision upheld FDA's new system of \ngranting the 180-day exclusivity to the first filer of a generic drug \napplication even if the pioneer firm did not sue for patent \ninfringement.\n  That same year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its \nopinion in Granutec v. Shalala. This case held that the exclusivity of \nthe first filer could be triggered by a court decision with respect to \na second, third, or subsequent filer.\n  Essentially, these decisions added up to one thing: mischief.\n  Once the exclusivity was awarded to the first filer of a generic drug \napplication divorced from any requirement for a successful patent \nchallenge, it became apparent to some that the first filer--with a \nfinancial inducement from the patent holder--could effectively \nforestall multi-firm generic competition by simply not going to market. \nIf the 180-day clock never started, multi-source generic competition \ncould be forestalled until the patents expired.\n  This could last for years.\n  As a coauthor of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act, I can tell you that I find these type of reverse \npayment collusive arrangements appalling.\n  I must concede, as a drafter of the law, that we came up short in our \ndraftsmanship. We did not wish to encourage situations where payments \nwere made to generic firms not to sell generic drugs and not to allow \nmulti-source generic competition.\n  To date, there are known to have been relatively few such agreements. \nThe FTC has obtained consent decrees in two cases: with Hoescht and \nAndrx over the drug, Cardizem, and with Abbott and Geneva over the \ndrug, Hytrin.\n  The agency suffered a set-back recently in the third case it brought \nin this area which involved an agreement between Schering-Plough, \nUpsher-Smith, and American Home Products with respect to the compound \nK-Dur 20, a widely prescribed potassium chloride supplement. While the \nFTC settled with American Home products, an Administrative Law Judge \nrecently rejected the agency's argument in the case against Schering \nand Upsher-Smith. The ALJ's opinion looked at the facts of competition \nin the potassium chloride market and concluded that FTC had not proven \nits case given the highly-competitive nature of this particular market.\n  However the K-Dur case ultimately is decided, I commend FTC Chairman \nTim Muris for indicating he will continue the agency's policy of \nzealously reviewing these type of reverse payments cases to determine \nwhether such agreements run afoul of the antitrust laws.\n  In my earlier statements, I commended both the enforcement actions of \nthe FTC and the development of the Drug Competition Act, S.754, by \nSenator Leahy for creating a climate unfriendly to the execution of any \nadditional collusive deals not to compete between generic and brand \nname companies.\n  Today's release of the report: Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent \nExpiration: An FTC Study underscores the importance of Senator Leahy's \nwork in developing the Drug Competition Act. This bill was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee last year.\n\n  I was pleased to work with him to refine the bill before the \nCommittee adopted this measure. I am particularly pleased that he \nbecame convinced it was wise to abandon a patent forfeiture feature \nvery similar to the provisions contained in the Edwards-Collins \nsubstitute to S. 812 that so many biotech and pharmaceutical firms and \nintellectual property experts find so objectionable.\n  I did have a few additional suggestions for improving S. 754, but in \nthe interest of moving the legislation forward in a bipartisan fashion, \nI supported the bill in Committee.\n  Frankly, one of my suggestions is very simple and amounts to \nrecognition of the importance of the bill. This simple suggestion would \nbe to codify the bill as part of the Clayton Act, rather than let the \nlanguage float as a statute-at-large.\n  Here are the other concerns that I have with S. 754.\n  The Leahy bill exempts three types of agreements: first, purchase \norders for raw material supplies; second, equipment and facility \ncontracts; and third, employment or consulting contracts.\n  These three categories were also exempted by the FTC in its recently \ncompleted study of the pharmaceutical industry. To these three, I would \nsuggest adding two other classes of non-germane agreements: first, \npackaging and labeling agreements and, second, confidentiality \nagreements. It seems to me\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\nthat the thrust of the legislation is to get a quick review of actual \nexecuted agreements relating to settlements of patent non-infringement \nor patent invalidity cases arising out of Hatch-Waxman Paragraph IV \ncertifications.\n  Garden variety packaging and licensing agreements or mere agreements \nto talk about possible settlements in a confidential manner are not \nwhat we are after with this legislation.\n  I think we should start with the presumption that the law will be \nfollowed. Given this perspective, I favor the total deletion of \nproposed Section 8, subsection (b) which creates a special rule for \ncontract unenforceability. My understanding is that this is a relative \nrecent addition to the Leahy bill and that only current sections 8(a) \nand 8(c) were in the original Leahy bill and, in fact, precisely mirror \nthe long-standing Hart-Scott-Rodino enforcement language. In short, \nwhat does this new section 8(b) accomplish that is not included in the \nmore general provision of section 8(c) that grants a broad authority \nfor equitable relief?\n  And what is the real chance that one or both parties will not comply \nwith the statute in the first place? And if one party reports, what \ncould possibly be gained by the other party not reporting the \nagreement? For that matter, it might be preferable to change the bill \nto require a joint submission of a certified copy of the agreement \nbecause one can hardly imagine some poor FTC staff attorney doing a \nside-by-side, word-by-word reading of documents to make sure both \nparties sent the same agreement.\n  In addition, I think that language should be added to make explicit \nthat nothing in this Act should be construed to discourage or prohibit \nlegitimate settlements between brand name and generic drug companies. \nThe Joint DOJ/FTC guidelines smile upon such settlements so long as \nthey do not run afoul of other laws such as the antitrust statutes. The \nFTC Administrative Law Judge's decision in the K-Dur 20 case reminds us \nof this fact, no matter how the case is finally decided.\n  The essence of S. 754 is to see that every agreement between pioneer \nand generic firms that raises antitrust questions are promptly reported \nto the FTC and DOJ for appropriate scrutiny.\n  I think the emergence of the Leahy bill--and I must give credit as \nwell to the McCain-Schumer bill, coupled with the strict FTC \nenforcement in this area and the agency's extensive industry-wide \nsurvey helps explain why these so-called reverse payment cases appear \nto be dwindling, and perhaps have completely halted for the time being.\n  Senator Leahy should be pleased that the chief recommendation that \nthe FTC is making today with respect to the collusive 180-day marketing \nexclusivity agreements amounts to an endorsement of S. 754.\n  The FTC report recommends that Congress:\n\n       Pass legislation to require brand-name companies and first \n     generic applicants to provide copies of certain agreements to \n     the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n  This straight-forward recommendation is a far cry from the complex, \nbarely comprehensible, 180-day marketing exclusivity fix that emerged \nfrom the HELP Committee.\n  As a Wall Street Journal article yesterday described the discussion \nof the Edwards-Collins substitute: ``In a remarkable session, it became \nclear that many lawmakers didn't understand the complex bill.''\n\n  Why should that be surprising given the fact that this completely \nnew, incredibly- intricate, highly-technical language was made \navailable the day before the mark-up? A review of proceedings of the \ntwo-day HELP Committee mark-up is very revealing and I would urge that \nthe press and the public make the effort to review this discussion. I \ncan see why Senators Gregg and Frist are so frustrated about some \nchanges in language that appear to have been agreed to one moment, only \nto vanish the next. One can only wonder who, how, where, when, and why \nsuch language was drafted--although yesterday's Wall Street Journal \narticle may shed some light on some of the actors behind the scenes.\n  In many ways, the Edwards-Collins substitute misses the mark, and is \ntoo complicated to boot.\n  Nevertheless, I do think we need to re-examine the statute in this \narea in light of the potential for these type--or perhaps new types \nof--anticompetitive agreements to crop up in the future given how the \ncurrent statutory language and court decisions work together to help \ncreate a climate for mischief.\n  The McCain-Schumer bill addressed the 180-day collusive reverse \npayments situation by a so-called rolling exclusivity policy. This \nrolling exclusivity means that if the eligible generic drug filer does \nnot go to market within a specified time period, the 180-day \nexclusivity rolls to the next filer.\n  I do not favor rolling exclusivity.\n  I agree with what Gary Buehler, then Acting Director of FDA's Office \nof Generic Drugs, told the Judiciary Committee last year:\n\n       We believe that rolling exclusivity would actually be an \n     impediment to generic competition in that the exclusivity \n     would continue to bounce from the first to the second to the \n     third if, somehow or other, the first was disqualified.\n\n  I believe a better course of action was advanced by FDA in its 1999 \nproposed rule which suggested a use it or lose it policy. This simple \nrule is that if the first eligible generic drug applicant did not \npromptly go to market, all other approved applicants could commence \nsales.\n  Molly Boast, Director of the FTC Bureau of Competition, testified \nlast May that, at the staff level, FTC supported FDA's use it or lose \nit proposal.\n  My first reading of the summary of the new FTC Report leads me to \nconclude that the agency favors a very aggressive use it or lose it \npolicy. In this regard I must point out that the FTC Report contains \nthree minor recommendations that center on the 180-day provision:\n  First, the agency would run the 180-day clock if a generic firm \nmarketed the pioneer's product under a license, not an ANDA.\n  Second, FTC would codify current case law and run the 180-day clock \nfrom the time of any court decision, not an appellate decision as \nallowed under the HELP Committee language.\n  Third, the Commission would trigger the 180-days if a court dismissed \na declaratory judgment for lack of case or controversy.\n  While I am just beginning my review of the FTC report, it appears \nthat the FTC is advocating a very aggressive form of a use-it-or-lose-\nit policy.\n  As I have argued on a number of occasions, my view is that rolling \nexclusivity delays the day when multi-generic competition can commence. \nIt appears to me that the FTC shares this view.\n  If our goal is to maximize consumer savings after a patent has been \ndefeated, I find it difficult to see how rolling exclusivity achieves \nthis goal. I certainly prefer a use it or lose it approach over the \nMcCain-Schumer brand of rolling exclusivity.\n  I commend the sponsors of the Edwards-Collins substitute for \nrejecting the McCain-Schumer rolling exclusivity policy in favor of \nwhat Senator Edwards calls modified use-it-or-lose-it. Having said \nthat, I am disturbed to learn that during the HELP Committee mark-up \nSenator Edwards and HELP Committee staff stated that, in fact, the \nexclusivity could roll indefinitely.\n  I understand the intent is to transfer the exclusivity once and only \nonce, but having reviewed the language of the bill and the discussion \nat the mark-up, I am not convinced that the exclusivity will roll over \nonly once.\n\n  In any event, even if the exclusivity only rolled over once, I \nquestion the rationale behind a policy that only delays the day when \nmulti-source generic competition can commence.\n  It is only after the time when many generics enter the market that \nconsumers receive the full benefits of price competition.\n  During the first 180-days when only one generic is on the market, the \nchange in price may be marginal. This is so because when there is only \none generic competitor during this 180-day time frame, neither the \npioneer firm nor the generic firm is under any tremendous pressure to \ncut the price. The report, Drug Trend: 2001, published by Express \nScripts, notes this dynamic:\n\n       The A.P. [average wholesale price] for the first generic is \n     usually about 10 percent below the brand. After the six month \n     exclusivity granted to the first generic manufacturer, the \n     price paid . . . for the generic quickly falls, often by 40 \n     percent or more, as multiple manufacturers of the same \n     generic product compete for market share. Moreover, it \n     appears that the value of the 180-day\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\n     marketing exclusivity incentive may be worth much more today \n     that it was back in 1984.\n\n  I understand that, in 1984, the number-one selling drug in the United \nStates was Tagamet, with U.S. sales of about $500 million.\n  Today, it is estimated that Lipitor, the anti-cholesterol medicine, \nhas a domestic market of over $5 billion annually. In nominal dollars, \nLipitor sales today are 10-times higher than Tagamet sales were in \n1984. In real dollars, I am told that this amounts to about a six-fold \nincrease.\n  If we are going to open up the 180-day provisions of the 1984 law--\nand I think we should so long as we do it carefully and thoughtfully--I \nthink we should reexamine other aspects of the 180-day rule such as \nwhether we should retain the 180-days or some other number of days \ngiven the substantial six-fold growth in potential value of this \nincentive.\n  Why should we be locked into 180-days? The dirty little secret of the \n180-day provision is that both the pioneer firms and generic firms like \nthis provision because it delays the full price competition that only \noccurs when many generic enter the market.\n  I think that the mutual economic interest of the generic and the \npioneer firms is not in perfect alignment with the interests of \nconsumers with respect to the 180-day incentive.\n  Moreover, even if we could perfect the modified use it or lose it \nlanguage of the Edwards-Collins substitute and the first qualified \ngeneric manufacturer could not, or would not, commence marketing and \nthe exclusivity moved to the next qualified applicant, why should the \nsecond manufacturer get the full 180-days? Why not 90 days? Why not 60 \ndays?\n  Frankly, I am disturbed that, in some circumstances, the Edwards-\nCollins language appears to grant exclusivity not to the successful \ngeneric litigant--but to a firm which was merely first to file papers \nwith the FDA that triggered a legal proceeding.\n  I understand the rationale for this is that it will supposedly ensure \nmultiple patent challenges. But, when we start rewarding the first to \ntrigger lawsuits in place of actually winning the challenge, it strikes \nme as out of sync with the traditional American value of rewarding the \nactual winner.\n  I am all for assuring that there are sufficient incentives to ensure \npatent challenges. But, isn't there a limit beyond which we should \ndirect these potentially enormous profits back to consumers?\n  While I have not seen any formal estimates, one would think that 180-\ndays of marketing exclusivity for a $5 billion seller like Lipitor must \nmean hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps even $1 billion, in \nlost consumer savings.\n  Would we rather see 25 percent to 40 percent of that money in the \nhands of the trial attorneys who brought the case? Or, would we rather \nsee that at least some of those funds earmarked for attorneys' fees be \nchanneled to help citizens lacking access to prescription drugs?\n  Shouldn't we get more facts concerning the change in value of the \n180-day marketing exclusivity today compared to 1984 and make any \nappropriate adjustment to this incentive? We don't want to set the \nincentive so low as to discourage challenges to non-blockbuster \npatents, but we don't want to set the incentives too high either.\n  As a matter of fact, some have questioned the need for retaining the \n180-day marketing exclusivity at all.\n  For example, Liz Dickinson, FDA's senior, career attorney in this \narea, has asked:\n\n       I suggest we look at whether 180-day exclusivity is even \n     necessary, and I know that there is this idea that it is an \n     incentive to take the risk. I say the facts speak otherwise. \n     If you have a second, third, fourth, fifth generic in line \n     for the same blockbuster drug . . . undertaking the risk of \n     litigation without the hope of exclusivity, is that \n     exclusivity even necessary?\n\n  Ms. Dickinson, a fine lawyer with no political axe to grind, went on \nto make the following observation with respect to the 180-day rule,\n  We have got a provision that is supposed to encourage competition by \ndelaying competition. It has got a built in contradiction, and that \ncontradiction . . . is bringing down part of the statute.\n  Similarly, Gary Buehler, FDA's top official in the Office of Generic \nDrugs agreed with his colleague's assessment when he testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee last year:\n\n     . . . we often have the second, third, fourth, fifth \n     challengers to the same patent, oftentimes when the \n     challengers actually realize that they are not the first and \n     there is no hope for them to get the 180-day exclusivity. So \n     with that in mind, I would agree with Liz's statement that \n     generic firms will continue to challenge patents. Whether the \n     180-day exclusivity is a necessary reward for that challenge \n     is unknown, but it does not appear that it is.\n       I personally favor retaining some incentive to ensure \n     vigorous patent challenges. But in light of this testimony \n     and other factors, I do not believe there is a need to be \n     locked into the current incentive--the 180-day exclusivity \n     benefit.\n\n  I find it curious that neither the McCain-Schumer bill, nor the \nKennedy mark, nor the Edwards-Collins amendment, proposed any changes \nin the current 180-day regime in light of the views of the FDA \nofficials, the dramatic increase of the potential value of 180-days of \nexclusivity, and other factors.\n  This may have been partly due to the fact that neither the FDA nor \nFTC nor any representatives from the Administration testified at the \nHELP Committee hearing on May 8th. In fact, no committee of Congress \nhas ever held a hearing of the language that was marked-up and reported \nby the HELP Committee.\n  On any number of occasions, I have heard Senator Schumer and others \nargue that the simple goal of this legislation is to close loopholes in \norder to return to the original balance in the 1984 law.\n  But what if conditions have changed and the original policies of the \n1984 need to be reassessed?\n  Or what if there were an area that we didn't get right the first \ntime?\n  For example, consider how Paragraph IV litigation treats patent \ninvalidity and patent non-infringement challenges. These are lumped \ntogether, and both, if proven, can result in identical 180-day \nmarketing exclusivity awards. In truth, invalidity and non-infringement \nare two very different types of claims.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of, and challenge them to question the \nimplications of, lumping these two concepts together. We need to re-\nthink this policy. As Al Engelberg, a smart and tough-as-nails attorney \nwho specialized in attacking drug patents on behalf of generic drug \nfirm clients, has said about this difference:\n\n       In cases involving an assertion of non-infringement, an \n     adjudication in favor of one challenger is of no immediate \n     benefit to any other challenger and does not lead to multi-\n     source competition. Each case involving non-infringement is \n     decided on the specific facts related to that challenger's \n     product and provides no direct benefit to any other \n     challenger. In contrast, a judgment of patent invalidity or \n     enforceability creates an estoppel against any subsequent \n     attempt to enforce the patent against any party. The drafters \n     of the 180-day exclusivity provision failed to consider this \n     important distinction.\n\n  Once again, as one of the drafters of this law, I accept my share of \nresponsibility for failing to fully appreciate the implications of this \ndistinction.\n  The 180-day rule acts as only a floor in non-infringement cases. A \nparticular non-infringer's marketing exclusivity can extend beyond the \nstatutory 180-days. This period of marketing exclusivity can last until \nsuch time as another non-infringer might enter the picture or until the \nunderlying patents are invalidated or expire.\n  Conversely, it can be argued that the 180-day floor actually works to \nthe detriment of consumers whenever the 180-days of exclusivity acts to \nblock entry of a second non-infringing generic product during the 180-\nday period. Why shouldn't a second or third non-infringer be granted \nimmediate access to the market as would occur in any other industry? \nConsumers could enjoy the savings that accrue from immediate price \ncompetition.\n  I would hope that my colleagues working on the bill, and others \ninterested in this debate carefully consider the distinctions between \ninvalidity and non-infringement challenges. This is an area where we \nmight have gone off-base in 1984.\n  While I am of the mind to retain a strong financial incentive to \nencourage vigorous patent challenges by generic drug firms, I am \nunconvinced at this point that we should retain the old language that \ngrants identical rewards for\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\nsuccessful invalidity and non-infringement claims. I welcome debate and \ndiscussion on this matter.\n  Before we change the law, let us have a serious re-examination of \nwhether to retain the 180-day marketing exclusivity in its current form \nboth in terms of the length of the exclusivity period and whether the \nrewards for successful invalidity and non-infringement challenges \nshould be treated identically.\n  My purpose in raising these points is to get an indication from the \nsponsors of this legislation and other interested parties, such as \npatient advocacy organizations, state Medicaid agencies, and insurers, \nwhether there is interest in discussing the advisability of passing on \nmore of the value associated with the current 180-day marketing \nexclusivity to consumers if it appears it is fair and appropriate to do \nso?\n  If there is interest, I would be willing to help fashion an \nappropriate amendment. It seems to me that we need to provide enough of \nan incentive to assure vigorous patent challenges, but we should give \naway no more exclusivity than is necessary. Every day of marketing \nexclusivity awarded to a generic firm comes at the expense of \nconsumers. While we want to ensure vigorous patent challenges, we don't \nwant to set the benefit too high at the expense of consumers.\n  I think we can and should explore this area further.\n  Frankly, I am not certain that I completely understand how the \nforfeiture language in Section 5 of the bill works. I do not think I am \nalone in this confusion. I understand that this language was the source \nof much confusion during the mark-up in the HELP Committee.\n  At some point, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the bill \nmanagers to ask some questions designed to clarify precisely how this \nprovision works.\n  Let me say that if the bill reinstates the successful defense \nrequirement and gives awards to the successful challenger so long as \nthe firm goes to market in a timely fashion, I may be supportive of the \ngeneral concept. I do wonder if the language in the HELP substitute \noverturns the effect of the MOVA, Purepac, and Granutec cases that I \ndescribed earlier?\n  I must say that I think that there are some real advantages to \nSenator Gregg's simple and straight-forward policy of more closely \nfollowing FDA's old-fashioned, easy to understand use-it-or-lose-it \nproposal.\n  I will continue to study the particulars of the three minor \nrecommendations that the FTC has made in connection to the 180-day \nissue.\n  I must also indicate that part of the confusion concerning the effect \nof this new Edwards-Collins language stems from the discussion of the \nprovision at the mark-up. I understand that when Senator Edwards first \nexplained this section of the bill he said that the exclusivity could \nroll over one time if the first qualified applicant did not use it. I \nam told that Senator Edwards indicated his language would eliminate the \npossibility that this could just continue to roll over and over and \nover during which time the exclusivity in the marketplace continues.\n  However, upon questioning from Senators Gregg, Frist, and Sessions, \nthe Committee staff then explained that if the second generic firm \nqualified does not use the exclusivity then the process would start all \nover again. The HELP Committee staff went on to explain, apparently in \ndirect contradiction to Senator Edward's first explanation, that the \nexclusivity could roll indefinitely if there is no generic ready to go \nto market.\n  On the second day of the mark-up, Senator Edwards seemed to indicate \nthat the Committee staff had it right and he had it wrong when he at \nfirst said that the provisions of Section 5 of the bill eliminated the \npolicy of rolling exclusivity. In fact, I am told that Senator Edwards \nthen acknowledged that if there were nobody to compete, then the \nexclusivity could keep rolling over and over.\n  I am afraid that the Edwards-Collins brand of modified-use-it-or-\nlose-it is, at least, very confusing. At worst, it is just another \nversion of rolling exclusivity.\n  I want to learn what the FTC thinks about the Edwards-Collins \nlanguage.\n  What the proponents of this language have failed to do is to explain \nwhy any third, fourth, fifth, or subsequent filer should be given 180-\nday of very valuable marketing exclusivity?\n  Moreover, why for example should a fifth filer be treated any \ndifferently than a sixth filer if neither has won a patent challenge \nand both are ready to go to market?\n  This dog just won't hunt.\n  Recall that some experts at FDA don't even think this incentive is \nnecessary.\n  As I stated earlier, I am somewhat sympathetic to the concerns of \ngeneric drug firms that any exclusivity awarded should be measured from \nthe time of an appellate court decision. But this principle may not \nhold up if any form of rolling exclusivity is adopted or if we have \nmultiple patents and multiple challengers, some of whom are attacking \non invalidity and some of whom are attacking on non-infringement.\n  Frankly, in light of the FTC report just issued this morning, I feel \ncompelled to reconsider if my sympathies are consistent with my use-it-\nor-lose-it view even in the case, increasingly rare, I am told, of one \npatent and one challenger.\n  I am troubled by the provision of the bill that appears to grant each \ngeneric firm that qualifies for the benefit of the 180-day marketing \nexclusivity incentive a 30-month period to secure FDA approval. This is \nmeasured from the time of the filing of the generic drug application.\n  If the first firm eligible to take advantage of the 180-day benefit \ndrops out for some reason, it seems to me that the best thing for \nconsumers would be to approve all applications that are ready to go \nwithout singling out any of these applications for 180-days of \nexclusivity. If, for example, the second firm eligible under the terms \nof Section 5 is in a dispute with FDA over a good manufacturing \npractice inspection and can't go to market, it is consumers who will \nsuffer. In a case where, say, there are 14-months remaining on the 30-\nmonth clock allowed under Edwards-Collins, it does not seem fair if the \nnext firm eligible on the list already has satisfied all of the FDA \nrequirements and is ready to go to market.\n  I would hope that the proponents of the substitute amendment will \nhelp us all understand just how Section 5 is intended to work.\n  It is difficult for me to see why we should adopt a policy whereby \nthe balance of the 30-month period described in Section \n5(a)(2)``(D)(i)(III)(dd)'' on page 44 of the bill could conceivably be \ngreater than the 180-days of marketing exclusivity. Upon default of the \nfirst qualified applicant, why should we wait for a second eligible \ndrug firm to obtain FDA approval when there may be a third, fourth, or \nfifth applicant in line with FDA approval ready to go?\n  I hope the sponsors of the legislation are not locked into their so-\ncalled modified-use-it-or-lose-it policy. The discussion at the HELP \nCommittee mark-up suggests that the language is, in fact, just another \nelaborate version of the flawed rolling exclusivity policy. While I can \nreadily see why rolling exclusivity is attractive to generic drugs \nfirms--and their lawyers--who routinely challenge patents, I don't see \nwhere this policy is good for the American people.\n  Whatever happened to the American tradition that rewards success in \nlitigation, not just filing papers with FDA and making a claim in \ncourt?\n  For all of the reasons I have just discussed, I think it would be \nwise for Congress to take time and reassess the wisdom of retaining the \n180-day marketing exclusivity provision in essentially the same form as \nenacted in 1984.\n  As I argued last night, the Senate would be well-served if we had a \nmore orderly discussion of the facts and recommendations contained in \nthe new FTC study.\n  I see that my friend from Massachusetts is trying to spin the FTC \nstudy as supporting the changes in patent law contained in the HELP \nCommittee substitute.\n  But the fact is, and it is a fact that will be better understood over \ntime, that the FTC recommendations are at variance with the major \nprovisions of the bill on the floor.\n  Let me just spell some of them out for you.\n  The FTC urges adoption of legislation that would allow one 30-month \nstay, measured from the time that each generic drug application is \nsubmitted while S. 812 limits the stay to\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\nthose patents issued within 30-days of the approval of the pioneer \ndrug.\n  The HELP Committee Substitute contains several provisions that \nrequire innovator firms to list all, and sue on, their patents related \nto each particular pioneer drug or forfeit their customary patent \nrights; the FTC makes no such recommendations regarding patent \nforfeiture.\n  The HELP Committee Substitute creates a new private right of action \nto attack the listing of patents with FDA, while the FTC report makes \nno such recommendation.\n  The HELP Committee Substitute embraces a form of 180-day marketing \nexclusivity that allows the exclusivity to roll from one generic drug \nmanufacturer to another in, I might add, a very complicated fashion \nthat potentially has no clear endpoint. The FTC Report appears to \nsupport a very aggressive form of a use-it-or-lose-it policy which, for \nexample, would trigger the 180-day period from the time of a district \ncourt decision. The pending legislation allows generic competition to \nbe delayed until after an appellate court rules.\n  The FTC recommends that certain potentially anti-competitive \narrangements between pioneer and generic firms be reported to the FTC \nin a fashion similar to Senator Leahy's legislation, S. 754, the Drug \nCompetition Act. The HELP Committee is silent in this respect.\n  So the differences are significant between the bill on the floor and \nwhat the FTC recommends.\n  No amount of spinning in the press will change these facts. In light \nof the FTC study and some of the arguments that I have made here today, \nI wonder if some of those who are backing S. 812 because they were told \nit is a good bill will now reconsider what the bill does and decide \nthat they are being sold something of a bill of goods?\n  I would urge my colleagues, as well as consumer organizations and \npharmaceutical purchasers such as insurers and self-insured businesses \nto reflect upon what I have said on this subject today.\n  This is an area in which I think we would be wise to reject Senator \nSchumer's argument that all we are doing with this legislation is \nrestoring the balance of the old Hatch-Waxman Act.\n  On a number of occasions, I have commended Senator Schumer and \nSenator McCain for moving their legislation forward. Even if the bill \nthat came out of the HELP Committee does not resemble very closely \ntheir bill, and even if I still have major problems with this hastily \nconsidered floor vehicle, I commend them again today. I just hope that \nthey, and Senators Kennedy, Frist, Collins, and Edwards will work to \nimprove this legislation.\n  I think that over the last two weeks that I have made a case for \ntaking the time to get this legislation right.\n  We all know that S. 812 was plucked from the calendar to be used as a \nvehicle to debate the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, not because \nit was some finely tuned consensus bill.\n  As I said last night, let us not rush to adopt legislation in this \narea before the ink is dry on the FTC report. We need to understand and \ndebate the FTC report and its recommendations. My first reading of the \nExecutive Summary of the FTC Study reveals a fundamental disconnect \nbetween the agency's recommendations and the legislation that emanated \nfrom the HELP Committee. The floor of the Senate is not the best place \nfor the type of discussion the FTC Report warrants.\n  We need to allow the Judiciary Committee to play a role in fashioning \nlegislation that is fundamentally an anti-trust bill with patent law \nand civil justice reform implications. Certainly, the FTC smiled upon \nwhat the Judiciary Committee was doing in this area. And just as \ncertainly, the PTO did not smile upon how the substitute to S.812 \ntreats longstanding patent rights.\n  The detailed criticism that I have made to the pending bill in no way \nminimizes the importance of the matters that are the subject of the \npending legislation, because they deserve Congressional attention.\n  Let me be clear. We should make some changes in the Hatch-Waxman Act. \nNo law so complex cannot be improved.\n  But let's do it the right way because the American public deserves \nboth the newest medicines and the most affordable medicines.\n  I do not believe, moreover, that S. 812 even identifies the most \nimportant issues we should address in Hatch-Waxman reform.\n  I hope to return to the floor to discuss some ideas for a more \ncomprehensive approach to reforming the Drug Price Competition and \nPatent Term Restoration Act. I suspect that many others, including my \nfriend, Henry Waxman, will want to participate in such a discussion.\n  I am unconvinced that focusing on how best to bring the law back to \nthe old days of 1984 is the right way to go about reforming the Hatch-\nWaxman Act.\n  I think we may be well served if we attempt to modify the law in \norder to help usher in a new era of drug discovery while, at the same \ntime, increasing patient access to the latest medicines.\n  Let us not adopt this hastily-crafted bill in the last week before \nAugust recess. Please do not hold your nose and close your eyes and \nvote for this bill by telling yourself that we can fix it in \nconference. We can do better.\n  We would do better in the long run for the American people if we put \nS. 812 aside for the time being and devote our attention to passing the \nOmnibus Trade Promotion Authority, Trade Adjustment Assistance, and \nAndean Pact legislation before this week runs out. We need to get the \neconomy going again and trade can help us achieve that goal.\n  Let's face it. S. 812 is not ready for adoption, but the trade \nlegislation is long overdue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the PTO and BIO, \ndiscussed earlier in my speech, be made part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Biotechnology Industry\n\n\n                                                 Organization,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Thank you for your prompt response to \n     my letter of July 15 objecting to several new provisions of \n     S. 812, the Schumer-McCain legislation. No one was more \n     surprised than members of the biotechnology industry at these \n     last-minute changes, which pose significant problems for our \n     companies. At this stage in the debate, we must strongly \n     object to these provisions and urge that they be deleted from \n     the bill under consideration on the floor of the Senate.\n       The Biotechnology Industry Organization quite intentionally \n     took no position on the particulars of the original version \n     of the Schumer-McCain bill, leaving debate on the practices \n     described in your letter to others. But the bill has been \n     changed radically, without opportunity for members of our \n     industry to provide legal and policy reaction to the new \n     provisions on bioequivalence, loss of rights to sue for \n     patent infringement, and a right of action for generics to \n     sue our companies to ``correct'' patent information filed \n     with the Food and Drug Administration.\n       In BIO's July 15 letter, I pointed out the potentially \n     damaging consequences to our emerging industry that could \n     result from these provisions--carte blanche authority of FDA \n     to determine testing methods applicable to full NDAs, loss of \n     the ability to protect our intellectual property because of \n     failure to meet new filing deadlines under food and drug law, \n     and an unwarranted private right of action afforded generic \n     companies to sue members in efforts to `'delist'' patents or \n     ``correct'' patent information. Whatever the purposes of \n     these provisions, we fundamentally disagree with their \n     consequences--perhaps the result of producing totally new \n     provisions only 36 hours before markup.\n       We also point out that we were assured by committee staff \n     that the bioequivalence provision was intended only to \n     confirm FDA's authority to craft tests for bioequivalence for \n     products not easily absorbed in the bloodstream. We were also \n     assured that this provision (section 7) would be worked out \n     before floor consideration. This has not occurred, despite \n     the fact that BIO provided draft language that accomplishes \n     precisely the stated purposes of the bioequivalence section.\n       BIO retains its admiration for you and your staff and \n     appreciate very much your past efforts to respond to \n     challenges that confront our industry in Massachusetts and \n     across the nation. We have no doubt that you did not intend \n     that the bill's new provisions pose threats to BIO companies, \n     and look forward to an opportunity to work with you to remove \n     from S. 812 the provisions on bioequivalence, loss of rights \n     to sue for infringement and the private cause of action \n     during its consideration on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Carl B. Feldbaum,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                              United States Patent\n\n\n                                             and Trade Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: In a few months, the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) will celebrate its 200th \n     year in existence. During that time, we have been the only \n     Federal agency charged with administering this Nation's \n     patent laws and determining whether inventions are \n     patentable. USPTO plays a critical role in promoting and \n     protecting intellectual property and the work of our Agency \n     helps to stimulate American innovation and investment.\n       At your request, USPTO is providing its views on the \n     advisability of the changes in patent laws in S. 812, the \n     Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act. This letter \n     is intended to inform you of our objections to the current \n     language in S. 812.\n       First, in some cases, S. 812 would forfeit unnecessarily \n     the core right of patent holders--the right to exclude others \n     from practicing the invention for the entire patent term. \n     After years of research and development and significant \n     investment, the patent right is extinguished for the mere \n     failure to satisfy an administrative task or respond in a \n     timely manner. For example, if a patent holder fails to list \n     the patent with the Food and Drug Administration within a \n     certain time period, the patent is invalidated. Furthermore, \n     if a patent owner fails to bring an infringement action \n     within 45 days of receiving notice (also known as `Paragraph \n     IV') from a drug manufacturer that the patent is invalid or \n     not infringed by the generic drug, then the patent right is \n     forfeited. In this circumstance, the patent owner is barred \n     from ever bringing an infringement case in connection with \n     the generic drug at issue.\n       Second, we are concerned with the bill's disparate \n     treatment of patents depending on issue date. The Hatch-\n     Waxman Act gives a patent holder an automatic 30-month stay \n     to defend a challenge to the patent by a generic drug \n     company. S. 812 would apply this 30-month stay only to \n     patents that issue within 30 days of the new drug application \n     approval. This limitation is arbitrary and unrealistic. The \n     timing of issuance bears no relation to the importance of \n     innovation. Moreover, the patent applicant often has no \n     control over when a patent issues. Therefore, affording \n     certain benefits to patents that issue only within a certain \n     time frame would be unworkable and unjust.\n       Finally, USPTO believes it is vital to consider each patent \n     rigorously and uniformly to determine whether the application \n     satisfies the standards of patentability. All patent \n     applications are examined with equal scrutiny and all patents \n     must satisfy the same criteria of utility, novelty, and \n     nonobviousness before they are issued. Each pharmaceutical \n     patent, like all other patents, is entitled to a presumption \n     of validity and should be judged accordingly.\n       USPTO does recognize that some changes to current law may \n     be necessary to encourage appropriate access to generic \n     substitutes and prevent abuses of the patent laws. But S. 812 \n     clearly is not the answer. In fact, this bill would likely do \n     the opposite of what its title suggests--by limiting access \n     to cutting-edge drugs, decreasing innovation, and ultimately \n     harming the quality of treatments available to patients.\n       Before considering any future legislative efforts, we \n     should applaud the success of the time-tested Hatch-Waxman \n     Act and respect the delicate industry balance it forged. In \n     all cases, any changes should incorporate the expertise of \n     the Committees on the Judiciary of Congress, in addition to \n     the appropriate Government agencies. Only through a carefully \n     conducted analysis can a result be reached that benefits \n     consumers while promoting the progress of science and \n     innovation.\n       I hope this information is helpful and I would welcome the \n     opportunity for consultation on future endeavors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E.

Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of a fellow \nMississippian, Fred C. Cutrer Jr. and his navigator Leonard L. Kaster, \nwho died serving their country during the Vietnam War. Captain Fred C. \nCutrer Jr. was a pilot on a B57 Canberra Bomber, and during his service \nfor his country, he became instantly known around his base as a loving \nhusband and an immensely proud father of two sons. He would often be \nfound showing pictures of his family to his friends and squadron. Fred \nwas also courteous and friendly, exemplifying the character of a true \nsouthern gentleman. Jimmy Speed, a child-hood buddy described his \ncharming character by stating,\n\n       I use to call him good-humor man. He was a very smart man, \n     and people liked him immediately. I always felt that if he \n     had gotten to the ground alive, those people wouldn't have \n     hurt him because he was so likeable and friendly that he \n     would have fit into any crowd.\n\n  On August 6, 1964 Cutrer and 1Lt. Leonard L. Kaster, unknowingly flew \nthe skies for their last time. They were flying over South Vietnam, \nNorth East of Tan Son Nhut, and according to Defense Intelligence data, \ntheir airplane came under heavy fire from Viet Cong forces, causing \nthem to crash and explode near the Sang Dong Nai River in Long Khan \nProvince. Both men were classified ``Killed in Action, Body Not \nRecovered,'' and Cutrer was promoted to the rank of Major.\n  In the spring of 1997, the Department of Defense, with the help of a \nVietnamese native, helped bring closure to Cutrer's family by finding \nCutrer's dog tag and aircraft identification plate that had been buried \none meter beneath the surface of a jungle bog. This discovery led to \nthe declaration of these men's ceremonial burial for June 6, 2002, with \nfull military honors. I am thankful to say that both of these men, \nnearly forty years following their patriotic death for their country, \nnow lay buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Both the Cutrer and Kaster families flew from Mississippi to attend \nthe ceremony, and Air Force General Frank Faykes presented flags to the \nfamilies of both men. Buried alongside Cutrer is his wife, Shirley, who \nwas killed in an automobile accident four years ago. The children were \npleased to see their father properly honored as a hero and their mother \nrightfully buried beside him.\n  American troops have a slogan stating, ``We leave no man behind.'' I \nbelieve this manifests the pride and patriotism of our troops. Cutrer's \nsister, Lillie Cutrer Gould, promised her younger brother that if \nanything were to happen to him in Vietnam, then she would bring him \nback home. Not too many days ago, Mrs. Gould successfully achieved her \npromise to her brother, and America again exercised its duty and \ncommitment to its soldiers.\n  I salute John C. Cutrer Jr. and Leonard L. Kaster for serving their \ncountry and helping make America a better and safer place to live. I am \nthankful that I reside in a country where we take pride in our \nsoldiers, and we carry a strong commitment never to forget their \ncourageous acts nor to leave anyone behind. I want to thank God for \nallowing John and Shirley Cutrer to eternally lay side-by-side in \nArlington's National Cemetery, and I want to thank America for again \nmaking me proud of our citizens. I know my colleagues will join me in \nmemorializing and commending the lives of John C. Cutrer Jr. and \nLeonard L. Kaster, two American heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7571-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7571-S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MR. JOHN M. McGEE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay proper tribute to Mr. \nJohn M. McGee, a devoted husband, father, and grandfather as well as a \nmemorable American patriot. John was born in Brookhaven, MS on \nSeptember 16, 1933, and in February 23, 2002, John passed away as a \nresult of a sudden heart attack. In his high-school years, John was \nblessed with speed and athleticism that contributed to his becoming an \nextraordinary football player and an excellent athlete. John's \nathleticism led him to set the state record in the 100-yard dash. John \nattended my alma mater, the University of Mississippi, where he played \nfootball for the Ole Miss Rebels. John's patriotism towards his country \nconvinced him to interrupt his education at Ole Miss and enlist with \nthe U.S. Navy where he served on the destroyer tender Shenandoah and \nthe destroyer Willard Keith. During his duty in active service, John \ntook part in the decisive Inchon invasion commanded by General Douglas \nMcArthur.\n  John went on to earn his bachelor's degree in engineering from the \nArmed Forces Institute. After an honorable discharge, he pursued his \ncareer in engineering until 1966 when he accepted a job with the \nDepartment of Defense where he conducted operations in Vietnam, \nCambodia, Laos, and Thailand until 1969. During John's service in \nVietnam, he discovered and exposed extensive corruption in American \nmilitary operations. The Governmental Accounting Office confirmed these \nallegations, and John's discovery revealed the theft of 5.5 million \ngallons of fuel that had been originally intended for U.S. Military \nforces but had been penetrated and used by the enemy. John's inquiry \nhelped save the lives of many\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nAmericans. His discovery ultimately led to a Senate Sub-Committee \nchaired by the Honorable Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin to \ninvestigate the scandal. This incident is memorialized in the U.S. \nCongressional Record and in the books Report from Wasteland- America's \nMilitary Industrial Complex, by Senator William Proxmire and The \nPentagonists, by A.

Mr. President, today I have asked Senator Feinstein to add \nme as a cosponsor to her bill, S. 1523, which would amend the Social \nSecurity Act to permanently repeal the Government Pension Offset and \nthe Windfall Elimination Provision. I am pleased to support my \ncolleague Senator Kennedy and others in their support of this bill.\n  Massachusetts is one of 15 states in which the Government Pension \nOffset and the Windfall Elimination Provision hits employees and \nretirees particularly hard, because it is one of the few remaining \nstates where many state employees, such as teachers, do not pay into \nthe Federal Social security system. Rather, they pay into a state \npension fund. For many workers, the formulas in the law that reduce \nSocial Security benefits for these workers can have troubling and \nunintended consequences.\n  Listen to the testimonial of one educator from my state. This \nconstituent writes:\n\n       I served 13 years in the military and am a wartime veteran. \n     I did not receive a military pension; however, I did pay into \n     Social Security. I am shocked to learn that I may receive \n     virtually nothing from Social Security. My teaching pension \n     in Massachusetts will be small if I retire at 60 with only 22 \n     years of teaching service. I had previously thought that \n     Social Security would help to make up for the smaller \n     teaching pension. I feel that the Federal government is \n     unfairly penalizing those who have embarked on second careers \n     as teachers. They have created a disincentive that will work \n     against filling projected teaching shortages. I feel \n     especially cheated as I did sacrifice much during my military \n     career. It is obvious that I would be much better off \n     financially had I not served at all. I hope this is not the \n     message that the government wants to send.\n\n  The government pension offset has a significant impact on the \nbenefits of many retired public employees just like this one. For \nexample, a disabled former school employee and widow who retired in \n1986 receives $403 a month from her school pension. That income results \nin the elimination of a $216 monthly Social Security survivor's \nbenefit, to which she would otherwise be entitled. As a result, her \ntotal income is about 70 percent of the Federal poverty level. Another \nconstituent, a retired widow who worked as a school cook, receives $233 \na month from her school pension. Her Social Security widow's benefit is \nreduced by $155 because of the automatic offset. Her combined total \nincome is about 76 percent of the Federal poverty level.\n  It is clear that the GPO and WEP, complex though they are, are \ncausing pain and confusion. They also negatively impact teacher \nrecruitment efforts, at a time where we sorely need teachers, yet the \npotential reduction in Social Security benefits makes it unlikely that \npeople will turn to teaching for a few years at the tail end of their \ncareers. Consider the irony: Individuals who have worked in other \ncareers are less likely to want to become teachers if doing so will \nmean a loss of Social Security benefits they have earned, and yet our \nState and Federal policies are aimed at recruiting just those \nindividuals to teaching as a second career. Retired teachers are also \nreluctant to return to teaching to help fill urgent needs because of \nthe impact of the GPO and WEP. Finally, there is a fear that current \nteachers are likely to leave the profession to reduce the penalty they \nwill incur upon retirement.\n  The reforms that led to the GPO and WEP are almost 20 years old, \nnearly a generation. They were passed before many of us were members of \nthis body. Now that were are witnessing some of the impacts these 20-\nyear old decisions are having on people's lives, we understandably want \nto help our constituents, and I support that effort. However, while I \nsupport the repeal of the GPO and WEP, I know that if we continue to \naddress Social Security issues on a piecemeal basis, even expanding \nbenefits as certain social needs dictate, without fixing the program's \nunderlying imbalances and demographic challenges, we will make real \nreform more difficult when the time finally comes.\n  However, for the reasons outlined above, and the effect the \nprovisions are having on my constituents, I believe it is essential \nthat the GPO and WEP be repealed, preferably as part of an overall \nreform to Social Security, but by themselves if need be. My State, and \nothers affected by the GPO and WEP, cannot afford to provide \ndisincentives to be teachers or other public servants at this critical \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7572-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 14, 1995 \nin Brooklyn, NY. A gay man was attacked by another man who used anti-\ngay slurs. The assailant, John McHenry, 25, was charged with second-\ndegree assault, criminal possession of a weapon, and harassment in \nconnection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7572-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE ARKANSAS MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE \n                                 HEART\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to \nrecognize and pay tribute to the heroes of Arkansas who have been \nawarded the Purple Heart. This distinguished group of Americans are the \nrecipient of our nation's earliest military decoration and the oldest \nin the world in present use. The Purple Heart is a combat decoration \nawarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of \nthe armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands \nof the enemy.\n  The Purple Heart was originated by General George Washington in 1782 \nto recognize ``instances of unusual gallantry.'' Referred to then as \nthe Badge of Military Merit, the decoration was awarded only three \ntimes during the Revolutionary War. The modern Purple Heart was brought \ninto existence by Army Chief of Staff, General Douglas MacArthur. The \nmedal was designed by Miss Elizabeth Will, in the Office of the \nQuartermaster General, and was introduced by the War Department on \nFebruary 22, 1932, the bicentennial of George Washington's birth.\n  The Military Order of the Purple Heart provides a loud and clear \nvoice on behalf of veterans and the issues that concern them. The \ncrucial work that they do reminds us of just how precious freedom is, \nand that those who have unselfishly risked everything in freedom's name \nare worthy of every benefit a grateful nation can afford.\n  On behalf of the United States Senate, I thank the Arkansas members \nof the Military Order of the Purple Heart for the sacrifices that they \nhave made in defense of this great nation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7572-5", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7572-S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HAPPY 275TH ANNIVERSARY BOW, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ngive my congratulations to the town of Bow, New Hampshire on their \n275th anniversary.\n  Bow, New Hampshire is a quaint and inviting city and home to nearly \n7,200\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\nproud residents. The town was chartered in 1727 and began as an \nagricultural settlement. The waterways that stretch through Bow allowed \nthe town to establish a series of mills that have since served as the \nheart of an area of town known affectionately as ``Bow Mills.'' Bow has \nalso served as a historically significant stomping ground for many \ninfluential figures. Sergeant John Ordway, native to Bow, was part of \nthe Lewis and Clark expedition and Andrew Jackson stopped in Bow on his \n1833 New England Tour. Residents of this beautiful town are among the \nfirst in the nation to vote in primaries.\n  This progressive city has been able to maintain a family-oriented and \nrelaxing environment for 275 years in spite of their close proximity to \nthe two largest cities in New Hampshire. It is highly commendable that \nBow has preserved a superbly low crime rate and given its residents a \nsafe and secure town in which to live and raise their families. Bow is \nincomparable in so many ways, particularly the attention Bow gives to \nthe public school system in their community. Bow's public schools are \nwell maintained, well equipped with the latest technology to ensure \ncutting-edge education and skills training, and most importantly, \nprovide an adequate number of teachers that can endow our children with \nguidance and direction. The student to teacher ratio is roughly 14 to \n1. This is an astounding and praiseworthy circumstance and furnishes \nBow's youth with the opportunity for one to one interaction in the \nclassroom and an extended chance to explore each subject in greater \ndepth.\n  Bow is truly one of the most unique and wonderful cities in New \nHampshire and in the United States. It is said that Bow originally was \ngiven its name because of its literal positioning at the bow of the \nMerrimack River. I propose that perhaps Bow was given its name for its \nrepresentational properties; the visual packaging of this town is \nbeautifully decorated, however, what you discover inside the package is \nthe true gift and reward.\n  Bow, New Hampshire, congratulations on your 275th anniversary. It is \nan honor to represent the citizens of Bow in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7573-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORY OF RESERVIST ROBERT RANERI\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the memory of a fallen soldier in the U.S. Military, Robert \nRaneri.\n  Robert Raneri was a captain and commander of the 94th Military Police \nCompany in the Army Reserves and a highly respected and dedicated \nofficer. Raneri's professionalism and dedication to the Army was \nthought by many to be unrivaled. In July of 2000, Captain Raneri led a \nunit of 600 soldiers in a mission to Bosnia. In the wake of a very \npolitically and militarily charged conflict, Raneri returned nine \nmonths later with every one of the 600 soldiers alive and unscathed as \nhe had promised upon their departure overseas. Those who worked with \nRobert knew him as a strong presence and as a man not afraid to take \nchances if it was in the best interest of the men he commanded and of \nthe nation. His peers remember him as calm, deliberate, clear-headed, \ncompassionate, tough, and exacting. These virtues combined created a \nfine leader, friend, and man in Mr. Robert Raneri.\n  Robert was to be married to Maj. Amy Huther a week after his June \n26th passing, greatly looking forward to being a husband and a father \nsomeday. These dreams will cease to be realized for this exceptional \nman as a result of the unfortunate motorcycle accident that recently \ntook his life.\n  Robert Raneri was a dedicated Army Reservist who spent his life \nserving the United States as a commanding officer to the 94th Military \nPolice Company and his memory should be held in the highest respect. \nRobert's passing is a great loss not only for his family, but for the \ncountry and the U.S. Army.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7573-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF ALBERT G.

Mr. President, I rise today in \nremembrance of a highly respected and valued member of the Manchester \ncommunity and an esteemed public relations careerist, Mr. Albert G. \nCappannelli.\n  Al began his work with public media as a radio news reporter after \ngraduating from Boston University with a bachelor's degree in broadcast \njournalism. His fervor for the technique of media and journalism led Al \nto the arena of strategy consulting. As director of national media at \nHigh Point Communications, he developed tactics for clients throughout \nNew Hampshire including the Department of Education as well as on the \nnational circuit for companies including Anthem Blue Cross-Blue Shield, \nAmerican Express Financial Services, and Maryland Public Service \nCommission. Colleagues described Albert as savvy and highly effective \nin his discipline.\n  In addition to Al's professional career, he established a well-\ndeserved reputation as a community leader in Manchester. He volunteered \nhis time and effort to a number of causes in the community spanning \nacross interests with regard to both personal and social affairs. Al \nwas an active member at St. Peter's in Auburn where he held a position \non the parish council and was a parish facilitator for the Crown \nMinistries for the Diocese of Manchester. He was a huge advocate in \nmatters surrounding education; volunteering his time with Weston \nElementary School, Keene State College, McDonald Youth Leadership \nprogram, and as a member of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce \nEducation Committee.\n  Albert Cappannelli was the victim of an unfortunate and untimely \npassing as a result of liver cancer that had been diagnosed merely 2 \nweeks earlier. Albert is survived by his wife Jane of 16 years and his \ntwo children, Joshua and Helen.\n  Al spent his life and career serving public interest and revealed an \nuncompromising compassion and integrity throughout that endeavor. He \nwas a fine man, respected colleague, and adored by all who knew him. I \nwas proud to call him my friend, and honored to represent such a fine \nindividual in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7573-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7573-S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO DEAN KAMEN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to an innovator of the ages, an artist of medicine, and \ntechnological visionary, Mr. Dean Kamen.\n  As a prominent figure in the life and community of our State of New \nHampshire we honor Mr. Kamen for his efforts and entrepreneurial spirit \nthat have furthered the fields of science and technology in numerous \nways with the advent of his inventions. The improvements in several \nmedical procedures and enhancement of the administering of various drug \ntreatments have vastly improved the lives of individuals who suffer \nfrom a range of illnesses. Mr. Kamen holds over 150 national and \ninternational patents and is renowned throughout the country as one of \nthe greatest inventors of this age. Among his credits include the first \nwearable infusion pump, the first insulin pump for Diabetics, and the \nHomeChoice/TM/ dialysis machine.\n  Recently, Mr. Kamen was in New Hampshire to demonstrate to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, his latest technological \nimprovement, the Segway Human Transporter, an environmentally friendly \nand fuel-efficient mode of transportation for the 21st century. In \nattending this demonstration I was able to witness first-hand the \nincredible and impressive talent and vision of Mr. Kamen.\n  Dean Kamen accomplishments are well-recognized and his many awards \ninclude the Kilby Award for extraordinary contributions to society, the \nHeinz Award in Technology, and the National Medal of Technology given \nto him in 2000 by President Bill Clinton for inventions that have \nadvanced medical care worldwide. In addition, Mr. Kamen was honored by \nthe Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation as ``2002 Person of the \nYear'' for work related to the research and advancement of diabetes \ntreatment for youths.\n  Dean Kamen deserves to be recognized for his exceptional efforts at \nspreading the excitement of science and technology to the world at \nlarge. His advances for medical technology have been blanketed in the \nnotion that technology can be of virtue and practical in our society, a \nproposition that is admirable and worthy of merit.

Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommend and congratulate David Bibber who is retiring as chief of \nDover's Fire and Rescue.\n  Davis Bibber has been chief of Dover, NH, Fire and Rescue team since \n1978 and has recently decided his position as chief is in need of some \n``new blood.'' Bibber was the new kid on the block when he began as a \nfireman at the Fairfax County fire department in 1962 at 18 years of \nage. David started as a volunteer and was permitted to live at the fire \nstation while he finished school. After a few short years, David was \ngranted a full-time job with the department. David's story is an \ninspirational example of the American dream; working his way up to the \ntop.\n  On David's watch some major accomplishments have been achieved at \nDover Fire and Rescue. Among them are the implementation of paramedic \nservices, increased responsibility for emergency management services, \ngreater enforcement of building codes, and an expansion in public \neducation programs throughout the community pertaining to fire and \nsafety. While David has been chief, Dover has also developed a central \nalarm system by combining the dispatch services for the police and fire \ndepartment to lessen the response time for support.\n  Chief Bibber gives all the credit for his and the fire department's \nsuccesses to his staff. He recognizes the hard work and dedication that \neach member of the team has offered in order to keep the city's rescue \nservices running smoothly. David also recognizes the hard work that all \ncity workers provide, respecting city counselors in particular for \ntheir pro bono duties and efforts to make the lives of Dover residents \nbetter.\n  Congratulations to Mr. David Bibber. I thank you, New Hampshire \nthanks you, and the city of Dover thanks you for serving the interests \nof the people with care and capability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7574-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO GEN. JOSEPH P. HOAR, U.S. MARINE CORPS, RETIRED\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate General \nJoe Hoar on the occasion of his retirement as Chairman of the Board of \nDirectors of The Retired Officers Association, TROA.\n  Born in Boston, MA, General Hoar entered the Marine Corps as a Second \nLieutenant in 1958, following his graduation from Tufts University. As \nan infantry officer, he commanded at all levels from platoon to \nregiment; he also commanded three Marine Corps Air Ground Task Forces. \nAs a senior military officer, General Hoar became well-known to the \nmembers of the Armed Services Committee with his tours of duty as the \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Plans, Programs and Operations for the Marine \nCorps during the Gulf War, and, from 1991 to 1994, as the Commander in \nChief, U.S. Central Command, the unified command that had the \noperational responsibilities for the Middle East, South Asia, and the \nHorn of Africa. He retired from active duty on September 1, 1994 after \n37 years of commissioned service in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  General Hoar's dedication to service and excellence has not \ndiminished since leaving active duty. He served as a Trustee for the \nCenter for Naval Analyses at Suffolk University in Boston, and as a \nFellow of the World Economic Forum in Geneva, Switzerland. General Hoar \nwas elected to TROA's board of directors in 1996. For the last two \nyears, he served as TROA's Chairman of the Board, the position from \nwhich he is now retiring.\n  Through his stewardship, TROA continues to play a vital role as an \nadvocate of legislative initiatives to maintain readiness and improve \nthe quality of life for all members of the uniformed service \ncommunity--active: reserve, and retired, plus their families and \nsurvivors.\n  General Hoar has been a strong supporter of the Senate's efforts to \nimprove military readiness and quality-of-life through a competitive \ncompensation package for active and reserve forces, improving health \ncare for retired personnel and their families, and enhancing \nprotections for the survivors of deceased service members. Under his \nleadership, TROA has been an invaluable source of information during \nthe Senate's deliberations on a long list of compensation and benefits \nissues during this extraordinarily productive period.\n  General Joe Hoar has been a leader in every sense of the word in the \nU.S. Marine Corps, in TROA, and in the entire military retiree \ncommunity. I know my colleagues join me in extending very best wishes \nto General Hoar for continued success in service to his Nation and the \nuniformed service members whom he has so capably led and \nserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7574-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7574-S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF NATIONAL CHEESECAKE DAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN: Mr. President, today is a very special day for all \nAmericans, but it is especially near and dear to the hearts of many \nresidents of my home State of Illinois, because today has been \ndesignated as National Cheesecake Day.\n  Some may be tempted to dismiss National Cheesecake Day as another \nmeaningless holiday. To those unenlightened few, I extend my \nsympathies. For you have truly missed out on one of life's sweetest \npleasures. You see, in Illinois, especially in the greater Chicago \narea, National Cheesecake Day can only mean one thing, Eli's \nCheesecake.\n  When long-time restaurateur and Chicagoan Eli Schulman founded Eli's: \nThe Place for Steak Restaurant, one of his marquee offerings was a \nsuperb cheesecake. It quickly became one of Chicago's favorite \ndesserts. So popular, in fact, that Eli's began producing it for other \nrestaurants and retail outlets across the country. Eli's Cheesecake \nCompany has now been a Chicago icon in its own right for more than 20 \nyears.\n  Since its 1980 debut at the first Taste of Chicago, Eli's Cheesecake \nhas grown to become the largest specialty cheesecake company in the \ncountry. In both 1993 and 1997, Eli's Cheesecake was selected to \nparticipate in the presidential inaugural festivities, they have \nsupplied desserts on Air Force One for Presidents Reagan to Clinton, \nand Eli's Cheesecake provided the cake for the First Lady's birthday \nbash in 1997.\n  How does a humble homemade Chicago dessert go from after-dinner \nobscurity to gracing the plates of Presidents and First Ladies?\n  Actually, there are two answers. The first is the taste. If you've \never had a bite of an Eli's cheesecake, you'd know that there is \nnothing like it anywhere in the world. Eli's has taken great care to \ncontinue making each cheesecake by hand--the same way the very first \none was made. This ensures each bite will have the rich, creamy Eli's \ntaste so many have come to love.\n  The second is the spirit of Eli Schulman himself.\n  In 1910, a young man named Eli Schulman was born on Chicago's West\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\nSide. Although Eli's father owned a bakery on Roosevelt Road, times \nwere hard for the Schulmans.\n  Eli was forced to leave school and embark on a series of jobs to \nsupport his family, doing everything from selling newspapers, to \npeddling seat cushions at ballparks, to managing a shoe store and \nselling women's dresses.\n  In 1940, Eli decided to open his own restaurant called the Ogden \nHuddle. Soon after World War II breaks out, two signs appear in the \nrestaurant's window. The first offers a 25 percent discount to men in \nuniform. The second simply states ``If you are hungry and don't have \nany money, come in and we'll feed you free.'' This spirit of generosity \nwas carried throughout Eli Schulman's life.\n  Following the war, in the 1940s and 50s Eli's business expands and \nhis new restaurants become ``hot spots'' for both the Rush Street and \nLake Shore Drive set. When in town, entertainers such as Barbara \nStreisand, pianist Bobby Short and comedian Sheky Green often can be \nfound frequenting Eli's.\n  In 1966, Eli and his Wife Esther realized their dream of opening a \nwhite-tablecloth establishment, Eli's The Place for Steak, in what was \nthen the luxury hotel The Carriage House. Eli's soon became the spot \nfor celebrities and dignitaries to dine. Everyone from Frank Sinatra \nand Sammy Davis Jr. to Gayle Sayers of the Chicago Bears and comedian \nHenny Youngman, all began to make Eli's their place for steak.\n  In the late 1970s, following up on a suggestion from a customer about \nhis dessert, Eli spent several weeks coming up with a recipe that \npleases everyone. Eli's Cheesecake quickly became a marquee offering at \nEli's the Place for Steak. In the next few years, this rich and creamy \ndessert became such a hit that Eli's began producing cheesecakes for \nother restaurants and retail outlets.\n  Although Eli Schulman passed away in 1988, a playground in Seneca \nPark, located across the street from Eli's the Place for Steak, has \nbeen dedicated to his memory. And Eli Schulman's spirit lives on in the \ncompany he started. His son, Marc Schulman and Marc's wife Maureen, are \ndedicated to providing their customers with products and services that \nlive up to the name ``Chicago's Finest.''\n  Eli's Cheesecake now employs more than 200 associates, the company's \ngrowth has been dramatic, and its headquarters, Eli's Cheesecake World, \nis a 62,000 square-foot state-of-the-art bakery, visitor center, and \ncafe.\n  Today, the company makes more than 15,000 cheesecakes every day for \nsale to restaurants, supermarkets, and airlines. Eli's Cheesecakes are \nalso available to the public via the company's thriving mail-order \nbusiness and Web site.\n  In honor of this great day, I have brought a taste of Chicago to the \nU.S. Senate. Earlier today, I delivered a sample of Eli's Cheesecakes \nto both the Democratic and Republican Cloakrooms for my colleagues to \nenjoy.\n  As we go about the Nation's business today, I hope that each of my \ncolleagues will take a moment to enjoy the treats in the cloakrooms and \nponder the words of a respected American writer who once proclaimed \nthat cheesecake was the truest democratic dessert, it is a mix of \ndifferent ingredients that did not care much for the presence of an \nupper crust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7575-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HONORING ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO UPON BEING SELECTED AS A 2002 NATIONAL \n                     CIVIC LEAGUE ALL-AMERICA CITY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to join the National Civic \nLeague in recognizing the city of Roswell, NM as a recipient of the \n2002 All-America City award.\n  Roswell is one of the most fascinating cities in America. Perhaps \nRoswell's most notorious claim to fame is the 1947 ``Roswell \nIncident,'' in which an alleged space craft is said to have crashed \nnearby. It was in Roswell that Dr. Robert H. Goddard chose to launch \nthe first rockets into space, propelling him into history as the father \nof space exploration. The New Mexico Military Institute, noted for such \ndistinguished alums as Roger Staubach, Sam Donaldson, and Conrad \nHilton, has been training tomorrow's future leaders in the Roswell area \nsince 1891. However, Roswell has much more to offer than stories about \nextraterrestrials.\n  The city has been at the forefront of local civic programs aimed at \nimproving community standards. The Nothing Other Than Excellence, NOTE, \nprogram emphasizes how music appreciation can benefit reading and math \nabilities. A low-income dental program, the Community Dental \nInitiative, has provided a creative way to provide access to affordable \ndental needs by combining a mobile dental clinic with a permanent \nclinic helping to reach under-served people. In addition, the city has \ntaken up my initiative to get schools and communities involved in \ncharacter education. They have developed a citywide program involving \nschools, parents, churches, and the government to promote Character \nCounts, a program that stresses the importance of trustworthiness, \nrespect, responsibility, caring, citizenship, and fairness in young \npeople's lives.\n  It is for their civic work that the National Civic League recognized \nRoswell as an All-America City. For the past 53 years, the National \nCivic League annually chooses 10 outstanding communities for their \nefforts to involve community members in innovative projects to address \nlocal challenges. I am pleased that Roswell has tried to create a \nbetter community through active public participation in civic \nactivities.\n  Roswell's success is due to the active involvement of the community \nand their willingness to make a difference in each other's lives. All \nof Roswell can bask in the honor of being selected as an All-America \nCity. This could not have been achieved without everyone's support. I \ncommend you all on your well deserved recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7575-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5005.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit qualifying States to use a portion of their unspent allotments \nunder the State children's health insurance program to expand health \ncoverage under that program or for expenditures under the Medicaid \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSCHIP Budget Allocation Bill of 2002. This important legislation \naddresses the allocation of budgeted but unspent SCHIP funds that are \ncurrently out of the reach of States and are scheduled to be returned \nto the treasury at the end of fiscal year 2002 under BIPA provisions. \nWith our economy in recession, the healthcare needs of the pediatric \nMedicaid and SCHIP populations have not been in greater jeopardy in \nrecent memory. Our bill will address several important and essential \nissues. First, it will financially reward those States that are doing \nan outstanding job with their SCHIP and Medicaid pediatric populations. \nSecond, it will provide financial incentives to those States that have \nnot yet achieved SCHIP eligibility standards. Third, it will provide \nadditional Medicaid revenue, through an enhancement of the Federal \nMedicaid Assistant Percentage, FMAP, to States experiencing budget \nshortfalls due to the current recession. And lastly, it will protect \nchildren's healthcare services during this period of Medicaid cutbacks \non benefits and services.\n  SCHIP's first year of implementation was 1998. At that time program \nbudgeting was not done based on an actuarial estimate of per capita \nprogram costs, but rather excessive funds were committed to insure \nadequate funding. What has evolved since 1998 is a surplus of budgeted \nfunds whose allocation and fate has been determined by a complex State-\nby-State budgeting process that allows for cross subsidization between \nStates and has resulted in large sums of unspent funds to accumulate. \nAn unintended consequence of this intricate budgeting process is that \nit allows States with unspent allocated funds and States with unspent \nredistributed funds to lose access to these funds at the end of this \nfiscal year. In total, over forty States will lose access to allocated \nmonies, only to see budgeted funds diverted back to the treasury; money \nthat could be used to shore up the health care needs of children in \nMedicaid. In reviewing available options, we see the opportunity to \nmerge the original goals of SCHIP, namely to provide for the health \ncare needs of as many children as possible, while addressing the major \nbudget problems currently being experienced by most States. Our bill \nwould accomplish this by allowing unspent SCHIP monies to be used to \nenhance the FMAP for State Medicaid services for pediatric and pregnant \nwomen beneficiaries. Prior to initiating and introducing this bill, we \nevaluated the SCHIP budget, with CMS and CBO data, and found that the \nprogram had adequate residual funds to allow for these monies to be \nused by States to weather these difficult economic times without \nfinancially damaging the actuarially projected needs of SCHIP.\n\n[[Page S7581]]\n\n  Our proposal has been reviewed in detail and endorsed by the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics. This advocacy group shares our concern that \nunless decisive action is taken, access to health care for indigent \nchildren will suffer in our current economic climate. Today, please \njoin with me and my colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Lincoln, and Murray \nin supporting this bill. We can not and must not allow children's \nhealth care to suffer during these difficult economic times.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN (for herself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2820. A bill to increase the priority dollar amount for unsecured \nclaims, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Leahy, \nI am introducing legislation to protect the employees of corporations \nthat declare bankruptcy. This bill will also put a stop to the \noutrageous practice of giving unearned bonuses to select individuals \nimmediately before declaring bankruptcy. With the failures of Enron, \nand now WorldCom, Americans have seen how cruel bankruptcy can be for \nthe employees who dedicated themselves to their companies. While some \nexecutives received extra pay just before the bankruptcy, workers were \nleft holding the bag. Workers have faced mass layoffs. And in many \ncases, workers have been denied their rightful severance pay.\n  I understand that bankruptcy is intended to shield corporations from \ntheir creditors while they restructure their business. However, I do \nnot believe that corporations truly need protection from their own \nworkers. It seems to be the other way around. Workers need greater \nprotection from corporations that accept their labor and then refuse to \npay.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will allow employees, and \nformer employees, to recover a greater share of the money that their \ncompany owes them. This bill also puts a stop to the indefensible \npractice of paying some executives large sums of money just before \nclaiming that the company does not have the money to pay its average \nworkers. Let me explain each of these provisions in detail.\n  First, this bill increases the priority claim amount for employee \nwages and benefits to $13,500. Under current law, employees are only \nentitled to receive $4,650 for wages and benefits that they are owed. \nIf their employers owes them more, for severance or other obligations, \nthe employees must fight with all the other unsecured creditors in the \nrestructuring process. In light of the Enron bankruptcy, where \nemployees were owed average severance packages of $35,000, it is clear \nthat the current limit must be increased as a matter of fairness.\n  Let me be clear. This bill only affects employees who are owed money \nby their employer. Increasing the priority claim creates no new \nobligation for a company to pay severance or other compensation. It \nmerely makes it possible for employees to recover more of what is \nrightfully owed to them. It is appropriate that employees are given a \npriority in recovering debts. Employees depend on their paychecks to \nbuy food, pay the rent, and provide for their families. And unlike \ninvestors or creditors that can diversify their risks, workers cannot \ndiversify their employment.\n  In the case of the Enron bankruptcy, the parties have agreed that \nemployees are entitled to collect, up front, $13,500 to cover wages, \naccrued vacation, contributions to benefit plans, and promised \nseverance. This figure reflects a reasonable settlement. It recognizes \nthe expenses that workers face as they seek new employment.\n  This bill includes a second provision which is designed to restore \nfunds to the bankrupt estate which were unjustly dispersed immediately \nprior to the bankruptcy. My legislation permits the bankruptcy court to \nrecover excessive employee compensation paid in the 90 days preceding \nbankruptcy, if it determines that that compensation was out of the \nordinary course or unjust enrichment. These funds would be recovered \nfor the benefit of the estate and its creditors.\n  In the days leading up to its bankruptcy, Enron paid millions of \ndollars in so-called retention bonuses to executives. However, these \nexecutives actually had no obligation to stay with the company through \nits restructuring; indeed, most of them have since left. It is \nunacceptable for a company to pay millions to some employees, without \nany justification, and then weeks later claim that it cannot make basic \nseverance payments to the vast majority of its workers. This amendment \nwill ensure that bankruptcy courts have the authority to prevent such \noutcomes in the future.\n  These are common sense reforms that protect employees and creditors \nfaced with a corporate bankruptcy. In the wake of Enron and WorldCom, \nAmericans are learning some very difficult lessons about the failures \nof large corporations. We ought to heed these lessons and ensure that \nworkers and investors are better protected in the future. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this legislation. And I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FAIR TREATMENT OF COMPENSATION IN BANKRUPTCY.\n\n       (a) Increased Priority Claim Amount for Employee Wages and \n     Benefits.--Section 507(a) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``$4,000'' and inserting \n     ``$13,500''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking ``$4,000'' and inserting \n     ``$13,500''.\n       (b) Recovery of Excessive Compensation.--Section 547 of \n     title 11, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(h) The court, on motion of a party of interest, may \n     avoid any transfer of compensation made to a present or \n     former employee, officer, or member of the board of directors \n     of the debtor on or within 90 days before the date of the \n     filing of the petition that the court finds, after notice and \n     a hearing, to be--\n       ``(1) out of the ordinary course of business; or\n       ``(2) unjust enrichment.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2822. A bill to prevent publicly traded corporations from issuing \nstock options to top management in a manner that is detrimental to the \nlong-term interests of shareholders; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it seems like every morning, Americans wake \nup to another headline about the collapse of a big United States \ncorporation. The failures have devastated the savings of millions of \nhardworking Americans, savings they were depending on for their \nretirement, or to pay for their kids' college education.\n  When the smoke clears and the fall-out settles, the issue of stock \noptions comes to the fore. Report after report details the massive \nfortunes amassed by the directors and top executives of so many of the \ncompanies that are at the center of the storm. So often, these \nexecutives were granted huge stock option packages, which they cashed \nout quickly for multimillion dollar payouts shortly before the company \nwent over the brink.\n  The landmark legislation that the Senate passed unanimously last \nweek, and which I strongly supported, will curb significant corporate \nabuses and accounting scandals, but it does not touch the issues \nsurrounding stock options. It is time the Senate acted to do so. \nTherefore, today I am introducing the Prevention of Stock Option Abuse \nAct.\n  There is no question in my mind that some companies have abused stock \noptions, using them as a vehicle for funneling large amounts of wealth \nto top executives. What's more, options have been granted in ways that \nfail to serve their intended purpose of aligning the interests of \nmanagement with the long-term interests of the company. Instead, \nseveral of the massive option grants have created perverse incentives, \nenabling top executives to get fabulously rich by pumping up the \ncompany's short-term share price. The tactics they use to do so may \njeopardize the company's long-term financial health, but by the time \nthe long term impact is felt, the executives have already cashed out \nand left the firm.\n  When an executive develops a big personal stake in options, it can \nlead to a big conflict of interest. Too often, the company's long-term \ninterests take a back seat to the executive's desire for personal \nreasons to boost the short-\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nterm share price. When the betting is between massaging the numbers to \n``manage'' quarterly profit projections and improving the quality of \nthe business through such things as R investments, short-term \nprofits, and the value of executive stock options, can be the odds-on \nfavorite.\n  But the abuse of stock options in the executive suite should not be \ntaken as an indictment of stock options in general. I remain convinced \nthat stock option plans, as long as they are broad-based plans that \nextend to rank-and-file employees as well as CEOs, can play a very \nimportant role in our economy. They can enable corporations to attract \nand retain good workers and top talent. And they can improve motivation \nand productivity, by giving employees a strong personal interest in the \nlong-term success of the corporation.\n  Therefore, the legislation I am introducing today aims to stop the \nabuses at the top while not gutting options that are so vital to rank-\nand-file workers. It focuses on restoring the link between the long-\nterm interests of the company and those of senior management, and \ngiving shareholders knowledge about and control over the stock options \nof corporate leaders.\n  Specifically, the bill would direct the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to issue rules, applicable to all publicly traded companies, \nin three main areas.\n  First, to increase shareholder influence and oversight with respect \nto grants of stock options, the bill calls for rules requiring \nshareholder approval of stock option plans. This would help prevent the \nall too common ``I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine'' culture \nof clubby directors and top executives voting each other huge option \npackages with little or no shareholder input.\n  Second, the bill contains tough provisions to ensure that stock \noptions will provide incentives for corporate officers and directors to \nact in the best long-term interests of their corporations, rather than \nincentives to stimulate short-term run-ups in the stock price. It would \ndo this by establishing substantial vesting periods for options and \nholding periods for stock shares, so that top executives do not have \nthe ability to quickly cash out and jump ship.\n  The holding period would be multi-tiered. Directors and officers \nwould be allowed to sell up to one quarter of their shares six months \nafter acquiring them, to permit a degree of diversification or to meet \ntheir current financial needs. But for the majority, they would be \nrequired to wait at least three years. And they would be required to \nhold on to some of their stock until at least six months after leaving \nthe company.\n  Third, and finally, to improve the transparency of stock option \ngrants to directors and officers, the bill calls for rules to provide \nbetter and more frequent information to shareholders and investors. \nShareholders deserve more information than that contained in the \naverage footnote. Specifically, the bill would require stock option \ninformation to be reported quarterly, not just annually, and broken out \ninto a separate, easy-to-find section in each company's public SEC \nfilings.\n  To date, there have been two paths offered to deal with the issue of \nstock options. Some think the problem is so severe that options should \nbe pared back across the board and that Congress should dictate new \naccounting rules for them. Others say that business as usual should be \nthe order of the day, and that no immediate action is necessary.\n  The bill that I have introduced today seeks to lay out a third path. \nIt offers a way to ensure that broad-based stock options can continue \nto be a useful tool for deserving workers, shareholders and the economy \nas a whole, while still curbing abuses by those in the executive suites \nwhose conduct is over the line. I don't claim that the bill is the \ncomplete solution in its present form, but I believe it offers a strong \nframework for a new approach, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and others to refine and improve it as it moves through the \nlegislative process.\n  The job of cleaning up corporate corruption will not be complete \nuntil Congress acts to correct the abuse of stock options. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this effort to put tough new rules in place \nthat will retain broad-based stock options for workers and curb their \nabuse by top management.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2823. A bill to amend the Organic Act of Guam for the purposes of \nclarifying the local judicial structure of Guam; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation with \nthe senior Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, which amends the Organic Act \nof Guam to clarify Guam's judicial structure by ensuring that it is a \nunified and co-equal branch of the Government of Guam. The Organic Act \nestablishes the executive and legislative branches of the Government of \nGuam. This legislation would simply include Guam's judicial branch in \nthe Organic Act.\n  Similar legislation, H.R. 521, was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representative Robert Underwood of Guam. The Bush \nAdministration has no objection to the enactment of H.R. 521. The \nCongressional Budget Office also estimated that the legislation would \nhave no impact on the federal budget.\n  For those of us who have followed and worked on territorial issues \nfor a long time, we do our best to balance the role of Congress when \noverriding federal interests are involved with the concerns expressed \nby territorial leaders and the general public. In this case, the \nestablishment of an independent judicial branch on Guam is an \noverriding federal interest and is broadly supported by the people of \nGuam. This bill is supported by General Ben Blaz, former Guam Delegate \nto Congress, Guam Governor Carl Guiterrez, Justice Philip Carbullido, \nActing Chief Justice of Guam's Supreme Court, the Guam Bar Association, \nGuam's legal community, the National Conference of Chief Justices, and \nthe Guam Pacific Daily News.\n  I believe that today's legislation is necessary to ensure the \nintegrity and independence of Guam's judicial system as co-equal with \nthe executive and legislative branches of the Government of Guam. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this \nimportant issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2823\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nnonrefundable tax credit for contributions to congressional candidates; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this year we enacted a bold new \ncampaign finance reform bill. After years of debate and delay, the \nCongress passed and the President signed this far-reaching legislation, \nknown as McCain-Feingold. This new law eliminates the large ``soft \nmoney'' contributions from our campaign finance system and it expanded \nthe role that some individuals can play by raising the individual \ncampaign contribution limits.\n  But there is one critical area that the McCain-Feingold bill didn't \naddress, one important problem that the new law doesn't solve: how to \ngive low- and middle-income families an incentive to contribute to the \ncandidate of their choice.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill with my colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, that will do just that. It will empower millions of \nworking Americans to become engaged in our political system, by \nproviding a tax credit to those who donate money to congressional \ncandidates.\n  As campaigns become more and more expensive, the number of small \ncontributors is actually decreasing. The current campaign finance \nsystem is becoming dominated by big dollar contributors. This is not \nhealthy for our campaigns and it is not good for our democracy.\n  My bill would make middle income Americans more able to donate to \ncandidates. Specifically, my bill would provide a maximum $400 tax \ncredit to married couples earning up to $120,000 for their campaign \ncontributions. For singles with income up to $60,000, the tax credit \nwould apply to contributions up to $200. This credit will provide a \ndollar for dollar offset for contributions, an incentive that could \nencourage the vast majority of working families to consider \ncontributions to the candidates of their choice.\n  This is not a new idea. This type of credit was a part of our tax \nsystem for more than a decade in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been a \npart of many campaign finance reform proposals over the years, \nproposals that have been introduced and supported by both Democrats and \nRepublicans. And this policy proposal is the focus of a new study by \nthe American Enterprise Institute, AEI, which concluded that this \napproach would help to elevate small donors from the supporting role \nthat they now play. So, our proposal has been successful in the past, \nand it has had broad support from both parties over the past thirty \nyears.\n  Participation in the political process is key to a strong democracy. \nThis bill will help broaden participation and will provide an incentive \nfor more Americans to be included in political campaigns. That is \nhealthy for our form of government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO CONGRESSIONAL \n                   CANDIDATES.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of \n     chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     nonrefundable personal credits) is amended by inserting after \n     section 25B the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 25C.

A bill to improve the national instant criminal background \ncheck system; and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are an odd group of Senators, but not \nwhen it comes to making sure that guns are kept away from drug addicts, \nfelons, illegal aliens and others.\n  Today, we're announcing an extremely important new bill that would \nplug up the gaping holes that are currently in the Justice Department's \ngun background check system.\n  This bill is needed to prevent brutal, senseless murders like the one \nthat took place in a Long Island church a few months ago from ever \nhappening again.\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\n  For those of you who may not know what happened, on March 8, 2002, \nPeter J. Troy walked into Britt's Firearms in Mineolan, NY and \npurchased a .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle. Four days later, he \nwalked into a church in Lynbrook, NY, Our Lady of Peace, and shot and \nkilled the Reverend Lawrence M. Penzes and Eileen Tosner.\n  Mr. Troy had a history of mental health problems, and had been \nadmitted to Bellevue Hospital Center and Nassau University Medical \nCenter on at least two occasions. In addition, Mr. Troy's mother had a \nrestraining order issued against him in February 1998, which he \nviolated on more than one occasion.\n  Yet despite his history of mental illness and violent behavior, Mr. \nTroy was approved to purchase the rifle by a Federal background check. \nIn fact, there was no records on Peter J. Troy in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System, NICS, at all.\n  That never, ever should have happened. We knew Peter Troy was a \nviolent man. We knew he was mentally ill. He had no business owning a \ngun, and he proved it, to the shock and horror of everyone in Long \nIsland and to everyone else in this Nation.\n  Had the Federal system that checks all gun purchasers picked up on \nthe fact that Peter Troy was both mentally ill and was subject to a \nrestraining order, he never would have been sold a rifle and the \nmurders may never had occurred.\n  All the signs were there and all the signs were ignored. That's why \nwe need to tighten State reporting laws so that the violent and the \nmentally ill, people who aren't allowed to purchase guns, aren't able \nto purchase guns. Otherwise, this could happen again and again.\n  The Federal Gun Control Act bars people who have been committed to a \nmental institution or convicted of a felony from purchasing a firearm. \nThat's not the problem.\n  The problem is that this kind of information is not always shared \nwith the NICS system. The INS, for example, doesn't always share info \nabout an illegal alien with the Justice Department or a State doesn't \nforward info about an involuntary commitment to the FBI.\n  So when the background check is performed, the information never \nappears, red flags aren't raised, and the gun purchase goes right \nthrough.\n  In other words, the Federal background check is only as good as the \nrecords that are in it.\n  How poor is our background check system? This year, Americans for Gun \nSafety released a report showing that over a 30-month period, 10,000 \nfelons obtained a gun simply because faulty records made it impossible \nto complete a background check on time.\n  And their report warned that this 10,000 figure is only the tip of \nthe iceberg. It doesn't include the thousands of illegal immigrants, \ndomestic abusers, and the severely mentally ill who are not in the \nsystem at all and cannot be stopped by a background check no matter how \nmuch time is allowed.\n  It's catch as catch can, and we're not catching very much.\n  Under the bill we're introducing, if someone is trying to buy a gun, \nand if they are either: 1. under indictment; 2. been convicted of a \ncrime punishable by more than a year; 3. is a fugitive from justice; 4. \nis a known drug addict; 5. if they've been committed to a mental \ninstitution; 6. is subject to a court order restraining them from \ndomestic violence; or 7. been convicted of a domestic violence \nmisdemeanor, the State will be legally required to let the FBI know.\n  It's a lot of information. There's no question about it. But most of \nthis information is kept by the states. And most of it is automated. So \nfor the majority of these categories, it's a matter of getting the \ninformation from point A, the State, to point B--the FBI. \nUnfortunately, most States, including New York, do not have good \nrecords on mental health, and that's going to take some more work.\n  The bill provides $375 million per year for three years, for States \nto get their records in order and to automate them to ensure that they \nget to the FBI quickly.\n  It also requires Federal agencies to share the records they keep with \nNICS. For example, the INS would be required to share its records on \nillegal aliens with NICS.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who are with me today, particularly \nSenator Craig, for recognizing that this is a public safety issue that \nneeds urgent attention and not a ``gun control'' issue per se. Working \ntogether, we can get this done in the Senate with the same speed the \nHouse got it done.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in an \nunprecedented alliance today, introducing legislation to improve the \nNational Instant Background Check System (NICS). While we have \nfrequently demonstrated our differing views of second amendment issues, \nwe stand together when it comes to enforcing laws against criminal gun \nviolence, and that is the subject of our legislation.\n  The vast majority of gun owners in our country today understand that \nthe right to keep and bear arms comes with a grave duty to use firearms \nresponsibly and within the law.\n  The NICS system deals with the tiny but dangerous fraction of \nAmericans who have lost their firearm rights because they are proven \nlawbreakers, convicted felons--or because they do not have the capacity \nto understand their responsibilities as firearm users. Our federal laws \nprohibit these individuals from possessing or acquiring firearms, and \nthe NICS system is made up of the records of these ``prohibited \npersons.'' This is the list against which prospective gun purchasers \nare checked when the law requires a background check. State and local \nagencies still play a big role, conducting checks on almost half the \napplications based on their own records.\n  We want the system to be fast, so that it does not unduly burden \nindividuals in the exercise of their second amendment rights. That \nmeans the records need to be automated, so we don't have the kind of \ndelays that happen when local law enforcement has to manually check \nwritten records.\n  It is equally critical to all of us that the system be accurate. \nAccuracy means we need to be able to remove a record if it is no longer \nrelevant--for example, if it's a record of an indictment on charges \nthat were later dropped. It also means we need all relevant records--\nrecords pertaining not only to convicted felons, but also those who are \nadjudicated mentally incompetent and drug abusers, and all other \ncategories prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms.\n  Accurate, automated records means truly instant checks, fewer delays \nfor law-abiding gun purchases, and better use as a tool to prevent \nviolent criminals from obtaining firearms.\n  U.S. taxpayers have spend hundreds of millions of dollars in less \nthan a decade, helping to improve all States' criminal history records \nfor law enforcement purposes. It is time to focus our national strategy \non getting the job completed, to the benefit of not just the gun-\npurchasing public but all Americans concerned about the safety of their \ncommunities.\n  Our bill sets out the objectives needed to complete the NICS system, \nand it provides incentives and strategies for accomplishing those \nobjectives. We have been working in tandem with like-minded members in \nthe other body, and the bill we introduce today reflects the changes \nmade by the House Judiciary Committee in the original proposal. Among \nother things, this bill specifies the records still needed from federal \nagencies to fill in the gaps, and requires the removal of records that \nare no longer relevant. It provides inventive for States to improve \ntheir systems through grants and waivers of current matching fund \nrequirements. It calls on DOJ and the mental health community to \ndevelop privacy protocols so that mental health records can be properly \nadded to the system.\n  I am also pleased that the bill incorporates a provision of great \nimportance to law-abiding gun owners, making permanent the prohibition \nagainst charging a federal fee for background checks. Congress has \nsupported this prohibition repeatedly, acknowledging that any such \ncheck is being done for law enforcement purposes and not as a service \nor convenience to gun purchasers. It makes good sense to codify that \nprohibition, once and for all.\n  In sum, this is an important and timely measure. I appreciate the \nwork that the cosponsors have done to get us to this point, and I urge \nall our colleagues to support the bill's enactment.\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, along with Senators Schumer, Craig, and \nKennedy, I rise today to introduce the ``Our Lady of Peace Act'' that \nhas the strong support of major organizations across the political \nspectrum.\n  This legislation fixes a huge hole in our system--a hole that delays \nlegitimate firearms purchases and allows criminals and other prohibited \nbuyers to obtain guns. The hole is the faulty records in the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. Based on a report \nreleased by Americans for Gun Safety Foundation in January 2002, \nCongress has learned that millions of records are missing from the NICS \ndatabase. Over a 30-month period, 10,000 criminals obtained a firearm \ndespite a background check because the records couldn't be checked \nproperly within the 3 days allowed by federal law. In addition, \nthousands of other prohibited buyers will never be stopped because very \nfew restraining orders, drug abuse or mental disability records are \nkept at all. This report makes it clear that if we are to be serious \nabout stopping criminals, wife-beaters and illegal aliens from slipping \nthrough a background check, we had better fix this broken system.\n  Better records mean more accurate background checks--checks which \nstop prohibited buyers while allowing legitimate buyers to be approved. \nAnd better records put the ``instant'' back into instant check, because \ndelays occur when records have to be searched manually. In fact, the \nonly reason why criminal background checks sometime take several days \nis because records have to be checked by hand instead of computer.\n  The figure is astonishing. There are over 30 million missing records.\n  For felony records, the typical state has automated only 58 percent \nof its felony conviction records. The FBI estimates that out of 39 \nmillion felony arrest records, 16 million of them lack final \ndisposition information. Without final disposition records, background \nchecks must rely on time consuming manual searches of courthouse files \nto approve or deny firearms purchases.\n  On the issue of mental health, 33 States keep no mental health \ndisqualifying records and no state supplies mental health disqualifying \nrecords to NICS. The General Accounting Office, GAO, estimates that 2.7 \nmillion mental illness records should be in the NICS databases, but \nless than 100,000 records are available, nearly all from VA mental \nhospitals. States have supplied only 41 mental health records to NICS. \nCombined with the federal records, the GAO estimates that only 8.6 \npercent of the records of those disqualified from buying a firearm for \nmental health reasons are accessible on the NICS database.\n  In the case of drug abusers, the GAO estimates that only 3 percent of \nthe 14 million records of drug abusers are automated, not including \nfelons and wanted fugitives. States have supplied only 97 of those \nrecords to NICS which the GAO estimates as representing less than 0.1 \npercent of the total records of those with drug records that would deny \nthem a firearm.\n  On the issue of domestic violence, 20 States lack a database for \neither domestic violence misdemeanants or temporary restraining orders \nor both, 42 percent of all NICS denials based on restraining orders \ncome from one State--Kentucky--which does the best job of automating \nTRO's from the bench. The Department of Justice estimates that nearly 2 \nmillion restraining order records are missing from the database.\n  In the case of illegal aliens/non-immigrant status records, the GAO \nestimates that over 2 million illegal alien records are absent from the \nNICS database. Through 2001, NICS had no records of non-immigrants in \nthe United States making it impossible to stop visitors to the U.S. on \ntourist or student visas from purchasing firearms.\n  The benefits of better records are simple and important. They lead to \naccurate and instant background checks. Better records mean we would be \nable to stop far more prohibited buyers from obtaining a gun than we do \nnow. When a restraining order, drug abuse or mental health record is \nmissing, nothing in the NICS system indicates a reason to delay the \nsale and search records. NICS simply approves the transaction usually \nwithin 3 minutes.\n  Poor records are why and this legislation will fix the system. This \nbill requires Federal agencies such as the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, and the VA to provide all records of those \ndisqualified from purchasing a firearm to NICS. For INS, it would mean \nsending millions of records of those here on tourist visas, student \nvisas, and all other non-immigrant visas to NICS. Each State would be \nallowed to receive a waiver for up to 5 years of the 10 percent \nmatching requirement for the National Criminal History Improvement \nGrants, NCHIP, when that state automates and makes available to NICS at \nleast 95 percent of records of those disqualified from purchasing a \nfirearm. This bill also requires states to automate and send to NICS \nall disqualifying records under Federal and State law, including \ndomestic violence misdemeanors, restraining orders, criminal conviction \nmisdemeanors, drug abuse and other relevant records to NICS.\n  We also provides grants of $250 million per year for 3 years to \nStates to improve background check records, automate systems, enhance \nstates capacities to perform background checks, supply mental health \nrecords and domestic violence records to NICS. We also give grants of \n$125 million per year for 3 years to States to assess their systems for \nrapidly getting criminal conviction, domestic violence records and \nother records from the courtroom into the NICS database and for \nimproving those systems so as to eliminate the lag time between \nconviction and entry into NICS.\n  Better records mean instant checks: 72 percent of background checks \nare approved and completed within minutes, but 5 percent take days to \ncomplete for one reason only faulty records force law enforcement into \ntime consuming searches to locate final disposition records for felony \nand domestic violence convictions. It is our hope that this legislation \nwill finally make our records system complete and totally stop \nprohibited buyers from gaining access to firearms while allowing \nlegitimate buyers to be approved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7585-S7587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 311--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n    POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE \n                    DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED MATTERS\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Feingold, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 311\n\n       Whereas the Senate recalls the Stockholm Declaration of the \n     United Nations Conference on the Human Environment of 1972, \n     the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of the \n     United Nations Conference on Environment and Development of \n     1992, and Agenda 21--which provided the framework for action \n     for achieving sustainable development;\n       Whereas the pillars of sustainable development--economic \n     development, social development and environmental \n     protection--are interdependent and mutually reinforcing \n     components, and many countries continue to face overwhelming \n     social, environmental and economic challenges;\n       Whereas global environmental degradation is both affected \n     by and a

related to \n     the 3 pillars of sustainable development: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) having the President lead the United States delegation \n     would send a strong signal of United States support for the \n     goals of sustainable development;\n       (2) the United States should at the World Summit on \n     Sustainable Development--\n       (A) reaffirm its support for the implementation of \n     commitments entered into by the United States and the \n     international community at the United Nations Conference on \n     Environment and Development;\n       (B) support increased international cooperation to \n     implement the provisions of Agenda 21 and to address the \n     challenges of sustainable development in the twenty-first \n     century, including new specific targets and commitments, in \n     particular with respect to the protection of the oceans and \n     freshwater, combating deforestation, implementation of the \n     United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, \n     protection of the atmosphere including global climate change, \n     preservation of biological diversity, and reducing the use of \n     persistent bioaccumulative toxic pollutants;\n       (C) reaffirm the importance of integrating environmental \n     and social considerations into economic decision making, \n     including trade and investment agreements;\n       (D) support measures to improve compliance with and \n     enforcement of international environmental commitments;\n       (E) support measures to improve the economic, social, and \n     environmental well-being of develop countries, including the \n     mobilization of domestic and international resources and \n     development assistance beyond current levels;\n       (F) support the Global Environment Facility, which provides \n     critical financial assistance for environmental improvements \n     in the developing world, at a level which will allow it to \n     adequately fund ongoing and important new priorities;\n       (G) support good governance within each country and at the \n     international level as essential for sustainable development, \n     including sound environmental, social and economic \n     policies, democratic and transparent institutions \n     responsive to the needs of the people, public access to \n     information, the rule of law, anti-corruption measures, \n     gender equality and an enabling environment for \n     investment;\n       (H) support efforts to meaningfully improve the \n     institutional structure for implementing the framework \n     created by Agenda 21 and the Rio Declaration on Environment \n     and Development, as well as a more coherent and coordinated \n     approach among international environmental instruments;\n       (I) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling and to all \n     efforts to reopen international trade in whale meat or to \n     downlist any whale population in the Convention on \n     International Trade in Endangered Species; and\n       (J) support measures to increase the use of renewable \n     sources of energy throughout the world--for example, \n     encourage export credit agencies to foster more projects to \n     develop renewable energy resources;\n       (3) both at the world Summit on Sustainable Development and \n     in other appropriate fora, the United States should re-engage \n     in, provide leadership to, and urgently pursue the \n     negotiation of binding international agreements to address \n     global climate change consistent with--\n       (A) United States commitments under Article 2 of the United \n     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to ``achieve . \n     . . stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations at a level \n     that avoids dangerous anthropogenic interference with the \n     climate system . . . within a timeframe sufficient to allow \n     ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change . . .'';\n       (B) the findings of the Third Assessment Report of the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which the \n     Administration should support in its international \n     negotiations; and\n       (C) the Sense of Congress on Climate Change approved by the \n     Senate as part of the National Energy Policy Act of 2002;\n       (4) both at the World Summit on Sustainable Development and \n     in other appropriate fora, the United States should support, \n     provide leadership and urgently pursue the negotiation of \n     binding international agreements for the protection of the \n     marine environment, aimed at--\n       (A) reducing over-capacity of the global fishing fleet to \n     environmentally and economically sustainable levels;\n       (B) reducing bycatch, and protecting endangered migratory \n     species, such as sea turtles, marine mammals and sea birds;\n       (C) addressing the international aspects of marine debris;\n       (D) combating the degradation and destruction of coral \n     reefs; and\n       (E) reducing land-based pollution such as sewage and other \n     nutrients; and\n       (5) the President should identify priority international \n     environmental agreements that the United States has signed \n     during and following the United Nations Conference on \n     Environment and Development that the Administration will \n     present to the Senate for ratification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution \nwith my good friend and the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Mr. Jeffords of Vermont. We are pleased to be joined \nby Senators Boxer, Lieberman, Akaka, Murray, Durbin, Cantwell, \nTorricelli, Feingold, Leahy, and Bingaman in submitting this \nresolution.\n  The World Summit on Sustainable Development, WSSD, will take place \nAugust 26-September 4, 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa. The WSSD \nwill bring together tens of thousands of participants, including \ngovernments, environmentalists and business leaders. The WSSD is timed \nas the tenth anniversary of the groundbreaking United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, UNCED, held in Rio de \nJaniero in 1992. The overall goal of the WSSD is to assess the progress \nof countries in implementing the commitments made at Rio and to \nreinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development.\n  Among the core accomplishments of the Rio conference were ``Agenda \n21,'' which provides a comprehensive framework for achieving \nsustainable development, including chapters on protecting the \natmosphere and the oceans, and the Rio Declaration which sets forth \nprinciples such as the need for a precautionary approach in \nenvironmental protection. Also at Rio, several important international \nconventions were opened for signature: the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, UNFCC, and the Convention on Biological \nDiversity, CBD, both of which were ultimately signed by the United \nStates, with the UNFCC also ratified by the U.S. Senate.\n  I cannot emphasize how critical this world summit is. As a planet we \nneed to find a way forward, with countries large and small, rich and \npoor working together, to agree on steps that protect the environment \nyet allow our economies to grow sustainable. This resolution that I am \noffering today urges the administration to make this summit a priority, \nand to support the goals of sustainable development. This includes \nsupporting specific, concrete targets and timetables for implementing \nthe broad goals of Agenda 21, and a host of other common sense issues \nthat should be addressed at the WSSD. The United States must be a \nleader in demonstrating its commitments to these goals, and in showing \nthe world that economic growth can occur consistent with improved \nenvironmental quality. The resolution also calls on the United States \nto take a leading role both at the Summit as well as in other \nappropriate venues in negotiating binding international agreements to \naddress the very real threat of global climate change, as well as \nagreements to address critical oceans and fisheries issues facing the \nworld today.\n  This summit is a real opportunity for our Nation. It is my hope that \nthe Bush Administration will recognize it as such and work with the \ninternational community to develop a host of measures that will make \nthis planet a better place to live.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague and \nfriend Sen. John Kerry and ten other Senators to submit a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution concerning United States policy at the World Summit \non Sustainable Development, WSSD, an international conference to be \nheld in Johannesburg, South Africa from August 24-September 4, 2002. \nThe Kerry-Jeffords Resolution calls on the United States to reaffirm \nits current environmental and development commitments under and since \nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held \nin Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, otherwise known as the Earth Summit.\n  The Kerry-Jeffords Resolution also urges the United States to take \nits sustainable development commitments further through the full \nimplementation of ratified treaties such as the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification, two treaties of great importance \nto me. Implementation of these and other treaties should include \ncommitment to real targets and timetables. At a recent joint hearing \nbetween the Environment and Public Works and Foreign Relations \nCommittees, we learned that the United States has not maintained the \nspirit or the letter of its commitment under the Framework Convention. \nOther provisions in the Resolution call on the United States to be \nactively engaged in international negotiations that address\n\n[[Page S7587]]\n\nthe protection of oceans and freshwater, combating deforestation, \npreservation of biological diversity, increasing the use of renewable \nenergy sources, and reducing the use of persistent toxic pollutants.\n  The Resolution makes it clear that Presidential leadership of the \nUnited States delegation at the WSSD would send a strong signal of our \nNation's support for the goals of sustainable development. President \nBush's participation at Johannesburg would help rebuild alliances \nweakened by the Administration's diminished involvement in \ninternational climate change negotiations. His participation would also \nstrengthen relationships that are becoming increasingly important in a \nworld where any nation can face serious threats to its national \nsecurity and its environmental and human security. This Summit is an \nimportant opportunity to demonstrate that we will not act unilaterally \nwhen our actions can permanently and negatively affect the global \ncommons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7587-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7587-S7588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 133--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT USE FORCE AGAINST IRAQ, OUTSIDE OF THE \nEXISTING RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, WITHOUT SPECIFIC STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION \n OR A DECLARATION OF WAR UNDER ARTICLE I, SECTION 8, CLAUSE 11 OF THE \n                   CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution;

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Leahy and myself, \nI rise today to submit a concurrent resolution. This resolution is \naimed to deal with a great deal of the speculation we read about in the \npublic press as to whether there is an intent of the administration for \nuse of force against Iraq.\n  We all know that use of force requires a specific statutory \nauthorization or declaration of war under article I, section 8, clause \n11 of the Constitution of the United States. I believe the issue is not \na question of whether or not Iraq is a rogue state. It is. It is also \nnot a question of whether Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator. He is.\n  The question, however, is what is the best policy for the United \nStates and how to address these issues, and if we are to use force, \nthat we do so only after full debate and consideration of all of the \noptions and with a united Government and with the specific statutory \nauthorization of the Congress.\n  Under the Constitution, only the Congress can declare war, and I \noffer this resolution because of the growing sense, both within the \nUnited States and abroad, that the Bush administration is poised to \nlaunch a major military offensive against the Nation of Iraq.\n  Thus far, the administration has submitted no evidence of any Iraqi \nconnection to 9/11 to this Congress, and the resolution authorizing the \nuse of force against al-Qaida is specifically worded so that hard \nevidence of such a connection is needed to justify military action.\n  Conclusive proof that Saddam Hussein is, indeed, harboring weapons of \nmass destruction, that he is providing shelter for al-Qaida terrorist \ncells, or that he is in any way linked to the attacks of September 11 \nwould quickly galvanize support for military action. As of now, \nhowever, no such evidence has been substantiated.\n  At this time, moreover, I know of no formal support for a full-scale \nmilitary action from any other nation. I know of no formal grant to fly \nover or landing rights which would be granted by any nation in \nconnection with any invasion plan.\n  As far as I know at this point, the United States would be alone, \nunilaterally taking action. To take action without support from our \nallies or the United Nations would clearly identify the United States \nas an aggressor and may well prompt a series of potentially \ncatastrophic actions.\n  Both Turkey and Jordan, two of our most loyal and longstanding allies \nin the region, have been open about their concern about United States \nunilateral action at this time, making clear their opposition. They \nhave also pinpointed that the present crisis between the Israelis and \nthe Palestinians should be the world's primary focus in the Middle \nEast.\n  Until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is stabilized, until more than \na semblance of security and stability has returned to Israel and \nPalestine, a massive invasion against Iraq could expose the Israeli \npeople to possible missile strikes from Baghdad.\n  We should also remain focused and stay the course in our war on \nterror.\n\n[[Page S7588]]\n\nThe government of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan is increasingly unstable. \nThere are serious questions and concerns about security throughout \nAfghanistan. The warlords are restless and asserting power, and \npreviously dissipated Taliban elements are returning to Afghanistan. \nThe situation remains volatile.\n  The stabilization of Afghanistan, its successful transition to a \ndemocratic government, and its restoration of its war-torn economy \nshould remain a top priority for all of us. I believe it would be a \ntragic mistake if the United States turns its attention and effort from \nAfghanistan before the new Afghan Government is stabilized and security \nin the country is improved.\n  I, for one, strongly believe that Iraq should promptly agree to the \nreturn of the United Nations weapons inspectors it expelled in 1998. If \nthe government of Saddam Hussein has nothing to hide, something it \ncontinues to claim, then now is the time to prove it to the entire \nworld.\n  Iraq's refusal to cooperate is tacit admission of deception and of \nthe pursuit and stockpiling of chemical, biological, and, yes, \nadmission that the rumors of his pressing ahead to develop nuclear \nwarheads are, in fact, true.\n  Last week, at a meeting in Vienna, United Nations Secretary General \nKofi Annan told an Iraqi delegation in no uncertain terms that the \nIraqi Government must allow U.N. inspectors back in or there was no \npoint to continue discussions and negotiations.\n  There was no response from the Iraqi delegation, who simply left \nVienna and returned to Baghdad. I understand that Saddam Hussein is a \nbrutal dictator who during a 34-year reign of terror has systematically \neliminated all internal opposition, even including members of his own \nfamily. He has ruthlessly persecuted Iraq's Kurdish minority. He has \nused chemical weapons against the Kurds and his own people. He has \ninitiated a decade-long war against Iran, at the cost of nearly 2 \nmillion casualties. He has financially supported Palestinian terrorists \nand he has invaded Kuwait, prompting the United States to launch \nOperation Desert Storm.\n  In the history of our Nation, we have never attacked another country, \nexcept in response to an attack on our own shores, our people or our \nnational interests. Until and unless the administration is prepared to \ncome forward to offer its rationale, to submit its evidence to the \nAmerican people, and to allow Congress to vote to authorize the use of \nforce, an attack on Iraq, I believe, is both unwise and ill timed.\n  Unwise because it would certainly encourage an unprecedented response \nby Saddam Hussein, most likely targeted against Israel. Unwise because \nuntil the administration has thought through the who, the what, and the \nhow of the regime that will take power in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is \ndisposed of, any military action may well have unintended and \nundesirable consequences.\n  One cannot overemphasize how important the nature of the next Iraqi \nregime is to the future of the Middle East. It will require that the \nUnited States engage in nation building, something this administration \nhas been reluctant to do. Call it what you will, but in the wake of \ntoppling Saddam Hussein our commitment to Iraq must not be brief or \nperfunctory. This, I believe, is ill timed because of the unfinished \nbusiness in Afghanistan, the continuing threat of al-Qaida, and the \nfact that at least two-thirds of the al-Qaida leadership, including \nOsama bin Laden, remain at large.\n  The war against terror has not yet been won. We should stay the \ncourse. So before rushing precipitously forward in an attack on Iraq, I \nurge the Bush administration to work with allies and the United Nations \nto develop a multilateral approach to compel Iraq to live up to its \nobligations under Security Council Resolution 687.\n  Should Iraq be unwilling to live up to its obligations and the \nPresident determines that there is just cause for military action \nagainst Iraq, I urge him to come before this Congress, to come before \nthe American people, to make his case and let us in turn discharge our \nconstitutional duty to debate and vote on the authorization of the use \nof force. The many thousands of our sons and daughters who will bear \nthe brunt of such an operation, some of whom will surely pay the \nhighest price, deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7588-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7588-S7589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4327.

Mr. WELLSTONE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 812, to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act to provide greater access to affordable pharmaceuticals; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. STATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCOUNT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 70,000,000 Americans, including more than \n     18,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries, are uninsured or \n     underinsured for prescription drug coverage.\n       (2) High prescription drug prices are denying uninsured and \n     underinsured Americans access to medically necessary care, \n     thereby threatening their health and safety. Many of these \n     Americans require repeated doctor or medical clinic \n     appointments, becoming sicker because they cannot afford to \n     take the drugs prescribed for them. Many are admitted to or \n     treated at hospitals because they cannot afford the drugs \n     prescribed for them that could have prevented the need for \n     hospitalization. Many enter expensive institutional care \n     settings because they cannot afford the prescription drugs \n     that could have supported them outside of an institution. In \n     each of these circumstances, uninsured and underinsured \n     residents too often become medicaid recipients because of \n     their inability to afford prescription drugs.\n       (3) Pursuant to the Social Security Act, State medicaid \n     programs receive discounts in the form of rebates for \n     outpatient prescription drugs. On average, these rebates \n     provide discounts of more than 40 percent off retail prices.\n       (4) In 49 States, individual Americans do not have access \n     to medicaid rebates. But in 1 State, since June 1, 2001, over \n     100,000 Americans have received discounts from those rebates \n     through the ``Healthy Maine'' program. This program, \n     established as a demonstration project pursuant to a waiver \n     from the Secretary of Health and Human Services has proven to \n     work. Americans need that program replicated in every State, \n     immediately.\n       (5) The Federal and State governments are the only agents \n     that, as a practical matter, can play an effective role as a \n     market participant on behalf of Americans who are uninsured \n     or underinsured.\n       (b) State Prescription Discount Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1927(a) of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(7) Requirements relating to agreements for drugs \n     procured by individuals through state prescription drug \n     discount programs.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A manufacturer meets the requirements of \n     this paragraph if the manufacturer enters into an agreement \n     with the State to make rebate payments for drugs covered by a \n     State prescription drug discount program in the same amounts \n     as are paid by the manufacturer to the State for such drugs \n     under a rebate agreement described in subsection (b).\n       ``(B) State prescription drug discount program defined.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In this paragraph, the term `State \n     prescription drug discount program' means a State program \n     under which, with respect to a rebate period, not less than \n     the amount equal to 95 percent of all the rebates paid to the \n     State under agreements entered into under subparagraph (A) \n     during such period is provided to eligible State residents in \n     the form of discounted prices for the purchase of outpatient \n     prescription drugs.\n       ``(ii) Eligible state resident.--For purposes of clause \n     (i), the term `eligible State resident' means an individual \n     who is a State resident and--\n\n       ``(I) who is eligible for benefits under title XVIII; or\n       ``(II) whose income does not exceed 300 percent of the \n     income official poverty line (as defined by the Office of \n     Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance \n     with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1981) applicable to a family of the size involved.\n\n       ``(iii) Additional subsidies.--Nothing in this subparagraph \n     shall be construed as--\n\n       ``(I) requiring a State to expend State funds to carry out \n     a State prescription drug discount program; or\n       ``(II) prohibiting a State from electing to contribute \n     State funds to a State prescription drug discount program to \n     provide greater subsidies to eligible State residents for \n     outpatient prescription drugs covered under the program.\n\n       ``(C) No offset against medical assistance.--Amounts \n     received by a State under an agreement entered into under \n     subparagraph (A) in any quarter shall not be considered to be \n     a reduction in the amount expended under the State plan in \n     the quarter for medical assistance for purposes of section \n     1903(a)(1).''.\n       (2) Conforming Amendment.--The first sentence of section \n     1927(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-\n     8(a)(1)) is amended, by striking ``and paragraph (6)'' and \n     inserting ``, paragraph (6), and paragraph (7)''.\n       (c) Enhanced Rebates for State Medicaid Programs.--Section \n     1927(b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-\n     8(b)(1)(B) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Amounts'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii) and \n     subsection (a)(7)(C), amounts''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) Enhanced rebate.--In the case of a State that has a \n     State prescription drug discount program described in \n     subsection (a)(7) and that has entered into a rebate \n     agreement described in paragraph (1) or (4) of subsection (a) \n     that provides a greater rebate for a covered outpatient drug \n     than the rebate that would be paid for the covered outpatient \n     drug under subsection (c), then, notwithstanding clause (i), \n     only the amount equal to \\1/2\\ of the difference between the \n     amount received by the State in any quarter under such a \n     rebate agreement and the amount of the rebate that would be \n     paid under subsection (c) for such covered outpatient drug \n     shall be considered to be a reduction in the amount expended \n     under the State plan in the quarter for medical assistance \n     for purposes of section 1903(a)(1).''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     take effect on January 1, 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4328.

Mr. President, I do have to make a few remarks since my \ncolleague from New York made some very cogent, very important remarks \nthis evening.\n  I happen to have a lot of respect for my colleague from New York, and \nhe has the guts to really stand up and say that one of the reasons he \nis voting against some of these judges is the question of ideology. I \nthink he is dead wrong on that, but the fact is, I respect him for at \nleast being upfront and stating what he believes.\n  He has also said we need to have balance on the courts. I am not so \nsure that is a bad concept, but I believe whoever is President, we have \nto have that President's choice of judges. That is one thing we do when \nwe elect a President. Unless you can find some really valid reason for \nvoting against these judges, that I think has to be more than \nideology--at least that is my view--then you should vote for those \njudges, which is a practice I have followed throughout the Clinton \nadministration and throughout the Carter administration, as a matter of \nfact. I think it is the correct practice.\n  I still respect my colleague for his beliefs, for his forthright \nstatements.\n  I want to correct the record on a few things. No. 1, with regard to \nbalance, there is a lack of balance in many circuit courts of appeals \ntoday one way or the other. In the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 17 \nof the 23 judges are Democrats; 14 were appointed by none other than \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton.\n  In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the majority of them are \nDemocrats.\n  These are two very important circuit courts. In the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia, it could very easily have been \nthat way.\n\n  It comes down to whoever is President. That is one of the things we \ndo when we choose a President: We choose the person who is going to \npick the judges for the next 4 years. And I believe, unless you have a \nlegitimate reason--and it has to be a very legitimate reason for \nopposing those judges--you need to vote for them.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Vermont tonight say Judge \nSmith rules too much for corporations. Give me a break. He has been on \nthe bench 14 years. He has ruled for everybody during those 14 years. \nAnd, by the way, occasionally corporations are right. And if they are \nright, as judges in this country they ought to rule in their favor if \nit is a nonjury trial. They ought to be fair in their instructions if \nit is a jury trial and in the conduct of the trial if it is a jury \ntrial. Brooks Smith has had that type of reputation.\n  With regard to another comment of my friend from New York, he \ncontinues to repeat a myth that arose out of the Clarence Thomas \nproceedings. I happened to be there during those Clarence Thomas \nproceedings, and that myth is that he said he never discussed Roe v. \nWade. That is not what he said. He was\n\n[[Page S7614]]\n\nasked directly, and he said: I never debated it with my philosophy \nclassmates. That is a considerably different answer.\n  And from that, they extrapolated he never discussed it, and he wasn't \nasked any further questions about it by the same person who asked that \nquestion.\n  The fact of the matter is, some ideologically disagree with Justice \nThomas. Many on our side disagree with Justice Thurgood Marshall. I \nhappened to have respected him greatly. I didn't agree with a lot of \nthe things he wrote, but I also respected him.\n  Clarence Thomas is writing some of the most literate, intelligent \ndecisions on the Supreme Court right now.\n  Let me say the danger of the position of my friend from New York, in \nsaying ideology counts, is: Whose ideology? Because I have seen some \nvery conservative judges get on the bench and become very liberal \njudges almost overnight. I have seen some very liberal judges get on \nthe bench and become very conservative judges--maybe not overnight but \ncertainly in time.\n  I have to ask you, if you start talking ideology, whose ideology? \nThere are differences on the Democratic side on ideology. There are \ndifferences on the Republican side on ideology. Are we going to have a \nsingle litmus test to bar somebody from serving just because they may \nbe against Roe v. Wade or may be pro-life? Are we going to have a \nlitmus test against somebody serving because they once participated as \na corporate lawyer? A terrible thing to do, I guess.\n  No, we should not do that. If we took that attitude, that Roe v. Wade \nis paramount and preeminent in all judicial considerations, there would \nhave been very few Clinton judges. As I say, he came very close, \nvirtually was the same as the all-time confirmation champion, Ronald \nReagan.\n  So that is the danger, in my belief and in my philosophy, of the \nposition of the distinguished Senator from New York. I respect the \nposition. I respect his openness. I respect his forthrightness. I \nrespect him personally. He is very intelligent, a good lawyer--some \nwould say a great lawyer. I would say that. I enjoy being with him on \nthe Judiciary Committee. But his doctrine is a dangerous doctrine \nbecause--whose ideology?\n  People have tried to stereotype me the whole time I have been in the \nSenate. I just got finished writing a book that will be published this \nfall. It is going to be called ``The Square Peg.'' Guess who the square \npeg is. The fact is, that book is going to show I don't particularly \nfit in any category. Neither does the Senator from New York. In some \nrespects, he is a very conservative Senator. In other respects, he is \nvery liberal. I have had the same thing said about me. Does that mean \nneither of us could serve on any court because we might be conservative \non some issues, we might be liberal on other issues, that offend some \nin this body? No, it should not mean that.\n  Look, if a person is out of the mainstream, that is another matter. \nBut I have seen the argument come up time after time the judges are \noutside of the judicial mainstream. That is pure bunk, to be honest \nwith you. They do not get through this process where they are nominated \nby any President of the United States by being outside of the \nmainstream. They just do not. Some are conservative and some are \nliberal. This President has nominated some very liberal judges. He has \nnominated some very good conservative judges. He has nominated people \nin between. He has nominated Democrats. He has nominated Republicans.\n  But it is dangerous to say that anybody's personal ideology ought to \ndetermine whether a person serves on the bench if that person is \notherwise qualified.\n  I hope my colleague who is forced to sit there and listen to me at \nthis time as the Presiding Officer will reconsider at least some \naspects of his position because he may be chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee someday. When he is, he is going to find that in the interest \nof fairness, you have to presume and give the benefit of the doubt to \nthe President's nominee, especially unless you can show that they are \noutside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  I have to tell you that I haven't seen many--in my whole time in 26 \nyears in the Senate and confirming almost every judge that currently \nsits on the Federal bench--that I would consider coming close to being \noutside of the mainstream of American jurisprudence. By the time they \nget through the vetting process at the White House, the vetting process \nof the FBI, the vetting process of the American Bar Association, and \nwhen they wind up with a well-qualified rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, you can't say they are outside of the mainstream of \nAmerican jurisprudence, nor can you say that because they differ with \nyou ideologically you have to vote against them.\n  I happen to love my colleague. I just hope he will reconsider because \nI don't want him leading those who are less mentally equipped down the \nprimrose path of partisan politics.\n  I yield the floor to my dear colleague and friend from Florida, who \nhas really fought that good battle on S. 812, which is something I very \nmuch respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized after \nthe eloquent and kind remarks of the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also appreciate the kind remarks of the \nSenator from Utah and hope that he will open his Congressional Record \ntomorrow and will read the remarks that I am going to be delivering \nshortly, as we both share a very strong interest in the same \ndestination, which is to assure that the 40 million Americans who are \ncurrently benefitting by Medicare will see in this year a fulfillment \nof a long held aspiration, which is to expand Medicare benefits to \ninclude prescription drugs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7614-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7614-S7616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Gordon \nSmith of Oregon, and a number of other Members of the Senate, earlier \ntoday I introduced an amendment which will be debated beginning at 9:30 \ntomorrow, and voted on at 11 o'clock.\n  I would like to use this opportunity to briefly summarize some of the \nelements of that amendment, and then use that as the basis to respond \nto some comments which have been made questioning the desirability and \nappropriateness of passage of this amendment.\n  Our amendment has a simple objective. It is to bring Medicare into \nthe 21st century by providing for it what virtually every private \nhealth insurance plan has--coverage of prescription drugs.\n  When Medicare was established in 1965, prescription drugs were a \nrelatively minor part of a comprehensive health care program. In fact, \nit is surprising to know that in 1965 the average senior American spent \n$65 a year on prescription drugs. That number has increased 35 times to \nover $2,100 as the average amount that senior Americans are spending \nthis year on prescription drugs.\n  Our objective is to provide a modern Medicare Program by providing a \ncritical missing element from the current program.\n  In our debate a week ago, there was a great deal of concern about the \ncost of the plan. I introduced a plan which would have met fully the \nstandards of universal coverage, comprehensive in terms of drugs \ncovered, and affordable to the beneficiary. That plan received 52 \nvotes, which obviously is a majority of the Senate. Unfortunately, we \nweren't debating under the rules of majority rule. We were debating \nunder the rules that said you had to have 60 votes in order to overcome \nprocedural hurdles. We fell short of those 60 votes.\n\n  One of the reasons given for not voting for our plan was that it was \njust too expensive; it had to be reined in.\n  So we spent the last week reviewing our proposal to see what we could \ndo in order to make it more acceptable to our brethren so that we can \nget the 60 votes.\n  I want to again recognize and thank my colleague, Senator Gordon \nSmith, for the great contribution he has made in accomplishing this \ntask.\n  But one of the things we did was to say we are going to develop a \nplan which would cost no more than $400 billion over the next 10 years. \nWe received today from the Congressional Budget Office their scoring of \nour plan where they found the plan actually had a cost of $389 billion \nover the next 10 years. We thought that would be a goal--holding the \ncost to under $400 billion that\n\n[[Page S7615]]\n\nwould result in the support of people who had not voted for our bill \nlast year, saying: This is a proposition for which I can vote. \nUnfortunately, we didn't get that reaction. But we got the reaction \nthat challenged the Congressional Budget Office, and whether it had \naccurately scored our bill.\n  That is a little bit like challenging the umpire in a baseball game \nyou think is not calling the ball in the strike zone. We decided, just \nlike the American and National leagues decided, that we were going to \nhave an umpire for our deliberations, including an umpire for our \ndeliberations over a whole variety of spending, tax, health care, and \nother proposals that are going to cost the Federal Treasury. The \nCongressional Budget Office is that umpire. They have looked at our \nplan. They have given it a score of $389 billion.\n  It is interesting that the same persons who were challenging us and \nwho offered a competing plan have not received a Congressional Budget \nOffice estimate of their cost. We don't know what their plan is going \nto cost when the common standards of evaluation are applied. The one \nthat will be before us tomorrow has a Congressional Budget Office \nestimate of $389 billion.\n  The second thing we did was we looked at the architecture of the \nbill. We said we would like to have universal coverage, but we don't \nhave enough resources to provide meaningful universal coverage.\n  So we have two basic choices: One, you can put water in the soup, \nmake it thinner, and spread it out over more people or you can say, no, \nwe are going to identify those Americans who are most adversely \naffected by the Medicare benefit for prescription drugs. We identify \nthose people as being in two groups. One is those older Americans who \nhave unlikely high prescription drug bills.\n  I mentioned earlier the average senior American is a little more than \n$2,100. We set the standard of $3,300 for catastrophic. That is when \nthe cost of prescription drugs becomes beyond what you can expect many \nsenior Americans can pay. Remember, the average income for senior \nAmericans this year is about $14,000 to $15,000.\n  Second, we said the next group we would like to help is the neediest, \nthose who have the lowest income; and, therefore, the cost of \nprescription drugs takes a disproportionate amount of their meager \nincome.\n  We also said, however, there should be some benefits that all of \nAmerica's seniors can secure. For that group of Americans, we are going \nto provide the opportunity for a modest $25 a year enrollment fee to \nget a card, which will entitle them to get the benefits of pharmacy \nbenefit managers, who will negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies \nto get discounted prices, which will then be made available to the \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  In order to assure that those PBMs will be part of this and that all \nthe seniors will get even beyond what can be negotiated, we are going \nto provide a 5-percent supplemental reduction of the cost.\n  For example, if a senior had the standard cost of $100 for a \nparticular prescription, PBMs are estimated to be able to negotiate \nbetween a 15 and a 25-percent discount, so assume they can get 20 \npercent; that would reduce the cost of the drugs to 80 percent. Then \nthe Federal Government would pick up 5 percent of that cost, or $4, so \nthat the senior, instead of paying $100, would be paying $76. That is \nnot an insignificant benefit.\n  That same senior would also have an insurance policy against \ncatastrophic losses at $3,300. The peace of mind, the reduction of the \nfear of what the consequences would be if a healthy senior has a heart \nattack or develops some other serious chronic disease, where suddenly \ntheir prescription drug costs are escalating, this will give them that \npeace of mind.\n  There was another objection raised to that format that I just \noutlined, and that is, for the first time in the history of Medicare, \nwe are going to be making a differential; we are going to be \nrecognizing these Americans who have the lowest income among the 40 \nmillion seniors and give them some special benefits to help them, \nbecause they are the neediest of our seniors, to be able to meet the \ncost of their prescription drugs. I plead guilty. We are doing that.\n  We are saying that the poorest of America's seniors, which we define \nas those who are at or below 200 percent of poverty, will get \nprescription drugs from the time they enroll in this program, with only \na modest copayment of $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs.\n  It is said this is the first time we have ever split the Medicare \npopulation and provided such special treatment for a class; in this \ncase, a class defined because of the level of their need. That is not \ntrue. In fact, we have a number of examples in Medicare today where we \nare providing different benefits based on income. Just to mention two \nof those, we have a program called SLiMBies and QMBies.\n  SLiMBies are for those Americans who have an income between 100 \npercent and 120 percent of poverty. For those, there is a payment of \nthe Part B premiums, which today are running approximately $50 a month. \nThe Federal Government picks up the cost of those payments for \nAmericans between 100 and 120 percent of poverty. For those who are at \nor below 100 percent of poverty, we not only pay for their premiums, we \nalso pay for their deductibles and their coinsurance.\n  So America, a compassionate society, has had a history of recognizing \nthe special circumstances of the neediest of our elderly. We will \nextend that policy by the amendment which we will vote on tomorrow.\n  We will have, as the delivery system for this drug benefit, Medicare \nas we have known it, Medicare as it has served the interests of senior \nAmericans for 37 years.\n  There are some who say that is an out-of-date system; it is an \nantiquated process, that we need to get private insurance to deliver \nprescription drug benefits.\n  That was an intriguing idea, so I began to ask: What is our \nexperience with private insurance delivering a prescription drug \nbenefit? In fact, I had the conversation with a number of \npharmaceutical company executives who have been a primary advocate of \nthis plan, private insurance delivering prescription drug benefits. I \nasked: How do you, and how do your employees, get their prescription \ndrugs? They said: Well, we have a contract with an insurance company \nthat provides for the health care coverage of our employees, including \nmyself and they, in turn, contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to \nadminister the drug component of our health care program.\n  I said: No. Do you have, for the drug component of health care for \nyour employees, a separate program with a separate private insurance \npolicy?\n  They said: No, we don't have such a program. In fact, I don't think \none exists.\n  Do know what. They are right. One does not exist. Nobody is offering \na prescription drug-only private insurance policy, which is what some \nwould say should be the method by which we deliver prescription drugs \nto 40 million older Americans.\n  I would analogize it to putting those 40 million older Americans on \nthe Wright brothers first flight at Kitty Hawk. Do you want to really \nexperiment with such a significant part of the health care of older \nAmericans when nobody in any other sector, public or private, is using \nsuch a plan? I don't think that is a very prudent or conservative idea.\n  Why are there no insurance companies that are providing a drug-only \nprescription benefit? The answer is: Because they say it is not an \ninsurable risk. It would be the same answer that you would get if you \nwere to ask: I own a house, and I want to buy fire insurance, but I \nonly want to buy the fire insurance to cover the kitchen, or I have a \nrear bedroom which is next to an old and creeky tree that might fall \nover and crush the roof in a wind storm, so I only want to cover that \nback room.\n  The insurance company would turn you down. They would say: We are not \ngoing to insure a specific room within your house; we will insure your \nwhole house and take the total risk, but we won't let you parcel it out \npiece by piece.\n  That is the same answer as to why no private insurance company today \nis providing a prescription drug-only benefit. They will insure your \nwhole body. They will insure all of the health care that you might \nrequire. But they will\n\n[[Page S7616]]\n\nnot break it down into individual fragmented pieces, such as a \nprescription drug-only insurance policy.\n  There are some other concerns, such as if you were to go to a private \ninsurance policy, you would run very strong possibilities that there \nwould be big sections of the country that would not be covered because \nthey have populations that are peculiarly expensive. One of those which \nwe are already seeing in the whole body of insurance called \nMedicare+Choice--an HMO that insures not just prescription drugs but \nall of your health care needs--is almost nonexistent in rural America.\n  Why are they not in rural America? It is not because there are not \ndoctors and hospitals and other facilities that can treat people in \nrural America. It is because the population of seniors in rural America \nis actuarially expensive and, therefore, an unattractive population to \ninsure and treat.\n  According to a 1998 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, rural \nbeneficiaries are 20 percent more likely to be in fair or poor health \nthan their urban cousins. Rural seniors are 20 percent more likely to \nbe under 150 percent of the Federal poverty level than their urban \ncousins.\n  A study that was done in June of this year by the National Economic \nCouncil said that rural beneficiaries are 50 percent less likely to \nhave drug coverage compared to their urban counterparts, which probably \nmeans they are less healthy because they have not had equal access to \ndrugs. They use 10 percent more prescriptions than urban seniors, and \nnearly 60 percent of rural beneficiaries reported not being able to \npurchase drugs because of their cost.\n  We know from our experience with Medicare+Choice that HMOs will not \naccept the risk of covering this urban population. What leads us to \nbelieve they are not similarly going to be left behind with this effort \nto have prescription drug only insurance policies? I think the answer \nis, unfortunately, they will be left behind.\n  This last issue is not really a debate about drug coverage. It is a \ndebate, rather, about Medicare itself. Shall Medicare continue to be a \nuniversal program that is administered through the Federal Government \nor shall it be a program whose administration will be privatized? That \nis the debate.\n  We know there are people in this Chamber and particularly the \npredecessors who were here in the 1960s who thought that Medicare would \nfail, that it was not a sustainable system. I say quite to the \ncontrary, Medicare has delivered on its promise of substantially \nincreasing the health and welfare of older Americans.\n  That brings me to my concluding observation which is that today is a \nfortuitous day to be having this debate because it happens to be the \nanniversary of Medicare. On July 30, 1965, then-President Lyndon \nJohnson went to Independence, MO, the home of President Harry Truman, a \nman who had spent much of his political career advocating for the needs \nof senior Americans and particularly access to affordable health care. \nSo it was fitting and proper that President Johnson signed the bill at \ntheir home and then gave the first two Medicare cards to President \nHarry Truman and his wife Bess. That is the tradition we have had, a \ngreat tradition of service, respectful and compassionate, to America's \nseniors.\n  We would honor that tradition if tomorrow we adopt the amendment \nwhich will for the first time in its history expand a prescription drug \nbenefit for the beneficiaries of Medicare. It is a step which will not \nonly honor those who 37 years ago championed this program, but it will \nalso honor those who are served by it today, our grandparents, our \nparents, our family, and friends who look to Medicare as the means of \nsecuring their health care. Those are the people for whom we will be \nvoting tomorrow.\n  I hope my colleagues will grasp this opportunity to see that we bring \nMedicare into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/30/senate-section/article/S7616-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
