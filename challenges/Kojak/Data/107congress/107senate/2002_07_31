Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 90 minutes for debate, equally divided, on the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Graham amendment No. 4345.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The history of the American people is one of a never-ending journey \ntoward the goal of a more perfect Union. Americans believe in the ideal \nof equal opportunity so that individuals can achieve their fullest \npotential. We also believe that we are members of a great national \nfamily which seeks to protect all of its members. We understand that if \none of us is hurting, all of us are hurting.\n  In this quest for a more perfect Union, we have encountered and \novercome obstacle after obstacle. At the turn of the last century, we \npassed antitrust laws to begin the long process of controlling \ncorporate abuse and asserting that the public interest must take \nprecedence over the selfish interests of wealthy corporations.\n  We passed minimum wage laws to assert that a worker's right to a \nliving wage took precedence over business rights to maximize profits.\n  We passed the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act to guarantee a \nsecure and dignified retirement to every American who works hard and \npays into the system.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, we passed landmark legislation to curb the modern-\nday robber barons whose dishonesty and greed have done so much to \ndamage our economy and to defraud so many workers and investors of \ntheir hard-earned savings.\n  Today, Americans face a crisis in health care. The miracle medicines \nthat can save and prolong life more and more are beyond the reach of \naverage Americans. The prescription drugs we need to stay healthy and \nalive are just too expensive, and their costs go up and up with each \npassing day.\n  For the last week, we have been grappling with two more obstacles to \na more perfect Union and a better life for all of our people: The \nexploding costs of prescription drugs and the failure of Medicare to \ncover those costs. The rapid rise in the cost of drugs burdens \nfamilies, businesses, and patients, and our economy.\n  For the last 6 years, prescription drug costs have been escalating at \ndouble-digit rates: 10 percent in 1996, 14 percent in 1997, 15 percent \nin 1998, 16 percent in 1999, 17 percent in 2000 and 2001.\n  It is unacceptable when older Americans struggle to afford their \nheart medicines and diabetes medicines. It is reprehensible when hard-\nworking families are impoverished trying to pay for the drugs that keep \ntheir children in the classroom and out of the hospital, but it is \nintolerable when much of their burden has been created by the \nwealthiest corporations in America, the brand-name drug companies, \ndeploying an army of lawyers, lobbyists, and campaign contributions to \nexploit and maintain loopholes in the law to block competition and \nunfairly boost prices.\n  Today, the Senate is on trial. We will vote on whether to end those \nabuses, and just as the Senate has voted resoundingly to close \naccounting loopholes abused by Enron and WorldCom, we must also close \nthe loopholes in our drug patent laws that are exploited by big drug \ncompanies and are hurting patients each and every day.\n  Ending the abuses of the law that have contributed to escalating drug \nprices will help every family. But the most important step we can take \nin this Congress towards the goal of a more perfect Union is to act at \nlong last to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n  Last week, the Senate failed to fulfill its responsibility to senior \ncitizens and their families. This week, we have the opportunity and the \nobligation to do better and to provide a downpayment on our commitment \nto provide a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program.\n  Medicare is a solemn promise between our Government and our citizens. \nIt says: Play by the rules, contribute to the system during your \nworking years, and you will be guaranteed health security in your \nretirement years. Because of Medicare, the elderly have long had \ninsurance for their hospital bills and doctor bills. But the promise of \nhealth security at the core of Medicare is broken every single day \nbecause Medicare does not cover the soaring price of prescription \ndrugs. We can no longer ignore the sad fact that too many senior \ncitizens are living in pain because they cannot afford prescription \ndrugs.\n  Too many elderly citizens must choose between food on the table and \nthe medicine their doctors prescribe. Too many elderly are taking half \nthe drugs their doctors prescribe or none at all because they cannot \nafford them.\n  Senior citizens built our country. They fought in our wars. They \ncreated our economic growth and prosperity. They worked hard. They \nsupported their families. They played by the rules. And they stood up \nfor America. Now is the time for America to stand up for them.\n  Last week, a majority of the Senate voted for the Graham-Miller-\nKennedy amendment, a comprehensive program to provide prescription drug \ncoverage under Medicare and mend its broken promise. A minority stood \nagainst the seniors and with powerful special interests, but under the \nrules of the Senate that minority was able to block action. Just as the \nRepublican Party opposed the creation of the Medicare Program in 1965, \nit opposed the enactment of a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit today.\n  The Senate is once again confronted with a choice: Is our priority \nprescription drugs for the elderly or more tax breaks for the wealthy? \nWill we give senior citizens the same loyalty that they gave our \ncountry or will we continue to offer an open hand to the powerful \nspecial interests and the back of our hand to the elderly and their \nfamilies?\n  Over the coming years, Americans will spend $1.8 trillion on \nprescription drugs. So far, our Republican colleagues have said no to \namendments that would cover only a third of those costs. Yet under the \nSenate health plan, Senators have 75 percent of their prescription \ndrugs covered. How many of us are willing to face our constituents when \nwe go home in August knowing we have secure coverage for 75 percent of \nour drug coverage but we reject proposals that do even less for our \nfellow citizens?\n  The Graham-Smith amendment is a bipartisan compromise. It is not the \ncomprehensive program that I want or that a majority of the Senate \nwants, but it is an important downpayment on the kind of program senior \ncitizens need and deserve. Under this proposal, every senior citizen \nwill receive assistance and those with the greatest need will receive \nthe most help.\n  I ask that during the quorum call, the time be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I have a somewhat longer statement I \nwill deliver later, but at this point I\n\n[[Page S7619]]\n\nwill indicate clearly to my colleagues what exactly we are going to be \ndoing in approximately an hour and 15 minutes. We will be voting on \nwaiving the point of order that we anticipate will be raised against \nthis amendment based on noncompliance with the budget resolution.\n  Let's look at a few facts. In 2001, the Senate established, as the \namount of money to be expended for a prescription drug benefit for 10 \nyears, from 2001 to 2011, the number of $300 billion. That is the last \nbudget resolution the Senate has enacted. The Senate Budget Committee, \nin 2002, reexamined what would be required for an adequate prescription \ndrug benefit, and they recommended up to $500 billion, but that \nresolution has never been adopted.\n  So 18 months later, we are being constrained by a $300 billion \nnumber, which has been found to be inadequate by the Budget Committee. \nThe irony is that both the Republican proposal, the proposal of Senator \nGrassley and others, and the Graham-Smith proposal have a total \nexpenditure of $400 billion minus. There is probably not a 2- or 3-\npercent difference in the amount of money the Grassley bill and the \nGraham-Smith bill have found to be necessary in order to provide our \nseniors an adequate prescription drug benefit.\n  The issue of whether we are going to need to waive the Budget Act in \norder to get to the substance of this issue is one upon which both \nsides have agreed. So why do we not say yes, we have agreed that it is \ngoing to take more than $300 billion to have an adequate prescription \ndrug benefit? Let's vote today to waive the Budget Act, and then we can \nhave the full debate with amendments and all of the means by which \nMembers of the Senate can express their specific policy positions on a \nvariety of issues on this complex subject. If we cannot get past the \nBudget Act, the whole effort to provide 40 million Americans with some \nbetter access to a key component of their life and health will be \nagain, for the seventh straight year, denied.\n  I do not believe that is the record this Senate wants to go on. Let's \nhave a vote to do what we have all agreed--that it will cost more than \n$300 billion to provide a benefit. Then let's move on to a discussion \nthat justifies the title of this institution as being the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. Let us deliberate. Let us not quibble over \nthe issues of dollars for which there is no quibbling because we both \nagree as to what it is going to cost to provide this benefit.\n  This is the last opportunity we are likely to have in 2002 to provide \nAmerica's seniors this benefit. A vote against waiving the Budget Act \nis a vote for another year of denial. It is also a vote that when we \ncome back next year, we are not going to be talking about the $400 \nbillion that both sides have now agreed is necessary, we are going to \nbe talking about a substantially higher number because of another year \nof prescription drug inflation and another year of that baby boom surge \nof entrants into the Medicare Program.\n  If we think it is difficult today to vote to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit, be assured it will be only more difficult every year into \nthe future.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the reality of what we are doing and \nat least vote to waive the Budget Act so we can get on to a full debate \non this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOregon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Senator Kennedy, the manager of this \nbill, and my cosponsor of this legislation, Senator Graham, for the \ntime.\n  I say to the American people, what few may be up this morning \nwatching these proceedings, that this is probably our last best chance \nto pass prescription drugs in the 107th Congress, and I think it is \ncritical we do so.\n  I am optimistic we are going to succeed, but if we do not, it will be \nbecause of that old maxim that the perfect is the enemy of the good. \nWhat Senator Graham and I have is the best we can produce for the \ngreatest number of people, particularly the neediest, but for everyone \nin terms of discount cards and in terms of a catastrophic coverage. We \nhave the best we can do with the financial constraints faced by this \nGovernment.\n  We have produced a plan that is affordable for seniors and it is \naffordable for the U.S. Government. It is a plan at a minimum that we \nought to pass.\n  I thought what I would do in my remarks today was to try to give a \ncomparison between our bill and the competing bill. Both of these bills \ncan work. I have, in fact, voted for a version of the Grassley-Breaux \nbill. However, I am now on this bill because I think this is more in \nthe realm of what is possible and workable.\n\n  I will spend some time focusing on the health and financial security \naspect, which is what is available to every American under our plan who \nis under Medicare, and then focus on the sickest and the poorest, the \nprotection for the most vulnerable in our society. Let me start first \nwith the most vulnerable in our society.\n  Let's compare the low-income benefit. Under Grassley-Breaux, the low-\nincome folks are covered at 150 percent of poverty; under the Graham-\nSmith bill, people 200 percent of poverty are covered. Under Grassley-\nBreaux, it includes an assets test which will drop 40 percent of \notherwise income-eligible elderly; under Graham-Smith, there is no \nasset test. Under their proposal, beneficiaries below 200 percent of \npoverty can pay up to $3,700 due to copays, deductibles, and premiums. \nUnder ours, beneficiaries out of pocket are limited to drug copays of \n$2 for generic and $5 for brands. That is an enormous difference in \nterms of what they will have to pay and who will be included.\n  Under their plan, they provide more limited coverage than some \nelderly get in current employer programs or State pharmacy assistance \nprograms. Under our plan, coverage for low-income elderly is as \ncomprehensive as State pharmacy assistance programs. CBO estimates that \nno employer will drop coverage because of what we have.\n  As to the catastrophic limit, their proposal kicks in at $3,700. Our \nproposal kicks in at $3,300, a very big difference, a 12-percent \ndifference. That matters a great deal at the low end of the economic \nscale in our country.\n  Some may say this does not cover enough people. Let me give a few \nexamples of a few States and how much this plan helps. These are \npercentages of people in various States falling below 200 percent of \npoverty: In Vermont, 42 percent of their elderly fall below that; in \nthe State of Mississippi, 46 percent; in the State of Maine, 37 \npercent; in the State of Ohio, 41 percent; in the State of Nevada, 41 \npercent; the State of Illinois, 41 percent also; the State of Nebraska, \n43 percent; the State of Iowa, 38 percent; in the State of Louisiana, \n52 percent; in the State of Indiana, 46 percent; in the State of \nAlabama, 56 percent; in the State of Pennsylvania, 43 percent; and the \nState of Rhode Island, 48 percent.\n  These are dramatic numbers. There is hardly a State in the Union that \nfalls below 40 percent of people who will be covered 100 percent by the \nGraham-Smith proposal. That is significant. That is an incredible start \non a prescription drug program.\n  Let me turn to the health and financial security aspects and compare \nboth bills. The premiums and fees: Under Grassley-Breaux, the elderly \nwill pay $288 per year or more. The premiums imposed are imposed \nmonthly, despite periods when the beneficiary receives no benefit. \nUnknown premium amounts that can vary by area dramatically, year by \nyear. Under ours, there is no monthly premium.\n  Now to the deductible. Under theirs there is a $250 per year \ndeductible. Under Graham-Smith there is no deductible.\n  Universal coverage: Under Grassley-Breaux, only low-income and those \nchoosing to pay monthly premiums are covered. Under ours, all seniors \nand covered disabled are covered after a $25 annual fee.\n  As to employer coverage and crowding out private plans, the CBO \nestimates a third of current employer benefits will be dropped if \nGrassley-Breaux goes through. They estimate that under the Graham-Smith \nproposal all seniors and disabled will be covered, and they estimate no \nloss of current employer coverage. I think that is terribly \nsignificant. Ours overlays the existing program much better than the \nGrassley-Breaux proposal.\n\n  Now as to guarantee of current coverage levels: Under Grassley-\nBreaux,\n\n[[Page S7620]]\n\nsome low-income elderly would receive reduced coverage than under the \ncurrent State pharmacy programs. But under ours, low-income elderly are \nguaranteed a comprehensive benefit with a nominal cost sharing. CBO \nestimates under Grassley-Breaux one-third loss of current employer \ncoverage, and coverage could be far worse than the elderly currently \nreceive. CBO estimates under ours, no loss of current employer \ncoverage.\n  Now, the stability of the delivery system. Grassley-Breaux imposes an \nuntried and untested insurance model on our Nation's elderly and \ndisabled and results in employer crowd-out. I assume this insurance \nprogram in the private sector could be developed, but it does not exist \nright now. So we are betting that it can be developed and that people \nwould like it.\n  In the State of Oregon, if you ask how they like their private \ninsurance, it is not much; they do not like it much. While they \ncomplain about Medicare, they certainly want us to support it.\n  Then on this issue of a stable delivery system: Senator Graham and I \nbuild upon current State and market-based delivery models, and we do \nnot result in an employer crowd-out. What is the overall cost? The \nGrassley-Breaux approach is scored at somewhere between $375 and $400 \nbillion over 10 years. Ours is scored at $390 billion over 10 years. So \nthey are comparable in that regard.\n  I conclude my remarks by saying we will hear this morning about the \n``cliff''--that after 200 percent of poverty the people do not get \nanything; if you make $24,000 as a couple, you fall off a cliff. I wish \nwe had a more graduated program, I grant that. There are many things \nabout what Senator Graham and I have that I would change if I could, \nbut I can't, and get something passed and into conference. So let's \nstart here.\n  Let me simply say to those who would describe this as a cliff, that \nyou get nothing if you make more than $24,000 a year, to me it is not \nnothing to say that for $25 a year you get a discount card that, at a \nminimum, gives you 5 percent off all your prescriptions, but probably, \nbecause you get the benefit of pricing discounts, you get as much as 30 \npercent off every prescription drug, and, moreover, you add to that the \nfact that you never have to worry again as a senior in America that \nwhen you lose your health, you have to lose your home--you do not have \nto choose between food and medicine. That is significant. Tell me where \nin the private sector you can find an insurance policy that, for $25 a \nyear, will do all of that.\n  Have we done enough? No. Have we done a tremendous amount of good? \nAbsolutely.\n  I plead with my colleagues to vote to waive this point of order. We \nshould not fail today. We should get this to the floor. People have \nideas. We can perhaps make it better. But we can get on with the \nbusiness that the seniors and citizens of this country are expecting. \nLet us get beyond the war of words and get to a prescription of \nwellness for the seniors and provide them a benefit that is workable, \ntried and true, affordable for them and our Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes, to be followed \nby the Senator from Maine, 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, I rise in opposition of the Graham drug Medicare \nproposal. I will make four points regarding my opposition in the few \nminutes I will speak.\n  The first point is, the bills we are considering on the Senate floor \nhave not gone through the committee process. That is important for the \nAmerican people to understand. It makes it incredibly challenging to \nreceive an amendment yesterday such as this and having the opportunity \nonly to read it for the first time. This legislation is very \ncomplicated.\n  In looking at the this bill compared to the bill passed by the House \nof Representatives, the tripartisan proposal or the bi-partisan Hagel-\nEnsign bill, the major substantive objection I have is that the bill \ncosts more and yet fewer people benefit.\n  We do have huge gaps of coverage. We have huge gaps in terms of being \nable to look seniors in the eye and say, yes, we understand your \nproblem is affordable access to prescription drugs, and then walk away \nbecause they don't fall into the category. There are cliffs and gaps \nand chasms, and these vacuums exist for that individual who falls into \none of these gaps or chasms because we do not cover everybody in the \nsense of addressing their problem; that is, health care security for \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Of all the bills we have considered, this is not really a compromise \nbill. It is a very different bill that costs more and covers fewer and \nfewer people.\n  The tripartisan comprehensive plan the Senator from Maine put on the \ntable--and we will hear from her shortly, along with Senators Grassley \nand Breaux and Jeffords is a much more comprehensive bill that I argue \ngives more secure comprehensive coverage and helps a broader swathe of \npeople. If you look at individuals with disabilities, it doesn't have \nthese categories of exclusion. Where there are some areas that you do \nnot get as complete coverage, it is gradual, and you do not have these \ncliffs, these drop-offs. If you make one dollar more, all of a sudden \nyou do not get the coverage.\n  In terms of how many people are covered, it is hard to factor it out. \nWe have about 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities around this country. Of the 38 million, \nthere are an estimated 18 million who are above 200 percent of poverty. \nWe heard yesterday and last night about this drop-off, this cliff. Once \nyou get to 200 percent of the poverty level for an individual or for a \ncouple, all of a sudden you do not get benefits. There is a huge hole, \na huge chasm, a gap that is there, this drop-off. Above 200 percent you \nget a minimum benefit of 5 percent. That does not give me the security \nto look in somebody's eye and say we are really helping you. We need to \nmake affordable access to prescription drugs, which is our goal, a \nreality.\n  Only about 2 million of those 18 million will ever qualify for the \ncatastrophic benefit. So you have 18 million above the cutoff level of \n200 percent of poverty with very minimal benefit. But people say: Yes, \nfor catastrophic coverage they will be helped. At the end of the day, \nonly 2 million out of the 18 million will fall into that catastrophic \ncategory, again leaving essentially no benefit for 16 million seniors \ntoday.\n  I think it is important for our seniors to understand. I do not want \nto leave this body 2 days from now saying we passed prescription drugs, \nwe took care of your problem, you will have affordable access to \nprescription drugs--which seems to be the implication. It has been said \nthat we cannot leave here on recess without passing a package. This \npackage is a shell, and it does not give seniors affordable access to \nprescription drugs.\n  If we pass it, we are not being honest going home saying we passed a \nreal prescription drug package. It costs more, covers fewer people than \nwhat we have had on the floor, what we have been discussing. If we go \nback to the Finance Committee, I think we can come up with a very good \nbill. Under this bill, at least 15 million to 16 million seniors are \nleft behind. That is, they do not get a substantial benefit; they only \nget that 5-percent discount. Fifteen million to 16 million people we \nare leaving behind.\n  Second, I think from our standpoint it is irresponsible to pass a \nbill and pretend we are doing something that we are not really doing \nwhen we have alternatives. If we did not have alternatives, we could \nsay this is our best shot, and we can build on it in the future. But, \nreally, the two bills that came to the floor each had different \napproaches. The initial Graham bill was much more Government run. The \ntripartisan bill involved the public and private sector, but both of \nthose bills had more comprehensive coverage. For the seniors who are \nlistening, for the dollar value, they had more benefits than the bill \nbefore us today. Therefore, we should not, by default, end up passing a \nbill today just to say that we have passed something.\n\n  Politically, people might be able to claim a victory saying we passed \nprescription drugs, but this particular bill never addresses the \n``affordable'' problem, affordable prescription drugs.\n  The response to that is we are taking a good first step, and we have \nto do something. If we do something, maybe\n\n[[Page S7621]]\n\nwe can work on it later. If we knew what that ``later'' was, I would \nsay yes, we should have a one-two punch and come back. I have a great \ndeal of confidence if we pass this, we will not come back and visit \nthis in September or October and put together a truly comprehensive \nplan. We are not addressing the fundamental problem of seniors not \nbeing able to afford lifesaving drugs.\n  The third point I want to make is this bill fails to recognize that \nprescription drugs are, and need to be, considered a part of the \noverall modernization of Medicare. Yes, I admit all the bills we have \nconsidered over the last 2 weeks have not fully addressed the fact that \nprescription drugs need to be a part of the full armamentarium of what \na physician has to deal with, what a hospital has to deal with, that \ndoctor-patient relationship and outpatient care.\n  We are treating prescription drugs sort of on the outside, as if it \nis an appendage to Medicare, without in any way addressing the \nfundamental problems of Medicare. In truth, the sustainability, long-\nterm, of whatever we promise--whether it is acute or long-term or \npreventive care--has to be part of a more comprehensive approach which \nwe addressed. I mention that because the tripartisan bill, of all the \nbills we mention on the floor, is the only one that is health care \nsecurity for our seniors, like the surgeon's knife, like acute care, \nchronic care, or preventive medicine. Remember, the tripartisan bill \ncosts $370 billion, and the more limited bill we are considering on the \nfloor is even more than that because the tripartisan bill at least \nreached out and said we understand prescription drugs are a part of \noverall Medicare. This bill does not address that. It has no element of \nmodernization at all.\n  Thus, I think the bill on the floor, of all the bills we have \nconsidered, is the least effective in accomplishing what seniors \nexpect. It does not guarantee seniors comprehensive prescription drug \ncoverage. It locks into place a limited stopgap proposal. Everybody \nsays this is not the answer but this is sort of a stopgap, something to \ndo now. But it locks it in place at a far higher cost than it needs to. \nThe taxpayers are paying for this--the people who are listening to me \nnow. It is, my colleagues, constituents. All over the country, people \nare paying into this as taxpayers. So we need to give them an effective \nproduct as we go forward. The product itself, I think, is insufficient.\n  As I mentioned, it leaves a gaping hole in coverage. This is my final \npoint. We have talked about doughnuts earlier in the debate. All last \nweek we talked about a doughnut, which is a gap of people who simply do \nnot get the benefits that other people get. This has a much larger gap \nthan, again, any other bills; than the tripartisan proposal or the \nproposal that passed the House of Representatives, for example, several \nmonths ago.\n  It fails to provide Medicare beneficiaries with either an effective \ndrug prescription benefit or some of the other much needed improvements \nthat are present in the tripartisan bill.\n  I will close by simply saying that I think at this juncture the most \nprudent thing to do is to table this bill because of the reasons I have \noutlined and to recognize we have made huge progress compared to even a \nyear ago. It was 3 years ago that we had the Medicare Commission. It \nbasically proposed a public-private approach. That approach has been \nbuilt upon by a series of bills. We have made great progress over the \nlast 2 weeks. The Medicare debate is on the floor. People have talked \nabout it. We recognize deficiencies. We recognize some advantages in \nsome of the bills. I think the best thing to do is to go back through \nregular order that is usually in this body, and that is to go through \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Let that process, based on what we know and what we talked about \ntoday, work so we can have that particular debate, and move forward.\n  I will be voting against this bill. I will be voting, if there is a \npoint of order, to table the bill. I will support that, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to do so.\n  I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me the \ntime.\n  I concur with what has just been suggested by the Senator from \nTennessee in terms of returning to the regular process so that we can \ngo back and resume the negotiations and discussions that were well \nunderway over the course of the weekend with Senators from across the \naisle--Senators Kennedy, Baucus, and Wyden--even through Monday to \nreach an agreement that would provide for comprehensive coverage for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  There is no reason we cannot have that discussion to develop the kind \nof plan that seniors deserve in the Medicare Program.\n  As I said yesterday, we should not have this vote. Why entrench and \npolarize both sides on this issue? Why make it more intractable? Why \nnot go back and begin the process of negotiations that were well \nunderway using the tripartisan plan as a basis? It provides \ncomprehensive coverage. There is no reason we can't begin that process. \nThis doesn't have to be the last vote.\n  With the Medicare give-back in the fall, we have an opportunity \nduring this interim to begin this process anew so that we can achieve \nand craft a comprehensive plan that seniors need and deserve.\n  Looking over this proposal, there are many troubling features. I \nthink that we ought to deal with the facts.\n  First of all, the proposal before us today, if you had told me more \nthan a year ago--as the tripartisan group with Senator Breaux, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and myself, as members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee invited all members of the Finance \nCommittee to participate in this process--if somebody told me when we \nembarked on this legislative odyssey that somehow we would be \nconsidering in a serious way today a proposal that abandoned the basic \nprecepts that had been the underpinning of the Medicare Program since \nits creation 37 years ago yesterday when President Johnson signed into \nlaw the Medicare Program--we never contemplated or considered during \nthe course of this last year when we developed that tripartisan plan \nthat we would abandon universal coverage. We never contemplated \nabandoning the ability to pay and resorting to a means-test program \nthat is now before the Senate--a means-test program that places the \nlow-income benefit in the Medicaid Program--not Medicare, in the \nMedicaid Program.\n  These are huge departures from the principles that we have embraced \nhere in Congress year after year. In fact, the vote last week, with 97 \nvotes on both sides of the aisle, was for the original plan that we \nwere embracing for universal coverage--the principles that AARP and the \nmajor organizations representing seniors in America have always and \nconsistently embraced for the 37 years of Medicare existence. Now the \nproposal before us abandons all of those principles.\n  It most certainly doesn't advance or improve the prescription drug \ndebate. In fact, the bill before us today has not had the advantage of \nscrutiny by the Congressional Budget Office because the language of \nthis amendment specifically has not been reviewed by the Congressional \nBudget Office in order to prepare a cost estimate on the proposal. I \nthink we should understand that from the outset.\n  There is no certainty because the language in this legislative \ninitiative has not been reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office. \nAre we to have confidence in the process and the Congressional Budget \nOffice when the analysts have not even had the text of the amendment? \nWe are creating a new Federal program at a cost presumably of a minimum \nof $400 billion without knowing the true fiscal impact of this \nlegislative proposal.\n\n  Here is my first chart. One of my first major concerns about this \ninitiative before us, which I think all Members of the Senate should \nreadily understand, is that most seniors do not get a basic drug \ncoverage under this plan because it is not a universal benefit. I think \nthat needs to be understood.\n  The Graham proposal does not offer a basic drug benefit for 70 \npercent of seniors who have incomes above $17,720 for an individual and \n$23,880 for a couple. This is according to the AARP data: The number of \nseniors who have incomes above 200 percent of the Federal\n\n[[Page S7622]]\n\npoverty level. Seventy percent of seniors above 70 percent would not \nget basic coverage. They will have to spend $3,300 before they get any \nbasic coverage. That is an important point.\n  In fact, in the New York Times the other day there was an op-ed piece \nwritten by the Urban Institute--that is not a conservative think tank--\ndiscussing the fact that most individuals usually have drug expenses \nbetween $2,000 and $3,300; and that many people are spending in that \nmiddle range, particularly on chronic illnesses such as high \ncholesterol, high blood pressure, and arthritis. But with a low-income \ncatastrophic approach, that will provide very little help for most \nMedicare recipients with chronic illnesses. The chronically ill cannot \nget enough help under this type of an approach.\n  Under our legislation, 80 percent would even exceed our benefit limit \nof $3,450, and we had a catastrophic coverage of $3,700.\n  But the point here is that it now is 70 percent. In all States across \nthe country, seniors are left behind.\n  I heard this morning about how many seniors will be covered. But let \nus look at the other side of that equation and who won't be covered.\n  If you look at these statistics, it is staggering. It is 71 percent \nin Maryland. In Oregon, 51 percent of seniors will be left behind. In \nmy State of Maine, they will not get a basic drug benefit under this \nproposal; neither will 50 percent in Virginia, 67 percent in Arizona, \n51 percent in Arkansas, 66 percent in Missouri, 72 percent in \nWashington, 64 percent in Iowa, 70 percent in Colorado, and 52 percent \nin Montana. These seniors will not get a basic drug benefit under the \nGraham plan because they earn at least $1 over the strict income limit \nfor the comprehensive coverage offered to low-income seniors.\n  Only those seniors with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level obtain real prescription drug coverage under the Graham \nplan.\n  Let us look at chart 3. It is not a comprehensive benefit because it \nguts the most important part of any drug benefit program; that is, \nbasic coverage. There is a huge gap. We were criticized for our gap \nbetween $3,450 and $3,700. But this is a canyon in terms of gap in \ncoverage. You have no coverage from basically zero to $3,300 in out-of-\npocket drug expenses--zero.\n  Seniors above 200 percent will have to spend $3,300 before they \nreceive any coverage at all. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, two-thirds of seniors will not have prescription drug costs \neven has high as $3,000 or $2,500. That means that most of the 26 \nmillion Medicare beneficiaries with incomes above 200 percent of the \nFederal poverty level would never spend enough to receive any \ncoverage--no coverage at all. It is not a comprehensive benefit.\n  What about the 125 percent of seniors who will spend $4,000 annually \non prescription drugs? They will not have any coverage for their \nprescription drug costs until about Thanksgiving Day after 10\\1/2\\ \nmonths with no coverage at all--no coverage at all for 10\\1/2\\ months.\n  I am told that under this plan most seniors will only get a 35-\npercent discount off their drug costs through the Government-managed \nplan until they spend $3,300 a year.\n  Private drug coverage plans get significantly larger discounts, \nanywhere from 20 to 40 percent, compared to a benefit such as this. I \nknow the author of this amendment, Senator Graham, claims seniors will \nget up to a 30-percent discount, but I challenge him to show me where \nit says that in this legislative initiative we are considering in the \nSenate. It is not in this legislation. And study after study has shown \nthat discount cards, such as the one offered for seniors in this \ncoverage gap, do not offer discounts that high.\n  What the typical senior actually gets from this plan is about $6 a \nmonth in help with drug costs. So the total annual benefit will be $72. \nWhat about the senior, as we said earlier, who is spending $2,000 to \n$3,000? They will get no coverage other than maybe this average of 5 \npercent off on discounted drugs, which will average about $6 a month.\n  This does not offer a Medicare drug benefit, in all reality, in the \nMedicare Program. This program would, in reality, be administered by \nthe State Medicaid Program. This means the States will experience a \nhuge unfunded Federal mandate in the Graham plan because they are \nrequired to pick up a large share of the cost of this new program.\n  An analysis conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices of the costs passed on to the States by this Graham amendment \nshows that many States across this country will be required to shoulder \na sizable new financial burden.\n  Let's just talk about a few of the States hardest hit. I have a list \nof them, but I will go through a few: Arizona, Arkansas, California, \nColorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, \nWest Virginia.\n  Do you know what the annual impact will be on States, just in 1 year \nalone, based on our up-to-date analysis of the impact of this \nlegislation? It is $5 billion in 1 year--$5.189 billion in 1 year--as \nan unfunded mandate on the States, for a grand total of $70 billion \nover 10 years. That is $70 billion over 10 years in an unfunded mandate \nto the States as a result of this low-income benefit now being placed, \nfor the first time, in the Medicaid Program, not Medicare.\n  States, that as we all know are struggling in a sea of red ink, will \nbe forced to raise taxes to implement the drug benefit for low-income \nseniors. Ironically, this new unfunded mandate will create a new \nfunding crisis for States that we just tried to correct with the \nRockefeller-Collins amendment last week, which was designed to give \nemergency Medicaid funding to States so they are not forced to cut \ntheir existing health care programs. I might add, that was returning to \nthe States $9 billion for a year and a half. We are talking about an \nunfunded mandate, in 1 year, of $5.1 billion, and $70 billion over 10 \nyears, to the States.\n  I might also say, this plan penalizes low-income seniors who earn \nextra income because it could mean they could lose their drug coverage. \nOnly those beneficiaries who earn up to $17,720 for an individual and \n$23,880 for a couple will get comprehensive coverage, as I mentioned \nearlier. Any individual beneficiary who earns $17,720, plus $1, or a \ncouple who earns $23,880, plus $1, gets no coverage. They are left to \nspend 18 percent of their income for prescriptions.\n  Just 2 years ago--another irony here--we passed legislation, in March \nof 2000. The Senate voted 100 to 0 to repeal the Social Security \nearnings limit. Yet here we are today considering a plan that would \neffectively establish a new earnings limit almost identical to one we \nrepealed. Here is another contradiction in legislative policy.\n  So now we are going to penalize low-income seniors if they want to \nearn more money. Now we are creating a penalty----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We are now creating a penalty on prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  May I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield an additional 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  That is an important point, that we are now creating this type of \npenalty for low-income seniors, because if they earn $1 more, they lose \ntheir prescription drug coverage.\n  Finally, employer-sponsored plans, labor-union sponsored plans, will \nbe penalized under this legislation. There will be a disincentive for \nemployers and labor unions to continue their coverage. You might ask, \nwhy? I will answer that question. Because now, under this legislation \nbefore us, they have revamped the standard for how you calculate your \nout-of-pocket cost for the catastrophic level of $3,300.\n  These plans will not be counted toward the out-of-pocket costs. So \nemployers will not have an incentive to continue these programs. And \ncertainly employees would not want to because they would not want to \nlose their coverage. Labor unions will drop their plans. So that is \nanother disincentive.\n  Now 23 percent of retirees have such coverage. We do not want to \ncreate a disincentive for the continuation of those programs. But that \nis exactly what this Graham proposal will do that is before this Senate \ntoday. That is\n\n[[Page S7623]]\n\nwhy I am urging my colleagues not to support this initiative. Allow us \nto go back to where we were on Friday, continuing the discussions we \nwere holding across the aisle with our tripartisan group, with Senator \nBreaux, Senator Jeffords, Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wyden, and others, so that we can have \na comprehensive plan for all Medicare beneficiaries, with universal \ncoverage that the AARP and all of us have embraced for the last 37 \nyears with the existence of the Medicare Program.\n  This isn't the last vote. This can be the beginning. And I cannot \nimagine this Senate, in September, considering a Medicare give-back to \nproviders and not considering a prescription drug program for our \nNation's seniors. They deserve better. And we can do better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 29, 2002]\n\n              Finding a Formula for Medicare Drug Benefits\n\n                           (By Marilyn Moon)\n\n       Washington.--The political debate over how to add a \n     prescription drug benefit to Medicare has dragged on now for \n     more than four years. Prescription drugs have become an \n     integral part of health care delivery, but unlike insurance \n     for most working families, the Medicare program for older and \n     disabled people provides almost no drug coverage. Politicians \n     from both parties know they have to do something, but the \n     hurdles are big: money and control.\n       The debate in the Senate is still ongoing. But large \n     differences along party lines remain, and the Republican \n     House plan that was passed on a party line vote in June makes \n     hopes for compromise remote given the desires of consumers \n     for broad coverage and of drug companies for minimal \n     government controls.\n       The sums needed are enormous; over the next 10 years, \n     Medicare beneficiaries are expected to spend $1.8 trillion \n     for drugs. Thus, while the Senate Republicans' top offer of \n     $370 billion over eight years is a lot of money, it \n     represents only a bit more than one-fifth of drug spending \n     over that period. The Republican plans contain big gaps in \n     coverage and allow restrictions on what drugs will be \n     covered. Democrats offer more coverage, but at a cost of $500 \n     billion or more.\n       Since all proposed plans would be voluntary, those who \n     spend relatively little on prescriptions need to be wooed \n     into participating with the promise of receiving some \n     benefits. Otherwise, only high users will enroll and any \n     program will become very expensive over time.\n       All the competing plans offer generous coverage above a \n     certain level of spending for those with catastrophic \n     expenses. The differences arise in how to treat people who \n     spend below the catastrophic level but still spend several \n     thousand dollars annually on drugs. The Senate Democratic \n     proposal requires beneficiaries to pay a portion of the \n     costs, up to $4,000 a year. Beyond that limit, all drug costs \n     are covered. But under the House Republican plan individuals \n     must pay 100 percent of their drug expenses between $2,000 \n     and $5,300.\n       Increasingly, many people on Medicare are ending up in this \n     middle spending range, particularly those who take one or \n     more drugs every day for a chronic condition. Drugs for such \n     common ailments as hypertension, high cholesterol and \n     arthritis cost $1,200 to $1,500 a year, creating a \n     substantial financial burden for the chronically ill.\n       A viable compromise is to offer comprehensive coverage for \n     those with low incomes and catastrophic help for all other \n     beneficiaries, an approach that seems to be gaining favor in \n     the Senate. But this plan would still cost about $400 \n     billion, while providing little help for most Medicare \n     recipients with chronic illnesses.\n       Money accounts for only part of the differences between the \n     two parties. A big disagreement is over how the benefit is \n     structured--and the precedent it sets for Medicare's future. \n     The Democratic approach basically would have Medicare pay for \n     drugs the way it now pays for hospital and physician \n     benefits. Republicans want instead to have the benefit \n     offered by private insurers. Compromise on this ideological \n     question is especially difficult.\n       The Democratic approach is simpler and relies on Medicare's \n     well-tested structure. But drug manufacturers, fearing that \n     Medicare would impose price controls on drugs, are strongly \n     opposed to enlarging Medicare itself to cover drugs.\n       Supporters of a private insurance structure argue that only \n     competition among plans can achieve substantial control over \n     rising prescription drug costs. But this theory has not been \n     proved in other contexts. The private managed-care option in \n     Medicare, for example, has raised costs to the federal \n     government. Meanwhile, many Medicare recipients have had \n     to suffer with plans that cut benefits or, worse, are \n     withdrawn altogether because the companies offering them \n     have quit the Medicare program entirely for lack of \n     profits.\n       A privately administered drug benefit would be particularly \n     problematic. If private insurers carry the risk for drug \n     costs, they will probably structure their plans in ways that \n     put high users of drugs at a disadvantage. For example, they \n     can establish a list of preferred drugs (a formulary) and \n     either not cover certain drugs or charge more for drugs that \n     are not on the list. There are, for example, many anti-\n     cholesterol drugs, but a formulary may not include the drug \n     that works best for a particular patient. Consumers who need \n     many drugs are likely to find it hard to decipher which \n     medications the plans will cover and at what cost.\n       Ultimately, lawmakers and the rest of us must decide \n     whether we trust government to deliver a new drug benefit \n     effectively. What we do know is that the need for drug \n     coverage is too great to let this issue remain unresolved.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Seniors Left Behind by the Latest

Billions in Unfunded State Mandates Through \n                  Massive Mandatory Medicaid Expansion\n\n     Why does the bill increase Medicaid cost for many states?\n       The bill mandates a major expansion of a form of Medicaid \n     to provide prescription drug coverage. It creates a new \n     category of Medicare-Medicaid ``dual eligibles,'' who qualify \n     for drug coverage if they meet the means test requirement in \n     the bill. States, through their Medicaid programs, are \n     required to determine low-income eligibility and to pay the \n     enrollment fee and most of the drug costs for beneficiaries \n     with incomes below 200% of poverty. Low-income beneficiaries \n     are responsible for paying a $2 co-pay for generic drugs and \n     $5 for brand name drugs; the new drug benefit picks up all \n     the rest of the costs. This is a comprehensive drug benefit, \n     estimated to cost around $3200 per beneficiary on average in \n     2005. The Federal government pays for the Medicare portion of \n     the benefit. But most of the cost of this comprehensive \n     benefit must be paid through Medicaid. This is because the \n     Medicare benefit is a limited one: Medicare covers only 5 \n     percent of the cost of drugs up to the catastrophic limit of \n     $3300, then provides catastrophic coverage with a $10 copay. \n     Thus, state Medicaid programs must pay at least two-thirds of \n     the cost of the drug benefit, around $2000 per beneficiary in \n     2005. This is a conservative estimate of Medicaid benefit \n     cost, and it will increase rapidly over time.\n       The Federal government pays only part of the cost of the \n     Medicaid benefit, based on the state's Medicaid FMAP rate and \n     enhanced FMAP rate:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Required State\n     Percent of Poverty Rate       Medicaid Category     Contribution\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0-74............................

Drug QMB2.........  100% Federal Match\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       While all states have comprehensive Medicaid drug coverage \n     up to 74 percent of poverty, many states do not have coverage \n     up to 150 percent of poverty. States that currently do not \n     provide comprehensive drug coverage up to 150% of poverty \n     through either Medicaid or a state drug assistance program up \n     to 150% are thus required to pay for a significant portion of \n     the cost of comprehensive drug coverage. The cost of the new \n     mandate depends on how many beneficiaries in the state \n     currently do not have comprehensive coverage. The costs also \n     increase rapidly over time, because drug cost are rising \n     rapidly.\n     How much must your State pay?\n       The overall cost of this mandate to states in 2005 will \n     exceed $5 billion, and may be much more. Over the 10-year \n     budget window, the cost of the Medicaid mandate to the \n     affected states will exceed $70 billion--about 14 times the \n     2005 costs. The attached table shows states that definitely \n     will pay hundreds of millions more because of this proposal. \n     Additional states may also face higher costs, if they do not \n     already provide comprehensive drug benefits up to 150 percent \n     of poverty.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    No Help for Retirees With Employer or Union Coverage From Graham\n\n       Retirees with decent coverage from a union or employer do \n     not incur actual drug costs out of their own pockets above \n     $3,300, as they would have to in order to benefit from the \n     Graham amendment. So this benefit provides nothing for them.\n       The Graham bill supporters note that ``no employers drop'' \n     coverage as a result of their bill. This is because the \n     benefit is so paltry.\n       In contrast, the Tripartisan bill provides a real subsidy \n     worth almost $1,600 per retiree to help union and employer \n     plans continue coverage.\n       And those that decide to ``wrap around'' the strong basic \n     benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries still provide \n     comprehensive assistance to their workers. This is real help \n     for employer and union coverage.\n       The Graham benefit does little to stem the trend toward \n     dropping employer coverage. And when employers drop, Graham \n     leaves retirees with nothing until they incur over $3,300 in \n     costs out of their own pockets.\n       Graham would spend $390 billion yet provide virtually no \n     benefit for anyone with retiree coverage. When retirees find \n     out that they won't benefit from this, how will they react?\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, obviously, as you might expect, I rise in opposition \nto the latest amendment by Senator Graham--whether it is Graham 2, 3, \nor 4, I am not sure, but it is another Graham idea on drugs.\n  First of all, I would like to address an argument that some Senators \nhave been making on behalf of this amendment. They have argued that \nthis is the Senate's very last chance to deal with the drug issue this \nyear. Even though this amendment is terribly flawed, they say that \nsomehow Senators should be encouraged to vote for it anyway.\n  Mr. President, I am second to none in my frustration with the \nSenate's failure on this issue at this point. The Democratic leadership \nhas abandoned any pretense of a fair process. And fair process is what \nthe Senate is all about. Instead of leading, the Democratic leader has \nbeen content to cook up his own proposals or have members of his party \ncook up their own proposals and try to somehow just ram them through \nthe Senate.\n  For those of us who believe things in this body must be done in a \nbipartisan way, and through the committee process, and, in the end, get \nthings done, this process in which we have been involved has been \nextremely frustrating.\n  The good news is that this vote is not the last vote. Fortunately, \nthe Senate still has time and the ability to act. Speaking for my \ncolleagues in the tripartisan group, we are ready to move on and begin \nwork in the Finance Committee on a truly bipartisan compromise. I wish \nSenator Daschle had the confidence in Senator Baucus I have to move a \nbipartisan bill on Medicare prescription drugs out of committee.\n  No one should vote for this amendment in the misguided belief that it \nis their last chance because it is not their last chance.\n  Now I would like to address the substance of the amendment before us. \nThe sponsors chose to spring the text of this amendment on the Senate \nyesterday for the first time. Perhaps they thought they could slip in \nsomething\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\nnew that we would not catch. Well, we caught it, and you know we have \ncaught it by the speeches of the Senator from Maine. We actually have \nhad a chance, and we have studied the Graham amendment.\n  The Graham amendment imposes a massive new burden on States just when \nState treasuries are in terrible shape. What does it do? Well, it \nmandates--do you like mandates?--that State Medicaid Programs provide \ncost-sharing assistance to an entirely new universe of seniors who have \nincomes up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. If that is not \nbad enough, it also socks the States with administrative costs of \nenrolling seniors with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty. Even \nbeyond those costs, this enrollment burden is going to be an \nadministrative nightmare for the respective States because of all the \ndifferent populations involved.\n  At a time--and we know this is true in at least 45 of the 50 States--\nwhen they are experiencing tremendous budget pressures, massive new \nburdens of this type are the last thing the States need to have imposed \nupon them by the Federal Government. In fact, last week we heard of the \nproblems of the State budgets and the problems States are having with \ntheir Medicare Program, because we voted for additional fiscal relief \njust last week. How ironic it would be if now we were going to add yet \nanother burden.\n  Let me point out another problem with the amendment before us, and \nthat is the low-income benefit, focusing on the beneficiaries that it \nserves. If you earn $1 too much to qualify for coverage, you get \nnothing. That is a cliff, we call it. We try to avoid cliffs. If we do \npolicy right, we do avoid cliffs. But this amendment isn't about policy \nthat makes sense, this amendment is about a political statement.\n  So seniors can find themselves in a situation where, if they earn \n$17,720, they qualify. If they earn an extra $1, $17,721, they lose \ndrug coverage. So the Graham amendment sets up disincentives for \nbeneficiaries to work at the same time as Congress has been trying to \nremove the wrong incentives from the law, and here we are considering a \nnew disincentive. Once again, the policy just doesn't make sense.\n  Everything I have said so far pertains to the benefit for the 30 \npercent or so of low-income beneficiaries who get solid coverage under \nthe Graham amendment. Unfortunately, there are another 70 percent out \nthere who get very little coverage at all. Those 70 percent, in fact, \nare the biggest losers of all under this alternative.\n  Just how bad is this benefit in the amendment before us? A senior \nabove 200 percent of poverty with average drug spending will receive \napproximately $6 of assistance every month--only $6 towards their \nprescription drug expenses. For me, $6 a month is hardly a benefit at \nall. I would be embarrassed to go home to Iowans and tell them I voted \nfor an amendment that provided only $6 a month to average \nbeneficiaries.\n\n  Why is there so little benefit? Because for 70 percent of the \nseniors, there is no coverage from zero to $3,300 in out-of-pocket \nspending. A week ago, the author of this amendment complained about a \nproposal I put forward because we had a $250 deductible. Now we are \nseeing a $3,300 deductible. Benefits paid by private insurance don't \neven count towards that.\n  Another problem: Retirees with decent coverage from a union or an \nemployer do not incur actual drug costs out of their own pocket above \n$3,300, so the Graham benefit provides almost nothing for them.\n  I have to sound a sobering note: You don't pull the wool over the \neyes of Americans--and seniors in particular. They don't appreciate \nfalse promises. I fear Senators who vote for the Graham amendment will \nhave a lot to answer for down the road. I won't be one of them. I urge \nmy colleagues not to be one of them either.\n  We are facing another mostly partisan vote on a mostly partisan bill, \nanother vote that will fail to get 60 votes and will fail to help our \nseniors. Had regular order been followed, had the Finance Committee \nbeen given the right to work its bipartisan will, we could be \ncompleting action on this issue. Instead, we are still at a beginning.\n  The sponsors of the tripartisan bill, the only bipartisan bill in all \nof Washington, DC, to provide comprehensive, universal coverage, have \nalways been ready and willing to talk to anyone about compromises, and \nwe are still in this mode. We are ready to meet people any place, any \ntime, anywhere to discuss this, including members and leaders of the \nAARP, who somehow got sucked in today to supporting something that a \nweek ago they said they abhorred.\n  This situation is going to continue to be the case for us in this \ngroup, even after this morning's vote. So this vote is an ongoing, \nevolving process to get us a successful product. I have promised my \nconstituents I will not give up on this issue. Adding a drug benefit to \nMedicare is business that simply cannot wait another year to cost $100 \nbillion. Just as the need for prescription drug coverage in Medicare is \nnot going to go away, we in the tripartisan group are not going to go \naway.\n  Mrs MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to reluctantly support the \nGraham/Smith amendment. I am casting this vote to move the process \nforward so we can get closer to providing seniors and the disabled with \nthe prescription drug coverage they need.\n  I have got to tell you that I am frustrated and disappointed that \nCongress hasn't made more progress on this critical issue. Our seniors \ndeserve better than the procedural fights we have seen here in the \nSenate, and they deserve better than the Graham/Smith amendment. Today \nI am voting for this amendment because it offers best hope of moving \nthe process forward after so many delays.\n  Part of my frustration goes back to the priorities that were set last \nyear. Strengthening Medicare should have been a top priority in \nCongress. Instead, the Republican-controlled House and Senate moved \nforward with a $1.25 trillion tax cut. Now we are fighting to provide a \nminimal Medicare prescription drug benefit that will not cost more than \n$400 billion over ten years. While we have come a long away since the \nPresident's inadequate $190 billion proposal at the start of the year, \nwe still are not where we need to be.\n  I do want to applaud the efforts of our leader Senator Daschle and \nSenator Graham. I know that they share my goal of a universal, \naffordable benefit as part of Medicare. Senator Graham has worked \nespecially hard on behalf of our seniors and the disabled.\n  While this amendment provides some targeted relief, it falls far \nshort of our original goal. I supported S. 2625, a universal, \naffordable benefit that treated all seniors the same. Like the Medicare \nprogram, it offered every senior access to affordable coverage. I was \ndisappointed that we could not secure the necessary 60 votes on this \npackage. I do want to point out that S. 2625 did receive 52 votes, \nmeaning a majority of my colleagues supported this approach. \nUnfortunately, due to procedural battles and partisan bickering, 52 \nvotes were not enough.\n  This amendment does provide immediate assistance to the most needy \nand vulnerable. Ensuring that seniors below 200 percent of poverty \nreceive access to affordable coverage is critical and will offer \ncoverage to a larger number of seniors and the disabled. In Washington \nState, this could mean that 290,000 Medicare beneficiaries would be \neligible for full coverage with a nominal copayment and no monthly \npremiums. This is a big improvement. It would ease some of the \npressures on our State Medicaid program, which has been trying to fill \nthe Medicare gap for low income beneficiaries.\n  But, as we all know, income is sometimes not always the best \nmeasurement of need. What about those seniors who earn just $1 over the \n200 percent of poverty threshold? They could have significantly higher \ndrug costs yet receive no benefit, until they reach a catastrophic \nlevel of $3,300.\n  In Washington State, this could mean 428,000 beneficiaries would not \nbe eligible for the low income assistance. Yet, these seniors paid the \nsame taxes and contributed the same percentage of their income while \nthey were working to support the Medicare program.\n  I am pleased this amendment will offer catastrophic protection to all \nseniors regardless of income. Targeted relief to those with expensive \ndrug costs does provide some level of fairness to the program. Ensuring \nthat seniors with more than $3,300 in out of pocket\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\ncosts receive relief is a positive improvement and will offer some \npiece of mind.\n  This amendment is a good starting point, but it cannot be the final \nproduct we offer our seniors. I fear that this proposal could get worse \nin conference. The House-passed bill is nothing but a false promise of \nbenefits. It is based on a private insurance model that has all but \nfailed in most parts of the country. It would require significant out \nof pocket costs for even the low income and could result in less \ncoverage for many seniors. It has a huge hole in coverage and does not \noffer a seamless benefit as part of Medicare. It is a sham, and once it \nsees the light of day, seniors will not be fooled.\n  I am willing to support this amendment with the understanding that \nthis is only the beginning. This is the foundation for building a real \nuniversal benefit as part of Medicare. This cannot be the high water \nmark. I do not want a final conference report to offer only targeted \nlimited relief based on a private insurance model. We cannot just merge \nthis amendment with the House-passed bill. Instead, we must build on \nboth approaches and make significant improvements. We must insist that \nthe final product result in a seamless benefit that is part of Medicare \nthat offers universal, affordable coverage.\n  I want to make one other point about our attempts to improve \nMedicare. As my colleagues know, I am very concerned about Medicare \nreimbursement rates. These rates vary by region and don't reflect the \ntrue costs of providing care in many States. I am concerned that this \namendment builds on that flawed, unfair formula.\n  In Washington State, the annual per beneficiary payment from Medicare \nis $3,921 while in Louisiana it is as high as $7,336. Seniors in \nWashington State are suffering from this inequity. They cannot find a \ndoctor to accept new Medicare patients and are forced to seek care in \novercrowded emergency rooms. This inequity also puts providers in \nWashington State at a distinct economic disadvantage. Doctors are \nleaving my State for other parts of the country that offer higher \nMedicare reimbursements. In some parts of the country, Medicare \npayments are so high they subsidize private insurance payments. I can \ntell you that this is not the case in Washington State.\n  Unfortunately, the Graham/Smith amendment would result in some States \nreceiving much greater coverage than others. Because the benefits will \nbe targeted to those below 200 percent of poverty, some States will \nagain receive much more Medicare funding than other States. In \nWashington State, only 40.4 percent of seniors would be eligible. \nHowever, in Louisiana 66 percent would eligible for coverage. As we \nwork to improve Medicare we should make the program more fair to all \nseniors.\n  I understand that we will not be adding a provider package to this \nbill. We all recognize the need to address the provider shortfalls. I \nunderstand that the Majority Leader is committed to taking up a \nprovider package in September. This must be a priority. It does little \ngood to offer a prescription drug benefit if seniors cannot find a \ndoctor. I urge my colleagues to work to address the inequities in the \nMedicare reimbursement formula as part of a provider package. We cannot \ncontinue to increase payments without a fix, as those at the top \ncontinue to receive a large percentage of the increased dollars.\n  So I am willing to support the Graham/Smith amendment as a starting \npoint for our work on crafting an affordable, universal drug benefit \nthat's part of Medicare. It's clear that we still have a great deal of \nwork to do. And regardless of the outcome of this vote, I'm committed \nto working on this issue until we have the coverage that seniors and \nthe disabled need.\n  Mr. Hatch. Mr. President, my, what a difference a week makes! Who \nwould ever think that the Senate would now be considering a piece-meal, \nminimalist Medicare prescription drug coverage amendment.\n  Is that what seniors want? I don't think so and that is why I want to \nexpress my vehement opposition to the Graham plan.\n  Over the past few weeks, we have heard just about everything under \nthe sun regarding prescription drug coverage. Some fact, much fiction.\n  What we need to do now is to sort out the rumors and false statements \nand look just at the facts.\n  The one undeniable fact where we all agree is this: the need for \nMedicare drug coverage is too great to let it become buried in a \npolitical quagmire.\n  We have all been working hard on this issue and we must not fail our \nseniors now by passing a piece-meal Medicare prescription drug plan. \nApparently, our Democratic Leadership does not agree. Let's look at the \nfacts.\n  We know that the tripartisan bill will cost $370 billion over 10 \nyears. We hear that the latest Graham bill will cost close to $400 \nbillion over 10 years, but the plan keeps changing so we do not have a \ntrue CBO score. We just received the legislative language late \nyesterday afternoon and CBO has not had a change to carefully review \nthe legislative language.\n  We know that the tripartisan bill will provide a comprehensive \nbenefit package for all seniors. Every single senior receives \ncomprehensive, guaranteed coverage for his or her prescriptions.\n  We know that the Graham bill does not provide comprehensive coverage \nfor all seniors. Under the Graham bill seniors only receive coverage \nfor drugs if their incomes are below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty \nLevel or if they reach their catastrophic coverage limit. What happens \nto middle-income beneficiaries? My friends, these seniors are just out \nof luck.\n  We know that the tripartisan bill will work to push drug costs down \nthrough private sector competition.\n  We know that the graham bill is going to have a new, federally-\nfunded, government-run drug program that has no cost-saving mechanisms. \nIn my opinion, a government-run program will lead us down the dangerous \npath of prescription drug price-setting. Look what has happened to the \nreimbursement rates of other Medicare providers, like hospitals and \nphysicians.\n\n  The tripartisan bill encourages competition based on quality and \ncost. The tripartisan proposal lowers prices for all drugs without \ncompromising quality and innovation. The Graham plan does not.\n  The tripartisan plan offers choice--a choice of plans, a choice of \nmedication and a choice of Medicare coverage through our enhanced fee-\nfor-service option. The Graham plan has a one size fits some proposal.\n  Our tripartisan plan improves the Medicare program by taking a global \napproach to meet the changing needs of seniors. The tripartisan bill \nprovides protection against high hospitalization costs and offers free \npreventions benefits. This is what modern health care demands.\n  On the other hand, the Graham plan only provides minimal drug \ncoverage for a small number of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Why should seniors settle for a piece-meal approach? It just doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  For less than the cost of the Graham catastrophic plan--or, I think, \nthe catastrophic Graham plan--which would benefit less than half of \nseniors, the tripartisan approach provides comprehensive coverage with \nquality drug coverage, choice and cost savings for all Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  A piece-meal approach and last minute changes to keep the CBO score \ndown to placate people is the approach my colleagues on the other side \nhave taken in putting this bill together. And it is the wrong approach.\n  So it is no surprise that is what their plan has offered--a \npiecemeal, band-aid approach to providing drug coverage.\n  We need to provide Medicare beneficiaries with adequate prescription \ndrug coverage, this year. We must put aside our differences and self \ninterests.. Partisan arguments only stand in the way of Medicare drug \nlegislation being passed by the Senate.\n  Let's start the process of improving health care for our seniors by \npassing quality prescription drug coverage.\n  Let's not fail them again by allowing the piece-meal Graham plan to \npass the Senate. Our Medicare beneficiaries are depending on us to \nprovide them the best Medicare prescription drug coverage possible.\n  My friends, a vote in favor of the Graham plan does not accomplish \nthis important goal. Our Medicare beneficiaries deserve better.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Graham amendment.\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to reluctantly oppose the \nGraham-Smith amendment. First of all, let me commend the distinguished \nSenior Senator from Florida for the leadership he has shown throughout \nthe years to bring a meaningful prescription drug benefit to Medicare. \nAmerica's senior citizens have no stronger ally in this body than \nSenator Bob Graham. He has worked tirelessly to provide real relief to \nMedicare beneficiaries from their prescription drug costs and I was \nproud to stand with him, Senator Miller, and Senator Kennedy last week \nto try to move ahead with a real drug benefit. However, I must oppose \nthis amendment because it largely neglects the vast middle-class of \nsenior citizens.\n  Just yesterday, Secretary Thompson granted South Carolina a Section \n1115 waiver to bring our state's SilverxCard program under Medicaid, \nthereby allowing the program to expand coverage to seniors with incomes \nof up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Thus, the very same \nseniors that would receive comprehensive coverage under the Graham-\nSmith Amendment can already receive coverage, albeit more limited, in \nSouth Carolina through Medicaid or SilverxCard. This amendment would \nnot make one additional Medicare beneficiary in South Carolina eligible \nfor prescription drug coverage. I also have found that affluent seniors \nin South Carolina can either afford supplemental prescription drug \ncoverage on their own or have a plan from a former employer that \ncontains prescription drug coverage.\n  Which seniors are left furthest behind in South Carolina? It is the \nmiddle-class, those individuals who spent their lives working in the \ntextile mills, manning the assembly line, teaching in our schools, and \ntending to our farmland. They worked hard, paid taxes into Medicare, \nand deserve to receive the same benefits under Medicare as anyone else. \nI cannot in good conscience vote for an amendment that tells a senior \ncitizen with an income of $17,720 that, yes, you receive a real \nprescription drug benefit and another senior citizens with an income of \n$17,721 that, no, you have to spend $3,300 out of your own pocket \nbefore you receive any assistance. We did this once already with \nMedicare. It failed and this Senator learned that we should not do it \nagain.\n  I understand the desire of many of my colleagues to pass something, \nanything to help citizens afford their prescription drugs. I talk to \nthe same people and receive the same heart-wrenching letters from \nconstituents as they do. I know their commitment and desire to enact \nlegislation this year is real and genuine, but I simply cannot support \nthis approach. All of our seniors deserve comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug coverage.\n  I still believe that we can reach agreement before the end of the \nyear on a real, meaningful benefit for all our seniors and stand ready \nto work with my colleagues to make this possible.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nGraham-Smith amendment.\n  The Senate has been debating a prescription drug benefit for Medicare \nfor the past two and a half weeks. In fact, Congress has been working \non the issue for years now. Now our colleagues in the House have passed \na proposal. The Senate needs to do the same.\n  All along I have supported the efforts of the Tripartisan group and \ntheir efforts to write a common sense Medicare prescription drug \nproposal. I voted for their bill because I think it targets relief in a \nfiscally responsible manner to those seniors who need it the most.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot support the Graham-Smith amendment.\n  While we all agree that seniors need help with their prescription \ndrug costs, this amendment falls short for several reasons.\n  First of all, this amendment creates an ``all or nothing'' program \nfor many seniors. Seniors below 200 percent of poverty, which is \n$17,720 for singles and $23,880 for married couples, will basically \nhave all of their prescription drug costs paid for, with only a $2 or \n$5 co-pay for drugs.\n  However, folks who make over 200 percent of poverty, even if it is \nonly by a small fraction, basically don't get a real benefit until \ncatastrophic coverage kicks in at $3,300. Writing this steep of an \nincome cliff into the law isn't fair. We can do better.\n  The difference between having an income of $17,720 and $17,721 \nshouldn't costs seniors $3,300 in prescription drug costs. In Kentucky, \nthere are almost 240,000 seniors who have incomes above this threshold. \nUnder Graham-Smith, they basically get nothing.\n  Second, this amendment doesn't give us enough bang for our buck. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this amendment will cost \n$390 billion, which is a heck of a lot of money. However, even if we \npass it, we still aren't offering a real benefit to all seniors, like \nwe did with the Tripartisan amendment.\n  The Tripartisan proposal would have cost $370 billion, and all \nseniors could have had catastrophic coverage starting at $3,700, along \nwith substantial help with their prescription drug costs below that. \nEven the Hagel Amendment, with a price tag of $295 billion, limited out \nof pocket expenses for folks below 200 percent of poverty at $1,500.\n  I just don't understand why we would want to pay an additional $20 \nbillion or $95 billion more for a Medicare prescription drug plan that \noffers fewer benefits. This means that the Graham-Smith proposal \nshortchanges not only seniors, but the American taxpayer as well.\n  America's seniors need our help, and the Senate needs to pass a \nprescription drug bill. But because the Senate Democrat leadership \ninsisted on bypassing the usual committee process and proceeding \nstraight to the Senate floor with the debate, we have been struggling \nwith a legislative free-for-all that, in the end, could lead to nothing \npassing at all.\n  When I made my first floor statement on this issue, I warned against \nthis sort of procedural gimmickry and its possible consequences. So far \nwe have voted on three prescription drug proposals, and only two have \nearned more than 50 votes, let alone the 60 that are needed under the \nbudget rules. If the committee process had been allowed to work its \nwill, I think there is a much better chance that we could pass a \nserious proposal to provide meaningful relief to seniors.\n  I can't support Graham-Smith. It's a day late, more than a few \ndollars too short and fails to provide real help to seniors who need it \nmost. I think there is still a chance, a small one, to pass a real \nbill. But the door is about to close on our seniors yet again. I hope \nwe don't let them down.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nGraham-Smith amendment. I believe that this compromise represents an \nimportant victory for all our Nation's seniors, and particularly for \nseniors in my State of New Jersey.\n  Let me be frank: this is not the proposal I would have preferred and \nis not the proposal I have talked about with my constituents for the \nlast few years. I have gone around New Jersey and have heard from my \nconstituents about how they struggle to deal with rising drug prices, \nhow they fear being bankrupted in their last years, and how they worry \nabout burdening their families. That is why I strongly support a \ncomprehensive Medicare benefit, and that is why I supported the Graham-\nMiller-Kennedy-Corzine amendment last week.\n  But, I am also a pragmatist, and I know that the Graham-Smith \namendment is a good and necessary start, upon which we can build. It \nwill provide critical relief to the neediest of seniors, and provides \ncomfort to all seniors that castatrophic drug costs will not ruin them. \nAnd I know that if we can get this enacted, next year I will be back \nhere fighting to expand its reach.\n  The Graham-Smith amendment will ensure that no senior spends more \nthan $3,300 to buy their prescription drugs. It also provides \ncomprehensive coverage to our Nation's neediest seniors, those with \nincomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. In addition, it \nprovides a thirty to forty percent discount on prescription drugs for \nall seniors. At a cost of $390 billion over ten years, the Graham-Smith \namendment will guarantee all seniors much-needed prescription drug \ncoverage at a reasonable price.\n  My State of New Jersey and many other States around the Nation have \nresponded to the glaring need for prescription drug coverage for our \nNation's seniors by creating state pharmacy benefit programs. In New \nJersey,\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\nwe have the PAAD and Senior Gold programs. The PAAD program currently \nprovides comprehensive drug coverage to seniors up to 220 percent of \nthe Federal poverty line, and the Senior Gold program provides more \nlimited coverage to certain higher income seniors.\n  I am pleased that the Graham-Smith amendment preserves and reinforces \nState pharmacy benefit plans like New Jersey's. I worked with Senators \nGraham and Smith to ensure that the amendment enables States with \nprescription drug programs to wrap their programs around the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, to create more generous and more extensive \nbenefits for all seniors. This is a crucial provision that will enable \nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota and the other 20 States \nthat have State-funded prescription drug programs to expand and \nsupplement their existing programs.\n  I also worked with Senators Graham and Smith to ensure that state \npharmacy program spending counts toward a beneficiary's out of pocket \nlimit. This will ensure that New Jersey seniors reach catastrophic \ncoverage as quickly as possible. I want to thank Senators Graham and \nSmith for their assistance with these provisions.\n  Let me outline how the Graham-Smith amendment would benefit New \nJersey seniors: 1,189,000 New Jersey senior citizens and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries would be eligible for coverage under the Graham-\nSmith plan; 568,000 Medicare beneficiaries, 48 percent, would be \neligible for low-income assistance and will receive all needed drugs in \nreturn for nominal copayments; 621,000 senior citizens and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries, 52 percent, who are not eligible for special \nlow-income assistance would benefit from discounts of 25-30 percent on \neach prescription.\n  I know many of my colleagues have raised concerns that this amendment \ndoes not provide comprehensive coverage for all seniors. But the basic \nfact is that this amendment provides prescription drug insurance for \nall our nation's seniors and disabled. It provides a thirty to forty \npercent discount on prescription drugs for all Medicare beneficiaries \nand would provide full prescription drug coverage to every Medicare \nbeneficiary who spends at least $3,300 per year for their prescription \ndrugs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that by 2005, the year \nthat this amendment would take effect, at least half of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries will have annual prescription drug expenditures that \nexceed $4,000.\n  And, don't forget that the eighteen million Medicare beneficiaries \nwith incomes below 200 percent of poverty would receive all the \nprescription drugs they need, for a small copayment of $2 for generics \nand $5 for brand name drugs.\n  At a time in which this Congress has voted to give billions of \ndollars in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country, it is \nwrong and hypocritical to tell seniors that we simply don't have the \nfunds or the will to pass an amendment that will provide them access to \naffordable, essential medicines.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by Senators Graham and Smith to add a prescription \ndrug benefit to the Medicare program for low-income beneficiaries and \nthose with high drug costs.\n  The amendment offered today is built on consensus and compromise, and \nis the product of weeks of extensive discussion. I believe in its final \nform, this amendment strikes a balance between the Senate's proper \nexercise of fiscal responsibility and the need to expand and update the \nMedicare program to include some help with the high costs of \nprescription drugs for today's 40 million Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I want to thank my good friend, Senator Lincoln Chafee, for his \ncommitment to getting prescription drugs to those in our society who \nare the sickest and the poorest. I have been working with him since the \nend of June in developing a cost effective alternative that would get \nprescription drugs to the lowest income and the sickest in our society \nimmediately.\n  I believe that the Graham-Smith amendment we are debating today \naddresses my major concern which is to provide low-income individuals \nin our society with access to a full, prescription drug benefit at low \ncost.\n  I am pleased that others in the Senate agree with me that at a minium \nwe should provide a comprehensive benefit to those individuals in our \ncommunities who are making daily decisions about eating or paying rent \nand buying their necessary, life-saving prescription drugs.\n  The prescription drug benefit created by this amendment includes \nthree important components.\n  First, this amendment creates a voluntary, low-income benefit so that \nseniors would no longer be forced to continue making decisions between \nfood or medicine. Under this plan, beneficiaries would pay no premium, \nno annual fee, and no deductible. Their only cost would be a nominal \ncopay of $2 for a generic drug and $5 for a brand name drug.\n  I believe the assurance that over 18 million Medicare beneficiaries, \n47 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries, with incomes below $17,720, \n200 percent of the Federal poverty level, would have access to needed \nprescription drugs at a nominal cost is the most important component of \nthis proposal.\n  For California, this means that 1.8 million senior citizens and \ndisabled Medicare beneficiaries, 49 percent, with incomes below $17,720 \nfor an individual and $23,880 for a couple would have immediate access \nto all needed drugs.\n  Second, this amendment would provide all 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries with access to catastrophic coverage. For a simple cost \nof $25 a year for those with incomes above $17,720, every beneficiary \nwould have the assurance that once out-of-pocket spending for \nprescription drugs exceeds $3,300, a copayment of $10 would provide \nthem with access to full coverage at no additional cost to them.\n  Beneficiaries with incomes below $17,720 would not be responsible for \nthe $10 copay. Low-income individuals would receive this benefit at no \ncost.\n  Third, this amendment provides the 14 million Medicare beneficiaries, \n35 percent, making over $17,720 with access to discounts of about 25 \npercent on each prescription. For an annual fee of $25, these \nbeneficiaries would have access to the federal negotiated rate and \nwould receive a 5 percent government subsidy in addition on each \nprescription they purchase.\n  In California, this means an additional 1.9 million senior citizens \nand disabled Medicare beneficiaries, 51 percent, who are not eligible \nfor low-income assistance would benefit from discounts of 25-30 percent \non each prescription.\n  By providing coverage to low-income individuals and those with high \ndrug bills, this proposal meets the most fundamental needs of our \nnation's senior citizens and disabled.\n  Passing this amendment is timely. On a daily basis, my office hears \nfrom California's seniors about the financial constraints they face \nwhich often prohibits them from buying necessary medication.\n\n  I recently heard from Helen Cecil, a senior citizen from Paramount, \nCA on this issue. She lives on a fixed monthly income of $1,000. Her \nrent is $421 a month, and she spends $150 a month on her prescriptions \nto treat high cholesterol, hypertension and arthritis. In total, Helen \nspends $1,800 annually on medication. She admits to having only one \noption: She must cut down on food in order to buy her medications.\n  Under the Graham-Smith amendment, Helen would pay no monthly premium \nand no deductible. She would only pay $2 per prescription for generic \ndrugs. Assuming she purchases generic drugs, her monthly bill of $150 \nfor three medications to treat her chronic health conditions would drop \nto approximately $6. Helen saves about $142 monthly. This is money she \ncan use to buy groceries.\n  For the millions of Medicare beneficiaries that face the same \npredicament as Helen Cecil, I believe the government has a \nresponsibility to see that they are not forced to choose between buying \nfood and buying medications. Quite frankly, it is hard to think that in \nthe richest nation on earth, we have allowed a situation to evolve \nwhere so many of our elderly must make such a choice.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate won't fail our Nation's sickest, poorest \nand most frail.\n  In the hopes of breaking the gridlock of this debate, and with the \nneed to\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\npass legislation that meets both the budgetary restrictions of these \nuncertain times and the needs of our nation's low-income seniors, I \nurge my colleagues to support the Graham-Smith amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Graham-Smith amendment. \nHowever, I would have preferred a prescription drug benefit added to \nMedicare, like the Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of 2002, \ncommonly referred to as the Graham-Miller proposal. The Graham-Miller \namendment would have provided a comprehensive, voluntary, affordable \nand reliable prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. I \nvoted for the Graham-Miller amendment, which was supported by a \nmajority of the U.S. Senate in a vote last week. Unfortunately, the \nproposal required 60 votes and subsequently failed.\n  On balance, I will support the Graham-Smith compromise, even though I \nhave some reservations. The bill has three major points. First, the \nGraham-Smith amendment provides all Medicare beneficiaries access to a \nprescription drug card which allows Medicare beneficiaries to pool \ntheir purchasing power and receive drug discounts of up to 35 percent. \nThe Federal Government would add an additional 5 percent subsidy to any \nnegotiated price. Second, low-income beneficiaries would receive full \ndrug coverage--paying only a nominal copayment for their drugs. Third, \n``catastrophic coverage'' would be available to Medicare beneficiaries \nso that someone doesn't have to spend more than $3,300 in out-of-pocket \nexpenses on prescription drugs. After that, a beneficiary would only \npay a $10 copayment for each prescription drug.\n  However, I do have a number of reservations about the Graham-Smith \nproposal. First, a prescription drug card is no substitute for adding a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. I am a strong \nadvocate of making prescriptions drugs an entitlement for every \nMedicare beneficiary who wants it. A prescription drug card can be \nuncertain, relying on a possible negotiated benefit that might not \nmaterialize and is no substitute for a guaranteed prescription drug \nbenefit. I am also opposed to a means test for Medicare. Medicare's \nbeneficiaries receive services because they have paid into the system \ntheir entire working lives. It is unfair for Medicare beneficiaries to \nreceive different benefits based on their respective incomes. This \nsends the wrong message to our Nation's 40 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries who rely on its stability and its application to all \neligible seniors.\n  So, with reservation, I will be supporting the Graham-Smith proposal \nas the Senate's best chance to pass a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit this year, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to share \nwith my colleagues my thoughts about the Graham-Smith amendment that \nthe Senate will be voting on shortly. I have to say that the proposal \ncurrently before us is a far cry from what I have previously supported \nand certainly no where near what I had hoped for in terms of a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Indeed, this is not the benefit we ultimately should enact and, more \nimportantly, this is not the benefit our seniors deserve. At best, the \nGraham-Smith proposal provides a universal catastrophic benefit to \nthose seniors with the highest prescription drug costs and it will aid \nthose States that do not already have a State-based prescription drug \nbenefit. These concessions, offered in a spirit of compromise and \nbipartisanship, limit the effect and reach of this bill. Chief among \nthese concessions has been cost. That constraint on resources is driven \npredominately by the passage of the President's tax plan, which leaves \nus with resources that are only sufficient to meet the needs of low-\nincome seniors and those who spend over $3,300 out of their own pocket.\n  Nevertheless, the proposal does start us on the road to a universal, \nvoluntary benefit for our Nation's elderly and disabled population by \noffering a comprehensive benefit for those living below 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level. According to estimates, nearly half of the \nMedicare beneficiaries in Rhode Island would be eligible for the fully \nsubsidized Federal prescription drug benefit. In addition, the \namendment provides catastrophic coverage for drug costs above $3,300. \nAnd, contrary to other proposals, these benefits would be provided in \nthe same manner that seniors receive all other health care benefits: \nthrough Medicare.\n  There are however several areas where I feel this amendment falls \nshort.\n  First, seniors above 200 percent of poverty would receive, for a \nnominal annual enrollement fee, a discount card that would provide an \nautomatic 5 percent Federal subsidy for all drug costs and additional \nsavings that are expected to be captured through the negotiation of \nlower drug prices from the manufacturers. However, questions have been \nraised recently as to the effectiveness of prescription benefit \nmanagers, or PBMs, to achieve the best price for their subscribers. I \nbelieve that the potential benefits and drawbacks of PBMs on such a \nlarge scale have not been thoroughly explored, nor has the question of \nwhether PBMs are a reliable mechanism to achieve lower drug prices been \nanswered. I am also concerned about having a discount card as the sole \nsource of coverage for beneficiaries above a certain income level \nbecause I believe it deviates from the basic tenents of the Medicare \nprogram and may not provide the kind of assistance seniors and disabled \npersons with substantial drug costs might need.\n  Second, there is no requirement that States with existing \npharmaceutical assistance programs for low-income seniors, like my home \nState of Rhode Island, maintain their commitment to this particularly \nvulnerable population. I believe that the Graham-Smith amendment would \nhave a much greater impact if it acknowledged and rewarded the ongoing \nefforts in many States and encouraged them to work as partners with the \nFederal Government to build a far-reaching prescription drug benefit \nthat would offer more robust assistance to many more of our elderly and \ndisabled than the Federal Government can currently achieve on its own.\n  While I understand that many of our States are facing dire budgetary \nsituations, I believe our commitment to providing struggling States the \ntemporary support they need has been demonstrated through the \nRockefeller-Collins-Nelson amendment which passed the Senate by an \noverwhelming margin last week. I am disappointed that the Graham-Smith \namendment does not take the role of the States into more serious \nconsideration. If the proposal is enacted, I hope to work with my \ncolleagues to strengthen the State's role in this program.\n  The plan that I cosponsored and supported, the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \namendment, was the only true Medicare prescription drug proposal to be \npresented to the Senate. It is the only one that would have created a \nguaranteed, univeral benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries, regardless \nof income. In terms of the benefit structure, it required a modest \nmonthly premium and reasonable co-payment for prescriptions. However, \nthis benefit was deemed to be too costly by many of our Republican \ncolleagues given the current Federal budget deficits. I would argue \nthat we might be in a different position if we had not enacted a major \ntax cut bill last year.\n  Nevertheless, my colleague, Senator Graham, has tirelessly worked to \ncraft a scaled-back benefit proposal that is modeled after the Ensign-\nHagel amendment and would seem to meet the chief concern of my \nRepublican colleagues and should garner their support. I commend \nSenator Graham and others for their efforts on this critical issue and \nI intend to support his amendment in the spirit of compromise and \nmoving this debate forward. The Graham-Smith amendment is certainly not \nthe end of the road in terms of the prescription drug issue, it is only \nthe beginning. If Congress is going to have a serious chance of getting \na Medicare prescription drug bill to the President's desk this year, we \nmust take action now. I hope my colleagues will follow the lead of our \ncolleagues, Senators Graham and Smith, and work towards the enactment \nof a Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Graham-Smith amendment. \nHowever, I would have preferred a prescription drug benefit added to \nMedicare, like the Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of 2002, \ncommonly\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nreferred to as the ``Graham-Miller proposal.'' The Graham-Miller \namendment would have provided a comprehensive, voluntary, affordable \nand reliable prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. I \nvoted for the Graham-Miller amendment, which was supported by a \nmajority of the United States Senate in a vote last week. \nUnfortunately, the proposal required sixty votes and subsequently \nfailed.\n  On balance, I will support the Graham-Smith compromise, even though I \nhave some reservations.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 22\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator from Tennessee has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 18 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have a very simple message this \nmorning. America's seniors now, for 37 years and 1 day--since 37 years \nago yesterday was the day Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare \nlegislation into law--have been waiting for prescription drug coverage. \nIt was a minor amount of their expenditures in 1965. On average, it was \n$65 a year. It is a staggering amount for seniors today--over $2,100 a \nyear, on average.\n  Today is the day that there are no more excuses for delay. There is \nno credible reason to vote against the motion to waive the Budget Act \nso that the Senate can then consider an affordable, bipartisan \nprescription drug proposal, and all of the modifications, amendments, \nand other alternatives that others might wish to propose.\n  There have been a number of objections raised to our proposal--some \nof them last week--being contradictory to the same provisions or \nmodifications that are in our current bill, and some new issues were \nraised this morning. Let me briefly comment.\n  Last week, we heard that the prescription drug bill we had offered \nwas too expensive, at an estimated cost of $594 billion for 10 years. \nWe were told: we cannot support anything that is above $400 billion. So \nwe went to work. We rolled up our sleeves, and we made a number of \nchanges, and we have gotten the cost under $400 billion. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office states that in conjunction with the generic \ndrug bill--on which our Presiding Officer has provided such \nleadership--the cost of our bill now will be $382 billion. So we have \nmet the desire to have a less costly proposal.\n  Now we are getting the other argument, that because it is less \ncostly, it is not sufficiently comprehensive. Let me explain what this \nbill will provide, first, for all senior Americans. In my opinion, the \nmost important thing it will provide is peace of mind. If you are a \nrelatively well American in the early seventies, you have prescription \ndrug costs you can manage. The problem is that you never know whether a \nday from now you might not suffer from some catastrophic event, such as \na heart attack, or be found to have a chronic disease such as diabetes, \nwhich will suddenly escalate your prescription drug cost, potentially \nthreatening the economic security of your retirement.\n  This legislation will provide the peace of mind that will give you \nthe assurance that, once having spent $3,300, you will get full \ncoverage, but for a $10 per prescription copayment. That is a benefit \nof real value, which is available to all American seniors. The cost is \n$25 a year as an enrollment fee. There could be no greater bargain in \nthe insurance market than to be able to buy the peace of mind of this \ncatastrophic coverage for $25 a year.\n  That is not all of the benefits that will be available to all senior \nAmericans. Because we are going to have 40 million Americans with a \nchampion, called a pharmacy benefit manager, negotiating with the \npharmaceutical companies to get the best discounted prices, Families \nU.S.A., the Chain Drugstore Association, and the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services have all stated that, under our legislation, \nthey estimate that these organizations would be able to negotiate \ndiscounted prices in the range of 15 to 25 percent. That will be \navailable to all seniors.\n  In addition to that, we are going to provide that there will be a 5-\npercent Federal supplement on top of whatever the discounted amount is. \nSo there will be real benefits for all Americans.\n\n  But we did have to make some difficult choices when we reduced the \nsize of this program by over $200 billion. One of those decisions was \nthat we would focus our effort on those who had the largest \nprescription drug bills through a catastrophic program that would be \navailable to all, and we would focus on those who were the neediest \nAmericans and, therefore, had the greatest difficulty paying their \nprescription drug costs.\n  This business of life is a business of making choices, and we decided \nthat those were the two groups that should get the most attention under \nthe beginnings of a Medicare effort to provide prescription drug \nbenefits.\n  I might say that this is very consistent with what President George \nBush said as ``candidate'' George Bush when he emphasized that he \nthought a prescription drug benefit was a priority for the Nation and \nthat the priority within the priority was providing prescription drug \ncoverage for those who were most in need. That is what we have done.\n  For those persons who are under 200 percent of poverty--which today \nis 38 percent of America's 40 million Medicare eligibles--this will \nprovide a very significant benefit; and with no premiums, with no \ndeductibles, they will have access to prescription drugs for a \ncopayment of $2 for generic drugs and $5 for brand name drugs. This \nwill provide for the millions of senior Americans who are the most \nlikely not to have any other source of assistance--they didn't work for \nan employer who provided retiree prescription drug benefits or they \ncannot afford a Medigap policy. This is the group of Americans who are \nat greatest need, and they will get the greatest assistance.\n  There have been some other arguments raised today about the plan we \nare proposing. It has been suggested that there will be massive costs \nto the States as a result of this plan. Let me read you a statement we \nhave just received from the Congressional Budget Office. It states:\n\n       This plan will have almost no effect--\n\n  I would like my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to listen \nto this Congressional Budget Office release.\n\n       This plan will have almost no effect on State spending and \n     will have savings to States when combined with the underlying \n     generic bill. There will also be savings for\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\n     States that have their own State-funded drug programs. State \n     savings come from the Federal Government paying all of the \n     catastrophic benefits which are now paid by the State, as \n     well as 5 percent of each beneficiary's drug cost, which is \n     not subject to a match.\n\n  This is not a new idea. We have a program that has been in place for \nseveral years called the QMBs and SLMBs program. Don't ask me what the \nacronyms fully stand for, other than that they provide Medicare \nassistance to pay premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance for low-income \nAmericans who are still above the Medicaid level. That has not proven \nto be an unmanageable program for State-Federal cooperation, and \nneither will this.\n  It has also been stated that previous employers will drop the \ninsurance coverage of their retirees if we adopt this legislation. \nQuite to the contrary. The Congressional Budget Office, again, has \nstated that with our plan there would be no employer dropping of \ncoverage, whereas with the plan that has been proposed by our \ncolleagues on the Republican side, the same CBO estimates that up to \none-third of the employers would drop prescription drug coverage.\n  The issue today, frankly, is not any of the questions that have been \nraised in opposition to the thoughtful proposal that is the result of \nreal compromise between Democrats and Republicans, a true bipartisan \noutreach. On many provisions of this bill, we have adopted language \nverbatim from legislation that was introduced last week by, for \ninstance, Senators Hagel and Ensign. Senator Gordon Smith has worked in \nthe highest standards of cooperation and collaboration to give this \nSenate an opportunity to vote on a solid, significant prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  What we are going to vote on in a few minutes is a motion to waive \nthe Budget Act. How ironic. We have a Budget Act, which is 18 months \nold, that says the maximum amount we can spend on prescription drugs is \n$300 billion over 10 years.\n  Both the Republican plan and the Democratic plan are above $300 \nbillion, a clear recognition that people who have looked at what will \nbe required to provide a prescription drug benefit have come to the \nsame conclusion: we cannot provide a meaningful, responsible benefit to \nsenior Americans for $300 billion.\n  We are going to have an opportunity to vote to waive the Budget Act \nso we can then consider what would be a responsible prescription drug \nbenefit, but unless we get 60 votes to waive the Budget Act, we will \nnever get to the substance of this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus on the question that is before us: \nShould we maintain a slavish commitment to an 18-month-old number that \nboth Republicans and Democrats have clearly indicated is inappropriate \nor should we waive the Budget Act and have an opportunity to have a \nfull, substantive debate on prescription drugs?\n  There have been some who said this is not the last time; that we can \ncome back maybe in September or October, or some time in 2002, and act \nupon this. I admire their optimism, but as a pragmatist, I question the \npractical reality. In addition to the difficulty of passing legislation \nthrough the Senate, we know that we have to go to conference with the \nHouse, and the House is likely to have significantly different \nprovisions, including different priorities in terms of where to place \nemphasis in a senior prescription drug plan for Medicare than the \nSenate will have.\n  If we waste the month of August, which would be an opportunity for \nserious consultation between the House and the Senate, in hopes that in \nSeptember we can arrive at a compromise that can be voted by the \nCongress and then signed into law by the President, we will have missed \nour greatest opportunity to achieve this long-sought goal of senior \nAmericans.\n  The real issue today is, we have a choice of saying, yes, we want to \ncontinue, we want to have the opportunity to develop a prescription \ndrug benefit or we want to say no, that we are prepared to accept the \nstatus quo--another year in which senior Americans will be denied \nMedicare assistance in purchasing their prescription drugs, the fastest \nrising cost element in the typical health care budget of senior \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today to vote yes to waive the \nBudget Act and then vote yes to continue a serious, substantive debate \non the issues involved in providing our senior citizens access to a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit.\n  I would not like this debate to end in the ashes of a vote that says \nwe are going to put a greater value on the homage to an archaic budget \nnumber, which nobody today is advocating as being adequate to meet the \nneeds of senior Americans.\n  That is the issue: Do we say yes to the opportunity or do we say no \nto further gridlock and denial of this critical element of a modern \nhealth care program?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes \n45 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this is it today. We \nhave a very real choice to make. I believe it boils down to this: The \ndrug companies of America like the system the way it is today. They \nwant nothing to happen. The seniors of America are counting on us to \nstand up and do the right thing: Not privatizing Medicare with a \nprivate plan that sets up insurance HMOs which, by the way, was written \nin the House in part by the drug companies knowing that this is the \napproach that is least likely to lower prices but, rather, protecting, \npreserving, and modernizing Medicare.\n  This is a bipartisan effort. I commend colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who have stepped up to say we are going to make a downpayment \non modernizing Medicare to cover prescription drugs. That is what this \nis. Everyone gets help. Everyone's prices go down. And for those who \nneed it the most, those who are the sickest, they will, in fact, \nreceive comprehensive coverage. No premium. No deductible. They will \nget the help they need.\n  I am proud to stand today with my colleagues, Senator Graham, Senator \nSmith, and others on both sides of the aisle who have put this together \nwith AARP and with the senior groups in America to say the time has \ncome. The time has come for us to place this downpayment on modernizing \nMedicare and move forward until we completely provide comprehensive \nMedicare coverage for all seniors and the disabled in this country.\n  I cannot imagine why we would not want to keep this process going to \nget the bill in front of us. It can always be fine tuned. We can \ncontinue to work together. But today is yes or no on whether we proceed \nto help the seniors of America and stand with them. Stop talking about \nit; let's act together and let the seniors know that we are willing to \nprovide the leadership necessary--all of us together--to get this done. \nI thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to waive the \nBudget Act with respect to the point of order for a lot of different \nreasons. One, I wish we had a budget. Somebody said we could have \npassed a budget. Maybe the Budget Committee was going to pass a higher \nnumber.\n  Unfortunately, this is the first time since 1974 that we have not had \na budget pass the Senate. Maybe one of the most fiscally irresponsible \nthings we have not done is not pass a budget. We are still under the \nconstraints of last year's budget.\n  Last year, we overwhelmingly passed a budget and set up $200 billion, \n$300 billion, and it was passed by the Finance Committee. Really what \nwe should do is direct the Finance Committee to pass a bipartisan bill.\n  I looked at the last 22 years, and the Finance Committee has dealt \nwith major Medicare and Medicaid reforms, every one of which passed \nwith bipartisan support except one. Only once did we bypass the \ncommittee.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrat leadership said: We are not going to go\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nthrough the Finance Committee because we think it will report out \nsomething we do not like. So they came up with a partisan bill, and we \nare playing ping-pong.\n  I looked at the amendment we are considering right now. It is 102 \npages. It was still warm off the press, and nobody on this side, with \none exception maybe, had seen this amendment before it was offered \nyesterday.\n  This is the most important expensive expansion of Medicare in its \nhistory, and we find out that most of the expansion is not in Medicare \nbut Medicaid, and the cost to States is in the billions of unfunded \nmandates to the States because we did not just expand Medicare, we \nexpanded Medicaid, and we are telling the States they are going to have \nto come up with matches to provide this brand new free benefit. Thirty-\none States are going to have to pay for half of this new benefit. There \nis an increase in S-CHIP match, a 100-percent match for some, but 31 \nStates have a 74-percent match. They have to go up to 120 percent.\n  All of that is on the States, or at least their matching portion. The \nestimated cost of unfunded mandates is $70 billion.\n  We have not had a hearing. We have not had a markup. This may be a \nclassic example of the best way not to mark up legislation that is this \nimportant.\n  Let us step back a little bit. Let us work with the Finance \nCommittee. Let us work in a bipartisan way. We can certainly get that \ndone. We have the month of August and part of September. We can report \na positive bipartisan bill that can become law. What is before us, \nunfortunately, is well short of that goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand there are 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There are 4 minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I hope the Senate, given this \nopportunity, will do something about providing a drug benefit for all \nthose Americans who desperately need it. This is obviously a \ncompromise, but great work has gone into this effort and it is \nimportant we do something for all those people who need help.\n  I want to say a word about the underlying bill because while we are \nproviding the prescription drug benefit, we need to make that benefit \naffordable, No. 1, and, No. 2, we need to do something about the cost \nof prescription drugs in this country.\n  The Presiding Officer, Senator Schumer, led the way, along with \nSenator McCain, in doing something about the cost of prescription drugs \nin this country in getting generic drugs on to the marketplace, \nproviding competition, and bringing down the costs for all Americans. \nIn the HELP Committee, Senator Collins and I, working with Senator \nSchumer and Senator McCain, built on that work that had already been \ndone and provided a way to deal with the problem of brand name drug \ncompanies abusing the patent process to keep generics out of the \nmarketplace.\n  What was happening was this: Brand name companies were filing \nfrivolous patents. The result of filing those frivolous patents is the \ngenerics were not able to get into the marketplace. The brand names \nused the litigation process to keep generics out of the marketplace. \nWhat this underlying legislation does is to close those loopholes. It \nprovides specifically for a mechanism to eliminate the use of frivolous \npatents to, in fact, give brand name companies protection when they \nhave a real, new, creative, and innovative product, but at the same \ntime it eliminates the patent and litigation abuses that have been \noccurring. It eliminates things such as brand name companies getting a \npatent on putting their pills in a brown bottle. Those are the kinds of \nabuses that have been occurring. In the past, they have kept generics \nout of the marketplace.\n  What the underlying legislation will do is it will save $60 billion \nfor American consumers over the next 10 years. It is critically \nimportant that we do this drug benefit, but it is also critically \nimportant that we do something about the cost of prescription drugs for \nall Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Five years ago, the first prescription drug legislation \nwas introduced in the Senate. We have waited and the seniors have \nwaited 5 years to see whether the Senate of the United States was going \nto take action. Under the leadership of Senator Daschle, we have the \nopportunity to do that. That is because the Democratic leader said so.\n  A week ago, the Republicans said no to the comprehensive program that \nwas introduced by Senator Graham and Senator Miller that would have \nprovided the comprehensive approach about which so many have talked.\n  I have listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle. They \nare using a favorite technique. That is to misrepresent and distort \nwhat is before the Senate, and then differ with it.\n  Senator Graham has given the facts on this program. The basic issue \nbefore the Senate now, in the next few minutes, is whether we consider \nprescription drugs a priority for our senior citizens. If we vote with \nSenator Graham and Senator Smith, we are saying they are a priority.\n  This bill is not going to solve all the problems, but it is a \ndownpayment. It is a downpayment on those prescription drugs. Every one \nof us who is going to support that position is committed to coming back \nnext year and the year after to make sure we have the comprehensive \nissue. That is what is before the Senate: Do we take the problems of \nour senior citizens seriously or are we going to get behind some kind \nof facade and say let us put it off for another day?\n  Seniors have listened to that every single year since the time we \npassed Medicare in 1965. Now is the time to do something about it. This \nis a downpayment on prescription drugs, and I think it is time the \nSenate take that action, and take it today.\n  I understand our time is up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTennessee controls 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that \nvery clearly costs more and covers fewer people than the tripartisan \nbill we debated last week.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to one of the sponsors of that \ntripartisan, more comprehensive plan that seniors deserve better than \nthe underlying bill on which we are about to vote.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for yielding.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to do something about prescription \ndrugs, but this is not the thing to do with prescription drugs. How do \nI go back to Louisiana, as in every State, and tell the Medicaid \nProgram in Louisiana that this bill is going to cost my State $85 \nmillion, which we do not have, through our State Medicaid Program to \nhave the State pick up part of the costs of this prescription drug \nprogram? How am I going to go back to my State of Louisiana and tell \nthe 240,000 people in Louisiana that, yes, Congress passed a \nprescription drug program but, guess what, you are not part of it. You \nare going to pay 95 percent of all of your costs of prescription drugs, \nand the Federal Government is going to pick up 5 percent.\n  Now is the time to do something about prescription drugs, but this \nCongress can do much better than this. What we ought to do is combine \nthe best of what Government can do with the best of what the private \nsector can do, and come up with a program that fits Medicare that is \nuniversal, that is comprehensive, that covers all seniors, not just \nsome of the seniors, and gives them all a program of which they can be \nproud. That is the concept of what Medicare was 37 years ago. We should \nnot now divert from that concept and say one group of seniors is going \nto have one plan, the other seniors are going to get left by the \nwayside.\n  Certainly, I think this Congress can do better than that, and we will \nhave the opportunity to do that, working with our colleagues over the \nAugust recess to put together that type of plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n[[Page S7633]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use a minute of my leader time. I know we are \nscheduled to have a vote.\n  I simply remind my colleagues that almost every senior organization \nhas endorsed the Graham amendment. Not one senior organization has \nendorsed the Republican plan. What does that tell us? The drug \ncompanies endorse the Republican plan. The insurance companies endorse \nthe Republican plan. We do not find one senior organization endorsing \nthe Republican plan. So what is wrong with this picture? Why is it that \nwe cannot get bipartisan, overwhelming support for something every \nsenior organization endorses?\n  This is our opportunity to make a downpayment, a first step, and we \nought to support it. I applaud the Graham amendment. I hope our \ncolleagues will look at it carefully and support it. This is a critical \nmoment. Senior organizations agree. They endorse it. They want this to \npass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is 29 seconds for the minority.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a point of order will be filed very \nshortly.\n  In closing, it is important that people recognize the bill is \ninadequate. Seniors deserve more. A proposal has been discussed, the \ntripartisan bill, which is a more comprehensive approach for less \nmoney. This bill promises less, gives less, fewer benefits, for more \nmoney. I urge the defeat of the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. FRIST. I make a point of order that the Graham amendment No. 4345 \nviolates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 199 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Hutchinson\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is an important issue, and the \nSenate is not in order. We have 2 minutes of discussion on this, and \nimportant comments will be made by our colleagues who deserve to be \nheard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think many of us regret that we could \nnot succeed on the last amendment. But there are still things we can \ndo, and must do, to make the cost of drugs lower for all citizens. The \nSchumer-McCain generic drug bill, the underlying bill, does just that.\n  For people who are paying $100 per prescription, they will pay $30 or \n$35 or $40. It will reduce the cost of overall drug spending by $60 \nbillion. It will take some of the burden off our hard-pressed States as \ntheir Medicaid rates come down.\n  It will also apply to everybody: the young and the old, the senior \ncitizen who needs these drugs, as well as the family with a child who \ncannot afford a desperately needed drug to make that child better.\n  It is supported by a large group, not only senior citizen groups and \nconsumer groups and labor groups but GM and Caterpillar and Kodak and \nFord.\n  Please let us move forward on this amendment. We have a lot to do in \nthe area of making prescription drugs cheaper, and this is a very vital \nfirst step.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the underlying bill, which is the generic \ndrug bill, has not really been addressed as we have moved through these \ndebates on the overlying issue of whether we should have a prescription \ndrug program for seniors.\n  This underlying bill still has many significant issues in it. \nProbably the most significant issue is the fact that it creates a new \ncause of action, a whole new set of lawsuits which have never been used \nbefore. This cause of action has never been tried before, never been \nused before, involving patent law and the FDA. It really will be a \nlawyer's relief act rather than an act which is going to relieve our \ncitizens of the high costs of drugs.\n  We should have the opportunity to amend this bill. It can be \nimproved. The basic concepts of this bill are good,\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\nbut the bill can be improved. That is why we should not have cloture at \nthis time. We simply have not had a chance to properly address this \nunderlying bill because it has been sort of sidetracked as we have \naddressed the prescription issue for seniors. So I would hope we would \nvote against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on S. 812, \na bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide \ngreater access to affordable pharmaceuticals, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

On this vote, the yeas are 66, the nays are \n33. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I get to discussion of the \nunderlying bill, I would first like to thank Senator Kennedy for his \nlong-time leadership in ensuring access to affordable prescription \ndrugs and especially for the strong fight he and Senators Graham and \nMiller have led here on the Senate floor for the past two weeks to add \na meaningful prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership in the \nHELP Committee in bringing Hatch-Waxman abuses to light, and for \nworking with our Leader to move Schumer-McCain to the floor.\n  I also want to thank my colleague Senator McCain, with whom I \nintroduced the GAAP Act--as well our colleagues who introduced the bill \nin the house, Congressman Sherrod Brown and Congresswoman Jo Ann \nEmerson--for all their hard work in drawing attention to this issue and \npushing to get this bill passed this year.\n  When this Hatch-Waxman debate began, the Senate had two choices:\n  First, we could choose not to act, and let loopholes in the law \ncontinue to let drug prices skyrocket; or, second, we could pass this \nbill, close the loopholes, and bring down drug prices for all \nconsumers.\n  Today, as the Senate approaches a vote on the Schumer-McCain bill, \nthe Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, the choice is \nclear.\n  Consumers win. PhRMA loses.\n  Not only was the bill passed out of committee on a strong bipartisan \nvote; not only have we heard strong messages of support from our \ncolleagues on the floor; but the public, too, has spoken.\n  Major corporations have spoken. Labor has spoken. Senior groups have \nspoken. Consumer groups have spoken. Governors have spoken. Insurers \nhave spoken. Pharmacists have spoken. Disease groups have spoken.\n  And they want to see action. They want to see the loopholes closed, \nand they want to see competition in the pharmaceutical marketplace.\n  Last week we also heard from CBO. Its message: This Bill will bring \nthe relief the public wants. A conservative estimate shows the bill \nwill save consumers $60 billion on drug costs over the next 10 years. \nAnd it will mean nearly $8 billion to the Federal Government. When we \npass a Medicare drug benefit, it will mean even more savings.\n  Yesterday, we heard from the FTC. The report the Commission issued \nillustrates the abuses and tells Congress clear as day to plug up the \nloopholes in Hatch-Waxman. Their recommendations lead to one inexorable \nconclusion: pass Schumer-McCain.\n  The study makes clear that lawyers for the pharmaceutical industry \nhave picked the Hatch-Waxman law clean and that the law needs \nsignificant and immediate reform.\n  The one group that doesn't want to see action is the group \nrepresenting the name brand drug industry, PhRMA.\n  Why is the support so widespread? It is quite simple, really. As most \nthings do, it comes down to cold, hard, cash. Drug expenditures have \nbeen rising at double digit rates--at nearly 18 percent per year--\nthroughout the 90s.\n  These increases are simply unsustainable. And closing the loopholes \nin the patent laws is a common sense way to do something about them. \nThey will mean real savings for consumers, businesses, States, and \nseniors.\n  We looked at 15 name-brand prescription drugs whose expiring patents \nwill pave the way for billions of dollars in savings if blockbuster \ndrug companies don't block the less expensive generic versions of these \ndrugs from coming to market when they should.\n  These drugs are used to treat a variety of illnesses, including \nallergies, high cholesterol, asthma, and depression. You have probably \nseen commercials for some of them on TV--Claritin, Zocor, Zoloft. You \nmight even remember Cipro from last fall's anthrax scare.\n  All of the drugs are scheduled to come off patent by 2005, which in \nEnglish means that their less expensive versions can then go on sale.\n  The savings consumers will see on these drugs alone will be at least \n$4.15 billion annually by 2008 when these less expensive generics are \nfully phased in.\n  The biggest savings would come on the popular antidepressant Zoloft, \nwhich would see consumer savings of over $735 million if users opt to \nuse the low cost generic version.\n  Other savings would come on the popular allergy medicine Claritin \nwhich would see savings of $501 million and on the cholesterol medicine \nZocor, which would see savings of $577 million.\n  For the individual consumer, these projections are a dream come true.\n  If you look at what three popular pharmacy chains charge for five \ncommonly prescribed drugs--Claritin, Cipro, Zocor, Zoloft, and \nSingulair--the individual consumer would see individual savings ranging \nfrom $42 to $75 a month on these drugs if generic alternatives were \navailable.\n  Those filling a Singulair prescription at Walgreens, for example, to \ntreat asthma would save about $54 on the generic version, paying only \n$34 as opposed to the current price of $87.99. Those filling a Cipro \nprescription at CVS to treat a urinary tract infection would save about \n$58, paying only $37 for a 20 pill supply as opposed to the current \nprice of $95.59.\n  Zocor users would save $45, paying an estimated $70 for a 30 pill \nsupply to control high cholesterol instead of the $115.53 they \ncurrently pay at Rite Aid.\n  The good news is that these numbers show that these drugs can one day \nbe within reach of working Americans.\n  The bad news is that if we in Congress don't act, the chances of the \nblockbuster drug companies ever letting that happen are about as likely \nas the Yankees asking me to pitch Game 7.\n  We have heard time and time again from the big drug companies that \npatent protection is the key to innovating\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nnew drugs. And as I have said time and time again, I could not agree \nmore.\n  When drug companies innovate new drugs which benefit the patient, \nthey are indeed preventing disease and saving lives. And they should be \nrewarded for doing so with a period of time to exclusively market the \ndrug.\n  That is how the system is supposed to work and that's how it did work \nfor a very long time.\n  But over the almost 20 years since Hatch-Waxman was passed, the drug \ncompanies have taken advantage of this system, devising new ways to \nextend the period of exclusivity they get when they patent a life-\nsaving drug.\n  Today, I want to debunk some of the myths that the drug companies are \nperpetuating about the way they are using the patent laws and how the \nbill Senator McCain and I have introduced will impact innovation in the \npharmaceutical industry.\n  PhRMA has been circulating a list of claims that it has been calling \na ``reality check.'' If a bank tried to cash that check, it would \nbounce.\n  Today, I want to shine a light on some of the PhRMA claims and ensure \nthat the public knows the truth about what is going on in the drug \nindustry.\n  The reality is that the drug companies are not spending all their \ntime innovating new drugs, they are innovating new patents.\n  Instead of devising new ways to further medical science, they are \nfocusing on furthering company profits. And that often means keeping \nthe competition at bay.\n  But before I go on, I want to make clear that the Greater Access to \nAffordable Pharmaceuticals Act is not about robbing pharmaceutical \ncompanies of legitimate patent protection. It's not about theft of \ninnovation, it's not about taking steps to enact laws that are not in \nthe best interest of consumers.\n  In fact, it is about just the opposite. It is about examining \ncompetition in today's marketplace and revisiting a compromise which \nwas struck nearly 18 years ago.\n  That compromise--the Hatch-Waxman Act--was intended to strike a \nbalance and help save consumers billions of dollars on pharmaceuticals \nwhile rewarding brand name companies for their innovations.\n  But, in recent years, as the profits and stakes have become higher, \nas I said, the drug industry lawyers have picked the Hatch-Waxman law \nclean.\n  Companies are aggressively pursuing extended monopolies through \nfiling weak or invalid patents and engaging in deals which the FTC is \nincreasingly scrutinizing for anticompetitive motives.\n  We must put an end to these abuses.\n  The GAAP act does not intend to cut innovators off at the knees and \nit isn't a freebie for the generic drug industry. It is a pro-consumer \nbill that restores the balance intended by Hatch-Waxman.\n  The bill would limit the delay to one 30-month stay, for brand \ncompanies who file suit against a generic challenger. And the only \npatents eligible for this automatic stay would be the brand company's \noriginal patents.\n  For any patents listed after the brand drug is approved, the brand \ncompany would instead have to allow a court to decide whether their \ncase merits a stay against generic competition.\n  It would prevent abuses like those we are discussing here today by \nreducing incentives to list patents that are not truly innovative, but \ninstead are intended solely to extend monopolies.\n  The GAAP act reforms the so-called ``180-day rule'' by closing the \nloophole that enables a brand name company to pay a generic \nmanufacturer to stay off the market, effectively putting the kibosh on \ncompetition.\n  Closing this loophole would prevent problems like the Hytrin case \nwhere Abbott Laboratories allegedly paid Geneva Pharmaceuticals $4.5 \nmillion per month to keep their hypertension drug off the market.\n  Now PhRMA will tell you that the law is not broken.\n  They will tell you that generics' share of the prescription market \nhas increased from 18 percent in 1984 to 47 percent today.\n  But what they won't tell you is that generics have been stuck right \naround 45 percent for at least the past 6 years.\n  They will also tell you the games are not causing delays. But this \nchart shows that in 2000, 20 of the 30 drugs that were supposed to come \noff patent were delayed. In 2001, 23 out of 26 were delayed--88 percent \nof the drugs supposed to come off patent have been delayed, and most of \nthese delays continue today.\n  PhRMA will tell you that ``patents on new products never delay \ngeneric versions of old ones.'' And if we were talking about patents on \nnew drugs, that would be a true statement. But that is not what we are \ntalking about. We are talking about new patents on old drugs.\n  The drug companies are coming up with different formulations or \ndosage forms, or other unapproved uses for old drugs whose patents have \neither expired or are about to expire in order to keep low-cost generic \ncompetitors off the market.\n  Since a generic has to show that it doesn't infringe on these new \npatents before it can enter a market, the drug companies buy some extra \ntime and can extend their market exclusivity.\n  The changes Senator McCain and I have proposed protect the brand \ncompanies from having their patents infringed on. But they also prevent \nthe brand companies from abusing their patents and keeping generics off \nthe market.\n  Let's take a look at some of the ``innovations'' that brand companies \nare listing in the FDA's Orange Book. It is these kinds of patents \nwhich can automatically delay competition.\n  For Ultram, a pain medication, the brand company has come up with a \nnew dosing schedule--because it's a strong medication, they suggest \nthat you could take one-fourth of a pill at a time and slowly build up \nto taking a whole pill. This is a dosing method which doctors and \npharmacists have used on many drugs, in many instances. Yet, somehow, \nJ got a patent on it. And now that patent is preventing generic \ncompetition.\n  On Fosamax, a drug for osteoporosis, the brand company has come up \nwith a ``kit'' inside which the pills are arranged. This may be a great \nlittle kit, but its patent shouldn't be listed in the Orange Book where \nit can delay generic competition.\n  On Pulmicort, an asthma medication, the company has a patent on the \ncontainer the drug is in--and that patent is listed in the Orange Book, \nwhere it cause an automatic 30-month stay against a generic.\n  On Thalomid, a cancer drug, the company has come up with not one--but \ntwo--computer programs that pharmacists can use when doling out \nprescriptions. Computer programs--not new drugs--computer programs.\n  Cyclessa, similar to Fosamax, has a patent on a kit which reminds you \nhow to take the medicine. Well the generics can make their own kit.\n  A new piece of plastic shouldn't keep an old pill off the market.\n  These patents are real. Sure they may be on things that are novel, \nbut they have nothing to do with the drug substance that is helping the \npatient. They are put in the Orange Book for the sole purpose of \nextending a company's monopoly.\n  PhRMA says the automatic 30 month stays never extend a patent. Well, \nthey may not extend the amount of time a company can exclusively sell \nits particular container, but stacking them one after the other \ncertainly extends the amount of time that the brand can keep its \ncompetition away from its customers.\n  And brand companies are getting better and better at timing the \nfiling of their patent applications so that their new patents are \nissued just as their original patents are expiring. This practice \ncauses a delay in generic competition, which is nothing less than a de \nfacto extension of the original patent.\n  The delays caused by these additional patents are real, and they mean \nreal money to consumers.\n  Take Neurontin, a drug used to prevent partial seizures. The basic \npatents expired in July of 2000. By listing patents which do not even \nrelate to the originally approved form of the drug, the brand company \nhas already succeeded in preventing generic competition for 21 months--\na delay which may have already cost consumers over $800 million.\n  Further, by listing an additional patent with the FDA, and \noverlapping the automatic 30-month stays, the brand\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\ncompany has effectively converted the original 30-month stay into a 54-\nmonth stay against generic approval, and they didn't even have to prove \nto a court that the new patent had any merit at all.\n  Or take, for example, Paxil, a drug with $2.1 billion in sales used \nto treat depression.\n  The basic active ingredient in Paxil was discovered back in the late \n1970s by a Danish company, Ferrosan. But it wasn't marketed as a drug \nuntil Glaxo SmithKline licensed the original patents, did the clinical \ntrials and got it approved by the FDA.\n  The company deserves a reward for bringing this old chemical to \nmarket, and under Hatch-Waxman, that reward was intended to be 5 years \nof market exclusivity--5 years during which a generic can't even put in \nan application on the drug.\n  But that wasn't enough for Glaxo. Before marketing the drug, they \nmade a slight--and some would argue unnecessary--change to the basic \ncompound in order to get a new patent, a patent which would add an \nadditional 8 years to their monopoly their monopoly on a drug they \ndidn't even discover.\n  Enter Apotex, the first generic challenger, which has gone to court \nclaiming both that they do not infringe this new patent and that the \nnew patent is invalid.\n  The case has been in court for 3\\1/2\\ years. Even if the companies \ncome to resolution on this first patent, Glaxo has, in the meantime, \napplied for and been issued nine additional patents on Paxil--patents \non yet other slightly different chemical substances, as well as patents \non different formulations of the drug. The last of these patents \nexpires in 2019.\n  These new patents have already invoked multiple 30-month stays \nagainst generic competition for Paxil. The automatic stays already \ngranted add up to a delay of over 60 months. To be fair, if Glaxo \nprevails in court, these stays won't extend the time on their patent. \nBut if Apotex wins the suit, these multiple 30-month stays will still \nbe hanging out there preventing the generic from coming to market. And \nthere's nothing to stop Glaxo from getting even more patents before \nthese delays expire. Each year Glaxo can delay generic competition \ncosts Paxil users up to $500 million.\n  What has happened with these drugs is that the drug companies saw \ntheir original patents about to expire and then created new ones to \nmaintain their control over the market.\n  These kinds of practices have become the norm in the drug industry. \nThese companies figure out a new way to keep the dollars rolling in, \nstooping to new lows every day to maintain their exclusivity rights.\n  I have heard from the big drug companies that they are in the failure \nbusiness. Well, if it's the failure business that tops the Fortune 500 \nlists, sign me up.\n  The big pharmaceutical companies may make their claims, but we in \nCongress know the reality. Insurers and State Medicaid directors know \nthe reality. Corporations know the reality. Our seniors know the \nreality.\n  The reality is that prescription drug prices are skyrocketing at a \nrate of 17 percent per year, generic penetration into the market has \nbeen stagnant for the past eight years, and loopholes in our patent \nlaws are making the reality even worse.\n  They are crippling consumers and seniors who can't afford to purchase \nor take the drugs they need.\n  I agree that patent protection is important to saving lives, but I am \nsure those who dedicate their lives to finding new cures would also \nagree that a drug can do no good if it is financially out of the reach \nof patients who depend on it.\n  As Congress continues to wrestle with the complexity of crafting and \npaying for a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit, we must not \noverlook a straightforward solution to the escalating drug prices \nfacing seniors, businesses, insurers and consumers today.\n  If we can ensure fair competition in the pharmaceutical marketplace--\na level playing field for both brand and generic companies--then \neveryone will win.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to vote yes today to S. 812: to \nvote yes for fair marketplace practices, vote yes for robust \ncompetition in the pharmaceutical marketplace, vote yes for access to \naffordable drugs--and vote yes for consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that further material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                                     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\n\n\n                                   Office of Attorney General,\n\n                                    Harrisburg, PA, July 24, 2002.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Schumer: As Attorney General of \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, my constituents make me \n     aware every day about how the high cost of prescription drugs \n     adversely affects their lives. For that reason, I endorse the \n     Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001 (S. \n     812) which you are sponsoring.\n       Pennsylvania has the second largest number of senior \n     citizens of any state in the country. As you are well aware, \n     Medicare does not provide a prescription benefit for most \n     drugs. Therefore, senior citizens without private insurance, \n     Medicaid or a special government program like Pennsylvania's \n     PACE program, pay for prescription drugs themselves. Even \n     though Pennsylvania's PACE program is a model for other state \n     and federal senior citizen prescription benefit plans, the \n     program does not cover every senior citizen. Thus, there are \n     many Pennsylvania citizens living on fixed incomes who find \n     that their income and standard of living is being eaten away \n     by prescription drugs that can cost more than $100 a month. \n     Senior citizens who are on two or three medications can face \n     monthly prescription costs of $500 to $1000.\n       One factor in the high cost of prescription drugs is \n     attempts by brand name drug makers to forestall entry by \n     generic competitions. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 was \n     intended to spur generic competition with brand name \n     pharmaceuticals. Unfortunately, brand name drug makers have \n     been using that act in unintended ways to block or delay \n     rather than foster generic entry. In particular, two \n     provisions have been misused. One allows for an automatic 30-\n     month stay of a generic's drug application upon the filing of \n     a patent infringement suit by a brand name manufacturer. The \n     other grants the first generic drug applicant for a drug a \n     180-day period of exclusivity before other generics can enter \n     the market. These two provisions can be misused to delay \n     generic entry by years. I believe that the Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001 provides a reasonable \n     remedy for these abuses which balances the interests of \n     consumers and the pharmaceutical industry.\n       While I believe that pharmaceutical companies should be \n     compensated for their discoveries and innovation with \n     appropriate patent protection, I object to those patents \n     being lengthened by misuse of the current law. Passage of \n     your bill will address those misuses. Thank you for your work \n     and consideration on this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                D. Michael Fisher,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of New York\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      New York, NY, July 24, 2002.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Judd Gregg,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Gregg: I write to express my \n     support of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \n     Act of 2001 (``GAAP''), which amends the Hatch-Waxman Act of \n     1984 (the ``HWA''). I attach a Policy Statement which details \n     the arguments made in this letter.\n       In the past several years, State Attorneys General have \n     filed five antitrust suits to remedy the harm caused by \n     brand-name and generic manufacturers' manipulation of \n     loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman Act (``HWA''), thereby delaying \n     generic entry. These are:\n       State of Ohio, et al. v. Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Co., \n     concerning the anti-cancer drug Taxol127 (the ``Taxol \n     litigation);\n       State of Alabama, et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., et \n     al., concerning the anti-anxiety drug Buspar127 (the ``Buspar \n     litigation'');\n       State of New York, et al. v. Aventis, S.A., et al., \n     concerning the anti-hypertension drug CD127 (the ``Cardizem \n     litigation'');\n       State of Florida, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., \n     concerning the anti-hypertension drug Hytrin127 (the ``Hytrin \n     litigation''); and\n       Commonwealth of Pennyslvania v. Schering-Plough Corp. et. \n     al, concerning the potassium supplement K-Dur 20 (``the K-Dur \n     20 litigation'').\n     Through these cases, and other multi-state investigations, \n     this Office has gained substantial experience with the \n     shortcomings of the HWA. GAAP will be an important step in \n     correcting these problems, and in ensuring consumers access \n     to affordable medication.\n       GAAP specifically alleviates two critical problems caused \n     by the HWA, which the cases brought by the Attorneys General \n     illustrate:\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\n       The Thirty Month Stay--Under the HWA, brand-name \n     manufacturers list unexpired patents with the FDA in a \n     compendium known as the ``Orange Book.'' The FDA does not \n     evaluate the merits of the listing, and relies on the \n     manufacturer's representations as to the listing's validity. \n     An Orange Book listing carries a rich reward--an automatic \n     30-month stay against certain potential generic entrants \n     whome the manufacturer has sued for patent infringement, \n     despite the absence of any court finding that the \n     infringement claim has any validity whatsoever.\n       Problems caused by this provision are illustrated by the \n     facts of the Buspar litigation. In that case, Bristol-Myers \n     Squibb (``BMS'') sought to extend its patent monopoly for its \n     profitable buspirone anti-anxiety medication. As BMS's \n     buspirone patent was about to expire, BMS received a patent \n     for a metabolite that the body naturally produces--which BMS \n     claimed was the result of introducing buspirone into the \n     body. BMS then had the FDA list the patent in the Orange Book \n     eleven hours before the first generic alternative to \n     buspirone was to otain FDA approval. Although BMS explicitly \n     stated to the United States Patent Office that its new patent \n     did not cover buspirone, it Orange Book entry made precisely \n     the opposite claim. As a result, generic makers of buspirone \n     were barred from the market, and consumers paid millions more \n     than they would have paid, had a generic alternative been \n     available.\n       GAAP helps alleviate this problem in two essential ways. \n     First, a brand-name manufacturer will no longer be able to \n     obtain the 30-month stay for follow-on patents. Had GAAP been \n     in place, BMS's scheme would not have been possible. Second, \n     in certain instances, GAAP allows generic manufacturers to \n     challenge fraudulent Orange Book listings in court.\n       The 180-day exclusivity period--HWA gives certain generic \n     entrants who are the first to seek FDA approval for their \n     drugs a 180-day exclusivity period during which no other \n     generic alternative to the same brand-name drug may come to \n     market. While this provision was intended to provide an \n     incentive for generic entry, in several instances, brand-name \n     manufacturers have paid their generic counterparts to staff \n     off the market, without generic forfeiting its right to \n     exclusivity. This creates a perpetual bar to entry by other \n     generics. Thus, in both the Hytrin and Cardizem cases, no \n     generic version of the brand-name drug could be sold until \n     litigation and investigations by the Federal Trade Commission \n     led the parties to cancel their agreements.\n       GAAP would render impossible such permanent barriers to \n     generic entry. Under the pending bill, if generic entry does \n     not take place within sixty days of the generic drug's \n     approval, the next generic manufacturers in line may enter \n     the market. Conduct now being challenged in costly and time-\n     consuming litigation would simply not have taken place had \n     GAAP been in effect.\n       Case-by-case and after-the-fact investigations and \n     litigation are no substitute for fixing the problems inherent \n     in the HWA. For that reason, I applaud the efforts of \n     Senators Schumer and McCain, and those of other GAAP \n     sponsors, and urge the speedy passage of this important and \n     beneficial bill.\n       Sincerely,\n     Eliot Spitzer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 24, 2002.\n\n Statement on S. 812, The Greater Access To Affordable Pharmaceuticals \n                              Act of 2001\n\n        In a letter issued today, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer \n     has written in support of the Greater Access to Affordable \n     Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001 (``GAAP''), introduced by \n     Senators McCain and Schumer to amend the Hatch-Waxman Act of \n     1984 (the ``HWA''). This statement explains in greater detail \n     the arguments set forth in that letter, and the problems with \n     the HWA that led to its submission.\n       Protecting consumers' access to quality health care at \n     affordable prices is one way in which the State Attorneys \n     General serve the American public. To that end, State \n     Attorneys General have, in recent years, brought five \n     antitrust actions arising, in whole or in part, out of \n     efforts by brand-name drug manufacturers to manipulate the \n     HWA's procedures to keep cheaper generic drugs off the \n     market, and to maintain monopoly pricing long after the \n     brand-name drug's patent expiration date. These are:\n       State of Ohio, et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb, Co., \n     concerning the anti-cancer drug Taxol (the ``Taxol \n     litigation'');\n       State of Alabama, et al. v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., et \n     al., concerning the anti-anxiety drug Buspar (the \n     ``Buspar litigation'');\n       State of New York, et al. v. Aventis, S.A., et al., \n     concerning the anti-hypertension drug Cardizem CD \n     (the ``Cardizem litigation'');\n       State of Florida, et al. v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., \n     concerning the anti-hypertension drug Hytrin (thee \n     ``Hytrin litigation''); and\n       Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Schering-Plough Corp. et \n     al, concerning the potassium supplement K-Dur 20 (``the K-Dur \n     20 litigation'').\n\n       As described in more detail below, these cases starkly \n     illustrate the weaknesses of the HWA.\n       The New York Attorney General has reviewed the terms of \n     GAAP against the backdrop of this experience, and believes \n     that this bill represents a substantial step towards \n     correcting the HWA's flaws, and restoring the appropriate \n     balance that Congress initially intended between protecting \n     innovation and ensuring affordable drug prices. Indeed, much \n     of the misconduct challenged in these cases would not have \n     been possible had GSSP been in force.\n       By this statement and in his letter, the Attorney General \n     highlights the need for reform. After a brief summary of the \n     present law, the statement describes state enforcement \n     actions in greater detail, and show how GAAP effectively \n     closes loopholes that allowed for the misconduct addressed by \n     these actions.\n       By passing GAAP, Congress can protect consumers, lower drug \n     prices, and avoid the need for time-consuming and expensive \n     litigation. For those reasons, the New York Attorney General \n     has strongly urged that Congress enact GAAP into law.\n     I. Generic Drugs and the Hatch-Waxman Act\n       Generic drugs are bioequivalents of brand-name drugs in \n     dosage, form, safety strength, route of administration, \n     quality, performance characteristics and intended use. They \n     tend, however, to be priced significantly below their brand-\n     name equivalents. An increase in the use of generic drugs \n     would be an important step in controlling the rising costs of \n     pharmaceuticals, and of health care in general.\n       In 1984, Congress passed the HWA, which streamlined the \n     regulatory approval process for generic drugs. In particular, \n     the Act permits the manufacturer of a new generic drug to \n     submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application (``ANDA''), which \n     may rely on the safety assessments of the New Drug \n     Application (``NDA'') filed by the ``pioneerr''--i.e., brand-\n     name--drug's manufacturer. An ANDA entails far less expense \n     than an NDA, and can be approved by the FDA far more \n     expeditiously.\n       Although it is not necessary for purposes of this statement \n     to deve into all the intricacies of the HWA, two elements--\n     the 30 month stay and the 180-day exclusivity period--play an \n     important role in allowing pharmaceutical companies to delay \n     generic entry and deny consumers the benefits of competition, \n     despite the good intentions of the HWA's drafters. These \n     elements are addressed below.\n     II. The HWA's Loopholes\n       A. The 30 Month Stay\n       The Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'') maintains a list \n     of pharmaceutical patents commonly known as the ``Orange \n     Book.'' Upon receiving FDA approval for a brand-name drug, \n     the manufacturer must inform the FDA, in substance, of all \n     patents that would be infringed by the non-licensed sale of a \n     generic equivalent for that drug. The FDA then includes those \n     patents on its Orange Book list. Before marketing a generic \n     drug, an ANDA filer must certify that the listed patents will \n     not prevent sale of the generic version, for any of several \n     reasons, and notify the brand-name manufacturer of its \n     certification. One such certification--the so-called \n     ``paragraph IV certification''--attests that the pioneer drug \n     patent ``is invalid or will not be infringed by the \n     manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which the \n     application is submitted.'' Once an ANDA applicant--the \n     generic manufacturer--submits a paragraph IV certification, \n     the brand-name manufacturer has 45 days within which to bring \n     a patent infringement action against the applicant. If the \n     brand-name manufacturer initiates such a suit, the FDA's \n     approval of the NADA is automatically delayed for 30 months.\n       The 30 month period is referred to as a ``stay.'' More \n     accurately, it is an injunction that takes effect immediately \n     on the brand-name manufacturer's filing of its case, \n     regardless of the strength or weakness of its patent \n     infringement claims, and without any judicial oversight \n     whatsoever. The statutorily-created injunction relieves the \n     brand-name manufacturer of the responsibility of satisfying a \n     court that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction against \n     generic entry--a threshold that the brand-name manufacturer \n     would have to meet in the absence of the HWA. The FDA itself \n     lacks the expertise or the resources to evaluate the validity \n     of patents identified for listing in the Orange Book and, in \n     consequence, lists patents solely in reliance on the brand-\n     name manufacturer's listing request.\n       Given the minimal standard for placement in the Orange \n     Book, and the financial rewards of such a listing--a 30-month \n     roadblock to generic entry--it is no surprise that drug \n     manufacturers go to extraordinary lengths to insure that the \n     FDA list any unexpired patent covering a profitable brand-\n     name drug. Often, as the initial patent for a drug's active \n     ingredient nears expiration, the brand-name manufacturer will \n     seek ``secondary patents'' on specific aspects of the drug, \n     such as mode of delivery--the validity of which may be \n     dubious, at best--and which the manufacturer claims apply to \n     previously approved uses of the drug. Armed with such new \n     patents, manufacturers have been able to suppress generic \n     alternatives, which would otherwise be available to \n     consumers.\n       The cases brought by the States illustrate the potential \n     for misuse inherent in the 30 month stay provision:\n       The Buspar litigation concerns, in part, an effort by \n     Bristol-Myers Squibb (``BMS'') to extend its patent monopoly \n     for the profitable buspirone anti-anxiety medication. As \n     BMS's patent for buspirone was about to expire, it received a \n     patent for a metabolite that the body naturally produces--BMS \n     claimed--as\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\n     the result of introducing buspirone into the body. BMS then \n     had the FDA list the patent in the Orange Book eleven hours \n     before the first generic ANDA was to be approved. Although \n     BMS explicitly stated to the United States Patent Office that \n     its new patent did not cover buspirone, its Orange Book entry \n     made precisely the opposite claim. As a result, generic \n     makers of buspirone were barred from the market, and \n     consumers paid hundreds of millions of dollars more than they \n     would have paid, had a generic alternative been available.\n       A federal district judge found that BMS's conduct before \n     the FDA was improper and ordered the patent delisted, thereby \n     permitting the sale of generic alternatives. On appeal, the \n     Federal Circuit held that, as a matter of procedure, generic \n     entrants could not sue to obtain delisting from the Orange \n     Book, and vacated the order without evaluating BMS's behavior \n     before the FDA. This past February, yet another federal \n     district judge found BMS's Orange Book filing to be \n     ``objectively baseless,'' and an effort to ``justify taking \n     property that belongs to the public.''\n       The Taxol litigation addresses efforts by BMS to preserve \n     its monopoly on Taxol, an important treatment for breast \n     cancer and other tumors that the federal government itself \n     initially developed and then licensed to BMS for five years. \n     In their complaint, the States allege that BMS fraudulently \n     obtained patents for Taxol, listed them in the Orange Book, \n     and then filed litigation for the sole purpose of delaying \n     generic entry into the market via the HWA's stay provision. \n     It took nearly three years before a court rejected BMS's \n     claims, during which cancer patients were deprived of access \n     to less expensive generic alternatives.\n       In a particularly egregious manipulation of the HWA, BMS \n     entered into an arrangement with generic manufacturer \n     American Bioscience, Inc., by which BMS consented to \n     be subject to a court-ordered temporary restraining order, \n     issued upon ABI filing a lawsuit demanding that BMS list \n     one of ABI's Taxol patents in the Orange Book. Based on \n     the order, BMS had the FDA list ABI's patent in the Orange \n     Book--in an apparent effort to clothe the fraudulent \n     listing with the seeming legitimacy of a court decree. \n     After generic manufacturers and the Federal Trade \n     Commission filed papers challenging the collusively \n     obtained order, the Court ruled that ABI was not entitled \n     to sue BMS to obtain an Orange Book listing, and dismissed \n     the case.\n       GAAP takes important steps towards resolving the problems \n     addressed by these cases, in two ways. First, GAAP limits \n     drug manufacturers to a single 30 month stay per drug. As \n     initially drafted, GAAP eliminated the 30 month stay \n     altogether. While the original might better encourage \n     pharmaceutical competition, the compromise version passed by \n     the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     represents a substantial improvement over the present legal \n     regime.\n       In the Buspar case, BMS was able to obtain a 30 month stay \n     for the third patent it claimed barred generic versions of \n     buspirone, after the initial patent had expired and without \n     the need to obtain a court ruling on infringement. GAAP \n     instead requires drug manufacturers that obtain such follow-\n     on patents to protect their intellectual property in the same \n     manner as other patent holders--by going to court, proving \n     that their case has a likelihood of success, and securing an \n     injunction against the alleged infringer. That option \n     provides recourse for genuinely aggrieved patent holders, \n     while prohibiting brand-name manufacturers from gaining an \n     advantage, to the detriment of consumers, solely on the basis \n     of their own assertion of a valid patent and their \n     willingness to file suit.\n       Second, GAAP would allow generic competitors to seek \n     declaratory relief on the validity of an Orange Book listing \n     at the time an NDA is approved--when, under GAAP, the brand-\n     name manufacturer would still be entitled to a thirty month \n     stay. As the Federal Circuit's Buspar ruling demonstrates, \n     the FDA's decision to list a patent in the Orange Book may \n     not be subject to any judicial review under existing law, and \n     frivolous or fraudulent listings can become impassable \n     roadblocks to generic entry. Although a previous version of \n     the bill would have afforded even greater opportunity for \n     challenging Orange Book listings, this aspect of GAAP would \n     still provide potential entrants with the means to challenge \n     such roadblocks in court, in those cases where the thirty-\n     month stay would still apply.\n       B. The 180-Day Exclusivity Period\n       HWA gives the first ANDA filer with a paragraph IV \n     certification a 180-day exclusivity period following a court \n     ruling permitting entry, during which no other manufacturer \n     of a generic version of the same drug could enter. This \n     provision provides an incentive for generic manufacturers to \n     challenge brand-name patents. But as currently structured, \n     the HWA provides a means for brand-name and generic \n     manufacturers acting in collusion to bar new generic \n     competitors for significantly longer periods. In effect, the \n     brand-name manufacturer simply ``buys'' the first ANDA \n     filer's agreement neither to enter the market nor to transfer \n     its exclusivity rights, thereby creating a perpetual bar \n     against other generic competitors. This can have a profound \n     impact on drug prices, because generic drugs are typically \n     not priced at their full discount until the exclusivity \n     period has expired and additional generic competitors are \n     able to enter the market.\n       Cases brought by the Attorneys General illustrate this \n     abuse of the HWA:\n       The Cardizem litigation arises from an agreement between \n     brand-name manufacturer Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc. \n     (``HMRI'') and generic drug manufacturer Andrx Corporation \n     (``Andrx''), under which HMRI paid Andrx nearly $90 million \n     in exchange for Andrx's agreement to keep its cheaper \n     alternative to HMRI's Cardizem CD heart medication off the \n     market. As part of the agreement, Andrx agreed to stay off \n     the market while still prosecuting its ANDA--so as to \n     maintain its right to the 180-day exclusivity period granted \n     the first-filer under the HWA--and pledged not to transfer or \n     sell its exclusivity rights. Thus, the agreement effectively \n     barred any further generic entry. Only after private suits \n     challenged this arrangement and the FTC opened an \n     investigation, did Andrx enter the market, thereby removing \n     the block against additional generic competitors. A federal \n     district court has since held the HMRI/Andrx agreement to \n     constitute a per se violation of the antitrust laws. (That \n     ruling is now on appeal.) In yet another case, the Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstated a \n     generic manufacturer's claim challenging the HMRI/Andrx \n     agreement.\n       The Hytrin litigation challenges an arrangement under which \n     Abbot Laboratories (``Abbott'') paid generic manufacturer \n     Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (``Geneva'') over $60 million, \n     in exchange for Geneva's agreement not to market a generic \n     version of Abbot's hypertension medication, Hytrin. In that \n     agreement--as in Cardizem--Geneva promised not to give up the \n     180-day exclusivity period as the first ANDA filer. No other \n     generic manufacturers were able to enter the market, and \n     Geneva and Abbott shared the profits from the resulting \n     exclusion of competition. The district court held this \n     arrangement per se unlawful. (That ruling, too, is on \n     appeal.)\n       Under GAAP, the first ANDA filer loses its right to \n     exclusivity if it does not come to market within 60 days of \n     the date on which it is declared eligible to do so by the \n     FDA. Further, the 180-day exclusivity period runs from either \n     the date of a final court decision on the patent infringement \n     action, or the date on which a settlement order or consent \n     decree is signed by the court, whichever is earlier. These \n     provisions should severely limit the ability of the brand-\n     name manufacturer and first generic entrant to act \n     collusively to bar other generic alternatives from reaching \n     consumers.\n       III. Conclusion\n       In the examples above, antitrust suits seeking full \n     recompense for injured consumers helped cause the wrongdoers \n     to cease their misconduct, and may aid in deterring further \n     abuses. But antitrust enforcement on a case-by-case basis \n     will not solve the problems underlying the lawsuits, which \n     are inherent in the HWA itself. As enacted, the HWA affords \n     unscrupulous manufacturers with both means and incentive to \n     extend brand-name monopolies beyond the patent exclusivity \n     period set by Congress.\n       Not all such misconduct comes to the attention of law \n     enforcers or private plaintiffs; antitrust litigation is \n     time-consuming, expensive and risky; and pharmaceutical \n     companies are learning from previous legal setbacks, and are \n     adopting ways to exploit the present law that may be less \n     vulnerable to antitrust challenges--yet still deleterious to \n     the goal of harnessing competition to provide affordable \n     health care. Amending the HWA so as to remove available \n     avenues for anticompetitive and anticonsumer actions, rather \n     than relying on individual lawsuits for costly after-the-fact \n     remedies, is a far more effective means to protect consumers.\n\n                         Whose Side Are You On?\n\n\n                     In Favor of the Current System\n\n       Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association \n     (PhRMA)\n\n\n                   In Favor of Closing the Loopholes\n\n       General Motors Corporation\n       Ford Motor Company\n       Daimler Chrysler\n       International Union, UAW\n       AFL-CIO\n       AFSCME\n       Verizon\n       Wal-Mart\n       Kodak\n       Motorola\n       Caterpillar, Inc.\n       K-Mart\n       Georgia-Pacific\n       Albertsons\n       UPS\n       Kellogg's\n       Sysco\n       Constellation Energy Group\n       Ahold USA\n       Woodgrain Millwork\n       Weyerhaeuser\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare\n       AARP\n       Consumer Federation of America\n       Families USA\n       Gray Panthers\n       National Consumer League\n       Consumers Union\n       Public Citizen\n       U.S. PIRG\n       Governor Howard Dean (VT)\n       Governor William Janklow (SD)\n       Governor Bob Wise (WV)\n\n[[Page S7639]]\n\n       Governor M.J. ``Mike'' Foster, Jr. (LA)\n       Governor Don Siegelman (AL)\n       Governor Gary Locke (WA)\n       Governor Bob Holden (MO)\n       Governor Jeanne Shaheen (NH)\n       Governor Tony Knowles (AK)\n       Governor Benjamin Cayetano (HI)\n       Governor Ronnie Musgrove (MI)\n       Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA)\n       American Association of Health Plans\n       Aetna\n       Blue Cross Blue Shield Association\n       Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield\n       Health Insurance Association of America\n       Kaiser Permanente Health Plan\n       HIP\n       Association of Community Health Plans\n       National Association of Health Underwriters\n       National Association of Chain Drug Stores\n       Advance-PCS\n       Caremark Rx\n       American Academy of Family Physicians\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare\n       Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy\n       Alliance of Community Health Plans\n       National Organization for Rare Disorders\n       National Hemophilia Foundation\n       Alpha One Foundation\n       Gay Men's Health Crisis\n       Center for Medical Consumers\n       Treatment Action Group\n       Interstitial Cystitis Association\n       The Narcolepsy Network\n       Pacific Business Group on Health\n       Midwest Business Group on Health\n       Washington Business Group on Health\n       Food Marketing Institute\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today that the Senate has \npassed the Schumer-McCain bill. This bill is the Senate's answer to the \npublic's demand for action on lower drug prices. The bill would end--\nonce and for all--the drug industry's abuses and close legal loopholes \nthe industry exploits to block competition and keep drug prices \nartificially high.\n  The record is clear that the pharmaceutical industry uses loopholes \nin the landmark Hatch-Waxman Act to drive up the cost of prescription \ndrugs. Each and every day, pharmaceutical companies exploit those \nloopholes to maintain their monopoly over their drugs, and to keep more \naffordable generic drugs off the market. America's consumers pay the \nprice, and today the Senate has said loud and clear--it's time to stop \nthe abuses.\n  Just yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission recommended legislative \nchanges that are incorporated in Schumer-McCain. And here today, the \nSenate has approved the Schumer-McCain reforms on a strong bipartisan \nvote. The Senate has spoken and it has said: Stop these abuses. Stop \ndepriving our seniors and our uninsured of safe and effective drugs \nthat they can afford. Stop driving up the cost of health care for \nemployers and health plans and consumers by delaying lower cost generic \ndrugs.\n  What is it we have done today? Schumer-McCain amends the Hatch-Waxman \nAct, which provides for the approval of generic drugs. The Hatch-Waxman \nAct has been a tremendous success in promoting competition and \ninnovation in the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, both the brand drug \nand generic drug industries have flourished under it.\n  Yet there are clearly weaknesses in the Hatch-Waxman Act. Today, of \nthe top 15 best-selling drugs potentially subject to generic \ncompetition, the basic patents on at least five have long expired. \nTheir exclusive rights to market their drugs have passed. Yet there is \nno generic competition. The system needs repairs.\n  Prescription drug costs are spiraling out of reach of the elderly and \nuninsured. They are draining the health care budgets of State \ngovernments, employers and labor unions. All because brand-name drug \ncompanies have exploited loopholes in the law to pocket windfall \nprofits.\n  Drug prices have skyrocketed at double digit rates annually since \n1996, and experts expect this trend to continue. This drug price \ninflation has been far in excess of the rate of consumer price \ninflation. And experts agree that spiraling drug prices have accounted \nfor almost two-thirds of growth in drug spending especially the higher \nprices of new, aggressively promoted drugs.\n  Generic drugs are clearly part of the answer. Simply put, a 1 percent \nincrease in generic use can decrease the Nation's yearly bill for drugs \nby a billion dollars. And ensuring the timely approval of generic drugs \ncould save consumers $60 billion over the next 10 years.\n  These savings are easy to understand. For patients and health plans \nalike, the costs of brand-name drugs are four times higher than for \ntheir generic equivalents. That difference is even higher for the \nelderly and uninsured, who must often pay full price for their \nmedicines. On average, a month's supply of a generic drug costs a \npatient $4 and the health plan $16; the costs for a brand drug are 4 \ntimes higher: $16 for the patient, $64 for the plan. For the uninsured, \nand seniors who lack prescription drug coverage, the full costs are \neither $20 for the generic or $80 for the brand drug.\n  The antidepressant Prozac is a clear example. Generic companies \nchallenged and defeated a Prozac patent. Today, you can buy 30 generic \nProzac tablets for less than $30--less than a third of what brand-name \nProzac will cost you.\n  But some pharmaceutical companies game the system by listing spurious \npatents with the FDA--patents on unapproved uses, unapproved compounds, \nor formulations that they don't even market. Then they get automatic 30 \nmonth stays delaying approval of generic drugs.\n  For example, Neurontin is a drug approved by FDA to treat epilepsy. \nIn 2001, Neurontin sales exceeded $1.1 billion. The basic patent on the \ndrug compound expired in 1994, and the patent on the approved method of \nuse expired in 2000. But the company had listed two additional patents \non the drug that the generic companies had to certify were invalid or \nnot infringed. These two patents were on an unapproved compound--just \nthe addition of a water molecule to the basic compound--and on an \nunapproved use, the treatment of neurogenerative disease, patents that \nnever should have been listed at FDA.\n  The first 30-month stay needlessly delayed generic competition for \nhalf a year. But before that stay was up, Neurontin's manufacturer \nlisted a third formulation patent with FDA. The generic applicant had \nto certify to that patent as well and another 30 month stay will delay \ngeneric approval until December 2002. In total, a generic version of \nthis drug will be delayed 30 months, at a cost to consumers of $1.4 \nbillion.\n  In effect, Neurontin's manufacturer blocked generic competition by \nobtaining a patent for simply adding a water molecule to its basic \ndrug. That patent meant months of delay in which that company enjoys \nhuge profits while preventing affordable generic versions from reaching \nthe market. This single water molecule will cost consumers at least \n$1.4 billion in savings for their prescription drugs. We still do not \nknow when a generic will get to market, but we do know that Schumer-\nMcCain will make it far more likely that a generic Neurontin will be \navailable in 2003.\n  To address the abusive mis-listing of patents at FDA, the ever-\ngreening of patents, and the stacking of successive 30 months stays, \nSchumer-McCain includes a series of provisions designed to work \ntogether to close the loopholes and foreclose future gaming of the \nsystem. Schumer-McCain does several things.\n  First, Schumer-McCain permits only one 30-month stay per generic drug \napplication, and only on those patents listed with the FDA within 30 \ndays of brand drug approval.\n  Second, for the patents for which no 30-month stay is available, \nSchumer-McCain provides an expedited process whereby a patent owner \ncan, within 45 days, seek a preliminary injunction to defend its patent \nagainst a particular generic drug applicant. If a patent owner elects \nnot to defend its patent against that generic applicant as part of this \nprocess, it cannot later enforce that patent against that applicant or \nothers for the manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of that \napplicant's generic drug. This provision does not preclude the patent \nowner from enforcing its patent against anyone else, including a \nsubsequent generic applicant that challenges the patent in its generic \napplication. Schumer-McCain includes related provisions that enhance \nprotections for patents. One requires a generic applicant who \nchallenges a patent to provide better information to the patent owner \nfor it to assess the merits of the generic applicant's patent \nchallenge, while the second clarifies that a preliminary injunction in \na drug patent infringement case may be granted notwithstanding the \navailability of monetary damages.\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n  Third, Schumer-McCain clarifies the information that must be filed \nwith FDA on patents that claim a drug or an approved method of using a \ndrug, so that it will be more difficult for drug manufacturers to list \ninappropriate patents or incorrect or incomplete information with FDA.\n  Fourth, Schumer-McCain enforces this requirement to list patent \ninformation at FDA by saying that failure to list a patent bars the \npatent owner from enforcing the patent against a generic applicant or \nothers for the manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of a generic \ndrug. This provision does not bar enforcement of the patent against \nanyone else, in particular against any brand drug company or others for \nthe manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of a brand drug that \ninfringes the patent. In addition, the provision provides that \ncorrections to patent information may be made after it is published by \nFDA in the unusual circumstance of an inadvertent mistake or clerical \nerror.\n  Finally, Schumer-McCain allows generic applicants to sue brand drug \ncompanies to delist patents or correct patent information on patents \nthat can trigger 30 month stays. This provision allows for the \ncorrection of misinformation in and the removal of incorrectly listed \npatents from FDA's Orange Book.\n  A second tactic used by brand drug companies is to collude with a \ngeneric drug manufacturer to block other generic versions of the drug \nfrom getting to consumers. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the first \ngeneric drug company to challenge a patent on a brand drug has the \nexclusive right to market its drug for 6 months before any other \ngeneric can compete. In some cases, brand drug companies have paid such \na generic drug company not to exercise its 6-month right, thereby \nblocking other generic versions of the drug.\n  For example, terazosin hydrochloride is used to treat high blood \npressure and enlarged prostate. Consumers used about $540 million of \nthe drug in 1998. A generic was scheduled for market in April 1999, but \nAbbott Laboratories reached sweetheart deals with two generic \ncompanies, Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, \nto keep their generic products off the market. That in turn blocked \nother generics from getting to market for 16 months. Abbott paid Zenith \na lump sum of $3 million plus $6 million per quarter under their \nagreement, while Geneva received $4.5 million per month. The Federal \nDistrict Court in Florida held that the agreements were illegal under \nantitrust laws. The result was that consumers paid hundreds of millions \nmore than they should have because generic competition was delayed.\n  Schumer-McCain closes this loophole and ensures generic challenges to \ninvalid patents. How does it do this? It provides for six situations in \nwhich a generic drug company with the 180 days of exclusivity must \nforfeit the exclusivity--for example, if the generic is found by the \nFederal Trade Commission to have colluded with a brand drug company, if \nit withdraws its application, or otherwise delays in getting to market. \nWhen the first generic forfeits the 180 days, the generic applicant \nthat is next ready to be approved and go to market can go to market, \nand consumers immediately enjoy generic competition and lower costs.\n  If that generic applicant is the second generic to have challenged a \npatent, it gets the 180 days of exclusivity and subsequent generic \napplicants are delayed from getting final FDA approval for 180 days. If \nthe generic applicant ready to go to market is not the second generic \nto have challenged a patent, but rather is the third or the fourth or \nthe fifth, the 180 days of exclusivity disappears and FDA may approve \nsubsequent generic applicants as soon as they are ready.\n  Either way, consumers benefit because the first generic that is ready \ngets to market as soon as it can. In addition, the 180 exclusivity \nremains as an incentive for the second generic applicant to challenge a \npatent, an incentive that is vital to maintain especially for those \nsituations when a patent must be shown to be invalid. In this way, \nSchumer-McCain speeds generic drugs to market while preserving the 180 \nday incentive--an incentive that has encouraged generic companies to \nbreak patents on several high-priced blockbuster drugs and saved \nconsumers billions of dollars.\n  Schumer McCain also makes some other adjustments to the 180-day \nexclusivity provision. First, it clarifies that the court decision that \ncan start the 180-day period running is the earlier of the date of a \nfinal decision from which no appeal, other than a petition for review \nby the Supreme Court, has been or can be taken or the date of a \nsettlement order or consent decree that includes a finding that the \npatent at issue is invalid or not infringed. This provision also \nclarifies that it is any such decision on the patent that will trigger \nthe 180-day period, not necessarily one in the case to which the \ngeneric applicant with the exclusivity was a party. Second, the bill \nclarifies that the 180-day period is available only to the first \napplicant to challenge a patent on a brand drug, and that subsequent \napplicants that challenge different patents on that brand drug do not \nalso receive a 180-day period of exclusivity, unless the first forfeits \nits exclusivity, as provided for by the bill. Third, the bill clarifies \nthat the 180-day period is only applicable to a generic applicant that \nchallenges a patent if that applicant is sued for patent infringement.\n  Finally, Schumer-McCain includes a provision that is intended to \nforestall frivolous challenges by brand companies to the legal \nlegitimacy of FDA's bioequivalence regulations, challenges that have \nsubstantially delayed the approval of some generic drugs. The court \nchallenges by brand companies have taken several forms, including \nchallenges to the specifics of the FDA's regulations and the FDA's \nauthority to issue the regulations, and have involved drug products \nsuch as asthma inhalers and topicals. The challenges themselves \nfrequently start as administrative challenges in the form of citizen \npetitions and progress to legal challenges. Each challenge delays \napproval or marketing of the generic, and each one consumes valuable \nFDA resources in defending against these fundamentally frivolous \nlawsuits. These lawsuits are also filed notwithstanding the holdings of \ndifferent circuit courts of appeal upholding the regulations.\n  The provision says that FDA's current regulations on bioequivalence \nshall continue in effect as legitimate exercises of FDA's statutory \nauthority. The provision allows FDA to amend its regulations through \nrulemaking, but it does not preclude judicial review of those amended \nregulations, nor judicial review of an application of either the \ncurrent or amended bioequivalence regulations. Finally, the provision \nmakes it clear we are not changing FDA's authority under the Federal \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act over biological products.\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act has been a tremendous success in stimulating \nboth competition and innovation. But there are weaknesses in this law \nthat Schumer-McCain rightly closes. Drug companies are entitled to fair \nprofits on their research and innovation. But when patents expire, \nthose companies must innovate to succeed and help patients, not block \ncompetition to their old drugs.\n  I also want to applaud the inclusion of a number of important \namendments which will help lower drug costs and ensure drug coverage \nfor all Americans, including Senator Stabenow's amendment to help \nStates negotiate lower prices and Senator Rockefeller's amendment to \nprovide emergency Medicaid relief to States in fiscal crisis.\n  Schumer-McCain restores the balance of the original Hatch-Waxman Act, \nends the abuses that block competition, and closes the gaps in the \nHatch-Waxman Act. The Senate has said: Stop the abuses. Now the House \nof Representatives must act with us.\n  I thank my health staff for all their hard work on this legislation--\nDavid Dorsey, David Nexon, Paul Kim and Michael Myers on S. 812. David \nDorsey made a particularly important contribution to this effort, and \ndeserves high praise for his work. I also want to particularly \nrecognize the hard work and unwavering dedication of Missy Rohrbach \nwith Senator Schumer. And the record would be incomplete without noting \nthe very important contributions of Carlos Fierro and Jeanne Bumpus \nwith Senator McCain, Kyle Kinner with Senator Edwards, Michael Bopp \nwith Senator Collins, Debra Barrett with Senator Dodd, Sean Donohue\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\nwith Senator Jeffords, Anne Grady with Senator Murray, Steve Irizarry \nwith Senator Gregg, and Dean Rosen with Senator Frist.

Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As a broad-based coalition of large \n     employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers, \n     insurers, labor unions, and others, we are writing to advise \n     you of our strong support for the Edwards/Collins amendment \n     to S. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \n     Act. We believe it is critical that Congress act this year to \n     pass legislation that would eliminate barriers to generic \n     drug entry into the marketplace. The legislation you will be \n     marking up today clearly would accomplish this long-overdue \n     need.\n       Prescription drug costs are increasing at double-digit \n     rates, and clearly are unsustainable. Current pharmaceutical \n     cost trends are increasing premiums, raising copayments, \n     pressuring reductions in benefits, and undermining the \n     ability of businesses to compete in the world marketplace. We \n     believe that a major contributor to the pharmaceutical cost \n     crisis is the use of the Drug Price Competition and Patent \n     Term Restoration Act of 1984 clearly in ways unanticipated by \n     Congress, which effectively block generic entry into the \n     marketplace. The repeated use of the 30-month generic drug \n     marketing prohibition provision and other legal barriers have \n     resulted in increasingly unpredictable and unaffordable \n     pharmaceutical cost increases.\n       Although the compromise amendment being offered today does \n     not totally eliminate the 30-month marketing prohibition \n     provision, as would be our preference, it does make important \n     process changes that will lead to a more predictable, \n     rational pharmaceutical marketplace. We recognize that \n     compromises have been necessary to garner the support of a \n     majority of the Members of the Committee and appreciate your \n     leadership and the hard work of your staff. However, we would \n     strongly oppose any additional amendments that would \n     undermine the intent of this legislation by further delaying \n     generic access or reducing competition and increasing costs \n     to purchasers. We also remain opposed to legislation that \n     would increase costs to purchasers either through extended \n     monopolies or unnecessary and costly litigation.\n       We are convinced that the legislation you are advocating \n     will make a major difference in increasing competition in the \n     marketplace and enhancing access to more affordable, high \n     quality prescription drugs. We look forward to working with \n     you and other Members of the HELP Committee to ensure that \n     this important legislation is enacted this year.\n       The Coalition for a Competition Pharmaceutical Market is an \n     organization of large national employers, consumer groups, \n     generic drug manufacturers, insurers, labor unions, and \n     others. CCPM is committed to improving consumer access to \n     high quality generic drugs and restoring a vigorous, \n     competitive prescription drug market. CCPM supports \n     legislation eliminate legal barriers to timely access to less \n     costly, equally effective generic drugs.\n\n\n                       ccpm participating members\n\n       American Association of Health Plans, Aetna, Anthem Blue \n     Cross and Blue Shield, Blue Cross and Blue Shield \n     Association, Caterpillar, Inc., Consumer Federation of \n     America, Families USA, Food Marketing Institute, Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association, General Motors Corporation, Gray \n     Panthers, Health Insurance Association of America, IVAX \n     Pharmaceuticals, National Association of Chain Drug Stores, \n     National Association of Health Underwriters, National \n     Organization for Rare Disorders, Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, \n     TEVA USA, The National Committee to Preserve Social Security \n     and Medicare, United Auto Workers, Watson Pharmaceuticals, \n     and WellPoint Health Networks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               General Motors,\n\n                                       Detroit, MI, July 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: As the largest private provider of \n     health care coverage in the nation, I am writing to commend \n     you for your leadership in supporting legislation that \n     removes barriers to generic competition and reduces costs to \n     all consumers. At General Motors, we insure over 1.2 million \n     workers, retirees, and their families, and on their behalf, I \n     want to thank you for supporting and passing out of the \n     Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee S. \n     812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act.\n       We now spend over $1.3 billion a year on prescription \n     drugs, and without relief, these costs are projected to \n     continue to grow at 15 to 20 percent a year. Such increases \n     are clearly unsustainable, and over time will make it \n     impossible for us to compete in the world market.\n       We are convinced that your support of S. 812 will \n     rationalize the currently distorted marketplace that has led \n     to increasing and unpredictable pharmaceutical costs. This \n     has resulted in increasing premiums, copayments, and \n     pressures to reduce benefits. We believe that this landmark \n     legislation will close the loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman law \n     that currently block generic entry into the marketplace. \n     Moreover, we believe your leadership in supporting bipartisan \n     amendments in Committee strengthen S. 812 and assure much-\n     needed predictability in the health care delivery system.\n       As a large employer and payer of health care, we are \n     pleased that the Committee process clarified the so-called \n     ``de-listing'' provision. This modification makes clear that \n     the necessary ability for generics to challenge brand-name \n     companies who have inappropriately listed patents in the FDA \n     Orange Book does not in any way provide for civil and \n     monetary penalties, and solely focuses the remedy for the \n     abusive listing on the de-listing of the product from the \n     Orange Book.\n       Once again, I want to thank you for the work that you and \n     your staff have put in to this effort. We believe that your \n     efforts will make a major difference in increasing \n     prescription drug competition and choice, as well as \n     expanding access to more affordable medications for our \n     current and former employees and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dick Wagoner, Jr.\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Generic Pharmaceutical Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our strong \n     support of the Edwards amendment to S. 812, the Greater \n     Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act. As the \n     manufacturers, suppliers, and distributers of more than 90 \n     percent of the nations' generic medicines, the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) is all too familiar with \n     the abusive tactics name brand pharmaceutical companies \n     employ to delay consumers access to affordable, quality \n     generic pharmaceuticals and the dire need for Congress to \n     pass legislation to close the loopholes in the law that the \n     name brand industry has grown so proficient in exploiting. We \n     believe the Edwards amendment effectively accomplishes this \n     goal and has earned the tripartisan support it is now \n     receiving.\n       The high cost of prescription drugs is one of the nation's \n     most pressing public policy challenges today. Senior \n     citizens, the uninsured, major employers, governors, consumer \n     groups and public and private insurers are all looking to \n     Congress for relief from the unsustainable annual increases \n     in prescription drug costs. Increasing consumer access to \n     generic medicines by increasing competition in the \n     pharmaceutical market place can and must play a central role \n     in any legislative plan to control drug costs. The full \n     benefits increased competition can bring to the health care \n     delivery system, however, cannot be realized until Congress \n     closes the loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman Act that are \n     thwarting competition and inflating the cost of prescription \n     medicines.\n       Abuse of the 30-month stay provision of the Hatch-Waxman \n     act is one of the most effective and most frequently used \n     methods to delay generic competition. The Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association believes the most efficient way to \n     ensure this provision is no longer used to delay generic \n     competition is to abolish it completely. However, GPhA \n     recognizes that compromises were necessary to bring support \n     for the legislation to its current point and commends you, \n     the other Members of the Senate HELP Committee, and your \n     staff for your unwavering commitment to knocking down the \n     barriers that are blocking access to generic medicines.\n       GPhA looks forward to working with you to secure the \n     Committee's approval of the Edwards amendment and would \n     oppose any effort to dilute or weaken it with amendments that \n     would maintain or exacerbate the problems in the existing \n     Hatch-Waxman system. As always, we appreciate your leadership \n     on this issue and stalwart commitment to ensuring all \n     Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.\n       Sincerely,\n                                               Kathleen D. Jaeger,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             National Organization\n\n\n                                     for Rare Disorders, Inc.,\n\n                                       Danbury, CT, July 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: For the sake of 25 million Americans \n     with rare ``orphan'' diseases, we want you to know that S. \n     812, the\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\n     Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act (GAAP), and \n     the Edwards-Collins Amendment that was passed by the Senate \n     HELP Committee on July 11, 2002, will help millions of \n     uninsured and underinsured Americans to gain access to \n     affordable medications.\n       GAAP will close the loopholes of the Hatch-Waxman generic \n     drug law that was enacted in 1984. This will ultimately lead \n     to availability of lower cost generic drugs in a timely \n     manner. When pharmaceutical patents expire, competition would \n     be allowed without undue delay, and competition will drive \n     prices down. We believe that S. 812 will make affordable \n     treatments accessible to uninsured and underinsured people, \n     particularly the elderly and younger Medicare beneficiaries \n     who receive Social Security Disability benefits. In the \n     absence of a Medicare prescription drug benefit, S. 812 is an \n     essential first step in the giant leap forward that Americans \n     desperately need for health care.\n       We hope that Congress will close the loopholes to the \n     Hatch-Waxman Act and deter the frivolous lawsuits that have \n     repeatedly delayed availability of affordable generic drugs. \n     We hope that this will be the first step in your efforts to \n     add a much needed prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Abbey S. Meyers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: Consumers Union urges your support of the \n     ``Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act (GAAP Act) \n     of 2001 (S. 812).'' This legislation would streamline and \n     improve the generic drug approval process, saving consumers \n     billions of dollars. We believe that companies trying to \n     bring generic drugs to market face too many unnecessary \n     obstacles and that the removal of these barriers will \n     increase competition and deliver lower-priced drugs to \n     consumers.\n       We support wider access to affordable medicines for all \n     Americans, especially the uninsured, the underinsured, the \n     elderly, and the disabled. Today, health care costs are \n     spiraling out of control for consumers and employers. Between \n     1999 and 2000 alone, prescription drug spending increased by \n     17.3%--the sixth year of double-digit increases. According to \n     a 2002 Brandeis University study, older Americans could save \n     $250 billion over the next ten years through the increased \n     use of generic drugs. The Schumer-McCain bill is a cost-\n     saving measure that will help rein in spiraling prescription \n     drug expenditures--a critical first step toward the \n     implementation of an affordable Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit.\n       This legislation will improve consumer access to generic \n     drugs by restoring the balance between innovation and \n     competition. We believe that the anticipated cost savings \n     from this measure is a necessary foundation for the Senate to \n     build a comprehensive prescription drug benefit into \n     Medicare.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Janell Mayo Duncan,\n                                              Legislative Counsel.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment regarding our current situation on Medicare prescription \ndrug legislation. I am extremely disappointed that we have not been \nable to pass a prescription drug benefit, and I believe it is \nabsolutely imperative that the Senate continue to work toward this end.\n  The fact is, when Medicare was designed in 1965, the system relied on \ninpatient hospitalization and seldom on outpatient services, preventive \ncare, or patient drug therapies. At that time, prescription drugs only \naccounted for four percent of all personal health care expenditures.\n  But as we enter the 21st century, the cutting edge of health care has \nshifted. Every day, as new preventive and therapeutic drugs replace \noutdated inpatient procedures, Medicare falls further and further \nbehind in providing basic care.\n  Medicare was written to cover the most basic health care for seniors. \nWhen the original bill passed, the legislation's conference report \nexplicitly says that the intent of the program is to provide adequate \n``medical aid for needy people,'' and should ``make the best of modern \nmedicine more readily available to the aged.''\n  Well, we are not making the best use of modern medicine when millions \nof seniors cannot afford access to the prescription drugs they need. \nPrescription drugs that had not even been developed when Medicare was \nenacted are now an essential aspect of basic health care. We owe it to \nour seniors to live up to Medicare's original mandate and provide them \nthe best medical care.\n  Unfortunately, today, beneficiaries' current drug coverage options \nare often expensive and unreliable. And as a result, nearly seven out \nof ten Medicare beneficiaries lack decent, dependable coverage for \ntheir prescription drug needs, and more than one-third have no coverage \nat all. Prescription drug expenditures for the average senior in my \nhome State of Washington are over $2,100 every year, over 122,000 of my \nseniors spend more than $4,000 a year.\n  On average, one out of every five dollars of every Social Security \ncheck to Washington State's seniors is spent on prescription drugs. And \nseniors with the most serious illnesses spend nearly 40 percent of \ntheir Social Security check on prescription drugs. How in the world are \nseniors on fixed incomes supposed to do this? What happens to them in \nan emergency?\n  Last week I visited three senior citizen centers to discuss the \ncurrent prescription drug debate. This is what my constituents told me: \nthey want prescription drug coverage to be comprehensive, simple to \nadminister, guaranteed, stable, and based on the very best medical \ntechnology. And most importantly, they want the benefit run through \nMedicare, a program they understand and upon which they depend.\n  I think this is the first point I want to make about HMOs versus \nMedicare as we continue to debate delivery mechanisms for a new \nbenefit. Seniors do not want their prescription drug benefit run \nthrough an HMO or other private insurance company.\n  According to a June 2002 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and \nthe Kennedy School of Government, 67 percent of American people believe \nwe should expand Medicare to pay for part of prescription drugs, but \nonly 26 percent say we should help seniors buy private insurance to pay \nfor prescription drugs costs.\n  A private delivery model gives insurers complete control over whether \nto offer a benefit, how much to charge, and whether to cover drugs \nregardless of whether these drugs are medically necessary. That's too \nmuch control over a program that is supposed to guarantee help for \nseniors.\n  The very basic issue here is that the private market will not cover \nsuch a high-risk population--especially a population at such risk for \nadverse selection. I don't want to see this benefit be a repeat of the \nMedicare+Choice program. And if the private insurance model hasn't \nworked for the full Medicare benefit, it certainly won't work for a \nsingle benefit where utilization is expected to be high.\n  Putting HMOs in charge of prescription drug coverage would be like \nputting Enron in charge of Social Security.\n  The second point I want to make is that seniors need a benefit that \nis comprehensive, one that covers their total prescription drug needs. \nThirty percent of Washington seniors--212,000 people--will fall into \nthe benefit hole proposed under the Tripartisan bill. But these same \nseniors will need to continue to pay their monthly premium, whatever it \nis as determined by the private HMOs or insurance companies, during \nthat benefit gap. My constituents will not stand for this.\n  We need to pay very close attention to the catastrophic coverage in \nall of these proposals and what it means for seniors. What we're \ntalking about is covering medicines for the very sickest seniors, and \nwe know that the very sickest seniors have the very highest drug costs. \nIn fact, just 14 percent of the elderly population account for nearly \nhalf of all prescription drug expenditures.\n  Seniors account for 12.6 percent of the general population, but a \nthird of all prescription drug expenditures. And while prescriptions \nare expensive, in some cases, prohibitively so, these are the very same \nprescription drugs that keep people out of the hospital, out of the \nnursing home, and living vibrant and happy lives. And while it is \ndifficult to quantify in economic terms, prescription drugs preserve \nhealth and eliminate unnecessary hospitalization, which is by far most \nexpensive segment of the health care.\n  Americans are becoming increasingly reliant on more effective, and \nmore complicated, drug therapies. Total health care spending in the \nUnited States will total more than $1.5 trillion this year, an increase \nof 8.6 percent over last year, according to a March report released by \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n  The other part of this debate concerns the need to get generic \nmedications to the market, and to our Nation's seniors and disabled, \nmore quickly. Generic medicines account for 42 percent of all \nprescriptions dispensed\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\nin America and on average are put on the market at 75 percent of the \ncost of their name-brand rivals.\n  But we know that the current prescription drug patent system is \nbroken, and I am extremely concerned that pharmaceutical companies may \nbe acting illegally to extend their patents and prevent less expensive \ngeneric drugs from entering the market. To fix it, we need to eliminate \npatent loopholes that drug companies use to prevent price competition \nfrom generic alternative drugs.\n  We need to strengthen existing statutes, including antitrust laws. We \nneed to stop drug company abuses that prevent generic competition and \nlower prices, stop illegitimate patent ``evergreening,'' and stop \nanticompetitive sweetheart deals between brand name and generic \ncompanies.\n  I am pleased that the underlying bill we are considering would get \nlower-priced generics on the market faster, especially since we know \nthat prescription drug expenditures are the fastest growing segment of \nthe health care market, with spending on outpatient prescription drugs \nin the U.S. increasing by 17 percent over last year. It is absolutely \nincredible that outpatient drug expenditures have more than doubled in \nthe last five years.\n  Drug expenditures in the United States rose from about $5.5 billion \nin 1970 to a projected $161 billion this year, and CMS predicts that \nprescription drug expenditures will continue to increase faster than \nany other category of health care spending throughout the next ten \nyears. Medicare beneficiaries alone will spend $1.5 trillion on \nprescription drugs over the next ten years.\n  Those two factors, great dependency on drug therapies and \nskyrocketing drug prices, put us on a collision course in our efforts \nto provide affordable health care.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are concerned that the money isn't \nthere for this benefit, and I, too, have no doubt that a new benefit \nwill be extremely expensive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat the original Graham amendment will cost $576 billion over 10 \nyears, and it spends about $85 billion a year by the end of the decade.\n  This new spending is in addition to the fact that the Medicare budget \nwill reach at least $498 billion by 2012, and will begin spending out \nmore than it brings in by 2016. Sustainable financing of the Medicare \nprogram is a looming problem that must be addressed.\n  But while we discuss the potential cost of a new benefit, we also \nneed to discuss national priorities. I believe we can do a prescription \ndrug benefit while living within our budget, and we can do so by having \na clear vision for our country's priorities. One of my top priorities \nis getting a new prescription drug benefit to the Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Washington state. But this may mean making other tough \nchoices.\n  There is no doubt that if we interject all of these issues into the \npolitical debate surrounding the need to provide Medicare coverage of \nprescription drugs for our elderly and disabled, we have a debate to be \nrivaled by few others.\n  But the reality is that the Senate needs to move past the argument of \nwhether or not to include prescription drugs in the Medicare program. \nWe know there is a problem, and it is up to us to find a solution.\n  Congress is trying to take a reasoned and rational approach to \nintegrating a new prescription drug benefit into the Medicare program.\n  I strongly believe that we need to include a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare program and I will continue to fight to ensure \nthat all Washingtonians have access to the prescription medications \nthey need.\n  Finally, I want to briefly address the geographic disparities in \nMedicare provider payments. I am especially concerned that providers \nserving a disproportionate number of Medicare and Medicaid patients are \nfacing unsustainable fee reductions.\n  Every day I hear from my constituents that they are facing increasing \ndifficulty in getting primary care services, and from physicians who \ncan no longer afford to take on new Medicare patients. In fact, 57 \npercent of Washington state physicians are limiting the number or \ndropping all Medicare patients from their practices.\n  We absolutely must ensure that Medicare providers, hospitals, \nphysicians, home health agencies, physical therapists, nursing homes, \nare paid enough to cover the cost of providing care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I certainly hope that the Finance Committee, working \nwith the Leadership on both sides, will pass a reimbursement package \nbefore we adjourn the 107th Congress. It will do us little good to \nprovide a new Medicare benefit if there are no physicians willing or \navailable to write prescriptions for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act, GAAP, provides a real opportunity to benefit all \nconsumers of prescription drugs. In the recently concluded study of the \nabuses of the Hatch-Waxman act, the Federal Trade Commission concluded \nthat there is a need for Congress to act and to act quickly to end the \nexploitation of loopholes in current law that has delayed the entry of \ngeneric drugs into the market. S. 812 would allow consumers earlier \naccess to generic versions of drugs while protecting the intellectual \nproperty rights of the brand name drug innovators--a protection that is \nnecessary for their continued investment in research and development of \nnew and improved pharmaceuticals.\n  S. 812 would accomplish five important objectives. First, the bill \nwould limit the ability of brand name drug companies to delay the \nmarketing of generic competitors. It does this by limiting brand name \ndrug companies to only one automatic 30-month stay. Under current law, \nbrand name drug companies can prevent generic substitutes from coming \nto market by suing the generics for patent infringement, thus \ntriggering an automatic stay of up to 30 months on the FDA's approval \nof the generic drug. By bringing successive patent infringement suits, \nbrand name drug companies have obtained sequential stays, and kept \ngenerics off the market much longer than 30 months.\n  Allowing for only one automatic delay is consistent with the FTC's \nrecent recommendations. In its report, the FTC recommended that only \none stay be allowed, and noted that: prior to 1998, only 1 out of 9 \nblockbuster drugs products involved at least three patent lawsuits, \nwhereas after 1998, 5 of the 8 blockbuster products involved at least \nthree lawsuits. . . .\n  [C]ases involving multiple patents take longer than those involving \nfewer patents [to resolve] the FTC wrote, and the Commission found that \nthe multiple stacking of automatic stays delayed the approval of \ngeneric drug applications from between 4 and 40 months beyond the \ninitial 30-month period.\n  There is no doubt that these stays have cost consumers enormous sums \nof money by preventing their access to cheaper generic versions of \ndrugs. Allowing for one 30-month stay, as S. 812 does, strikes a \nbalance between the rights of brand name drug companies seeking to \nprotect their legitimate patents, and the rights of consumers to access \ngeneric drugs without unreasonable delay due to ``gaming'' of the \nsystem.\n  Second, the GAAP Act would modify the provision in current law that \nallows the first-to-file generic drug manufacturer an exclusive 180-day \nperiod to market its drug without competition from other generic \nmanufacturers. The 180-exclusivity period was intended to provide a \nneeded incentive for challenging dubious patents. Like the automatic \n30-month stay, however, this 180-day exclusivity has been abused. Brand \nname and generic drug companies have colluded in deals in which the \nbrand name manufacturer effectively extends its own period of \nexclusivity by paying the generic drug manufacturer to stay out of the \nmarket for the six months during which the generic would otherwise be \nable to compete. When this occurs, the brand name manufacturer wins, \nand the generic manufacturer wins, but consumers lose. To prevent this \ntype of abuse, S. 812 modifies current law so that first-to-file \ngeneric manufacturers that engage in anticompetitive conduct and do not \ngo to market, lose the privilege of the 6-month exclusivity in the \ngeneric market, and, in certain circumstances, that exclusivity \n``rolls'' over to the next generic competitor.\n  Third, the legislation would require generic drug applicants to the \nFDA to provide a more detailed ``paragraph\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nIV'' filing. This means that the patent holder will not only receive a \ngeneral notice that its patent is being challenged, but the generic \ndrug applicant will be required to provide a more detailed legal basis \nof its assertions regarding the original patent's validity. This is an \nimportant protection for the brand name manufacturers because they will \nreceive more information about the nature of the patent challenge as \nopposed to a simple notice that a generic application has been filed.\n  Fourth, S. 812 would clarify that the FDA's existing regulations as \nthey pertain to bioequivalence have the effect of law. Currently, bio-\nequivalence is demonstrated through blood level studies, and only in \nsome circumstances has the FDA allowed for limited human data to be \nsubmitted for products where blood studies are inapplicable. S. 812 \nwould allow the FDA to amend its regulations as necessary and clarify \nits authority over biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act.\n  The fifth significant change to current law relates to how to clean \nup abuses of the ``Orange Book'', the manual in which the FDA lists all \npatents on pharmaceutical drugs. S. 812 allows generic manufacturers in \ncertain instances to bring a cause of action to ``de-list'' or \n``rename'' a drug patent. Current law provides no means for \n``delisting'' a patent, although doing so can speed the marketing of \ngeneric drugs, particularly in cases involving patents that are \npatently frivolous and for which the brand name manufacturers clearly \nwould not win a patent infringement suit. While purging the Orange Book \nof frivolous patents is important, I understand that some Senators are \nconcerned that the new cause of action to ``delist'' will not speed the \navailability of generic drugs, but will lead to a snarl of litigation. \nI hope these concerns can be reviewed in conference.\n  Over twenty years ago, Hatch-Waxman established the procedures for \nbringing generic drugs to consumers and set out to strike a balance \nthat would allow drug innovators to protect their innovations, while \nallowing generic drugs easier access into the market. In large part, \nHatch-Waxman succeeded in bringing new lower-cost alternatives to \nconsumers, and encouraging more investment in U.S. pharmaceutical \nresearch and development. This has been evident in the years since the \nenactment of Hatch-Waxman, where research and development has increased \nfrom $3 billion to $21 billion. Loopholes in the law, however, have \ndelayed benefits to consumers. It is time to close them.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, recently released results of \nits estimate of S. 812, finding that total drug expenditures in this \ncountry over the next ten years, 203 to 2012, will be roughly $4.7 \ntrillion. If the delays resulting from numerous lawsuits and agreements \nthat arise under current law were eliminated, the CBO estimates that S. \n812 would result in a savings of up to 7 percent, or $320 billion. For \nconsumers, particularly seniors, the uninsured, and those on Medicare, \nthis is a tremendous savings.\n  Congress will improve the lives of many Americans by passing the \nunderlying language of S. 812. I urge my colleagues to do this now.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'd like to say a few words about the \nHatch-Waxman provisions that were contained in S. 812 that passed this \nmorning. Ensuring access to affordable prescription drugs is a top \npriority for me. The challenge is to strike the right balance so \nconsumers have timely access to medicine that's affordable and so that \nnew, groundbreaking pharmaceuticals continue to be developed. I voted \nfor S. 812 because I want Iowans and all Americans to benefit as much \nas possible from the competition and lower prices that generic drugs \nbring about in the marketplace. This bill starts to close loopholes in \nthe current Hatch-Waxman law and stop abuses that may have contributed \nto the delay in market entry to generic drugs and kept drug prices \nhigh. I believe that this is a good first step toward recognizing and \naddressing concerns about abuses in the current system. However, I \nstill have concerns about the drafting of a few of the provisions in \nthis legislation.\n  For example, I'm concerned abut the new private right of action \ncreated by S. 812. The current Hatch-Waxman law does not allow for such \na remedy, and this could cause unnecessary and increased litigation. I \nalso share the concerns that Senator Frist expressed regarding the \nbioequivalency provision. I think that we need to clarify that this \nprovision should in no way adversely impact or lessen public safety. \nFurther, I think that we should clarify that the provision dealing with \nthe 45 day paragraph IV notice does not eliminate all legal avenues \nwith respect to a company being able to protect it's rights with \nrespect to a patent. There might be a few other changes that would be \nbeneficial to the bill. Nevertheless, I'm hopeful that we can improve \non this legislation. We need to be able to close the loopholes, but \nalso ensure that we keep the proper balance between promoting timely \naccess to affordable generic drugs and giving brand-name companies \nreasonable intellectual property protections so they will continue to \ninnovate and find new cures and drugs.\n  I was disappointed that the Senate was not able to consider an \namendment I wanted to offer with Senator Leahy which would have \nrequired brand-name and generic companies to file with the Federal \nTrade Commission and Justice Department any agreements that deal with \nthe 180 day exclusivity provision of the Hatch-Waxman law. The language \nof our amendment is exactly the language contained in S. 754, as \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee last November. So everyone \nknows, this legislation is fully supported by the Federal Trade \nCommission report that came out just yesterday. In fact, the Federal \nTrade Commission report said ``we believe that notification of such \nagreements to the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of \nJustice is warranted. We support the Drug Competition Act of 2001, S. \n754, introduced by Senator Leahy, as reported by the Committee on the \nJudiciary.'' I'm putting my colleagues on notice that I will work to \nget this legislation passed to ensure that lower price drugs get to \nmarket as soon as possible.\n  I want Iowans to benefit from new scientific research and innovative \ndrug products. Patent protections help provide incentives for these \ndevelopments. With the practice of medicine today being so dependent on \nprescription drugs and with a new, taxpayer-financed prescription drug \nbenefit on the horizon, I'll continue to work to make sure Congress \nmaintains the right balance between patent protection and access to \ngeneric drugs.\n  Mr. McCain. I would like to take the opportunity to talk about the \nunderlying bill, S. 812, which, until now, has been largely treated in \nthis two week debate as little more than a vehicle for a grander, more \npolitically salient, but also more elusive, prescription drug benefit.\n  If the Senate fails to pass the underlying bill, the Greater Access \nto Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, GAAP, will lose a real opportunity \nto benefit all consumers of prescription drugs. In a recently concluded \nstudy of the abuses of the Hatch-Waxman act, the Federal Trade \nCommission concluded that there is a need for Congress to act and to \nact quickly to put an end to the anti-competitive abuses that have \ndelayed the entry of generic drugs into the market. S. 812 would allow \nconsumers earlier access to generic versions of drugs while protecting \nthe intellectual property rights of the brand name drug innovators, a \nprotection that's necessary for their continued investment in research \nand development of new and improved pharmaceuticals.\n  While the brand name drug manufacturers have decried this bill, which \nhas been portrayed by some as a boon to generic drug makers, I assure \nyou that these portrayals are not accurate. The consumer is the \nintended beneficiary of this legislation, plain and simple.\n  S. 812 would accomplish five important objectives. First, the bill \nwould limits the ability of brand name drug companies to delay the \nmarketing of generic competitors. It does this by limiting brand name \ndrug companies to only one automatic 30-month stay on the marketing of \ngeneric drugs. Under current law, brand name drug companies can prevent \ngeneric substitutes from coming to market by suing the generic for \npatent infringement and in\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nso doing, stop the FDA, for up to 30 months, from approving the cheaper \nsubstitute. By bringing successive patent infringement suits, brand \nname drug companies have obtained sequential 30-month stays, and kept \ngenerics off the market much longer than 30 months.\n  Allowing for only one automatic delay is consistent with the \nrecommendation the Federal Trade Commission made recently in its \ncomprehensive study of anticompetitive abuses of current law by brand \nname and generic drug companies. In its report, the FTC recommended \nthat only one stay be allowed, and noted that ``prior to 1998, only 1 \nout of 9 blockbuster drug products involved at least three patent \nlawsuits, whereas after 1998, 5 of the 8 blockbuster products involved \nat least three lawsuits.'' ``[C]ases involving multiple patents take \nlonger than those involving fewer patents [to resolve]'' the FTC wrote, \nand the Commission found that the multiple stacking of 30-month stays \nprevented the FDA from approving generic ANDAs from 4 to 40 months \nbeyond the initial 30-month stay.\n  There is no doubt that these stays have prevented or delayed generic \ndrugs from entering the marketplace and increased the price of \nprescription drugs. Allowing for one 30-month stay, as S. 812 does, \nstrikes a balance between the rights of brand name drug companies \nseeking to protect their legitimate patents, and the rights of \nconsumers to access generic drugs without unreasonable delay due to \n``gaming'' of the system. I understand that there is disagreement \nregarding which patents should be afforded protection under the \nautomatic stay, however, I believe we can all acknowledge that allowing \nfor one, and only one stay, is the most effective way to prevent \nfrivolous lawsuits that delay consumers' access to less expensive \npharmaceuticals.\n\n  Second, the GAAP Act would modify the provision in current law that \nallows the first-to-file generic drug manufacturer an exclusive 180-day \nperiod to market its generic drug without competition from other \ngeneric manufacturers. The 180-exclusivity period was intended to \nprovide a needed impetus for generic companies to challenge dubious \npatents. Like the automatic 30-month stay, however, this 180-day \nexclusivity has been abused. Brand name and generic drug companies have \ncolluded in deals in which the brand name manufacturer effectively \nextends its own period of exclusivity by paying the generic drug \nmanufacturer to stay out of the market for the six months during which \nthe generic would otherwise be able to compete. When this occurs, the \nbrand name manufacturer wins, and the generic manufacturer wins, but \nconsumers lose. To prevent this type of abuse, S. 812 modifies current \nlaw so that first-to-file generic manufacturers that engage in \nanticompetitive conduct and do not go to market, lose the privilege of \n6-month exclusivity in the generic market, and, in certain \ncircumstances, that exclusivity ``rolls'' over to the next generic \ncompetitor.\n  Third, the legislation would require generic drug applicants to the \nFDA to provide a more detailed ``paragraph IV'' filing. This means that \nthe patent holder will not only receive a general notice that its \npatent is being challenged, but the generic drug applicant will be \nrequired to provide a more detailed legal basis for its assertions \nregarding the original patent's validity. This is an important \nprotection for the brand name manufacturers because they will receive \nmore information about the nature of the patent challenge as opposed to \na simple notice that a generic application has been filed.\n  Fourth, S. 812 would clarify that the FDA's existing regulations as \nthey pertain to bio-equivalence have the affect of law. Currently, bio-\nequivalence is demonstrated through blood level studies, and only in \nsome circumstances has the FDA allowed for limited human data to be \nsubmitted for products where blood studies are inapplicable. S. 812 \nwould allow the FDA to amend their regulations as necessary and clarify \ntheir authority over biological products under the Federal Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act.\n  The fifth significant change to current law relates to how to clean \nup abuses of the ``Orange Book'', the manual in which the FDA lists all \npatents on pharmaceutical drugs. The provision in the current bill, \nallows generic manufacturers in certain instances to bring a cause of \naction to ``de-list'' or ``re-name'' a drug patent. Current law \nprovides no means for ``delisting'' a patent, although doing so can \nspeed the marketing of generic drugs, particularly in cases involving \npatents that are patently frivolous and for which the brand name \nmanufacturers clearly would not win a patent infringement suit.\n  The cause of action for generic manufacturers to ``delist'' patents \nwas a provision that was added to S. 812 late in the process, and it is \ncontroversial. Opponents argue that doing so will significantly \nincrease and complicate litigation without clearly making generic drugs \navailable to consumers more quickly. How the cause of action in S. 812 \nwill work is yet unclear. I hope that during conference on this \nlegislation, we can consider not only the provision in the Senate bill, \nbut also the proposal mentioned in the FTC's recent report to permit a \nclaim for ``delisting'' to be brought, not as an original and separate \naction, but as a counterclaim in the context of a patent infringement \nlawsuit. Such an approach may be more appropriate in that it could \nreduce the number of lawsuits, but still allow generic manufacturers a \nway to ``delist'' frivolous patents through summary judgments or other \nmotions that can be raised in the context of patent infringement \nlitigation.\n\n  Over twenty years ago, Hatch-Waxman establishes the procedures for \nbringing generic drugs to consumers and set out to strike a balance in \nthe pharmaceutical industry that would allow brand name manufacturers \nto protect their innovations, while allowing generic brands easier \naccess into the market. In large part, Hatch-Waxman succeeded in \nbringing new lower-cost alternatives to consumers, and encouraging more \ninvestment in U.S. pharmaceutical research and development. This has \nbeen evident in the 15 years since the enactment of Hatch-Waxman, where \nresearch and development has increased from $3 billion to $21 billion. \nLoopholes in the law, however, have delayed benefits to consumers. It \nis time to correct this.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, recently released results of \nits estimate of S. 812 finding that total drug expenditures in this \ncountry over the next ten years (2003 to 2012) will be roughly $4.7 \ntrillion. If the delays resulting from numerous lawsuits and agreements \nwere eliminated, the CBO estimates that S. 812 would result in a \nsavings of up to 7 percent or $320 billion. For consumers, particularly \nseniors, the uninsured, and those on Medicare, this is a tremendous \nsavings.\n  Congress will improve the lives of many Americans by passing the \nunderlying language of S. 812. I urge my colleagues to do this now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that at the very last \nmoment, the acceptance of the Drug Competition Act of 2001 as an \namendment to ``The Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act,'' \nS. 812 was withdrawn. This bill, which enjoys the justified support of \nthe administration's antitrust enforcement agencies, would have brought \nlower-priced generic drugs to the marketplace. Along with Senator \nGrassley, I have every confidence that this bill would have garnered \nthe overwhelming support of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand would have benefitted every American purchasing prescription drugs, \nand am mystified by the reversal of the agreement to accept it. I thank \nSenator Grassley and Senator Kennedy for their support.\n  Prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing, and are a source of \nconsiderable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and \nfamilies. Generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than \nthe comparable brand name version. S. 812 is a tremendous effort to \nimprove timely introduction of generic pharmaceuticals into the \nmarketplace, and into our medicine cabinets, and our amendment will \nprovide an important tool in making that effort successful.\n  While the Drug Competition Act is a small bill in terms of length, it \nis a large one in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement \nagencies can take quick and decisive action against companies that are \ndriven more by greed than by good sense. It gives the\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nFederal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to \ninformation about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic \ndrugs off the market. This is a practice that hurts American families, \nparticularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost \ngeneric drugs, and further inflating medical costs.\n  This had been a genuine bipartisan effort, and I must thank all my \ncolleagues, including Senator Hatch who has a long-standing interest in \nthese issues and who has praised S. 754 on the floor in recent days. \nAlso, sub-committee Chairman Kohl has worked with me from the start on \nthis effort, and I particularly want to thank our co-sponsor Senator \nGrassley, who has worked hard to reach consensus on this bill that will \nhelp protect consumers. This bill passed unanimously out of the \nJudiciary Committee last October, but it has been the subject of an \nanonymous hold on the floor, presumably unrelated to the merits. \nPartisan politics should not further delay enactment of this sensible, \nand universally applauded, bill into law.\n  In fact, just yesterday the FTC released its long-awaited report on \nthe entry of generic drugs into the pharmaceutical marketplace. The FTC \nhad two recommendations to improve the current situation, to close the \nloopholes in the law that allow drug manufacturers to manipulate the \ntiming of generics' introduction to the market. One of those \nrecommendations was simply to enact S. 754, as the most effective \nsolution to the problem of ``sweetheart'' deals between brand name and \ngeneric drug manufacturers that keep generic drugs off the market, thus \ndepriving consumers of the benefits of quality drugs at lower prices. \nIn short, this bill enjoys the unqualified endorsement of the \nRepublican FTC, which follows on the support by the Clinton \nAdministration's FTC during the initial stages of our formulation of \nthis bill. We can all have every confidence in the common sense \napproach that S. 754 takes to ensuring that our law enforcement \nagencies have the information they need to take quick action, if \nnecessary, to protect consumers from drug companies that abuse the law.\n  The issue of drug companies paying generic companies not to compete \nwas exposed last year by the FTC, and by articles in major newspapers, \nincluding an editorial in the July 26, 2000, The New York Times, titled \n``Driving Up Drug Prices.'' This editorial concluded that the problem \n``needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.'' And \nwhile the FTC has sued pharmaceutical companies that have made such \nsecret and anticompetitive deals, as the then Director of the Bureau of \nCompetition Molly Boast testified before the Judiciary Committee in May \n2001, the antitrust enforcement agencies are only finding out about \nsuch deals by luck, or by accident.\n  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets \npermission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name \ndrug expires, enjoys protection from competition for 180 days, a head \nstart on other generic companies. That was a good idea, but the \nunfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be \nmade that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-\nday grace period, to block other generic drugs from entering the \nmarket, while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name \nmanufacturer to not sell the generic drug.\n  The bill would have closed this loophole for those who want to cheat \nthe public, but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true \ncompetition. The deals would be reviewed only by those agencies--the \nagreements would not be available to the public. I think it is \nimportant for Congress not to overreact in this case and throw out the \ngood with the bad. Most generic companies want to take advantage of \nthis 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs at much lower \ncosts for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive for them. \nInstead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every deal that \ncould lead to abuse, so that only the deals that are consistent with \nthe intent of that law will be allowed to stand.\n  This bill would have accomplished precisely that goal. Moreover, it \nfits neatly into S. 812's provisions requiring a generic drug company \nthat has been granted the exclusive, 180-day period on the market to \nforfeit that privilege if it makes a deal with a brand name company, or \notherwise delays bringing its generic drug into the marketplace. Such a \ngeneric company must relinquish that 180-day privilege to the next \ngeneric manufacturer that can come to market. Both S. 812 and S. 754 \nshare the goal of ensuring effective and timely access to generic \npharmaceuticals that can lower the cost of prescription drugs for \nseniors, for families, and for all of us.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate was \nunable to pass the Graham-Miller-Kennedy amendment last week, as it \nwould have established a comprehensive prescription drug benefit for \nour Nation's seniors. I strongly supported the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \nplan, as I believe it offered the best solution to the problem our \nsenior citizens face in finding a way to afford the prescription drugs \nthey need to stay healthy. Given the failure of the Senate to pass the \nGraham-Miller-Kennedy amendment, which I voted for, I now lend my \nsupport to the low-income, catastrophic benefit proposal that has been \noffered by my colleagues, Senators Bob Graham and Gordon Smith. While I \nwould rather the Senate take a stand in support of a more comprehensive \nbenefit, the Graham-Smith amendment marks an important first step in \nmaking sure that our country delivers on the promise that Medicare made \nto our Nation's seniors almost 30 years ago.\n  Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the leadership of President \nLyndon Johnson, as a promise to the American people that, in exchange \nfor their years of hard work and service to our country, their health \ncare would be protected in their golden years. But that promise has not \nbeen fulfilled. Across our country, millions of seniors have cried out \nfor help in paying for their prescription medication. Too many of our \nparents and grandparents confess that they are unable to afford the \ndrugs their doctors prescribe for them. Too many of our parents and \ngrandparents have to choose between paying for their rent, getting \ntheir groceries or buying the medicine they need to stay healthy.\n  Prescription drug expenditures are skyrocketing--with the drug prices \nfacing seniors growing at four times the rate of inflation. These costs \nare forcing our Nation's elders to pile into buses, and travel into \nCanada and Mexico where they can purchase the medicine they need for 30 \npercent less of the cost in the United States. These costs are driving \nAmericans across our borders to obtain the prescription medications our \nvery own pharmaceutical companies have developed here at home.\n  I appreciate the biotechnology revolution being driven publicly, by \nthe National Institutes of Health, and privately, by the pharmaceutical \nindustry. The advancements in modern medicine are truly spectacular, \nand many of the most inspiring discoveries are being made by \nbiotechnology companies in my own State of Massachusetts. I am proud of \nthe work being done in my state and across the country. With continued \ninvestment in research, scientists predict that we may be 5 to 10 years \naway from major breakthroughs in medical treatment for diseases like \nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's. But I ask, of what consequence are medical \ndiscoveries if they never leave the laboratory or move beyond the shelf \nof a local pharmacy?\n  The Graham-Smith amendment will help move those medications from \npharmacy shelves into the hands of the seniors whose lives depend on \nthem. Graham-Smith offers all seniors protection against high drug \nbills, establishing Medicare coverage of all drug costs incurred over \n$3,300. In addition to catastrophic coverage, the Graham-Smith proposal \nwill provide every senior, regardless of income, up to a 30 percent \ndiscount on drugs purchased before they reach the $3,300 stop-loss. For \nlow-income seniors, the Graham-Smith plan provides special assistance, \ncovering all drug costs for those beneficiaries below 200 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level.\n  The Graham-Smith amendment will provide protection to all seniors \nagainst the high cost of prescription drugs. It is not the ideal \nsolution, but it targets the seniors who need help the most. The \nsickest seniors will be protected from out-of-control costs, which\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\nevery senior needs as insurance against a serious illness. Seniors with \nlow incomes are guaranteed the drugs they need so they don't have to \nchoose between prescription drugs and other necessities. This amendment \nprovides a solid first step toward the goal of providing a \ncomprehensive, reliable Medicare prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Graham-Smith \namendment. But let us not abandon our goal of establishing a more \ncomplete prescription drug benefit. Graham-Smith is a good first step, \nbut we must continue the journey. Unless we establish a comprehensive \nMedicare drug benefit, the health of an entire generation will continue \nto be in jeopardy. We must act to deliver on that promise that \nPresident Johnson made 25 years ago. Our Nation's seniors deserve no \nless.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am disappointed that after nearly three \nweeks of debate, the Senate has been unable to pass a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors. Millions of senior citizens across the country \ndesperately need this help.\n  In California alone there are nearly 3.8 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries. According to the most recent estimates, 684,000 of those \nCalifornians have no prescription drug coverage. Unsurprisingly, low-\nincome California seniors make up the majority of those currently \nsuffering. However, this is an issue that cuts across socioeconomic \nlines to affect all seniors, throughout my State and throughout the \nNation.\n  It is easy to listen to numbers and forget that there are faces \nbehind those numbers--real people with real health care problems. But \nthat is precisely why this debate is so important. There are seniors in \nthis country who are being gouged by the prices of prescription drugs, \nwho are choosing to skip doses to make their drugs last, and who are \nholding off as long as possible before they fill their prescriptions \nbecause they simply can't afford it. This is a travesty, and one that \nwe must address.\n  We had a tremendous opportunity to address this situation and to \nprovide seniors with a comprehensive prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare. I supported a proposal to provide a voluntary, affordable \nprescription drug benefit for all seniors under Medicare, with special \nassistance to those with low incomes. This proposal would provide a \nreliable benefit for the people who spend the most on drugs and who, in \nmany cases, can least afford it: senior citizens. Unfortunately, \nbecause of opposition from the other side of the aisle, that effort \nfailed.\n  Fortunately, all is not lost. While we were unable to make \nprescription drugs more accessible to seniors, I am pleased that we \nwere able to take steps to make prescription drugs more affordable for \neveryone.\n  I supported--and we passed--a provision that will allow drug \nreimportation from Canada. In Canada, the exact same drugs often cost \none-third the price. However, pharmacies in this country are not \ncurrently allowed to buy drugs in Canada to sell in the United States, \nwhich would pass these savings on to consumers. That should change as \nlong as those drugs meet strict safety standards before entering our \ncountry. This provision will allow that to happen.\n  I supported--and we passed--a provision that will allow states to \nnegotiate lower drug prices for all of their citizens who currently \nlack prescription drug benefits. States currently negotiate drug prices \nfor their Medicaid recipients, the poorest of our Nation's citizens. \nThis provision will give States an even larger market power to ensure \neven deeper discounts for all residents who lack prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Finally, I supported--and we passed--a proposal to close the \nloopholes that currently allow brand-name drug companies to keep \ngeneric drugs off the market, even after the original patent on the \ndrug has expired. Bringing generics to market ensures greater \ncompetition and ultimately reduces prices. This should not be unfairly \nstalled by brand-name companies that want to maintain their monopoly on \nthe market.\n  These are all important ways in which we will be able to bring the \ncosts of drugs down for all Americans, young and old, rich and poor. We \nmust provide seniors with a true Medicare prescription drug benefit, so \nthat they are no longer forced to choose between drugs and food or \nrent. We may not have succeeded today, but I will keep fighting to see \nit happen in the very near future.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Greater \nAccess to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act, which will make prescription \ndrugs more affordable by promoting more competition in the \npharmaceutical industry and increasing access to lower priced generic \ndrugs.\n  I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with my colleague, \nthe Senator from North Carolina, in offering this compromise in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where it was approved \nby a strong bipartisan vote. I also recognize the leadership and hard \nwork of the Senators from New York and Arizona on this critical issue.\n  Prescription drug spending in the United States has increased by 92 \npercent over the past 5 years to almost $120 billion. These soaring \ncosts are a particular burden for the millions of uninsured Americans, \nas well as for those seniors on Medicare who lack prescription drug \ncoverage. Many of these individuals are simply priced out of the market \nor forced to choose between paying the bills or buying the pills they \nneed to remain healthy.\n  Skyrocketing prescription drug costs are also putting the squeeze on \nour Nation's employers who are struggling in the face of double-digit \nincreases in their insurance premiums. They are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to continue to provide health care coverage for their \nemployees.\n  Soaring costs are also exacerbating the Medicaid funding crisis that \nall of us are hearing about from our Governors back home who are \nstruggling to bridge shortfalls in the States' budgets.\n  In 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Act made significant changes in our patent \nlaws that were intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make \nthe investments necessary to develop new drug products while \nsimultaneously enabling their competitors to bring lower cost, generic \nequivalents to the market. We should acknowledge that, to a large \nextent, the original Hatch-Waxman Act succeeded. The law has speeded \naccess to generic drugs in the market. As a consequence, consumers are \nsaving anywhere between $8 and $10 billion a year by purchasing lower \npriced generic drugs.\n  Moreover, there are even greater potential savings on the horizon. \nWithin the next 4 years, the patents on brand name drugs with combined \nsales of $20 billion are set to expire. If Hatch-Waxman were to work as \nit was intended, consumers could expect to save between 50 and 60 \npercent on these drugs as lower-cost generic alternatives becomes \navailable after these patents expire.\n  But despite the past successes of this law, it has become \nincreasingly evident that the Hatch-Waxman Act has been subject to \nabuse. While many pharmaceutical companies have acted in good faith, \nthere is mounting evidence that others have attempted to game the \nsystem by exploiting legal loopholes in the current law. The result is, \ntoo many pharmaceutical companies have maximized their profits at the \nexpense of consumers by filing frivolous lawsuits that have delayed \naccess to lower priced generic drugs.\n  Just yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission released its long-\nawaited study that found that brand name drug manufacturers have, \nindeed, misused the law to delay the entry of lower cost generics into \nthe market. The FTC found that these tactics have led to delays of \nbetween 4 and 40 months--over and above the first 30-month stay \nprovided under Hatch-Waxman--for generic competitors of at least eight \ndrugs--eight very popular drugs--since 1992. Moreover, six of these \neight delays have occurred since 1998.\n  The FTC report identifies two specific provisions of the current \nlaw--the automatic 30-month stay and the 180-day market exclusivity \nprovision--as being susceptible to challenges and strategies that delay \nthe entry of lower cost generic alternatives into the market. According \nto the FTC report, these loopholes ``continue to have the potential for \nabuse'' and, if left unchanged, ``may have [even] more significance \n[for consumers] in the future.'' I am pleased to say that these\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\nare the very loopholes that our bill would close.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that our legislation would \ncut our Nation's drug costs by an astounding $60 billion over the next \n10 years. It is no wonder that our proposal is supported by coalitions \nrepresenting the Governors, employers, insurers, organized labor, \nseniors groups, and individual consumers who are footing the bill for \nthese expensive drugs and whose costs for many popular drugs could be \ncut in half if generic alternatives were more readily available.\n  I would like to pause for a moment to discuss some of the details of \nthe underlying Edwards-Collins bill. Some of my colleagues have argued \nthat certain provisions of the bill are unconstitutional or that the \nbill will lead to more litigation. But no amendments have been offered \nto change any of the provisions of the Edwards-Collins bill. Moreover, \nthe bill itself is the product of months of work and represents a \nbroad, bipartisan compromise that incorporates the views and concerns \nof a wide spectrum of interests.\n  I worked particularly hard on carefully wording the cause of action \ncreated by the bill, and believe that criticisms of it spurring \nincreased litigation are not well-founded. Our bill creates a new civil \naction that offers a remedy if companies incorrectly or frivolously \nlisted patents in the Orange Book, so that these patents do not delay \nthe ability of a generic drug to come to market. The bottom line is, \nthe cause of action will help to reduce both the cost of prescription \ndrugs and the cost of prescription drug litigation. It does so by \nallowing generic drug makers, for the first time, to directly challenge \na patent that has been frivolously or incorrectly listed.\n  I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues who are leery of \ncreating new causes of action. But I would reply that, in many cases, \nlitigating through narrowly-targeted suits can be quicker and less \nexpensive than aggregating a number of claims in one, massive \nproceeding. Moreover, I have worked to target the new provision as \ncarefully as possible. In Committee, I offered a common sense amendment \nto tailor the new cause of action in a way that will help minimize \nunintended consequences while, at the same time, ensuring that it still \nserves its intended purpose of policing frivolous or incorrectly listed \npatents. My amendment made it clear that the delisting cause of action \nis for injunctive relief only and cannot result in monetary damages. It \nalso limited the new cause of actions to patents listed in the Orange \nBook up to 30 days after a New Drug Application's approval. In doing \nso, my amendment harmonized the 30-month stay provision and the cause \nof action, as it should be.\n  The original Hatch-Waxman Act was a carefully constructed compromise \nthat balanced an expedited FDA approval process to speed the entry of \nlower cost generic drugs into the market with additional patent \nprotections to ensure continuing innovation that brings us these \nwonderful lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs.\n  The bipartisan compromise bill before us restores that balance by \nclosing the loopholes that have reduced the original law's intent and \nits effectiveness in bringing lower cost generic drugs to market more \nquickly. I am very pleased we are going to pass this legislation. It \nreally will make a difference for millions of Americans who are \nstruggling to afford the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from various \ngroups that are supporting this legislation and worked very closely \nwith us in drafting it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Business for\n\n\n                                          Affordable Medicine,\n\n                                     Washington, DC July 23, 2002.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     US Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Business for Affordable Medicine \n     coalition encourages you to vote for the Hatch-Waxman reform \n     measures in S. 812. By closing loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman \n     Act, Congress will ensure that more affordable prescription \n     drugs reach the market without delays, which will provide \n     prescription drug purchasers with significant cost savings.\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that closing \n     Hatch-Waxman loopholes would reduce the nation's drug costs \n     by $60 billion over the next 10 years. Preventing delays in \n     the availability of generics would also reduce federal \n     spending for prescription drugs by $6 billion while \n     increasing federal revenues by $2.2 billion.\n       Consumers and institutional purchasers (including \n     employers, and federal and state governments) can no longer \n     afford the anti-competitive practices that are made possible \n     by loopholes in the Hatch-Waxman Act.

We believe it is \n     critical that Congress act this year to pass legislation that \n     would eliminate barriers to generic drug entry into the \n     marketplace. This legislation would accomplish this long-\n     overdue need.\n       Prescription drug costs are increasing at double-digit \n     rates and clearly are unsustainable. Current pharmaceutical \n     cost trends are increasing premiums, raising copayments, \n     pressuring reductions in benefits, and undermining the \n     ability of businesses to compete. We believe that a major \n     contributor to the pharmaceutical cost crisis is the use of \n     the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of \n     1984 in ways clearly unanticipated by Congress and which \n     effectively block generic entry into the marketplace. The \n     repeated use of the 30-month generic drug marketing \n     prohibition provision and other legal barriers have resulted \n     in increasingly unpredictable and unaffordable pharmaceutical \n     cost increases.\n       Although the legislation as reported out of the Senate HELP \n     Committee does not totally eliminate the 30-month marketing \n     prohibition provision, as would be our preference, it does \n     make important process changes that will lead to a more \n     predictable, rational pharmaceutical marketplace. We \n     recognize that compromises were necessary to garner the \n     support of a bipartisan majority of the Members of the \n     Committee. However, we would strongly oppose any additional \n     amendments that would undermine the intent of this \n     legislation by further delaying generic access or reducing \n     competition and increasing costs to purchasers. We also \n     remain opposed to legislation that would increase costs to \n     purchasers either through extended monopolies or unnecessary \n     and costly litigation.\n       We are convinced that the legislation currently pending \n     before the full Senate will make a major difference in \n     increasing competition in the marketplace and enhancing \n     access to more affordable, high quality prescription drugs. \n     We look forward to working with you and other Members of the \n     Senate to ensure that this important legislation is enacted \n     this year.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Coalition for a Competitive\n\n\n                                        Pharmaceutical Market,\n\n                                                    July 30, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: As a broad-based coalition of large \n     employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers, \n     insurers, and others, we are writing to urge you to vote for \n     cloture on the bipartisan Greater Access to Affordable \n     Pharmaceuticals Act (S. 812). We believe it is critical that \n     Congress act this year to pass legislation that would \n     eliminate barriers to generic drug entry into the \n     marketplace. This legislation would accomplish this key \n     policy objective.\n       Prescription drug costs continue to skyrocket--adversely \n     impacting consumers by increasing premiums, raising \n     copayments, pressuring reductions in benefits, and \n     undermining the ability of businesses to compete. We believe \n     that a major contributor to the pharmaceutical cost crisis is \n     the use of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act of 1984 in ways clearly unanticipated by \n     Congress and which effectively block entry of equivalent \n     generic drugs into the marketplace.\n       Today's report from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \n     supports the kind of reforms contained in S. 812. For \n     example, the report supports limiting the availability of the \n     automatic 30-month marketing prohibition to just one per \n     product, per generic drug application. It also recognizes the \n     value of\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\n     having a mechanism that would allow a generic company to \n     remove or correct the listing of a frivolous patent with the \n     FDA. According to the report, the lack of a mechanism to \n     delist an improperly listed patent ``may have real world \n     consequences'' given the FTC's knowledge of ``instances in \n     which a 30-month stay was generated solely by a patent that \n     raised legitimate listability questions.''\n       The Coalition believes that S. 812 makes important process \n     changes that will lead to a more predictable, rational \n     pharmaceutical marketplace. CCPM members would strongly \n     oppose any additional amendments that would undermine the \n     intent of this legislation by further delaying generic access \n     or reducing competition and increasing costs to purchasers. \n     We also remain opposed to legislation that would increase \n     costs to purchasers either through extended monopolies or \n     unnecessary and costly litigation.\n       We are convinced that the legislation currently pending \n     before the full Senate will make a major difference in \n     increasing competition in the marketplace and enhancing \n     access to more affordable, high quality prescription drugs. \n     We look forward to working with you and other Members of the \n     Senate to ensure that this important legislation is enacted \n     this year.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today is a day of profound disappointment \nto me. We have completed a debate on proposals to provide prescription \ndrug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, the most vulnerable sector of \nour population, and we have come up empty.\n  I applaud my colleagues for their earnestness and conscientiousness \nas this issue was discussed on the Senate floor, but earnestness and \nconscientiousness do not help the senior citizen who cannot afford to \npay for needed medications. I introduced a bill, the Prescription Drug \nBenefit Act of 2002, that would have provided an excellent benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries by adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare \nPart B with no new premiums or deductibles, and I still believe that \nshould be our goal. But at this point, we don't even have a consensus \nfor a first step toward a Medicare prescription drug plan for seniors.\n  Last week, I voted for the Graham-Miller plan, a comprehensive \napproach to this problem that, although not as good as my own bill, was \na worthy compromise. It was defeated. Today, I voted for the Graham-\nSmith plan that would at least offer us a starting point toward a \ncomprehensive prescription drug plan. It was defeated. I and all of my \ncolleagues who are concerned about the welfare of our seniors are \nregrouping with an eye toward taking another run at this critical \nproblem in the very near future.\n  The seniors and the disabled still need their life-saving \nmedications. They still have to pay large amounts out-of-pocket for \ndrugs, even though the legislation we passed today should help reduce \nthe overall cost of pharmaceuticals for everyone. The percentage of the \npopulation covered by Medicare is rising. Medical advances are leading \nto important new drugs for various diseases. Our nation's seniors \ncannot, and should not, be left behind in the race toward longer and \nhealthier lives. We have moved this debate forward, but it is far from \nover, and we will need to continue to be resourceful and persistent in \nthe future. The life and health of 40 million Americans hang in the \nbalance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support final passage of \nS. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act. I \ncosponsored this important legislation because I believe it will \nbenefit every American by ensuring that more affordable generic drugs \nget to market on time and lower costs for consumers as promised. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this bill will save American \nconsumers $60 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Prescription drug spending represents 9 percent of all health care \ncosts, but drug spending grew 17 percent in 2001--and it's the fastest \ngrowing part of health care. Generic drugs can cost one-quarter of the \nprice of their brand-name counterparts. In a time when health care \ncosts are soaring in the double-digits annually, that is no small \npoint.\n  The pharmaceutical industry enjoys the highest profit margins of any \nsector in the American economy. Drug companies argue that high retail \ncosts reflect the high cost of investment in research and development. \nI applaud the drug companies' efforts to find new lifesaving treatments \nand cures for patients and I do not argue with their right to make a \nhealthy profit from their work.\n  It is important to note that many of the gains in pharmaceutical \nresearch are made possible by the substantial, taxpayer-funded research \ninvestments of the National Institutes of Health and other Federal \ngrants. All Americans should have access to the benefits of that \nresearch, and they should expect that once a drug company has recouped \ntheir costs, made a healthy profit, and the patents surrounding their \ndrug expire, at that point consumers should benefit from generic \ncompetition that lowers drug prices.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, many drug companies have used \nloopholes in our patent laws to keep less expensive generic drugs off \nthe market. This raises health care costs for patients, employers and \nStates that are already struggling with rising health costs.\n  There are three major loopholes that this bill closes. First, it \nwould stop brand-name drug companies from filing endless, frivolous \npatents to keep a generic competitor off the market. These patents \noften border on the ridiculous, such as a patent on the color of the \npill. But ridiculous as it may seem, each of these patents triggers a \n30-month stay whereby the generic drug is kept off the market while the \nmatter goes to court. And drug companies have every incentive to do \nthis, after all, the cost of litigation is virtually nothing compared \nto the additional profits they can get by keeping their monopoly just a \nlittle longer. For example, the makers of the antidepressent Wellbutrin \nwere able to make another $1.3 billion during the 31 months they were \nin litigation with the generic company. And the makers of Prilosec \nearned another $1 billion in just 7 months of delayed generic \ncompetition.\n  This bill would also close another loophole by outlawing sweetheart \ndeals where a brand company pays a generic company to stay out of the \nmarket. In the case of Cardizem, which treats high blood pressure, the \nbrand-name company paid the generic company $90 million to stay out of \nthe market. Because the generic had won the right to have 180 days of \nmarket exclusivity before other generic competitors could enter the \nmarket, this sweetheart deal allowed the brand company to earn another \n$450 million before other generics could compete.\n  Finally, this bill puts some common sense back into the process by \nwhich brand companies list patents with the FDA in what is called the \nOrange Book. It enforces the law as it was originally intended by \nensuring that only patents that claim the drug product or the approved \nmethod of use are listed in the Orange Book. It also gives generic \ncompanies the ability to challenge patents that may have been listed \ninappropriately just to keep generics off the market longer.\n  I believe that this legislation preserves the original intent of the \nHatch-Waxman Act to balance the competing interests of the rights of \ninnovative drug companies and the rights of consumers to affordable \nmedicines. It preserves the ability of drug companies to invest in \nresearch and development to find lifesaving cures and treatments, but \nit also makes prescription drugs more affordable for all Americans by \ngetting generic drugs to the market on time. It also makes any Medicare \nprescription drug benefit we pass more affordable for seniors and \ntaxpayers.\n  This brings me to the real disappointment I have about the \nlegislation we are about to pass today. I am extremely disappointed \nthat the Senate was unable to also pass a real, comprehensive, \naffordable drug benefit within the Medicare Program. I am baffled by \nthe unwillingness of many on the other side of the aisle to work \ntogether to help our Nation's seniors with skyrocketing drug costs.\n  When Medicare was first created in 1965, prescription drugs were a \nvery small part of our health care system. But today, prescription \ndrugs are a critical part of that system, keeping people healthier and \nliving longer. Unfortunately, according to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation, 38 percent of our Nation's elderly have absolutely no \nprescription drug coverage at all. Many seniors who do have some \nprescription drug coverage find their plan inadequate and face large \nout-of-pocket costs. Too many seniors forgo needed medicines or are \nforced to choose between buying the medicine they need and buying food \nor paying rent.\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n  Seniors and the disabled on Medicare need a comprehensive, universal, \nvoluntary, affordable drug benefit, and that benefit should be part of \nthe Medicare program that we've relied upon since 1965. While the \nSenate considered many different plans, I voted for the Graham-Miller \napproach because it was the only plan that met those important goals. \nAnd it was the only plan before the Senate that guaranteed that all \nWisconsin senior citizens would have access to the medicines they need.\n  By contrast, I voted against the so-called ``tripartisan'' plan \nbecause it relied solely on HMOs to provide prescription drugs to \nseniors. This simply won't work in Wisconsin. In our State, because of \ninadequate Medicare reimbursement, we've already seen Medicare HMO \nplans leave every year and offer fewer benefits than in other States. \nThe tripartisan plan had the same Medicare reimbursement problems. \nThere was no guarantee that plans would participate in Wisconsin at \nall, and those plans that did participate could cover fewer drugs or \ncharge seniors more in Wisconsin than in other States.\n\n  In fact, the HMOs themselves have said they are reluctant to offer \nsuch plans. And even if they do, there is no guaranteed drug benefit, \nfrom year to year, HMOs could change the premiums and copays seniors \npay and which drugs will be covered. I do not believe we should hold \nWisconsin seniors hostage to the business interests of HMOs. Seniors \nneed a drug benefit that they can rely on every year to be affordable \nand one that ensures access to the medicines they need. The tripartisan \nplan did not meet that test.\n  In addition, under the tripartisan plan, many seniors would still \nhave high drug costs and low-income seniors would not be protected. The \nHMOs could charge whatever premiums they want; there would be a $250 \ndeductible; seniors would still pay 50 percent of their drug bills; and \nthere is a big gap where there is no coverage at all and the senior \npays 100 percent of their drug bills. Seniors would have to pay $3,700 \nout of their own pockets before they even reach the catastrophic level. \nAnd low-income seniors may not qualify for any extra help at all \nbecause of a strict asset test that prevents them from being covered if \nthey own a car worth more than $4,500, clothing and furniture worth \nmore than $2,000, or even a burial fund worth $1500. This asset test \nwould automatically eliminate 40 percent of Wisconsin's low-income \nseniors from being eligible for the extra help they need.\n  Instead of the false promise of the tripartisan plan, I and 51 other \nSenators supported the Graham-Miller plan. This program provided a \nguaranteed benefit through the Medicare Program that would be available \nto all seniors, at the same price no matter where they live. It was \nvoluntary, so seniors with drug coverage today could keep their plans. \nIt had reasonable premiums and copays, no gaps in coverage, and low-\nincome seniors would get extra help with no restrictive asset test. And \nit gave seniors choices. Seniors could choose an HMO plan if they \nwanted to, but the Graham-Miller bill offered them a drug benefit \nthrough the traditional Medicare program that seniors have relied on \nsince 1965.\n  Unfortunately, even though a majority of Senators supported the \nGraham-Miller bill, it failed to gain the 60 votes that are necessary \nfor any plan to pass under Senate budget rules. At that point, the \nSenate was faced the possibility of doing nothing and continuing to \nleave seniors stranded with high drug costs. For me, this was not an \noption. Seniors have waited too long for Congress to act, and it would \nbe inexcusable for Congress to leave them with nothing.\n  That's why I supported a bipartisan compromise that represented a \nsolid down payment on a real Medicare prescription drug benefit. First, \nit would help all low-income seniors below 200 percent of poverty, 45 \npercent of Wisconsin seniors, by providing comprehensive drug coverage \nthrough the Medicare program with nominal copays of $2 per generic \nprescription and $5 per brand-name prescription. Second, it would \nprovide all seniors above 200 percent of poverty with discounts on \nprescription drugs of up to 30 percent. The Medicare program would \nutilize Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, to negotiate these \ndiscounts the same system that is used today to manage benefits for \nnearly 200 Americans in the private sector.\n  Third, the Graham-Smith compromise would protect seniors with very \nhigh drug costs of more than $3,300 in out-of-pocket costs, which \nrepresents nearly 17 percent of Wisconsin seniors. At that point, \nseniors would receive full Medicare coverage for their medicines with \ncopays of only $10 per prescription.\n  Let me be clear that I would much prefer a more comprehensive benefit \nand have voted for one. The original Graham-Miller plan would have been \na comprehensive benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries, and I believe \nthat is the direction we need to go. But the Graham-Smith compromise \nplan would have taken a real first step toward the universal benefit we \nneed. It would have been a down payment upon which Congress must build \nso that all seniors have the coverage they need. But again, even this \ncompromise was blocked from passing.\n  I am extremely disappointed in the outcome of this debate. We missed \na tremendous opportunity to pass a comprehensive Medicare drug benefit. \nAnd then we were blocked from the opportunity to take even one real \nstep toward that goal. I truly hope that this is not the end of our \njourney this year. Our senior citizens made our country what it is \ntoday, they paid their taxes and they played by the rules. They should \nnot be forced to choose between paying the rent or buying groceries, or \nbuying the life-saving medicines they need to be healthy in their \nretirement years. It's time to create a reliable, affordable Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. I hope the Senate will continue \nto work toward that goal this year.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of \naffordable prescription drugs. As a life-long health advocate, I \nrecognize that prescription drugs are an important part of improving \nthe health and quality of life for millions of Americans. These drugs \nallow Americans of every age to live a more productive and more \nenjoyable life. Our success in this area is due in large measure to our \ncompetitive system that allows for many different approaches to meet \nthe many different needs of Americans.\n  The central features of any prescription drug bill should be \nincreased competition, innovation in the marketplace and increased \naccess to more affordable drugs. However, the current bill does not \naccomplish these objectives. Instead, it seeks to bypass the excellent \nconsumer protection provided by the FDA, decreases the return on the \ndevelopment of newer and better drugs, and may actually increase the \ncost of prescription drugs in the long run.\n  This bill has been hastily assembled and rashly brought to the floor \nbefore committee consideration. This bill contains provisions that have \nnot been analyzed for their impact upon our fine health care system. I \nfear these provisions will threaten the excellent healthcare system we \ncurrently enjoy. Indeed, the FTC released, just yesterday, a report \nentitled ``Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration'' that showed \nthat our system was working and that under the current Hatch-Waxman law \ninnovative new drugs were being brought to market even as a thriving \ngeneric market was lowering overall drug costs. While the report does \nshow that some minor changes may be in order, the place to make such \nimportant and complex changes is not the floor of the Senate after only \na few hours study, it is in the appropriate committee with the \nrequisite expertise.\n  The bill contains a provision allowing for large scale re-importation \nof prescription drugs. This presents a serious safety concern of a \nvariety of public health officials and has been rejected in the past. I \nam concerned that the opinions of many relevant agencies on this matter \nhave been disregarded. Agencies which oppose this provision include the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Customs Service, and the Center ;for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services.\n  Another provision which I strongly oppose which is in the bill \nrelates to Medicaid recipients access to medicine. While it is \npresented as a price control, it will effectively make drugs \nunavailable to low-income Medicaid patients\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\nby imposing restrictive ``prior authorization'' requirements on \nphysicians. This policy is opposed by many patient groups and should \nnot be part of this legislation.\n  Finally, I am deeply concerned that this bill does not contain a \nMedicare drug benefit plan. This is a very important issue that remains \nunresolved by this body. Therefore, I do not support cloture on this \nbill, nor do I support final passage of the measure. It is my hope that \nwe will revisit this issue soon and craft a bill which will improve the \navailability of affordable prescription drugs and ensure advances \ncontinue in this industry.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, nearly 482,000 seniors in Arkansas \ndesperately need a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Per capita, \nArkansas has one of the poorest senior populations in the Nation, which \nmeans, more often than not, Arkansas seniors must choose between \nputting food on the table and buying much needed prescription \nmedicines. I voted in favor of the Graham-Smith-Lincoln Medicare \nprescription drug compromise today, which has the full support of the \nAARP, because I believe in providing prescription drug assistance to as \nmany people as possible and to those seniors who need it most. I \nregret, however, that it leaves out nearly 40 percent of Arkansas \nseniors and lacks measures to strengthen and protect Medicare. Rather, \nI believe that a universal benefit, accompanied by responsible Medicare \nreforms, is the most sensible approach to addressing the rising cost of \ndrugs for our seniors and ensuring the long-term stability of the \nMedicare program. But most importantly, I am concerned about the impact \nof the Graham-Smith-Lincoln compromise on local pharmacies.\n  Seniors need a Medicare prescription drug benefit just as much as \nthey need access to their local pharmacies, particularly in rural \nstates like Arkansas. The discount drug card established under the \nGraham-Smith-Lincoln compromise is a concept I opposed last week when I \nvoted against the Hagel drug card amendment. Requiring pharmacies to \naccept discounts while doing nothing to reduce the price at which drugs \nare bought could force local pharmacies to foot the bill of a Medicare \nprescription drug amendment. This is simply not right.\n  To help fix these problems, I filed an amendment to the Graham-Smith-\nLincoln compromise which would have struck the drug discount card \nprovisions in the bill as well as a provision giving special treatment \nfor mail order pharmacies. If the Graham-Smith-Lincoln compromise \ngarnered the 60 votes necessary for passage, I was prepared to offer my \namendment so the Senate could have an open debate and vote on the \nimpact of such legislation on local pharmacists. Since the Graham-\nSmith-Lincoln compromise was rejected, this debate will have to wait \nuntil another day. In the meantime, I will continue to work for a \nbipartisan solution that provides Medicare prescription drug coverage \nfor all seniors, and particularly low-income seniors, while also \npreserving access to local pharmacies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nremaining equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, again, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation. Admittedly, it is incomplete legislation. We have not \nextended access, but in terms of cost cutting, this legislation is \nstrong.\n  The Schumer-McCain provisions will reduce the costs of so many drugs \nby 60, 65 percent for the senior citizen. For the family who has a \nchild who desperately needs a drug, instead of $100 a prescription, it \nwill only be $30, $35, or $40 a prescription. That is a godsend to many \npeople these days.\n  These drugs are wonder drugs, but their cost is so high that if you \nare not very wealthy or don't have a good medical plan, you cannot \nafford them, and that is an awful choice for people.\n  This bill achieves the goal of reducing costs and reducing it very \nsignificantly--a $60 billion reduction over the next decade to our \ncitizenry. I ask for your support of this measure.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I encourage a ``no'' vote on this \nbill. The Senator from New York says these are wonder drugs. They do \nnot drop out of the air. They come from a tremendous amount of \ninvestment from pharmaceutical companies which create new drugs and \nsave people's lives and create a better quality of life for Americans.\n  We are sacrificing future cures for political payout today, which is \ncheaper drugs for our folks back home. The long-term consequence of \nwhat we are doing today is that more people will die as a result of \ndrugs not being invented because of the reduction in the amount of \nresearch and development that will go on because we have now tipped the \nbalance toward generic drug companies, which do no research and \ninvestment and create no new drugs.\n  So understand what you are doing. We are sacrificing, yes, a great \nvote to say we are going to provide cheaper drugs. But long-term we are \nproviding less cures and a lower quality of life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no''.\n  The result was announced--yeas 78, nays 21, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 201 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--78\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--21\n\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The bill (S. 812), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

BROOKS SMITH TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of D. Brooks Smith, of \nPennsylvania, to United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 5 minutes evenly divided on the \nnomination. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have at best a modicum of order in the \nSenate, but I will proceed.\n  The record before us does not demonstrate that Judge D. Brooks Smith \nmerits a promotion to the Court of Appeals. He is already serving a \nlifetime position as a Federal judge, but he continued as a member of a \ndiscriminatory club more than a decade after he told\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nthe Senate he would quit. He did not resign until 1999, and then only \nafter this vacancy on the Third Circuit opened up.\n  It should make no difference whether this club discriminated against \nwomen, or people because of their race or creed; it is discriminatory. \nHe acknowledged that continuing in the club would be inconsistent with \nethical rules, but he continued to serve there, even after he told \nSenator Heflin under oath in 1988 that under these rules he would be \nrequired to resign.\n  I believe he did not keep his word. I think this is, frankly, the \nkind of lapse that, had it been somebody nominated by the previous \nPresident, my friends on the other side of the aisle would have voted \nagainst him. I think they should vote against this one, even though he \nis a member of their own party. We have the areas where he did not \nrecuse himself in a case where he had a clear conflict of interest. He \ntook special-interest-funded trips. I think his record as a whole calls \ninto question his sensitivity, his fairness, his impartiality, and his \njudgment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we debated the issue of Judge Smith's \nqualifications extensively last night. But by way of brief summary: He \nhas an excellent educational background. He practiced law for 8 years. \nHe served as district attorney of a major county in Pennsylvania. He \nwas a State court judge for 4 years, and in 1988 the bipartisan \njudicial commission, which Senator Heinz and I had organized, found him \nqualified. He has served in a very distinguished way for the past \nalmost 14 years on the Federal court in Pittsburgh. He is now the chief \njudge of the Western District Court. His reputation is excellent. I \nhave known him for the past 14 years and can personally attest to his \nintegrity and his qualification.\n  When an issue is raised about not resigning from a club and the \ncontention has been made that there was false testimony under oath, \nthat simply is not supported by the facts. When Judge Smith came up for \nconfirmation in 1988, he made the statement that he would resign if he \ncould not change the rules of the fishing club, which was viewed at \nthat time as discriminatory because women were not permitted to join.\n  In 1992, there was a definitive ruling that a club which did not have \nbusiness purpose--which is the kind of club that this was--did not \npractice what is called invidious discrimination. Since the club did \nnot practice invidious discrimination, Judge Smith did not have to \nresign. Certainly it cannot be said that somebody made a false \nstatement under oath in 1988 when he had an intention at that time to \ndo precisely what he said.\n  When later circumstances arise, where there is a change of \ncircumstance, nobody can say that what he testified to in 1988 was \nincorrect at that time, because the circumstances had changed.\n  When the argument is made that he resigned when a vacancy arose on \nthe Third Circuit, there were lots of vacancies on the Third Circuit in \nthe interim, so that if that was a motivating factor, he could have \nresigned at an earlier time.\n  Judge Smith has brought to Washington a virtual army of people who \nhave supported him, including many women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as much as I like and respect my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, I believe Judge Smith did \nnot keep his commitment in testimony before the Senate, did not keep \nhis commitment to Senator Howell Heflin, a commitment that was made \nunder oath. This was the first opening of a Court of Appeals seat from \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  When I look at this, I look at the way he misled us in his initial \ndescription of the club that he belonged to and then further misled us \nin his intention. Frankly, I cannot support him. Every Senator can vote \nhow they want. I cannot vote for him.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret that I will be opposing Judge \nSmith's nomination. I regret that this nomination has become a \nlightning rod for so many.\n  Let me state at the outset that I disagree very strongly with Judge \nSmith's rulings on a number of cases. I find serious fault with his \nstated comments on the Violence Against Women Act. In a 1993 speech, \nJudge Smith told the Federalist Society that he viewed VAWA as \nunconstitutional. The text of those remarks read in part ``There is no \nlegitimate constitutional source for this new-found `civil right' to be \nfree from physical violence.'' I cannot overstate my objections to his \ncallous view of domestic violence.\n  I understand that Judge Smith has received the American Bar \nAssociation's rating of ``well qualified.'' I also understand that \nJudge Smith has strong support across the political spectrum in western \nPennsylvania, his home. We have heard his friends in the Senate point \nout that he is a respectful, friendly and unbiased judge. These are \nimportant qualifications, and I do not doubt them. However, we must \nlook beyond such qualifications when considering a nomination of this \nimportance.\n  It is critically important that a judge on a Circuit Court of \nAppeals, the court of last resort for the vast majority of cases, have \nan ethically spotless record. In 1992, Judge Smith testified under oath \nthat he would leave the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club within a couple \nof years if he could not change the rules of the club preventing women \nmembers. He did not do that. It was not until the seat on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals to which he now seeks appointment became \nvacant that he resigned his membership in the club. To this day he \ndenies any wrongdoing. However, several prominent judicial ethicists \nhave pointed out that he clearly violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. \nJudges.\n  There is a model for cases such as Judge Smith's involvement in the \nSpruce Creek club. Judge Kenneth Ryskamp was denied an appellate court \nseat in 1991 because of his membership in a country club whose bylaws \nwere uncertain regarding membership diversity. In 1986, he was \nnominated to be a district court judge, he declared himself to be a \nmember of a club whose bylaws clearly exclude women. He also told the \nJudiciary Committee that he would resign from that club. He did so \nalmost immediately. Unfortunately, this example stands in stark \ncontrast to the actions of Judge Smith.\n  Judge Smith also conducted himself poorly in not immediately recusing \nhimself from two cases involving Mid-States Bank which was both his \nwife's employer and a bank in which he owned significant stock. During \nhis hearing he did agree that he erred in not recusing himself sooner, \nwhich I do appreciate. But nevertheless, he exercised judgement that \nwas questionable at best.\n  The Court of Appeals is the court of last resort for thousands of \ncritical cases each year. Judges who serve there must be in the highest \nmoral standing. Judge Smith's failure to follow-through on a promise to \nthe Senate in a timely matter and his handling of cases involving Mid-\nStates bank are disappointing and call into question that moral \nstanding. Therefore, I reluctantly must oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today in opposition to the \nnomination of D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. I \noppose the nominee because I believe serious questions have been raised \nregarding his ethical integrity and judicial temperament. Mr. Smith \nmisled the Judiciary Committee in 1988 when he promised he would resign \nfrom the all-male Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club. Despite his promise, \nand after the committee passed a resolution asserting that belonging to \nexclusive clubs where business is conducted constitutes invidious \ndiscrimination, Mr. Smith did not resign. In fact, he did not resign \nuntil 1999, when the position on the Third Circuit opened up.\n  Mr. Smith appears to subscribe to a general judicial philosophy that \nneglects the rights of women, institutionalized persons, consumers, \nworkers, prisoners and disabled persons. His judgments have been \nreversed by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals 51 times--a larger \nnumber of reversals\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nthan any of the Appellate Court Nominees who have come before the \nJudiciary Committee this Congress. Many of these reversals concerned \ndecisions affecting civil and individual rights and indicate a \ndisturbing lack of sensitivity and failure to follow established rules \nof law and appellate court decisions when it comes to those rights.\n  I am particularly concerned about Mr. Smith's reported view that the \nViolence Against Women Act is unconstitutional. I believe the Act is a \nlifeline to women in danger around the country and find Mr. Smith's \nview to be extreme. He is not in my view a suitable judge to serve one \nlevel below the Supreme Court.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have carefully considered the record \nof Judge D. Brooks Smith, who has been nominated to the Third Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, and it is with regret that I will be voting not to \nelevate Judge Smith. While I believe that he is intellectually \nqualified and personally respect, the fact remains that when he was \nconfirmed as a judge to the District Court by this committee in 1988, \nJudge Smith stated under oath that he would follow the ethical rules \ngoverning Federal judges and resign from a discriminatory club if he \nwas unable to change the men-only rule. Judge Smith failed to change \nthat rule, but did not resign from the Club until more than a decade \nlater, in December of 1999.\n  Since it became known that Judge Smith had not withdrawn from the \nclub, he has made an attempt to justify his inaction by claiming the \nclub is purely social and is thus does not engage in pervasive \ndiscrimination. While I believe that there is little difference between \na club that affirmatively denies membership to women, and a club that \ndenies membership to African Americans or to people of a particular \nreligious affiliation, the issue is not whether or not the club's \ndiscriminatory membership policies are or are not ``pervasive.'' The \nissue is that Judge Smith told this Committee under oath that he would \nresign from the club and he did not do so.\n  Federal judges are appointed to lifetime terms and the confirmation \nprocess is the only democratic check on individuals conduct, unless he \nor she is appointed to a higher position. If a promise to the Committee \nlike the one Judge Smith made can be so broken with no consequence, \nthen promises and assurances made by other nominees to this Committee \nwill mean very little.\n  I am also disturbed by Judge Smith's judicial decisions in the gender \ndiscrimination context. In at least two cases, Judge Smith's \napplication of legal and constitutional standards for deciding gender \ndiscrimination complaints raises serious concerns about his willingness \nto reach decisions fairly and in a manner consistent with precedent in \nthe Third Circuit. In Shafer v. Board of Education, Judge Smith \ndismissed the suit filed by a male teacher challenging his school \nboard's family leave policy which entitled women, and not men, to one \nyear unpaid leave for childbirth or ``childrearing.'' The Third Circuit \nreversed, finding the policy to be in violation of the father's Title \nVII rights. In Quirin v. City of Pittsburgh, Judge Smith interpreted \nthe law in a way that made it nearly impossible for the City of \nPittsburgh to remedy past discrimination in its hiring of only male \nfirefighters, and he applied the law in a manner inconsistent with \nestablished precedent.\n  Judge Smith also has engaged in other questionable conduct. He has \nexercised dubious judgment in failing to promptly withdraw from a case \nthat involved a bank in which he had a very significant investment, he \nhas attended more corporate funded trips than any other sitting federal \njudge, and he has given speeches expressing his views of the \nconstitutionality of statutes that could be challenged in cases before \nhim. The combination of these factors suggests that Judge Smith simply \nhas ethical blind spots that call into question his suitability to \nserve on the Circuit Court.\n  I am concerned by Judge Smith's failure to follow precedent and his \ntroubling record of reversals, and by his actions on the bench that \nfail to meet the very highest standards of the legal profession. In \naddition, his failure to promptly abide by the promise given to this \nCommittee in 1988 and withdraw from the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun club \nis simply a failure that cannot be ignored. Therefore, I cannot support \nhis elevation to the Third Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand in support of the confirmation of \nD. Brooks Smith, who has been nominated to be a judge on the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Judge Smith is currently the Chief Judge for \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania. He has compiled an impressive \nrecord as a judge since 1988, when, at age 36, he became one of the \nyoungest Federal judges in the country. Prior to that, Judge Smith has \nserved as a state court judge, as a prosecutor, and as a private \npractitioner with a law firm in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He is a 1973 \ngraduate of Franklin and Marshall College and a 1976 graduate of the \nDickinson School of Law in Pennsylvania.\n  Of course, anyone who has been reading the newspapers in the past few \nmonths knows that it would be impossible to comment on Judge Smith's \ncredentials without mentioning the attack he has come under from the \nusual liberal lobbyist interest groups in Washington. As President \nReagan would say, there they go again.\n  An editorial in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted,\n\n       Critics of Smith, many aligned with Democratic Party \n     interests, say he has been too quick to dismiss valid \n     lawsuits brought by individuals against corporations, and too \n     eager to travel to conferences paid for by businesses with \n     interests in federal litigation. . . . But outside \n     Washington's world of partisan poliitics, Smith seems to have \n     no enemies, only admirers. Those who have watched him work \n     say an exemplary 14-year record on the federal bench in \n     Western Pennsylvania is being twisted by political \n     opportunities. His popularity outside the capital extends \n     even to members of the opposing political party, who describe \n     him as fair, hard-working and respectful to all.\n\n  Well, it is an election year and we know the left of mainstream \ngroups will not miss an opportunity to flex their muscles.\n  Those groups who are working to discredit Judge Smith apparently \nbelieve that President Bush's circuit court nominees deserve to have \ntheir records distorted and their reputations dragged through the mud. \nI think that no judicial nominee deserves such treatment, and that was \nsomething I practiced as Chairman for 6 of President Clinton's 8 years \nin office. I strongly agree with the Washington Post editorial of \nFebruary 19, 2002, that ``opposing a nominee should not mean destroying \nhim.''\n  Referring to our last confirmation hearing, the Post pointed out.\n\n       The need on the part of liberal groups and Democratic \n     senators to portray [a nominee] as a Neanderthal--all the \n     while denying they are doing so--in order to justify voting \n     him down is the latest example of the degradation of the \n     confirmation process.\n\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will be sensitive to the \ndangers to the judiciary and to the reputation of this body that will \ncertainly result from the repeated practice of degrading honorable and \naccomplished people who are willing to put their talents to work in the \npublic service. Again, I fully support a thorough and genuine review of \na nominee's record and temperament, and in no way do I think we should \nshy away from our constitutional role of providing advice and consent.\n  We did that in the case of D. Brooks Smith and have found him to be \none of the finist jurists serving today. The President was right to \nnominate him, we will do well to confirm him.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for Senator \nArlen Specter. During the Clinton Presidency, Senator Specter angered \nmany in his own party by standing up to conservative special interest \ngroups and supporting well-qualified mainstream judicial nominees, many \nof whom waited months or years for a confirmation hearing.\n  That said, Judge D. Brooks Smith of Pennsylvania has a track record \nthat troubles me. His conservatism is not in dispute, on display in a \n1993 speech to the ultra-conservative Federalist Society criticizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act. He articulated a vision of \nconstitutional federalism directly at odds with Congress's power to \npass that important legislation, and many other important federal \ninitiatives to fight crime, such as the highly successful ``Weed and \nSeed'' program. The Supreme Court subsequently invalidated a small \nportion of the Violence Against\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nWomen Act, but Judge Smith's vision well exceeds the Court's own.\n  Judge Smith has also engaged in conduct that raises serious ethical \nquestions.\n  First, as you have heard, Judge Smith has a long association with a \nprestigious private club that has a formal policy barring women from \nmembership. Exclusive clubs are serious business, forging important \ncommercial ties and blocking women from full opportunity in society. \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was offered a job as a legal secretary \nout of Stanford Law School, has endorsed limits on such clubs, noting \nthat the government has a ``profoundly important goal of ensuring \nnondiscriminatory access to commercial opportunities in our society.''\n  We can debate back and forth the merits of whether the Spruce Creek \nClub is or is not a ``purely social'' organization, at least one club \nmember told the Judiciary Committee investigator that he has attended \nseveral business conferences at the club. For me, though, it is even \nmore significant that Judge Smith told this same Judiciary Committee in \n1988 that he would comply with the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct and \nresign from the club if it did not change its policies. To his credit, \nhe did try to change the policies. But he did not follow through on his \ncommitment and resign for 10 more years.\n  Second, as a district court judge, Judge Smith sat on two fraud cases \nin which he and his wife had a conflict of interest. He did recuse \nhimself from these cases, but only after a period of time had passed in \nwhich he was well aware of the conflict and continued to issue orders \nin both cases. His defense, that none of the parties asked him to \nrecuse himself earlier, is weakened by the fact that he never told the \nparties, before or after, of his $100,000 plus investment in the bank \nin question.\n  Finally, I am troubled by Judge Smith's frequent attendance at \njudicial seminars sponsored by special interest groups and funded by \ncorporations with litigation pending before his court. Most \nimportantly, he remains to this day unwilling to report the value of \nthose seminars on his financial disclosure forms and unwilling to \naccept responsibility to be attentive to the corporate sponsors of \nthose seminars. Both of these positions are inconsistent with an \nadvisory opinion of the Judicial Conference's Committee on Codes of \nConduct.\n  For these, reasons, I am constrained to oppose Judge Smith's \nnomination.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote ``no'' on the nomination of \nD. Brooks Smith to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Let \nme take a few minus to explain my decision.\n  First, let me not that I did not reach this decision lightly. After \nthis vote, we will have considered 64 judicial nominations of President \nBush on the floor and I will have voted against only two. And this will \nbe the first Court of Appeals nominee I have voted against on the \nfloor. I voted against one other nominee in Committee, while I have \nvoted in favor of 12 circuit court nominations.\n  I also want again to commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand the majority leader for the way that they have handled judicial \nnominations. The pressure is intense, and the criticism quite harsh. It \nis my view that a process that gives a nominee a hearing, and then a \nvote in the committee, and then a vote on the floor is not an unfair \nprocess; it is the way the Senate is supposed to work.\n  During the previous six years, the Senate, and the Judiciary \nCommittee did not work this way. Literally dozens of nominees never got \na hearing, as Judge Smith did, and never got a vote, as Judge Smith did \nin committee and is about to on the floor. Those nominees were \nmistreated by the committee. Judge Smith has not been mistreated. I \ncommend Chairman Leahy for doing what he can to set a new course on the \nJudiciary Committee, even though most supporters of the President's \nnominees do not give him credit for that.\n  I chaired the hearing that the Judiciary Committee held on Judge \nSmith. He is obviously a very intelligent man, and talented lawyer. He \nis personable and respectful. My opposition to his nomination is not \npersonal.\n  I oppose this nomination because I believe that Judge Smith has not \ndemonstrated good judgment on certain ethical issues. Beyond that, I \nbelieve that he misled the Judiciary Committee when his conduct was \nfairly questioned. These are serious issues, not trifles, not excuses. \nI cannot in good conscience support his elevation to the Court of \nAppeals.\n  People who came to our courts for justice don't get to pick their \njudges. And, at least at the Federal level, they don't get to elect \njudges. If our system is to work, if the people are to respect the \ndecisions that judges make, they have to have confidence that judges \nare fair and impartial. Judges, more than any other public figures, \nhave to be beyond reproach. The success of the rule of law as an \norganizing principle of our society is based on the respect that the \npublic has for judges. A legal system simply cannot function if the \npublic does not believe its judges will be fair and impartial.\n  That is why I have focused on ethical issues on a number of \nnominations we have faced so far. I can't as a Senator assure my \nconstituents that every decision made by a judge will be one with which \nthey will agree, or even the correct one legally. But I should be able \nto assure them, indeed, I must be able to assure them, that those \ndecisions will be reached fairly and impartially, that the judges I \napprove for the Federal bench are ethical, and beyond that, that they \nunderstand the importance of ethical behavior to the job that they have \nbeen selected to do.\n  In 1988, Judge Smith was nominated to the Federal District Court in \nPennsylvania. He had a distinguished legal and academic record, and his \nnomination faced no serious opposition. The one issue that aroused \ncontroversy was his membership in a hunting and fishing club called the \nSpruce Creek Rod and Gun Club that did not then, and does not today, \npermit women to be members. Judge Smith told Chairman Biden in a letter \nthat he would try to convince the club to change its policy and if he \nwas unsuccessful he would resign from the club.\n  In answers to questions posed by Senator Schumer, Judge Smith stated: \n``In my 1988 letter to the Judiciary Committee, I stated that I would \nresign from the Spruce Creek Rod & Gun Club if it did not amend its by-\nlaws to admit women as members. I did not specify in my letter when I \nwould resign.''\n  But Judge Smith also testified before this committee, under oath, in \n1988. Senator Howell Heflin asked what steps he would take to change \nthe restriction and how long he would wait. Judge Smith testified as \nfollows:\n\n       Well, first of all, Senator, I think the most important \n     step would be to attempt an amendment to the bylaws. Failing \n     that, I believe an additional step would and could be--and I \n     would support, and have indicated to at least one member of \n     the club that I would support and attempt--an application for \n     membership from a woman. Failing that, I believe that I would \n     be required to resign.\n       I think it would be necessary for me to await an annual \n     meeting which is, as I understand it--and I preface it with \n     ``as I understand it'' because I have not been an active \n     member in any real sense of the word, but I believe there \n     to be an annual meeting every April--and I believe I would \n     have to await that point in time to at least attempt a \n     bylaws amendment.\n\n  Now I suppose that our former colleague Senator Heflin, who was a \nState supreme court judge earlier in this career, could have nailed him \ndown even tighter than he did. But we don't have to do that in the \nJudiciary Committee. The committee is not a court of law. We have a \nright to rely on the clear implications of sworn testimony of nominees \nwho come before us. I believe everyone at that hearing, and everyone \nreading it fairly today would conclude that Judge Smith promised that \nhe would resign in 1989, if he was unsuccessful in getting the club to \nchange its policies at the next annual meeting.\n  Judge Smith made that promise in October 1988. He was then confirmed \nby the Judiciary Committee and by the full Senate. We learned after \nJudge Smith was nominated to the Third Circuit last year that he didn't \nresign from the club until 1999, eleven years later. Indeed, he didn't \nresign until after a vacancy arose on the Third Circuit Club of Appeals \nin which he was interested. This is what he wrote to the club when he \nresigned on December 15, 1999:\n\n       After considerable thought, and not without a measure of \n     regret, I hereby submit my resignation from membership in the \n     Spruce\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\n     Creek Rod and Gun Club, effective immediately. Certain of the \n     Club's exclusive membership provisions, which I do not expect \n     will change, continue to be at odds with certain expectations \n     of federal judicial conduct.\n\n  At this point, it certainly appears that Judge Smith recognized that \nhis continued membership in the club was not consistent with the Canons \nof Judicial Conduct.\n  After he was nominated to the Third Circuit vacancy last year, Judge \nSmith filled out of the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire. This is \nhow he responded to a question about membership in organizations that \ndisciminate:\n\n       I previously belonged to the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club, \n     a rustic hunting and fishing club which admits only men to \n     membership. I joined the club in 1982 largely for sentimental \n     reasons: it is where my grandfather taught me to fish when I \n     was seven or eight years old. I urged the club, through \n     letters to club officers personal contacts with members, to \n     consider changing its exclusive membership provision. These \n     efforts were unsuccessful. Eventually, in late 1999, I \n     voluntarily resigned my membership.\n\n  It is noteworthy that in this answer, Judge Smith makes no mention of \nthe argument that he and his supporters now advance, that he had no \nobligation to resign from the club because it is a purely social club. \nOnly when questions began to be raised about his continued membership \ndid this argument arise.\n  Now I know that there is a dispute about whether business is \nconducted at this club. To be honest, I tend to credit the email and \nstatements of Dr. Silverman, a supporter of Judge Smith, who said that \na medical PAC held meetings there, rather than his letter to the \ncommittee saying that the events were just picnics, which was written \nafter he learned that what he had said might be damaging to Judge \nSmith's confirmation. In my mind, if the club permits its members to \ninvite business associates to the club and hold business meetings \nthere, that is a club that should not discriminate against minorities \nor women. And the president of the club has confirmed that members can \nhold any meetings they want at the club.\n  But for me, that's not the crucial point. The crucial point is that \nthis nominee made a commitment to the Judiciary Committee under oath. \nHe broke that commitment. And then he compounded his problem by coming \nup with an after-the-fact rationalization for why he broke his \ncommitment. Even if he were obviously correct that he need not have \nresigned his membership, I still believe he was untruthful when he \nsuggested to the committee that the changes to the Code of Conduct in \n1992 ``afforded me the opportunity to reexamine the entire Code and \nconsider it's application to my membership in Spruce Creek.'' I don't \nbelieve that Judge believed between 1992 and 1999 that his obligation \nhad changed after 1992. If he did, I don't think he would have had, and \nI am quoting from his written answers to Senator Schumer's questions:\n\n     numerous conversations with Club officers about changing the \n     by-laws. In fact, in practically every conversation I had \n     with members of the Club in which we talked of the Club, I \n     recall discussing the by-law issue and advocating change.\n\n  Why would he do that if he thought the club was not engaging in \ninvidious discrimination? And why would he say in his resignation \nletter that the club's membership policies: ``continue to be at odds \nwith certain expectations of Federal judicial conduct''?\n  I have concluded that Judge Smith came up with his argument after \nquestions were raised about his failure to resign. Some in the Senate \nmay be convinced by this argument that they should ignore Judge Smith's \nfailure to follow through on his commitment to the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate in 1988. I cannot ignore that failure.\n\n  I am afraid that this is not the only instance where Judge Smith has \ncome up with after-the-fact rationalizations of his behavior that don't \nhold up under scrutiny. At his hearing, I asked Judge Smith about \nnumerous trips he had taken to judicial education seminars paid for by \ncorporate interests. Judge Smith indicated that had studied and been \nguided by Advisory Opinion No. 67, which instructs judges to inquire \ninto the sources of funding of such seminars before attending them in \norder to be sure that there was no conflict of interest. I asked him if \nbefore he went on the trips he had inquired about the source of funding \nsponsored by The Foundation for Research on Economics and the \nEnvironment, known as FREE, and the Law and Economics Center of George \nMason University, known as LEC. Judge Smith answered the question with \nrespect to FREE, saying that he remembered inquiring more than once \nabout FREE's funding by telephone.\n  So I asked him a follow-up question in writing about whether he made \na similar inquiry about the funding for seminars put on by the Law and \nEconomics Center at George Mason University. Judge Smith gave an \namazing answer. He said that because the trips were sponsored by a \nuniversity, he had no obligation to inquire about the source of \nfunding, and he claimed that he reached that conclusion in 1992 and \n1993 when he was taking these trips.\n  Both ethics professors with whom I consulted state in no uncertain \nterms that Judge Smith is wrong in his interpretation of the ethical \nobligations of a judge who wishes to go on one of these trips. As \nProfessor Gillers states: ``Obviously, there would be room for much \nmischief if a judge invited to an expense-paid judicial seminar could \nrely on the non-profit nature of an apparently neutral sponsor to \nimmunize the judge's attendance. Judge Smith is therefore wrong in his \nassumption.''\n  I believe if Judge Smith really reached this conclusion with respect \nto LEC at the time of the hearing, he would have told us when he \nanswered my question at the hearing. His written response to the \nfollow-up question indicates that he in fact did not understand the \nimport of Advisory Opinion No. 67, then, or now. I find that very \ntroubling. It undercuts his assurances to me at the hearing that he \nwould refrain from taking additional trips until he was ``satisfied \nthat funding does not come from a source that is somehow implicated in \na case before him.'' I don't know how I can rely on that assurance.\n  In addition, there is the question of Judge Smith's failure to recuse \nhimself in two cases in 1997--SEC v. Black and United States v. Black. \nThese are very complicated cases, so I sought the advice of two legal \nethics experts. After reviewing Judge Smith's testimony and written \nanswers to questions and all of the other materials submitted to the \nJudiciary Committee on this issue from both supporters and opponents of \nJudge Smith, both Professor Gillers and Professor Freedman conclude \nthat Judge Smith violated the judicial disqualification statute, 28 \nU.S.C. Sec. 455, by not recusing himself earlier in SEC v. Black, and \nby not recusing himself immediately upon being assigned the criminal \nmatter in United States v. Black. Professor Freedman called his \nviolations ``among the most serious I have seen.''\n  I was particularly disturbed by Judge Smith's failure to disclose his \nfinancial interest in the bank involved in the case to the parties in \nthe criminal case. He told them about his wife's employment and that he \nhad recused himself in the civil case. But he didn't give the parties \nfull and complete information upon which they could base a decision \nwhether to ask him to recuse himself. This was Judge Smith's \nobligation, in my view.\n  In my opinion, these ethical questions individually raise serious \nconcerns about Judge Smith's fitness to serve as a Circuit Court judge. \nTogether, they are very significant. I cannot support a nomination \nplagued by such an ethical cloud, despite all of the heartfelt support \nhe has received. I will therefore, reluctantly, vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that following the vote on the matter now pending, \nJudge Smith, we proceed to H.R. 5010, the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We informed \nthe staff and we will be happy to show them the amendments when we see \nthe amendments that Senator McCain intends to offer.\n  Mr. REID. I also say that I misspoke. The majority leader does not \nneed unanimous consent on his behalf.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, as we have talked on a number of \noccasions on previous bills, any package of managers' amendments the \nSenator from Arizona will have a chance to review.\n  I withdraw the unanimous consent request and announce on behalf of \nthe majority leader that following the vote on Judge Smith, the Senate \nwill move to H.R. 5010, the Department of Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, let \nme say to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, that not only he will \nsee the managers' amendments, but I will insist on the managers' \namendments being read on all appropriations bills for the attention of \nthe full Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  We have had many occasions where late at night managers' amendments \nwere agreed to without anyone ever having seen or heard of them. And I \nwould still like to see the managers' amendment before some time late \ntomorrow night when everyone wants to get out of here and leave and I \nam the bad guy again. I want to see what is in the managers' amendment \npackage.\n  It is not an illegitimate request to see the managers' amendment \npackage before they vote on final passage, which then puts us in the \nuncomfortable position of having to be delayed. I think it is a fair \nrequest on the part of the taxpayers of America to see what we are \nvoting.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am informed that 20 minutes ago those \namendments went to Senator McCain's office and we have not seen his \namendments. We ask that we see his amendments, too. We cannot put a \nmanagers' package together until we see them all.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Arizona, do you \nhave any problem with DOD appropriations after this vote?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't.\n  I would like to say, any amendment that I have will be debated and \nvoted on. I don't have the privilege of proposing a managers' \namendment.\n  Mr. REID.

The consent has \nalready been given some days ago.\n  Mr. REID. As has been explained to me, the majority leader at this \ntime--and I--can call this up, but would have to be, as I understand \nit, some later time.\n  I am asking for a time certain and that is why the Senator from \nArizona, as I understand, has no problem bringing it up after this next \nmatter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof D. Brooks Smith, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Third Circuit? On this question the yeas and nays have been \nordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES, I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``Yea''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commercial Reusable In-\n     Space Transportation Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 902. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest to encourage the \n     production of cost-effective, in-space transportation \n     systems, which would be built and operated by the private \n     sector on a commercial basis.\n       (2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, \n     enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end \n     of their useful lives, and increase the capability and \n     reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.\n       (3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance the economic well-being and national security of \n     the United States by reducing space operations costs for \n     commercial and national space programs and by adding new \n     space capabilities to space operations.\n       (4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including \n     orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude \n     orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite \n     orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of \n     satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to \n     increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to \n     geostationary and other high energy orbits.\n       (5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States \n     by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth \n     orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival \n     deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other \n     planets.\n       (6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to \n     deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic \n     loss to the United States and present substantial concerns \n     for the current backlog of national space assets.\n       (7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     provide new options for alternative planning approaches and \n     risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national \n     space assets.\n       (8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     developed by the private sector can provide in-space \n     transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the Department of Defense, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need \n     for the United States to bear the cost of production of such \n     systems.\n       (9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of \n     credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, \n     is an effective means by which the United States can help \n     qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise \n     unattainable private financing for the production of \n     commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at \n     the same time minimizing Government commitment and \n     involvement in the development of such systems.\n\n     SEC. 903. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR PRODUCTION OF COMMERCIAL \n                   REUSABLE IN-SPACE TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       (a) Authority To Make Loan Guarantees.--The Secretary may \n     guarantee loans made to eligible United States commercial \n     providers for purposes of producing commercial reusable in-\n     space transportation services or systems.\n       (b) Eligible United States Commercial Providers.--The \n     Secretary shall prescribe requirements for the eligibility of \n     United States commercial providers for loan guarantees under \n     this section. Such requirements shall ensure that eligible \n     providers are financially capable of undertaking a loan \n     guaranteed under this section.\n       (c) Limitation on Loans Guaranteed.--The Secretary may not \n     guarantee a loan for a United States commercial provider \n     under this section unless the Secretary determines that \n     credit would not otherwise be reasonably available at the \n     time of the guarantee for the commercial reusable in-space \n     transportation service or system to be produced utilizing the \n     proceeds of the loan.\n       (d) Credit Subsidy.--\n       (1) Collection required.--The Secretary shall collect from \n     each United States commercial provider receiving a loan \n     guarantee under this section an amount equal to the amount, \n     as determined by the Secretary, to cover the cost, as defined \n     in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, \n     of the loan guarantee.\n       (2) Periodic disbursements.--In the case of a loan \n     guarantee in which proceeds of the loan\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\n     are disbursed over time, the Secretary shall collect the \n     amount required under this subsection on a pro rata basis, as \n     determined by the Secretary, at the time of each \n     disbursement.\n       (e) Other Terms and Conditions.--\n       (1) Prohibition on subordination.--A loan guaranteed under \n     this section may not be subordinated to another debt \n     contracted by the United States commercial provider \n     concerned, or to any other claims against such provider.\n       (2) Restriction on income.--A loan guaranteed under this \n     section may not--\n       (A) provide income which is excluded from gross income for \n     purposes of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

and\n       (B) complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, \n     maintain, operate, or sell the physical asset.\n       (g) Credit Instruments.--\n       (1) Authority to issue instruments.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Secretary may, subject to such \n     terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, \n     issue credit instruments to United States commercial \n     providers of in-space transportation services or system, with \n     the aggregate cost (as determined under the provisions of the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.)) of \n     such instruments not to exceed $1,500,000,000, but only to \n     the extent that new budget authority to cover such costs is \n     provided in subsequent appropriations Acts or authority is \n     otherwise provided in subsequent appropriations Acts.\n       (2) Credit subsidy.--The Secretary shall provide a credit \n     subsidy for any credit instrument issued under this \n     subsection in accordance with the provisions of the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n       (3) Construction.--The eligibility of a United States \n     commercial provider of in-space transportation services or \n     systems for a credit instrument under this subsection is in \n     addition to any eligibility of such provider for a loan \n     guarantee under other provisions of this section.\n\n     SEC. 904.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are now on the Defense appropriations \nbill. Senator Inouye worked hard to get to this point, as did Senator \nStevens--not only the ranking member of the subcommittee but the \nchairman of the full committee.\n  We would like to move this bill and finish it today. This is a very \nbig bill. It is the largest Defense bill in the history of the country. \nBut it has been worked and worked and worked. I think we are at a point \nwhere we should be able to do that.\n  Senator McCain has indicated he has some amendments. And we are \nwaiting for those, as is Senator Inouye. If there are other amendments, \nthey should be offered.\n  We are going to try to wrap this bill up today. There are different \nways of doing that. I hope there is cooperation.\n  Senators Inouye and Stevens have agreed to a period of morning \nbusiness for 12 minutes, and then the bill will be taken up and we will \nproceed in haste to complete it.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I therefore ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Kerry and Senator Collins each be recognized to speak for up to \n6 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). The Senator from Maine.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins are printed in today's Record during \nconsideration of S. 812.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was looking for an opportunity when the \nSenator was on the floor to say some things I think are appropriate. I \nhave said this before, but there is no one in the Senate I have more \nrespect and admiration for than the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  The reason I wanted to say something today is I have had the \nopportunity the last many years to serve as ranking member and chairman \nof the Ethics Committee, which is a difficult job but one that I accept \nand understand the responsibilities. The situation arose where the \nSenator from Hawaii was asked by the majority leader to take over the \nchairmanship of that committee. As has been done on so many different \noccasions when there was something difficult that had to be done in the \nSenate, we looked to the Senator from Hawaii to do that. He has never \nshirked responsibility.\n  Frankly, there were others who maybe could have or should have done \nthis, but of course we looked to who we thought was the best, someone \nwhose ethical standards are what I think the Senate is all about. I \nwant, on behalf of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to express \nappreciation for stepping into a difficult situation, handling it with \ngrace and handling it in a manner that I think is about as well as \nanyone could handle things.\n  Let me complete this by saying we are now taking up the Defense \nappropriations bill, the largest Defense bill in the history of the \ncountry. There is no one who is more capable of handling a bill of this \nmagnitude, dealing with the security and the defense of this country, \nthan a person who is a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for the \nvalor he showed in World War II. The valor he has shown is exemplified \nby the military awards he has received. He has shown the same valor in \nthe Halls of the U.S. Senate. The people of Hawaii are so, so fortunate \nto have someone of his caliber, but I say that the people of Nevada are \nfortunate to have someone such as him serving in the Senate, and that \napplies to all the other States.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am humbled by those very generous remarks. I thank the \nSenator very much.\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was in my office and I heard that the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader was speaking about the \ncontribution of our distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii. I wanted \nto come to the floor to add my voice.\n  Someday, when the history of this period in the Senate is written, \none of those Senators who will tower as one of the giants is the \nSenator from Hawaii. On so many occasions over the course of his \ncareer, the Senate has called upon him to provide leadership in \ninquiries of all kinds, extraordinary challenges involving the need to \nwork with both sides, somebody whose fairness, whose appreciation of \nthis institution could never be challenged.\n  I come to the floor to publicly thank him for taking on the \nextraordinarily difficult role that he had earlier this year when he \nagreed to my request to serve in the capacity of senior member of the \nDemocratic representation on the Ethics Committee. He didn't want that \njob. He certainly didn't ask for that job. He knew the difficulty it \nwould pose, and he knew how much time it would consume. But in keeping \nwith his practice, he said yes.\n  Last night we witnessed the product of his work, along with the \nothers of the committee. I think it is fair to say, without question, \nhe lived up to and exceeded the expectations of all of us in the Senate \nin conducting the hearings with fairness and dealing with the issue \nadroitly, and recognizing the important matters and issues that had to \nbe addressed in this inquiry.\n  I come to the floor simply to add my voice of gratitude to the \ndistinguished Senator from Hawaii. I might also say, as the Senator \nfrom Nevada has noted, it is a little ironic, perhaps, that the two men \nwho have given the most in the Senate today to their country at times \nof war are either sitting in the chair or standing at the manager's \ndesk as we begin the DOD appropriations bill. I know of no two finer \nmen.\n  I have no greater admiration for any two people in the Senate than I \ndo these two Senators. I thank them for what they have already done for \ntheir country and for what they continue to do in the roles they play \nas truly outstanding U.S. Senators.\n  I look forward to the debate on Defense appropriations and, as \nalways, we turn to our dear Senator from Hawaii with our admiration and \nour gratitude and our expressions of hope that we conclude this \nsuccessfully within the course of the next period of time.\n  I thank the Senator for accommodating me. I know he wants to get \nstarted on his bill, but I needed to come to the floor to express \nmyself, as the Senator from Nevada has as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Very seldom am I at a loss for words, but I must say I am \nextremely grateful to my leaders for their generous remarks. I am \nhumbled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me ask, briefly, and express my \nviewpoint concerning Danny Inouye and Max Cleland. Others have just \npreceded me in speaking of these two valiant patriots. Danny Inouye has \nalways been my hero in the Senate. There was never anyone, in my \njudgment, greater than Danny. In our time, or in past times, I think \nthat says about all I need to say about Danny. He is the ranking \nDemocrat on the Appropriations Committee in the Senate. He has always \nbeen a valued supporter of mine when I was majority leader, when I was \nminority leader, and as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, which I presently am. So he doesn't take second place to \nanybody in the Senate, as far as I am concerned. As heroes go, he is \nNo. 1.\n  In recent years, there has come to the Senate the junior Senator from \nGeorgia, Max Cleland, who is also my hero. So I have two heroes in the \nSenate. Danny is one who has been my hero from the beginning, and Max \nCleland is my second hero. So I just add that little bit to what has \nalready been appropriately said by Senators Reid of Nevada and the \nmajority leader. I don't think I can add anything to that.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. INOUYE. On behalf of the Presiding Officer and myself, we are \nhumbled by the Senator's generous remarks.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Hawaii.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know we are going to have opening \nstatements by Senator Inouye and others. I ask unanimous consent, when \nwe get to amendments, I be allowed to do the first amendment on the DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is that the Senator be allowed to \noffer a first-degree amendment at the conclusion of opening statements \non the Defense Appropriations Committee bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I personally have no objection, but I would \nlike for both managers to be here. I would like for both managers to be \nhere when the request is made.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Objection to what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the unanimous consent request of \nthe Senator from Minnesota to offer first an amendment upon the \ncompletion of the opening statements.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't know what the Senator's amendment \nis. I object, for the moment, just for the moment, until both managers \nare on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me take a little bit of time then. \nI am sorry, I won't proceed if the Senator from Hawaii is ready to make \nhis opening statement. I do not want to take much time. Let me just \ngive my colleagues a sense of what the amendment is. I will try to do \nthat because we come down to the floor and we try to get in order so we \ncan also do some other things.\n  What the amendment says is that none of the funds made available in \nthis act may be obligated for payment on any new contract to a \nsubsidiary of a publicly traded corporation if the corporation \nincorporated after December 31, 2001, in a tax haven country.\n  Basically what I am talking about is the whole question of contracts \nthat go out to companies that have incorporated overseas to avoid U.S. \ntaxes. By the way, knowing this is not in the House bill, I tried to \nhave a very moderate version which is really to not even reach back \nretroactively but to look at this prospectively.\n  That is the amendment. My guess is there will be a lot of support for \nthe amendment. Without the unanimous consent agreement, I will wait \nuntil after opening statements and then try to seek recognition. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will at least, even though I do not \nhave assurance of being able to do the first amendment--I  will just \nsend the amendment to the desk. Usually what Senators want is for those \nof us who have amendments to come out here. I am just trying to get \ngoing here.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The number of the amendment is No. 4364, which \nthe clerk has.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Today I am pleased to report H.R. 5010 to \nthe Senate with the Appropriations Committee's recommendations for \nfunding the Department of Defense for Fiscal Year 2003.\n\n  The Bill before the Senate totals $355.4 billion in new \nappropriations for the Defense Department.\n  This is the largest spending Bill the Senate has ever considered. It \nis $35 billion more than was approved for FY 2002 and nearly $700 \nmillion more than recommended by the House last month. In light of the \nthreat to this Nation, I believe the increase is well warranted.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues that while the Bill is the \nhighest in history, the total recommended is still $11.4 billion below \nthe President's request.\n  A request for $10 billion was originally presented by the President \nfor contingency costs for the global war on terrorism.\n  This amount is being withheld by the Appropriations Committee to be \nallocated at a later date.\n  On July 3, the President submitted a sketch of how he would like \nthese funds appropriated. Unfortunately, no details on the use of the \nfunds were provided. Therefore, the Committee has not allocated the \nfunding to the Subcommittee yet.\n  I should point out that the measure that passed the House also did \nnot address the $10 billion contingency amount.\n  Over the next several months we will work with the Administration to \nidentify the specific needs for this funding.\n  We expect that a supplemental Bill will be forthcoming to allocate \nthe full $10 billion to DoD.\n  The remaining $1.4 billion decrease reflects transfers made to other \ndefense related activities to cover pressing requirements for military \nconstruction and nuclear weapons related programs in the Department of \nEnergy. These are not under the jurisdiction of the Defense \nSubcommittee.\n  The priorities for this Bill remain the same as last year. First and \nforemost, we must ensure that we provide what the men and women in \nuniform need. To that end, we have fully funded the request for a 4.1% \nacross-the-board pay raise; funded the newly authorized benefits for \nour military; provided funding to cover the authorized end strength for \nour Active, Guard, and Reserves; funded the Tricare for Life program \nfor our military retirees; and, fully funded the Defense Health \nProgram.\n  Second, we have included funding for all the Defense Department's \ntransformation programs.\n  We recommend full funding for the Army's Interim Armored Vehicle. We \nhave increased funding for unmanned aerial vehicles. We recommend an \nincrease of $278 million in the Army's future combat system.\n  And we provide an additional $70 million to support the planning and \ndeployment of the New Interim Army Brigade Combat Teams and strongly \nencourage the Defense Department to deploy all six Brigades.\n  Third, we recommend funding all the investment priorities of the \nDefense Department. This includes full funding for the F-22, full \nfunding for the Navy's DDX, increased funding for four more F/A-18 \naircraft, full funding for 15 C-17 aircraft, full funding for V-22 \naircraft purchases, and increasing funding for Navy shipbuilding.\n\n  Fourth, a major initiative in funding for the bill is to improve \nfiscal discipline in the Department of Defense. This Committee and our \ncolleagues in the House have been concerned for several years with the \nincreased cost growth in Navy ships. This year alone the total unfunded \nliability for the Navy in this area has increased by $1 billion to $4 \nbillion.\n  The Committee has carefully reviewed the request and reallocated \nresources that are not required at this time, in order to increase \nfunding to pay off these existing bills. In total, the Committee \nrecommends $1.4 billion to cover these must pay bills. We have \ndiscussed this matter with Navy officials and they concur that this is \nthe best approach to get their financial house in order.\n  Fifth, the bill recommends adding $585 million to purchase 15 C-17 \naircraft. The Air Force recommended a risky scheme, already rejected by \nthe House, to finance the C-17 Program incrementally. This proposal \ncould have required us to cut C-17 production to 12. The recommendation \nwill ensure that we continue to produce 15 C-17's under the approved \nmulti-year contract.\n  Sixth, the Committee has mirrored the recommendations approved by the \nSenate regarding ballistic missile defense. The bill provides $6.9 \nbillion for ballistic missile defense programs. In addition, as \nauthorized, the Committee recommends $814 million to be allocated at \nthe discretion of the President for either counterterrorism or missile \ndefense.\n  In total, the $7.7 billion recommendation is the same as requested by \nthe Administration.\n  Finally, I want to thank my Co-Chairman, Senator Stevens and all of \nhis hard work on this bill. The Committee held 12 hearings to review \nthe Defense Department's budget.\n  The recommendations that we have put forward here reflect what we \nlearned in those hearings, and in our meetings with senior DoD \nofficials and members of the public.\n  I believe this is a very good bill and urge your support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I endorse the statement made by the \nDistinguished Chairman of our Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, and fully \nsupport the Bill now pending before the Senate. In a time of war and \nconflict, including unprecedented threats here at home, the Senate \nengages in no more important task than funding our national defense. \nThe Bill reported by the Committee, under Senator Inouye's leadership \nand guidance, fully meets the needs of our men and women who serve in \nthe Armed Forces, today and for the future.\n  The Bill exceeds the level provided in the House version of the Bill \nby nearly $700 million.\n  The Bill is consistent with the President's total request for the \ndefense budget function 050, with the exception of the $10 billion \nreserve, which I will speak to shortly.\n  The Chairman has accurately and comprehensively addressed the \ncontents of the Bill, I will take just a few moments to highlight \nseveral priorities. While providing unprecedented levels of funding for \ncurrent training and operations, this Bill serves to decisively move \nour military towards a future of more mobile, more lethal, and more \nefficient systems and capabilities. In all four services, and in the \nMissile Defense Program, this Bill shifts from the sustainment of \nlegacy systems, designed to fight the Cold War, to the technologies of \nthe 21st Century.\n  For the Army, the increase in this Bill for the future combat system, \nand the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon to succeed the Crusader, keeps faith \nwith General Shinseki's vision of the Army's future.\n  For the Navy, full funding for the DD-X Program, and start up funds \nfor the Littoral Combat Ship, prepare the Navy to maintain our \ndominance at sea.\n  For the Air Force, funding for the F-22, the JSF, C-17, and JASSAM \nall contribute to a refurbishment of the Air Force unmatched since the \nintroduction of the jet fighter in the 1950's.\n  For the Marine Corps, the Bill fully supports the V-22, and puts the \nLPD-17 Class Amphibious Assault Ship Program back on track, along with \nJSF.\n  Of special importance to me, and my State, is the funding provided in \nthe Bill for missile defense. Intelligence analyses over the past \ndecade consistently demonstrate the increased threat, and our continued \nvulnerability to long-rang missile attack, potentially with weapons of \nmass destruction. President Bush, in a new relationship with Russia, \nhas established a framework whereby our Nation will go forward with a \nlimited missile defense capability, without putting at risk our \nrelations with Russia.\n  Many claimed that deployment of U.S. national missile defense systems \nwould precipitate a new arms race. That speculation has proven to be \nwithout basis or merit.\n  Last week, several Members met with our Supreme Allied Commander in \nEurope, Gen. Joe Ralston, who spoke positively about the new ties \nbetween NATO and Russia.\n  Greater security for our Nation fosters greater security and \nstability for our allies and emerging partners.\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\n  This Bill accommodates the priorities presented by the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense to the Congress.\n  The Bill lives within the fiscal limits set by our Committee in the \nabsence of a budget resolution.\n  The Bill addresses the key priorities raised in the Senate's \nconsideration of the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2003.\n  I urge all Members to work with the Chairman today to accomplish the \nexpeditious consideration and passage of this Bill.\n  Consistent with the allocation adopted by the Appropriations \nCommittee, by unanimous vote, I will oppose any amendment that would \nincrease the spending level in this Bill.\n  We have been working with Members since the Bill was filed to address \nadditional concerns, and will proceed to a number of cleared amendments \nshortly.\n  I will close by expressing by appreciation to the Chairman for his \npartnership, colleagiltiy and courtesy at every state in the \npreparation of this Bill.\n  I support the Bill with reservation or qualification, and urge all my \nColleagues to join advancing this Bill to Conference today.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Minnesota \nwishes to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4364\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4364.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds made available in this Act for \n        payment on any new contract to any corporate expatriate)\n\n       On page 223, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. Corporate Expatriates. (a) Limitation.--None of \n     the funds made available in this Act may be obligated for \n     payment on any new contract to a subsidiary of a publicly \n     traded corporation if the corporation incorporated after \n     December 31, 2001 in a tax haven country but the United \n     States is the principal market for the public trading of the \n     corporation's stock.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of subsection (a), the term \n     ``tax haven country'' means each of the following: Barbados, \n     Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Commonwealth \n     of the Bahamas, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, the \n     Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco, \n     the Republic of the Seychelles, and any other country that \n     the Secretary of the Treasury determines is used as a site of \n     incorporation primarily for the purpose of avoiding United \n     States taxation.\n       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) with \n     respect to any specific contract if the President certifies \n     to the Appropriations Committees of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate that the waiver is required in \n     the interest of national security.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President and colleagues, I offer a very simple \namendment that would bar any funds in this bill from being used to \nenter contracts with U.S. companies that incorporate overseas to avoid \nU.S. taxes. Let me repeat that. I rise to offer a very simple amendment \nthat I believe will command a majority vote--I hope more than a \nmajority vote--in the Senate that would bar any funds in this bill from \nbeing used to enter contracts with U.S. companies that incorporate \noverseas to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Former U.S. companies that have renounced their citizenship currently \nhold at least $2 billion worth of contracts with the Federal \nGovernment. I do not think companies that are not willing to pay their \nfair share of taxes should be able to hold these contracts.\n  U.S. companies that play by the rules of the game, that pay their \nfair share of taxes, should not be forced to compete with bad actors \nthat can undercut their bids because of a tax loophole.\n  In the last couple of years, a number of prominent U.S. corporations, \nusing creative paperwork, have transformed themselves into Bermuda \ncorporations, purely to avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  These new Bermuda companies are essentially or basically shell \ncorporations. They have no staff. They have no offices. They have no \nbusiness activity in Bermuda. They exist for the sole purpose of \nshielding income from the Internal Revenue Service.\n  U.S. tax law contains many provisions designed to expose such \ncreative accounting and to require U.S. companies that are foreign in \nname only to pay the same taxes as other domestic corporations. But \nthese bad corporate former citizens exploit a specific loophole in \ncurrent law so that the company is treated as foreign for tax purposes \nand, therefore, pays no U.S. taxes on its foreign income.\n  The loophole gives tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks to major \nmultinational companies with significant non-U.S. business. It also \nputs other U.S. companies unwilling or unable to use this loophole at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. No American company should be penalized \nstaying put while others renounce U.S. citizenship for a tax break.\n  The problem with all this is that when these companies do not pay \ntheir fair share, the rest of the American taxpayers and businesses are \nstuck with the bill.\n  I think I can safely say that very few of the small businesses that I \nvisit in Detroit Lakes, MN, or Mankato or Minneapolis or Duluth can \navail themselves of the ``Bermuda Triangle.'' They cannot afford the \nbig-name tax lawyers and accountants to show them how to do their books \nEnron-style, but they probably would not want to anyway if it meant \nrenouncing their citizenship. So the price they pay for their good \ncitizenship is a higher tax bill.\n  I believe the Congress will close this tax loophole this year. There \nis growing support for doing so in the House. And I have introduced \nlegislation to close this loophole, and the Senate Finance Committee \nhas reported a version of this legislation, that I strongly support, \nthat would do so as well.\n  I say to the distinguished chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Defense, it is not appropriate for the Senate to close the tax \nloophole on this bill. This is not a tax bill, and I understand that. \nFrankly, I think the tax legislation that is going to pass is going to \nmake it clear that any company that is located in Bermuda forthwith, \nno matter when they incorporated, they are not going to be able to do \nit any longer. They are not going to be able to do it. We are going to \nclose that tax loophole.\n\n  But what is appropriate for us to say today--and this is my moderate \nversion; this is the Senator Wellstone moderate version--what is \nappropriate for us to say today is, if a U.S. company wants to bid for \na contract for U.S. defense work, it should not renounce its U.S. \ncitizenship for a tax break.\n  I am simply applying this to any corporation that incorporated after \nDecember 31, 2001. I am not even reaching back. I am saying, look, \neveryone has had the time now to understand, first, the unfairness and \nthe outrageousness of this from the point of view of who pays taxes, \nwho pays their fair share of taxes; and, second, everybody has had the \ntime to now understand what 9/11 meant to us, and any company, with \nthat background, that now continues to engage in this egregious \npractice--after December 31, 2001, and in the future--that is going to \nbasically say, ``We are renouncing our U.S. citizenship so we don't \nhave to pay taxes,'' no longer will be eligible for any procurement. \nThat really is what this amendment says.\n  We all make sacrifices in a time of war. The only sacrifice this \namendment asks of Federal contractors is that they pay their fair share \nof taxes like everybody else.\n  I say to my colleagues--and I say to the distinguished chair of the \ncommittee--that, look, I want to go after this tax loophole. Believe \nme, we will eliminate it. We will do it through the tax committee.\n  In the homeland defense bill on the House side, there is a tougher \nversion that reaches back. But I know in the House Defense \nappropriations bill there is no such provision such as the provision I \nam offering today.\n  So what I am saying to my colleagues--I guess I have a little bit\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\nmore; maybe it is because I am a Senator; maybe it is because of party \ncontrol, I don't know--I have a little bit more faith in what we will \ndo here. What I am saying to my colleagues is, I am giving you the \nmoderate version. I am giving you the most reasonable proposition.\n  We are only saying to Federal contractors: Pay your fair share of \ntaxes as does everybody else, and for now on--December 31, 2001, and \nforward--any of you companies, if you want to go to Bermuda and play \nthis shell game and renounce your citizenship, then you are not going \nto get our defense contracts. You are not going to get any of the \nprocurement.\n  This is really simple. This is really basic. This is really \nstraightforward. I think it would be a great shot across the bow and a \nreally powerful message, a really powerful and positive message, by the \nSenate to go on record with a strong vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I hope the Senator agrees that this \namendment can be set aside temporarily to accommodate the request of \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee who wishes to study the measure.\n  I can assure you, sir, this matter will be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Hawaii, I \nwould be pleased to honor his request. I also know that our colleague, \nSenator Stevens, from Alaska has an important engagement at the White \nHouse and will not be here for a while anyway and requested that he be \nhere before there be any vote. So we can set this amendment aside.\n  The only thing I want to say to my colleague from Hawaii is, I am \ncertainly pleased for the Finance Committee people to look at this \namendment. We will continue the debate, and we will have a vote. We \nwill have a recorded vote. I worked hard on what could be the most \ncentral, simple, compelling message that also is fair--maybe almost too \nfair, frankly--to some of these companies. This is the proposition. \nThis is the proposal.\n  So it is fine with me to put it aside, understanding full well that \nwe will continue the debate and have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. With that understanding, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis measure be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 4373 through 4386, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I have a list of amendments. These \namendments have been cleared by both managers and their staffs. No \nobjections have been voiced. Furthermore, these amendments do not add a \nsingle dollar to the bill.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4364\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am not going to call up the \namendment yet, unless the managers are ready to do so. If they are, I \nwill. I call up amendment No. 4364.\n  Madam President, I have spoken on this amendment and I wait for other \nSenators to come to the floor. It is a very simple amendment. What it \nwould do is bar the funds in this bill from being used to enter into \ncontracts with U.S. companies who incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. \ntaxes. Madam President, I went over this amendment before.\n  Let me add a couple of points so my colleagues know what my thinking \nis.\n  As I said, I wanted to keep it very simple. I want to keep it very \nbasic and very straightforward, and I think very fair.\n  I think there are two issues here. One of them has to do with tax \nfairness or tax unfairness. I think it is absolutely maddening when \npeople in our country see U.S. corporations using creative paperwork \nand then transforming themselves into Bermuda corporations so they do \nnot have to pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.\n  What I am saying is if these companies, post-December 31, 2001, have \nengaged in such a practice, and they no longer call themselves U.S. \ncitizens, then they are not beneficiaries of U.S. defense contracts. My \nthinking about this is as follows: I am thinking to myself, we are all \naware of 9/11 and what it meant to our country. I have given companies \ntime to respond in the positive to 9/11 and be the best of good \ncorporate citizens, be the best of good, patriotic corporate citizens. \nI even allowed some lag time after 9/11. But what I am saying is \nstarting the beginning of this year, if any of these companies have \nengaged in the same sham practices so they do not have to pay U.S. \ntaxes, they are not going to be the\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nbeneficiary of the public contracts. It really is that simple.\n\n  We all make sacrifices. God knows, many Americans are making \nsacrifices today. The only sacrifice this amendment asks of Federal \ncontractors is they pay their fair share of taxes like everybody else, \nand at the very minimum, given 9/11 and how strongly our country feels, \nno corporation from the beginning of the year on, engage in this kind \nof deceitful practice.\n  This is a narrowly tailored amendment; this is not a tax bill. Not in \nthe spirit of bragging but I will just say it, I know at least the \nfirst piece of legislation that eliminated this tax loophole I wrote, \nand we sent it to the Finance Committee. They did good work. The have \ndone great work. They reported out a bill that basically eliminates \nthis egregious loophole.\n  But what I am saying is until that loophole is eliminated, and no \ncompany is able to engage in this practice, what a great message for \nthe Senate to send.\n  When the homeland defense bill comes to the floor, I will join forces \nwith other colleagues--I am sure Senator Lieberman and others--and we \nwill do something parallel to what was done, to my understanding, in \nthe House of Representatives. But right now on this appropriations \nbill, knowing full well the House did not take any action, I am trying \nto be a legislator here. I thought to myself: I will narrowly tailor \nit. I will have it speak specifically to this 1-year appropriations \nbill. It will send a very unmistakable message. And I believe this \namendment will command widespread support.\n  I do not know whether we will have unanimous consent. The \ndistinguished chair of the Defense Appropriations Committee tells me \nthere is some opposition, in which case I am pleased to have the \ndebate. Then we will have a vote after the debate.\n\n  Again, this is the second time I have come to the floor. I want to be \nclear what this amendment is about and what it is not about. I hope \nthere will be very strong support on both sides of the aisle for this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, in order to expedite the consideration \nof this amendment, a call has been placed for Senators interested in \nthis matter to report to the floor to carry out the debate.\n  May I ask a question of the sponsor of this measure? By ``tax haven \ncountry,'' does the Senator mean countries such as Barbados, Bermuda, \nBritish Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Commonwealth of the Bahamas, \nCyprus, Gibralter, Isle of Man, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the \nPrincipality of Monaco, the Republic of Seychelles, and any other \ncountry that the Secretary of the Treasury determines is used as a site \nof incorporation, primarily for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the chairman, that is correct. I make it \nclear the Secretary of the Treasury, in addition to listing those \ncountries, if there is another country that he determines is using this \nsite of incorporation primarily to avoid U.S. taxation, that is \nincluded.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator's amendment also provides if the President of \nthe United States should consider that the interests of national \nsecurity would require it, notwithstanding this designation, they may \ndo business?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. INOUYE. How many companies are involved?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the distinguished chair, I do not really \nknow. Since I am talking about from the beginning of this year on, I do \nnot know how many companies are actually going to be affected by this. \nI do not reach back. I just simply say, post beginning of this year, it \nis completely inappropriate, given 9/11, given how everybody feels in \nthe country. I don't know how many companies are affected. I want to \nput every company on notice if they continue in this practice they are \nnot going to get the contracts.\n  Mr. INOUYE. May I ask another question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Please.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Am I correct, in the last fiscal year, approximately $2 \nbillion worth of contracts were awarded to companies incorporated in \nthese countries?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? At the moment \nthere is not.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senate is \nconsidering the Wellstone amendment. Is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4412 to Amendment No. 4364\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4412 to amendment No. 4364.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4412\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds made available in this Act for \n        payment on any new contract to any corporate expatriate)\n\n       Strike all after the first word:\n       Sec. 8124. Corporate Expatriates. (a) Limitation.--None of \n     the funds made available in this Act may be obligated for \n     payment on any new contract to a subsidiary of a publicly \n     traded corporation if the corporation is incorporated after \n     December 31, 2002 in a tax haven country but the United \n     States is the principal market for the public trading of the \n     corporation's stock.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of subsection (a), the term \n     ``tax haven country'' means each of the following: Barbados, \n     Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Commonwealth \n     of the Bahamas, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, the \n     Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco, \n     the Republic of the Seychelles, and any other country that \n     the Secretary of the Treasury determines is used as a site of \n     incorporation primarily for the purpose of avoiding United \n     States taxation.\n       (c) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) with \n     respect to any specific contract if the President certifies \n     to the Appropriations Committees of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate that the waiver is required in \n     the interest of national security.\n       (d) Effective one day after enactment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are colleagues who may very well \nhave some technical suggestions that don't change the import of this \namendment one bit. I certainly invite their consultation and their \nsupport which would help strengthen the amendment.\n  My understanding is that there may eventually be a vote to table the \namendment. I do not know. If so, I want to make sure one more time that \nI am crystal clear about what this amendment does and what it doesn't \ndo.\n  It is a simple amendment. It bars any funds in this bill from being \nused to enter into contracts with U.S. companies that incorporate \noverseas to avoid U.S. taxes. It is really simple.\n  Former U.S. companies that have renounced their citizenship--and \nSenator Inouye asked me about this--currently hold at least $2 billion \nworth of contracts with the Federal Government.\n  It seems to me the companies that play by the rules and that pay \ntheir fair share of taxes should not be forced to compete with the bad \nactors that undercut the bids through a tax loophole. I am saying, put \non notice all U.S. companies post-January 1: If you engage in this \negregious practice post-9/11 and you set up some sham business\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\nin Bermuda, et al, and therefore you don't pay any U.S. taxes, you \ndon't get any defense contracts.\n  I do not know. Maybe Senators want to vote against this proposition. \nBut I will tell you that this is pretty simple and it is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  These companies--and we know all about it--transform themselves into \nBermuda companies, which are basically shell corporations. They don't \nhave any staff. They don't have any offices. They don't have any \nbusiness activity. They exist for the sole purpose of shielding income \nfrom the IRS.\n  What these bad corporate former citizens do is exploit a specific \nloophole in current law so that the company is treated as a foreign \ncompany for tax purposes, and therefore they do not pay any U.S. taxes \non the foreign income. This loophole gives tens of millions of dollars \nin tax breaks to major multinational companies with significant non-\nU.S. business.\n  It also puts other companies that play by the rules at a complete \ndisadvantage. No American company, colleagues, should be penalized by \nstaying put. For now on--reaching back to the beginning of this year--\nno American company should be penalized for staying put in our country \nwhile others decide they are going to renounce U.S. citizenship for a \ntax break. It is just simply unacceptable.\n  I said it before, and I will say it again, there are a heck of a lot \nof businesses in Minnesota--small businesses and otherwise--that, No. \n1, wouldn't do it even if they could; and, No. 2, surely they do not \nhave all of the lawyers and accountants to show them how to do their \nbooks Enron-style and get away with not paying their fair share of \ntaxes. So the only price all the good corporate citizens pay--of which \nthere are many--is a higher tax bill.\n\n  I think we should close this loophole this year. I think we should \nclose the tax loophole this year. As I said before, I wrote a piece of \nlegislation to do that. I have worked with the Finance Committee. The \nFinance Committee, through the bipartisan work of Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, has reported out a good piece of legislation. And \nassuming it passes, this tax loophole will be gone.\n  But it seems to me, while this piece of legislation is on the floor, \nfor this 1 year, what a powerful and positive message for us to send \nwhich is, again, post-December 31, 2001--I don't even reach back--I \ngive companies enough time to respond to 9/11, and say: Wait a minute, \nthis is not the right thing to do or patriotic thing to do. But I will \ntell you something, post-December 31st of last year, if a U.S. company \nhas set up a sham corporation, so it does not have to pay part of its \nfair share of taxes, it is not going to be eligible for defense \ncontracts. It is really that simple.\n  So, again, I don't see colleagues out here to debate this. I \nunderstand there is opposition. I say to both of my colleagues, Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens, I am certainly not trying to delay the \npassage of this overall Defense appropriations bill.\n  I think I have a good amendment on the floor, and I look forward to \ndebate or I would look forward to constructive suggestions from other \nSenators if they think there is a way to strengthen this amendment.\n  I am not backing off on the basic proposition here. I am not backing \noff on the basic proposition. And the basic proposition, again--and I \nthink we are going to do the same thing on the homeland defense bill. \nIt was done in the House. In fact, it was broader, more sweeping on the \nHouse side on homeland defense.\n  This is 1 year. This is Department of Defense appropriations. This is \nnot a tax amendment that I have offered to this piece of legislation. \nThat would not be appropriate. But I do think it is appropriate to put \nevery single U.S. corporation on notice, forthwith, reaching back to \nthe beginning of this year, given the unfairness of this, given the \nobviousness of the ways in which companies are not paying their fair \nshare of taxes, and, more importantly, given all that has happened to \nour country post 9/11: You are not going to be able to do this any \nlonger. And if you do, you are not going to then be able to come to the \nU.S. Department of Defense and get defense contracts.\n  That is what this amendment says. It is simple. It is \nstraightforward. I am, frankly, at a loss to understand the opposition.\n  Senator Inouye asked me an important question. He wanted to go over \nsome of the countries, some of the tax-haven countries that were listed \nhere. And we went through them.\n  But there is also additional language that says there could be other \ncountries that the Secretary of Treasury determines have been used as a \nsite of a corporation primarily for the purpose of avoiding U.S. \ntaxation. So we really write it the right way.\n  Then, of course, there is the waiver where the President may waive \nthis with respect to any specific contract if the President certifies \nto the Appropriations Committees of the House and the Senate that the \nwaiver is required in the interest of national security.\n  I will tell you something: This is very straightforward. I thank my \ncolleague from Hawaii for asking me these questions. I would love to \nadopt this on a 100-to-0 vote or to have a debate if colleagues want to \ncome out here and speak against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask some questions to my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Are you aware of some of the Federal contracts that corporate \nrunaways now hold? Let me give an example. Are you aware that Foster \nWheeler, who was reincorporated in Bermuda about a year ago, has \nFederal contracts amounting to $286,253,000?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say to the whip that I have \nhere a list of corporate runaways, and I am aware of this one of many \negregious examples.\n  Mr. REID. To run through some of these to kind of get a picture of \nthe substance of the Senator's amendment, is the Senator aware that \nTyco Company reincorporated in Bermuda and has Federal contracts of \n$224 million-plus in Fiscal Year 2001 alone?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that PricewaterhouseCoopers Monday, \nwho spun off of PricewaterhouseCoopers of New York and incorporated in \nBermuda a couple of months ago, has Fiscal Year 2001 Federal contracts \nof almost $221 million? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, unfortunately, I have the same \nlist with many egregious examples.\n  Mr. REID. I would like the Senator to acknowledge if we have the same \nlist; for example, Ingersoll-Rand, which reincorporated 6, 7 months ago \nin Bermuda, has Fiscal Year 2001 Federal contracts of over $40 million?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am aware of this. Could I just add, I am aware of \nthis, but more importantly, the American citizens are aware of this, \nand people don't like it one bit. People feel as if, first of all, it \nis just outrageous in terms of tax evasion. And, second of all, it is a \nloophole that should not be about. People say, look, boy, this is the \nopposite of the right and patriotic thing to do.\n  Mr. REID. I will not go through the entire list because the Senator \nand I both have the same list. It was compiled by the Federal \nProcurement and Data Center off their Web site. The amounts are over $1 \nbillion, just on this short list we have, of companies that go to \nBermuda and avoid paying taxes like other companies that are \nincorporated in the United States and work hard and pay their fair \nshare of taxes. I certainly applaud the Senator's amendment. I hope we \ncan dispose of this quickly. I think the debate has been good and \ndirectly to the point. I would really think it would be hard to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague and whip that I appreciate his \nquestions. If there is going to be agreement, we are going to pass this \namendment on the floor of the Senate. I say great. The summary of this \namendment is that it is appropriate for the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to say today that if a U.S. company wants\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\nto bid for a contract for U.S. defense work, then it should not \nrenounce its U.S. citizenship for a tax break. It is that simple. We \nare just putting everybody on notice: You are no longer going to be \nable to do that. You will not be able to make a bid for a contract for \nU.S. defense work if you are going to go out and renounce your \ncitizenship for the purposes of getting a tax break. It couldn't be \nsimpler.\n  I am going to stay on the floor of the Senate or stand on the floor \nof the Senate and keep talking about this until we get a vote or until \nwe get acceptance of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a list of corporate \nrunaways and fiscal year 2001 Federal contracts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Corporate Runaways and FY2001 Federal Contracts\n\n       Foster Wheeler: Clinton, N.J. engineering, environmental \n     and construction company re-incorporated in Bermuda on May \n     25, 2001.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $286,253,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $248,835,000.\n       accenture: Consulting firm spun off of Arthur Anderson of \n     Chicago and incorporated in Bermuda in July, 2001.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $281,904,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $144,834,000.\n       tyco: Exeter, N.H. electronics, security, healthcare and \n     engineering conglomerate reincorporated in Bermuda in March, \n     1997.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $224,171,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $182,453,000.\n       PricewaterhouseCoopers Monday: Consulting firm spun off of \n     PricewaterhouseCoopers of New York and incorporated in \n     Bermuda on March 27, 2002.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $220,801,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $129,073,000.\n       Ingersoll-Rand: Woodcliff Lake, N.J. industrial equipment, \n     construction and security company reincorporated in Bermuda \n     on December 31, 2001.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $40,289,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $39,328,000.\n       apw: Waukesha, Wisconsin electronics and technology \n     products reincorporated in Bermuda in July 2000.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $7,077,000\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $4,912,000.\n       Cooper Industries: Houston electrical equipment tool and \n     hardware company reincorporated in Bermuda on May 21, 2002.\n       Total FY2001 Federal Contracts: $6,357,000.\n       Defense and Homeland Security related: $5,954,000.\n       Stanley: New Britain, Connecticut tool maker voted to \n     reincorporate in Bermuda on May 9, 2002.

I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will my colleague and friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I haven't seen a list. I am trying to \nfigure out what companies would be impacted by that. Do you have a copy \nthat maybe you might share with other Senators?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me say to my colleague that there are two parts to \nthis equation. The first part is the definition of ``tax haven \ncountries.'' There is Barbados, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman \nIslands, British Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and so \non. Then the additional language where, because we want to have \nflexibility, we also say: or any other country that the Secretary of \nTreasury--these countries listed in the amendment--are the main tax \nhaven countries.\n  In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury could determine that there \nis another country that has been used at the site of incorporation for \nthe purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation. That is No. 1.\n  The second part of this--to give the operational definition--is that \nthis would be any U.S. company that set up this phony citizenship \npost--actually, December 31.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I am asking for a list of \ncompanies--not countries--that have done this egregious deed of \nreincorporating in some other country.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I sent the list over to you. I think you have a list \nthat lists some of the companies that would be affected by this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me get that in question----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. These are the countries that reincorporated.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Accenture reincorporated in July of 2001. Your deadline \nis January 1, so it would not apply.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It would apply to only those companies--what I am \ntrying to do----\n  Mr. NICKLES. I found one. PricewaterhouseCoopers evidently \nreincorporated in Bermuda on March 27, 2002; is that correct, according \nto your sheet?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. They do defense contracts of $220 million and total \nFederal contracts in defense and homeland security-related, $129 \nmillion; is that correct?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am trying to follow the list and where the Senator \nis.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I got this from you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is right. You mentioned it, but I have to go down \nand find it in the column.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am trying to figure out who we are trying to punish \nhere.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, if I could, since he asked the \nquestion--let me say this and be real clear about it. I wrote probably \nthe first legislation here eliminating this action and that is moving \nthrough the Finance Committee and it will come to the floor. I hope in \nthe future all these companies will be covered, period.\n  Second, if you want to reach back, you can do so and that would be \njust fine with me. My thinking is that I took a look at--I am thinking \nof two issues. No. 1, just sort of this loophole and, No. 2, I think of \n9/11 and I say, look, given 9/11, you can give companies some \nflexibility to understand that it doesn't seem very patriotic to \ncontinue to do this.\n  For God's sake, from the beginning of this year on, all companies--\nanybody that does this in the future is in trouble.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, I found a guilty \nparty--PricewaterhouseCoopers. I will say I had no idea--I have read in \nthe paper, and I heard about Stanley and Ingersoll-Rand. I didn't find \nsomebody--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. You will find a number of them.\n  Mr. NICKLES.--guilty as under your provision. PricewaterhouseCoopers \nis a $220 million contractor. That is pretty significant.\n\n  Let me ask you a question. PricewaterhouseCoopers does a lot of \nbusiness, evidently, with the Department of Defense, homeland security, \nand other Federal contractors. They would be banned from all Federal \ncontracts--or only Federal contracts dealing with Department of \nDefense?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Department of Defense.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So now we are down to $129 million worth of contracts. \nIf they do those contracts with U.S. employees, do they pay taxes on \ntheir U.S. contracts if they make income--I mean, if they make income, \ndon't they pay corporate income tax on the contracts they have in the \nUnited States?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So they do pay income tax?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is right. But there is a portion of the tax that \nthey should be paying that they are deliberately evading. That is \nunacceptable. If that is their practice--and that is what this \namendment does--don't expect to be getting these contracts any longer.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me make sure I understand. So this company, which \ndoes a lot of work--they do software,\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nmanagement, and a lot of different things--is doing $129 million worth \nof defense-related contracts, they would be banned from any of those \ncontracts; is that correct?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Under the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct if, but only if, after all we have \nbeen through as a country, they basically renounce their citizenship \nand set up some sham/dummy corporation in Bermuda to avoid taxes--only \nif they do that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Whoa, whoa.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. They are welcome to come back home, in which case they \nare eligible for all of this.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, but don't they pay U.S. income \ntaxes on every penny of the contract they have with the Department of \nDefense?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. They do. So if they incorporate in Bermuda, or Barbados, \nor someplace else, they might try to not pay U.S. taxes on foreign \nincome, but they are already required, under present law, to pay U.S. \ntaxes on U.S. income; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am told--I say to my colleague, I am not a tax \nexpert--they may not actually pay all their taxes on U.S. contracts. \nBut, in addition, what is egregious about this--and I say to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, if he wants to vote no, he can vote no. This \nis a pretty simple proposition, which is, if you are going to renounce \nyour U.S. citizenship so you can locate in some other country where you \ndon't do business so you can avoid paying part of the taxes you should \nbe paying so that other businesses and other companies and other \nAmericans have to pay those taxes, you renounce your citizenship and \nyou will not be eligible for these defense contracts. It is that \nsimple.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There are 200-some-odd-million-dollars' worth of \ncontracts. There is no prohibition right now that I know of that would \nkeep a foreign company from doing the same work that \nPricewaterhouseCoopers is doing, or some other company, so a French \ncompany or a German company could pick up this contract that we are \ngoing to foreclose from PricewaterhouseCoopers, or somebody else and, \ncorrect me if I am wrong, under the Senator's amendment a German \ncompany could do it, and 100 percent of those employees could be in \nGermany and do 100 percent of this work and there would be no U.S. \nincome tax--I take that back. I will rephrase this. This is a $129 \nmillion PricewaterhouseCoopers contract and they would be barred, so \nnow those contracts would be open. There is nothing to prohibit a Swiss \ncompany, a German company, a French company, Israeli company, or any \nother company worldwide from doing that work, and those jobs might be \ndomiciled someplace else in the U.S.; isn't that correct?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  But I say to my colleague, this is about American companies. I am \ngoing to be clear about that. This is about an egregious practice. This \nis about good corporate citizenship. This is about being patriotic and \nabout saying to these companies, in all due respect, you can come back \nhome. You don't need to renounce your citizenship, in which case you \nare eligible. But if you continue to exploit this egregious tax \nloophole, then you are not going to be eligible. It is that simple.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments on \nthe legislation. My colleague mentioned that he is not on the Finance \nCommittee. This is an item that has jurisdiction in the Finance \nCommittee. Of late, I think maybe we don't use the committees anymore. \nI am kind of shocked that the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee are not here saying, wait a minute, we are dealing \nwith this issue. Actually, I believe an amendment has been reported out \non this issue, but it is a different amendment.\n  We are dealing with taxation issues. My colleague from Minnesota \nalready admitted--and it happens to be factual--if you do business in \nthe United States and you are a U.S. company, at 100 percent you pay \ntaxes on that contract, period. And if you are domiciled in Bermuda and \nyou do a U.S. contract, you pay 100-percent corporate taxes. What we \nare talking about is a differential of taxes of international taxation \nof foreign source income, not U.S. contracts.\n  We are using U.S. contracts and threatening thousands of U.S. jobs \nthat, if this amendment is adopted--and I hope it is not--these jobs \nmay be done elsewhere because there is nothing in this amendment that \nsays other companies in other countries need not apply. They are not \ngoing to be prohibited.\n  We may well have a situation, as absurd as it sounds, of: Oh, we are \nsorry, you do not pay enough in foreign taxes on foreign source income; \ntherefore, we are going to deny you U.S. contracts. And now we are \ngoing to export U.S. jobs.\n  I am not sure that makes sense. Let me be very clear. My colleague \nfrom Minnesota agreed with me, U.S. companies, whether domiciled in \nBermuda or not, if they do U.S. contracts with the Department of \nDefense or any U.S. contracts, they pay U.S. corporate income taxes, \nperiod. They pay U.S. taxes, period. There would be U.S. taxes paid on \nevery dime of this contract.\n  We are really dealing with foreign international taxes, a very \ncomplicated issue, one that should be dealt with appropriately in the \ntaxation committee, not on the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill, not where people do not know what we are talking about when we \ntalk about foreign source income.\n  On occasion, this Senate should rise and say this is not the way to \nlegislate. I understand the beautiful demagoguery that somebody is able \nto say--and I have read in the papers--look at those companies, they \nare leaving the country, turning their backs. I do not know I agree \nwith that statement.\n  I will give an example. I do not know that much about Stanley. It is \na Connecticut-based toolmaker. They took a lot of flack. Stanley \ndecided they got enough pressure, and they rescinded their corporate \nmove, or they were contemplating going to Bermuda, and they rescinded \nit. PR-wise, this is bad news if a company tries to reincorporate in \nBermuda or anyplace else--I do not know why my colleague included \nCyprus. I never considered Cyprus a tax haven.\n  Stanley decided not to reincorporate in Bermuda. I do know that if \nthey did incorporate in Bermuda, for every contract they had with the \nDepartment of Defense, they would pay 100 percent U.S. corporate income \ntaxes--100 percent. They would pay as much as Nickles Machine \nCorporation would.\n  This is an easy issue to demagog, but it is a complicated issue in \ntax policy. The Finance Committee, of which I happen to be a member, \nand Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus have worked on a bill. It is \nnot perfect, but it is a much better approach than what we have before \nthe Senate today.\n  To say you cannot get the jobs--I do not know, I am sure \nPricewaterhouseCoopers has thousands of employees. I am sure they have \nsome employees my State. I am not sure they have employees in every \nState, but they have a lot of employees, and those are employees in the \nUnited States. They pay U.S. taxes.\n  Should we say they should be denied any Federal contract or any \nDepartment of Defense contract? I am not ready to say that. They may \nwell be providing goods and services--$129 million to DOD or $220 \nmillion--that are very much needed. As a matter of fact, they are \nprobably doing jobs that Arthur Andersen used to do. So we need more \naccounting consulting companies.\n  Should they be totally debarred? That is a pretty serious penalty. \nDebarment is usually a penalty for pretty egregious conduct such as \nfraud or criminal liability, not necessarily moving a headquarters.\n  I know a lot of companies incorporate in the State of Delaware. All \nacross the country companies incorporate in the State of Delaware. \nThere must be some advantage in incorporating in the State of Delaware. \nI am amazed at the number of corporate headquarters in Delaware. Is \nthat for income tax evasion? I do not know. I do not think so. But \nshould we deny them contracts? I am not sure. I darn sure question the \nwisdom of saying all Government contracts will be banned.\n\n  Maybe there should be a penalty if people reincorporate in Bermuda to\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\navoid foreign taxes. Should that penalty be taxation? Right now this \npenalty is total debarment from Federal contracts. I question that \npenalty. I am not sure that is the right penalty. Maybe there should be \na better way. Maybe we should reconsider foreign taxation and make sure \nwe are competitive.\n  I know in some countries they are growing, and growing dramatically \nbecause their international taxation picture is much better than ours. \nTake, for example, Ireland. They have reduced their international \ntaxation, and they happen to be growing. There are other countries that \nhave done quite well because they have a low tax structure. God bless \nthem. I am proud of them.\n  Should we say that anybody who happens to have a headquarters in \nthose facilities, but also has a branch in the United States, should be \ndenied any business in the United States and automatically export those \njobs to other countries? I do not think so. I just question the wisdom \nof the amendment.\n  I know the amendment is well intended. I know it is populist. I know \nit is very comfortable to beat these companies up, and maybe some \nrightfully so. But I am not sure that total debarment from any Federal \ncontract of those employees who work for those companies and are going \nto find themselves unemployed because we just said they cannot do \nGovernment work, when they pay taxes on that Government work, I am not \nso sure that is the right penalty.\n  I have serious reservations about my colleague's amendment. I am not \nso sure that we should adopt it. I am sure it does not belong on this \nbill. If we are going to deal with taxation issues, I think it should \ncome out of the Finance Committee and be dealt with on a tax bill, not \non a Federal procurement bill.\n  The amendment reaches pretty far. I hope people will start taking a \nlook at it. I am trying to see who is covered by this. Let me find \nanother company. I do not want to mention just one company.\n  Ingersoll-Rand, I noticed, incorporated in Bermuda on December 31. \nThat happens to fall on the Senator's date. I read his language.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, maybe they should be, but they \nare not. It is after December 31.\n  Mr. NICKLES. They made it by 1 day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator wants to make it tougher, we will make \nit tougher.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am trying to figure out what we are doing. Let's take \nIngersoll-Rand. Ingersoll-Rand will not be covered. They would not be \ndebarred. This is very interesting. Ingersoll-Rand makes heavy \nindustrial equipment. I know that because I used to be in the heavy \nindustrial equipment business. Actually, I was a competitor with \nIngersoll-Rand at one time.\n  Ingersoll-Rand does about $40 million worth of contracts. They have a \nlot of employees in the United States. They have employees in my State \nof Oklahoma. Ingersoll-Rand has a plant in Tulsa, OK. They would be \ndebarred from doing any work with the Federal Government. No, they \nwould not because they incorporated on December 31. Cooper Industries \ncompetes with Ingersoll-Rand. They reincorporated in Bermuda on May 21. \nThey probably did it because Ingersoll-Rand did it. They compete. They \nare competitors. So one company got in and will not be affected by \ndebarment; they would not lose $40 million worth of contracts.\n\n  Cooper Industries, on the other hand, is doing about $6 million worth \nof contracts. They would be debarred because they reincorporated on May \n21. So here we have two competing industries, one of which made it in \nunder the wire, and so they are not denied $40 million worth of \ncontracts, but their competitor--I believe their principal competitor--\nwould be debarred for $6 million.\n  That is a little troublesome. Both have a lot of employees in the \nUnited States. I notice Cooper Industries--I know my colleague from \nTexas is here--is headquartered in Texas. I know they have thousands of \nemployees in the United States. I know they pay Federal income taxes on \nevery single dime of these contracts.\n  I guess that is what bothers me. I believe there is a \nmisunderstanding that if somebody reincorporates in Bermuda they will \nnot pay U.S. taxes on U.S. contracts, and that is false. They will pay \nU.S. taxes on U.S. contracts. To have a penalty that says if they \nreincorporate in Bermuda because they want to avoid taxation on foreign \nsource income and we are going to debar them from U.S. contracts and \nmaybe cost thousands of jobs domestically, that is very shortsighted \nand probably not the right solution.\n  Maybe the right solution would be we would work through the \nappropriate committees and try to discourage people from relocating in \nBermuda. Maybe we can make our tax structure more competitive \ninternationally.\n  I have been on the Finance Committee for a long time. Those of us who \nhave looked at it for years have said we need to relook at \ninternational taxation.\n  We are not competitive internationally. We encourage jobs to go \noverseas because of our international posture. If we do not fix it, we \nare going to continue encouraging people to relocate. The amendment of \nmy colleague from Minnesota is going to exacerbate that problem. He \nwill, in effect, be denying contracts to a lot of U.S. firms that have \njobs in the United States that pay taxes on these contracts.\n  I am afraid the net result is competitors from other countries, with \nemployees in other countries, are going to be competitive and win these \ncontracts, and the net loss is we are not only not going to get U.S. \ntaxes on these contracts, we are going to have employees go overseas.\n  The amendment may be very well intended politically, and my \ncompliments to my colleague from Minnesota. It is a very popular \namendment. It looks good, it is populist, but I think it is bad tax \npolicy. I think tax policy should be done in the Finance Committee, not \non the floor of the Senate on a Department of Defense bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Minnesota that \nthis amendment is a good amendment. U.S. corporations have to pay \ncorporate taxes on what they earn here in the United States and on what \nthey earn in other countries. But foreign corporations only have to pay \ntaxes on what they earn in the U.S. So a lot of U.S. companies figured \nout that if they move their corporate papers overseas but leave their \noperations and employees and everything else here in the United States, \nthey can get off the hook for most of their taxes.\n  Tyco did that. It incorporated in Bermuda in 1997 and saved $400 \nmillion a year in taxes. Just by going across the water to file \nreincorporation papers. Stanley Works did the same thing and saved $30 \nmillion annually; Cooper Industries, $55 million, Ingersoll Rand, $440 \nmillion annually.\n  These companies get all the benefits of being U.S. corporations, and \ntheir stocks are mostly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, but they \nare escaping U.S. taxes. That means that you and I have to make up the \ndifference. I think the Senator from Minnesota is on the right track.\n  To show this is not some bizarre, ridiculous amendment, look at what \nthe State of California did. The State of California is usually on the \ncutting edge of what is going on in this country because they are \nalmost a country unto themselves. Thirty-five million people live in \nCalifornia. The State of California announced last week that corporate \nexpatriates are no longer eligible to hold State government contracts. \nThat is California, where over 10 percent of the people in this country \nlive. It is one State, and that State recognizes what is being done is \nwrong.\n\n  Also, in the House of Representatives, which is evenly divided \nbasically between the Republicans and Democrats, 318 Members voted for \nan amendment that is substantially similar to Senator Wellstone's \namendment.\n  Another thing. This amendment does not absolutely bar these companies \nfrom holding government contracts, as my very good friend from Oklahoma \nsaid. These companies can change this in a matter of a couple of hours. \nAll they have to do is come back to the U.S., where they came from, and \nreincorporate again in America. That is\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nthe patriotic thing to do. That is the right thing to do. They cannot \nhave it both ways.\n  Why do they do this?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will yield in a little bit.\n  They do it because turning their back on their country in their \ncountry's hour of need makes their profit margins look better. The \nprocess they use is complicated. As I said before, the foreign \ncorporations, the expatriates, only owe taxes on their U.S. income. But \ncompanies that never left the U.S. owe taxes on both their U.S. income \nand their foreign income. Although the U.S. government does give them a \ntax credit in the amount of any foreign tax on the profits, which \nprevents double taxation. So incorporating outside the United States \neases--and I have gone through the list of how it eases--a \ncorporation's tax liability.\n  Expatriates also often engage in earnings stripping, it is called. \nEarnings stripping occurs when a foreign corporation legally funnels \nits U.S. earnings outside the United States without paying taxes in the \nUnited States. The two main avenues they do this with are: First, a \nU.S. subsidiary can borrow a substantial amount of money from the \nforeign parent corporation and make large interest payments to the \nforeign parent. The interest is considered a business expense and is \nthen not taxable under the United States Code.\n  What else can they do? The U.S. subsidiary may make other payments to \nthe foreign corporation for royalties or intellectual property payments \nor for other purposes. These payments many times seem grossly out of \nproportion to the service that foreign corporation actually renders.\n  For instance, the U.S. branch of one expatriate company paid its \nparent company royalties in an amount of about 4 percent of its total \nrevenue just for the right to use the company's name. That is a little \nout of line, I would think. The payment got routed through the Swiss \nbranch of the company's Luxembourg holding corporation, which is a \nwholly-owned subsidiary of the Bermuda parent company. All to ensure \nthat the company takes advantage of every conceivable tax break \npossible. Under the current Tax Code, that is a business expense and is \nnontaxable under the United States Code. And because of an existing tax \ntreaty between the United States and Switzerland, the payments are not \nsubject to Swiss taxes either. So they got to move that 4 percent of \ntheir total revenues out of the U.S. without incurring any U.S. \ncorporate taxes on it. That's a relatively tame example of how earnings \nstripping works.\n  So I say to my friend from Minnesota, these companies that run \noffshore to tax havens get all the benefits of doing business in the \nUnited States, and they do not have to pay like other corporations.\n  I also say that every time a bill comes up, they say it should be \nunder the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. We should have a \ncommittee of the whole, and we should all become members of the Finance \nCommittee. It seems, they say, everything should be taken through that.\n\n  I do not believe that is proper. The jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee is fairly well restricted. I say to anyone within the sound \nof my voice, we have a committee system and we do our very best to \nfollow it, but there are certain things that come up as we do \nlegislation that demand not a lot of committee hearings. This is one of \nthose instances.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is on the cutting edge of what we should \nbe doing legislatively. It is important we are doing this. And the talk \nabout how it's too bad that we're barring this poor company from \nholding government contracts. If it is so bad for them, let them come \nback to the United States and reincorporate, and they will have all the \nbenefits they did before. But they cannot have it both ways. They \ncannot have all of these--I refer to them as shady deals. I have gone \nover a couple that I pinpointed, and I think they are significant.\n  I also say to those who were listening to the prior debate, they are \nreally feeling bad about the consulting branch of \nPricewaterhouseCoopers. They shouldn't worry. PwC announced today that \nit was being sold to IBM, which is a U.S. corporation. IBM, the new \nparent company, is a U.S. corporation. That takes care of the problem, \nas far as I understand it. I think that solves the big problem there.\n  So we have, as far as I am concerned, a very valid amendment. I \nunderstand my friend from Oklahoma. He is someone for whom I have the \ndeepest respect, and he is always in tune with the business community's \nneeds and wants. And I do not say that in any negative way. He was a \nbusinessman before he came to the Senate, and he has not lost that. I \nunderstand how he believes they should always be given a fair shot, and \nI believe they are in this instance. The business community is being \ngiven a fair shot. In fact, I think this is a gunshot across their bow \nthat they should come back to this country again. This is what they \nshould do, and I think they should plug these tax loopholes and end \nthese tax havens. If the Finance Committee wants to do more, let them \ndo more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 10 seconds because I know \nthe Senator from Texas wants to speak, and then I will respond later \nbefore the vote. I first want to thank the whip and make a technical \npoint.\n  Actually, contracts are not----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief question without his \nlosing the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator agree that these monies that they are not \npaying, avoiding taxes in this country, are going in many instances to \nline the pockets of its fat cat corporate executives?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to the whip, I am trying to be a moderate \ntoday. I do not know whether I want to respond to that question, but it \nsounds to me as if the question is going in the right direction.\n  I point out that I do not really think this is a big issue, but \ntechnically--I have already thanked about four or five times both \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley for moving this bill. I introduced \nthe bill that says we ought to eliminate this egregious tax loophole. \nTechnically, the Finance Committee does not have jurisdiction over \ncontracts. Let me make that clear.\n  Second, let me also make one other thing clear: That to the people in \nthe coffee shops in Minnesota and the coffee shops in all of our \nStates, American citizens, this whole jurisdictional battle is not \nreally all that important to them. They believe if these companies are \ngoing to renounce their citizenship, go abroad, set up these dummy \ncorporations--and by the way, quite often they use those new structures \nto shift earnings from the U.S. branch to the foreign branch so they do \nnot have to pay their fair share of taxes--and that could include \nearnings from Government contracts--that they do not pay their fair \nshare of taxes. Frankly, most people in the country say: Come home, \ndeclare your American citizenship, then you are eligible. If not, you \nare not. It is that simple.\n  I hope this amendment will have a strong vote. I can talk a lot more \nabout it, but I know my colleague from Texas is in the Chamber, and I \nalways look forward to what he has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if you are trying to get cheers in coffee \nshops, this is an excellent amendment. If you are trying to make law in \nthe greatest capitalistic country in the history of the world, a \ncountry that more than any other country on Earth has had companies \noperating in other countries, come to America and gradually move the \nbulk of their business to our country over the years in order to \nbenefit from the fact we have better laws and lower tax rates, then \nthis is a very bad amendment.\n  Let me make it clear. I don't have any sympathy for people who are \ntransferring where their company is domiciled to try to get a tax \nadvantage. But I would make the following points. Whether a company is \ndomiciled in Barbados, Germany, Ireland, or Saudi Arabia, the IRS Code \nis very clear on one thing. Section 881 of the IRS Code says any income \neffectively connected with the United States is taxed in the United \nStates of America.\n  When companies are relocating--and I noticed Ireland is not listed \nhere even\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nthough Ireland is a major relocation center for companies all over \nAmerica because they have very low tax rates on business, and I \ncongratulate them for being smart enough to do that--we double tax \ndividend income, we double tax the income on corporate America. It is \nnot an enlightened policy, and in my opinion, we should not do it.\n  This is the point. Under section 881 of the IRS Code, if you earn \nincome in America, you are taxed here. Companies are seeking \njurisdictions where they get more favorable overall tax treatment, \nincluding tax treatment on their foreign earnings. I don't have \nsympathy for companies that do this, but the plain truth is they are \ndoing it. The plain truth is by affecting Government procurement, this \namendment is GATT illegal and violates GATT.\n  Also, it is astounding to me that we would want to give one \nindividual, the Secretary of the Treasury, the power to unilaterally \ndisbar any company that is domiciled in a foreign country. Under this \namendment, we outline all these countries that we are saying are tax \nhavens, and then we add any other country that the Secretary of the \nTreasury determines is used as a site of a corporation primarily for \nthe purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation.\n  As I pointed out, you do not avoid U.S. tax by changing where your \ncompany is domiciled because the IRS Code requires income earned in the \nUnited States is taxed here.\n  What companies do, however, is they get a more favorable environment. \nWhat we should be doing is looking at our corporate tax structure and \ntrying to become more competitive.\n  The amendment gives the Secretary of the Treasury unilateral power to \ndisbar any company that is domiciled in a foreign country from selling \ngoods to the Defense Department.\n  I understand politics. I once was engaged in it. I have now given it \nup. But I understand it is very good politics to basically attack \npeople who are operating in foreign countries that have low tax rates, \nthat we choose to call tax havens. I long for America to be a tax \nhaven. I long for us to get back to the situation we once had where \ncompanies were moving out of Germany, Italy, and Britain to domicile in \nthe United States of America because we had favorable tax treatment. I \ndon't remember us thinking it was a bad deal then. We thought it was a \ngood deal.\n  I had not heard the business about giving up your citizenship. This \nthing has nothing to do with citizenship. If Stanley Works changes \ntheir domicile, the people who own Stanley Works do not change their \ncitizenship. The people that run Stanley Works do not change their \ncitizenship. I don't know from where that comes from. That has nothing \nto do with this debate.\n\n  Now, we had a debate once where people were giving up their American \ncitizenship to avoid death taxes. Fortunately, we have passed a tax cut \nthat eliminates death taxes and some of us want to make that \nelimination permanent. You can be guaranteed that will never happen \nagain if our elimination of the death tax becomes permanent.\n  Now, I conclude by saying I don't have any doubt about the fact that \nif this is brought to a vote it will pass. We are in an environment \nwhere slapping businesses around is good politics. Talking about \ndenying procurement opportunities to companies domiciled in other \ncountries is always popular until you remember that we sell more \nmilitary equipment to foreign countries than any other country in the \nworld--and more than every other country in the world combined.\n  Under the IRS Code, you have to pay American income taxes on income \nearned in America. If you are domiciled somewhere else, you do not have \nto pay American taxes on income earned in another country.\n  This amendment is not good public policy. I hope we can find a way of \ndealing with this. I am very reluctant to see this amendment pass. On \nthe other hand, if this amendment had to be clotured, we would be \ntalking about 2 days before we would have an opportunity to do it. I \nhope people who are managing the bill can find some way out of this. I \ndon't think anyone really believes this issue belongs on this Defense \nbill. I think this is something we ought to be discussing at the \nauthorization level. This is an appropriations bill.\n  Our goal as taxpayers is to procure the best stuff we can for \nmilitary use at the lowest possible price. I know that is not a popular \nview, but it is a rational view, whether it is popular or not.\n  This amendment is GATT illegal. It will be subject to retaliation if \nit actually becomes law. I don't know that anyone here is serious about \nit becoming law.\n  In any case, if you want to pick a debating point for the local high \nschool and you get to pick which side you will be on, you want to pick \nthis topic, and you want to pick Senator Wellstone's side.\n  But in terms of public policy, this is an amendment that is bad \npublic policy. While it is easy to attack companies that are domiciled \nin other countries, especially countries with low tax rates, the bottom \nline is, for most of the 220-odd-year history of America, we have been \nthe tax haven. We have had companies move from other countries to \nAmerica seeking lower taxes and better opportunity.\n  How much better our time would be spent if we were debating ways to \nmake America more competitive rather than trying to build walls around \nour country to try to keep capital in. What a far cry this is from the \nbasic American approach, which has been to have an environment that is \nso favorable to investment and capital creation and wealth that other \ncountries have to try to build walls around themselves to keep their \ncapital in. Now we are talking about building walls around America to \nkeep people from taking capital out.\n  I understand it is easy for us to say: Look, we think you should not \nuse your money in a way that you view as most efficient. We know more \nabout your money than you do. We did not invest it, we did not save it, \nwe did not risk it, but we are perfectly capable of telling you how to \ndo it.\n  I think, again, if we are debating this in terms of popular hoorah, \nwe are basically saying that in a free country someone who owns wealth \ncannot take that wealth out of the country and invest it and still have \nthe right to engage in commerce--which we grant to companies in Germany \nand Ireland and Czechoslovakia. We are going to take that position \nbecause right now slapping around people who are trying to engage in \nbusiness is popular. It may be popular, but I do not think it is good \npublic policy. We should be debating how we can change our laws so that \nno company would ever want to move out of the United States. But if \nthey want to move out of the United States, you either believe in \nfreedom or you do not--and I do.\n  So I wish they did not find it desirable to do it. I wish Stanley \nWorks would keep their headquarters in America. But I have to say I am \nnot an investor in Stanley Works. Now TIAA-CREF, my teacher retirement, \nmay invest in Stanley Works. But so far as I know, I do not own any \nStanley Works stock. So who am I to be trying to tell them where they \nput their money? I may not like how they do it, just like I do not like \nit when people waste their money. I have never understood why people \nbuy lottery tickets. But I know it sends some people to college and it \nis a free country. If they want to do it, let them do it.\n  I never understood why people go out and spend their money buying a \nlot of different things that I do not value. People might not \nunderstand why I want to own a whole bunch of shotguns, more than I \nwill ever pull the trigger on, but it is a free country and you either \nbelieve in freedom or you do not.\n  Now, some freedom is not popular. Here today on the floor of the \nSenate, the freedom to take your wealth that you created and put at \nrisk and invest it in any one of the following countries--Gibralter, \nCyprus, and others. I don't know why we are picking on Cyprus. I \nthought we were trying to make peace there. I thought we were trying to \ncreate jobs for both the Greeks and the Turks. But it is popular to \nsay, today: It is your money, you earned it, you put it at risk, but \nyou can't invest it in Cyprus and have the freedom to engage in \ninternational commerce and sell to the U.S. Government.\n  I know that is popular today, but the question is, Is it right? What \nif it were our money, if we owned these companies as public companies, \nand if this were really a socialistic country? I\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nknow some dream of it being that, but it is not. Thank God. Thank you, \nsweet Jesus, it is not. The commanding heights of the world are \ndominated by capitalism. The Berlin Wall has collapsed. Tears are still \nshed about it, not just in East Germany, either.\n  But freedom is tested when it is unpopular, not when it is popular. \nStanding up and cheering for the team that wins the Super Bowl is an \nexercise in freedom of speech, but that is not where you measure \nfreedom of speech. You measure it when somebody is saying something you \ndo not agree with, something that is not popular. I would say that I do \nnot own any Stanley Works stock. I did not invest in Stanley Works. Who \nam I to be telling them they can't have the rights that we give to \nevery other company in the world that is domiciled in Germany or in \nTaiwan or Korea or the Philippines or Morocco or wherever? They can \nproduce things and sell to the Defense Department, but Stanley Works, \ndomiciled in Cyprus or elsewhere, they are not going to sell to the \nUnited States.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. You made some excellent points. The point that the company \nthat invests overseas, if it is a foreign company, it has the right to \ndo that, but under this rule, if it is an American company, it would \nnot have that right if it were domiciled outside the United States--\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is exactly right. Had they invested their money in a \ncompany domiciled in Germany, which competes with Stanley Works, they \ncould have sold products to the Defense Department. But under this \namendment, a company operating in Germany, making drills that might be \nbought by the Defense Department, having not one American employee, can \nsell to the Defense Department. Under this amendment, Stanley Works, \nwhich may have 40 percent of its employees in this country, many of \nthem in the Northeast, as the Senator is aware, is not allowed to sell \nin this country if they choose to domicile in Cyprus or Gibraltar.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for another question on that point. \nAren't we talking about aftertax dollars? I mean basically what we are \nsaying is if an American company generates American revenues, it has to \npay taxes on those American revenues. When an international company \ngenerates American revenues, it has to pay taxes on those revenues. The \nUnited States Treasury has taken in dollars from American-generated \nincome from an American or international company.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As I said earlier, every penny of American income is taxed \nunder IRS code 881. But the point you are making is, the money they are \ninvesting abroad is after tax money, which belongs to them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Which gets back to my point: You either believe in freedom \nor you do not. If you believe in freedom, you have to believe if it is \nsomebody's money--they have earned it, they pay taxes on it--and if \nthey want to invest it in Cyprus. You may not like it, and you might \nget big cheers at the local coffee bar by saying we are not going to \nlet people invest in Cyprus and sell to the United States. That is just \nwildly popular, but the point is it violates our basic precept of the \nright of people to use their own money for their own purposes, to \npromote their own goals.\n  Mr. GREGG. After they pay taxes on them.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And they pay taxes on that money. And it may not be the \ngoal of the Members of the United States Senate, but the point is this: \nIn a very real sense, when you cut through all the ability to make this \na popular issue--when you cut through to the bottom line, it is about \nfreedom; freedom to do something that is very unpopular. It is very \nunpopular. We all hate it. When there is a company operating in our \nState and they decide it is to their advantage to move their corporate \nheadquarters to Ireland, we decide we do not want them to do it. We \nhate them doing it. They do it, not because it changes their taxes on \ntheir American-earned income but because it changes their taxes on \nmoney they make in Europe and Asia and because they can have a better \nbusiness climate. We hate that they do it, but it is their money and \nthey have a right to do it. They have a right to do what we think is \nwrong.\n  Now to come in through the back door and try to limit their right \nbecause they are doing something we do not like, we are saying: You \ncan't do the same thing that a German company that never invested in \nAmerica and that has no employees in America can do. So it is popular, \nit gets you applause, but it is fundamentally wrong.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I tell my friend and colleague that one \nOklahoma-headquartered company relocated in Texas called Phillips \nPetroleum. I wasn't very happy about that, but they had the right to do \nthat.\n  Let me make it clear. My friend and colleague from Texas read the \nstatute that says you pay taxes on all American-source income. Isn't \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Corporate income tax--not just payroll tax.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Section 881 of the IRS Code.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Really, the difference we are talking about is income \ngenerated in other countries.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And the greater flexibility they have in their tax \ntreatment in those countries. But they still have to pay American taxes \non American income. In fact, the language of art is ``any income \neffectively connected with the United States.''\n  Mr. NICKLES. Any contract with the Department of Defense--and any \ncompany doing that has to pay U.S. corporate income taxes if they \ngenerate income off those contracts.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the clarification.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I conclude by noting that with the adoption of this \namendment, it will say to companies that pay half of their employees in \nAmerica that we are not going to let you sell to the American \nGovernment, but to foreign companies that have no employees in America \nand have never invested a penny in America, we are going to let you \nsell to the U.S. Government.\n  Again, it is popular. It will get you a big hurrah anywhere in the \ncountry, but it is not good public policy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. There is a major automotive company called Chrysler that \nrecently merged--or you could say was acquired by Daimler, a German \ncompany. They are headquartered now in Germany and domiciled in \nBermuda. I am guessing; I don't know. If my memory serves me correctly, \nChrysler used to make tanks, or used to make military equipment. They \nwouldn't be covered by this because the effective date is beginning \nJanuary 1. But the theory is, if the effective date was earlier, they \nwould be prohibited from making tanks or providing goods and services \nthat maybe they provided for a long time. In other words, they might be \nproviding an essential component to our national defense, and those \nthousands of employees who might be employed making products for \nnational defense would find themselves unemployed.\n  Mr. GRAMM. They would be in Detroit, MI. That is the point.\n  We basically come down to the question as to whether or not this is \ngood public policy. It is popular policy. It will always get applause. \nBut the question is, Is it good public policy? I would answer no.\n  Should we be building walls around America? Can you imagine the \nUnited States of America trying to penalize people who want to transfer \ntheir wealth somewhere else? We are the country where people from all \nover the world send wealth here. This is a role reversal, if I have \never seen it. These are games that other countries play.\n  This is GATT-illegal. This has no redeeming virtue, other than it is \nmomentarily popular and it will get you a rousing applause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about \nSenator Wellstone's amendment.\n  Ironically, I agree with Senator Wellstone's amendment, but also \nagree with some of the points made by my distinguished friends from \nOklahoma and Texas.\n  First of all, I want to be clear that I agree with Senator \nWellstone's purpose. As I have said repeatedly in public, companies \nshould have their hearts\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nin America. If they don't have their hearts in America, they ought to \nget their rear ends out of America. In my mind, this notion applies \nespecially to Government contracts.\n  Mr. President, when the Finance Committee marked up legislation to \nshutdown corporate expatriation, I considered adding this Government \ncontracting ban to the tax legislation. However, out of deference to \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, the committee with jurisdiction \nover Government contracts, I withheld. So, let's be clear that this \nmatter is not a Finance Committee matter. Chairman Baucus and I moved \nlegislation on this matter out of committee. If Government contracting \nwere within Finance Committee jurisdiction, we would've addressed it.\n  Now, let me say that my friends from Oklahoma and Texas are correct \nin one respect. That is, the problem of corporate expatriation springs \nfrom our flawed international tax code. It needs to be reformed. I am \ncommitted to reform. In the meantime, we need to stop the bleeding of \nthe U.S. tax base and not reward expatriate companies with Government \ncontracts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized for up to 15 minutes; \nfollowing that, Senator Wellstone be recognized for up to 4 minutes, \nand, following that, this matter be voted on. And we will do that by \nvoice. We will announce that to the Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I will probably not take the entire 15 minutes.\n  I do concede the point made by the Senator from Texas that many of us \ncome to this debate with a level of emotion. I am not happy to read in \nthe newspaper that a company such as Stanley Tools has decided, for tax \nreasons, they are going to forsake their American citizenship and move \nto Bermuda. I will guarantee you, I will never knowingly buy one of \ntheir products again.\n  I honestly believe the American corporations--proud to be in this \ncountry, proud to be part of this country, accepting their obligation \nto support this country, and paying taxes here--deserve my business \nbefore the folks at Stanley who decided it is much more fashionable to \nwear Bermuda shorts than to wear the red, white, blue.\n  Let me address three specific elements that came out in debate.\n  I have read, over the course of my education and my service in \nCongress, a lot of things relative to rights. I have read a great deal \nabout the rights of individuals and the rights of others.\n  We all know about the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. We have heard about those, and some trace them back to Plato \nand Aristotle. They go through all the great Renaissance thinkers, and \ncertainly to the Founding Fathers and Mothers of America, who came to \nthese concepts and fought for them.\n  But I never read about the inalienable, immutable, nontransferable \nright of a business, wherever it is located, to bid on contracts at the \nU.S. Department of Defense. That does not exist. That is a creature of \nlaw and policy.\n  We, in the United States, decide who will bid on Government \ncontracts. We establish standards. We establish qualifications. And we \nestablish disqualifications.\n  Should Saddam Hussein's agent show up at the Pentagon tomorrow and \nsuggest that the Iraqi National Business Corporation wants to start \nbidding on American defense contracts, you can imagine, we will laugh \nhim out of town. We decide who will bid on our defense contracts, in \nthe name of our national values and our national defense.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota brings before us is a very basic \nchallenge: If it is not an inalienable right to bid on contracts at the \nDepartment of Defense, are we going to offer that right to bid to a \ncompany which has forsaken and denounced its American citizenship in \norder to avoid paying taxes in the United States?\n  I will go back to the point made earlier by the Senator from Texas. I \ndo not think there is any right to that. And I do not think he can find \nit.\n  The second point I would like to make is this: The argument that \nthese poor companies go to Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, Barbados, and \nthe Isle of Man in order to escape American taxes--our critics say it \nis really a condemnation as to the high tax rates in America. They \nargue that we should lower our corporate tax rates so they will not \neven consider going to a tax haven such as Bermuda.\n  Trust me, no matter how low we bring our corporate taxes, some small \ncountry somewhere in the world will have a lower corporate tax rate. We \ncannot race to the bottom and expect to sustain the civilization we \nenjoy and the common defense which is funded under this bill if we do \nnot have a tax base in America.\n  These same people could argue, logically, that we should encourage \ncompanies to move overseas to the lowest possible wage rate where \npeople are being paid 5 and 10 cents an hour because it is such a smart \nbusiness decision. We do not encourage it. We discourage it. We should \ncontinue to.\n  But to argue that somehow we are at fault as a nation because we ask \nbusinesses to pay their fair share of sustaining the strength and \nquality of life in America, I think is ludicrous.\n  The third point I will make is this: This is a Defense bill. We talk \nabout the Department of Defense, but we all know that within the pages \nof these bills, particularly this bill, we will find not just words, \nbut we will find the support for the men and women in uniform in \nAmerica.\n  Think about what we ask of the men and women in uniform sustained by \nthis Department of Defense appropriations.\n  We ask these men and women, out of loyalty to America, to be willing \nto pay with their lives for the privilege to be an American citizen. \nAnd each and every one of us is so proud that young men and women come \nforth willing to do so, willing to give their careers, their lives, to \ntheir country.\n  But think about what those who oppose this amendment are saying: That \ncorporations with so little loyalty to the United States that they are \nunwilling to pay taxes to this country should somehow be honored with \nthe right to bid on Department of Defense contracts.\n  I disagree. I disagree. Let me hope that this amendment is adopted. \nLet me hope that after it is adopted, the next time a major corporation \ndraws its board of directors together and brings in their shifty \naccountant, who says, ``I just came up with a great idea: We're moving \nto Bermuda, and we can save taxes, and you all can make more money,'' \nsomebody will say, ``What impact is that going to have on our customer \nbase in America? What impact is that going to have on our business in \nAmerica? Shouldn't we think twice before we abandon this Nation because \nwe want to save a few bucks on taxes?''\n  My friends and colleagues in the Senate, I support this amendment by \nthe Senator from Minnesota. I will concede that I come to it with some \nemotion when I consider these businesses that are moving overseas to \navoid paying taxes to our Government. Businesses are moving their \noperations overseas to avoid hiring men and women in the United States. \nI do not think we should reward them or applaud them or say it is just \nan exercise of their freedom. They have the freedom to leave. We should \nhave the freedom in the Senate to tell them that their departure is \ngoing to cost them an opportunity to bid on these contracts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we had a long debate this afternoon. My \nunderstanding is that my colleagues are going to accept the amendment. \nI am appreciative of that. I think it is a very good amendment. I think \nit is important to have good, strong bipartisan support.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Reid, our whip, for their help. \nAnd if it\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\nis OK with them, I ask unanimous consent they be added as cosponsors to \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am looking at just a few editorials and op-ed \npieces. I will quote from them and do it in 3 minutes so we can get on \nwith this vote:\n\n       The trouble is that hinting, even by silence, that it's \n     O.K. not to pay taxes is a dangerous game, because it can \n     quickly grow into a major revenue loss. Accountants and tax \n     planners have taken the hint; they now believe that it's safe \n     to push the envelope. . . . Furthermore, what does it say to \n     the nation when companies that are proud to stay American are \n     punished, while companies that are willing to fly a flag of \n     convenience are rewarded?\n\n  That was from columnist Paul Krugman of the New York Times, May 14:\n\n       Even more galling is the fact that many of the same \n     companies are giving the taxman the brushoff as they shield \n     themselves with their Bermuda ZIP codes think nothing of \n     holding out their hand when Uncle Sam is doling out \n     government contracts.\n\n  That is from columnist Arianna Huffington, LA Times, May 15.\n  I ask unanimous consent material from the New York Times to the \nHouston Chronicle, to the Springfield Union News editorial, to the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer--there is a ring of editorials and opinions on \nthis question, and I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Editorials and Opinions Against Corporate Expatriation\n\n       ``Tax policy of this sort is outrageously offensive, if not \n     masochistic. It penalizes businesses that behave ethically \n     and responsibly and rewards those that do not. It increases \n     the federal deficit and decreases the federal resources to \n     keep the country running and rivers clean. It extends \n     privileges to corporations that can afford the legal bills \n     which it won't extend to $20,000-a-year day-care workers. \n     Americans should be outraged, and so should Congress, which \n     should move quickly to pass pending legislation outlawing the \n     dodge.''--Peoria Journal Star editorial, May 12.\n       ``The company has thumbed its nose at anyone who questioned \n     its plans. Stanley officials initially tried to bar reporters \n     from the annual meeting, despite high public interest in the \n     Bermuda vote. They also mailed confusing shareholder \n     information about how the vote would be tabulated. Businesses \n     that want to enjoy the benefits and protections provided by \n     this country should pay their fair share of taxes. Guess who \n     will wind up picking up the tab as a result of Stanley's tax \n     avoidance? Other American taxpayers, of course.''--Hartford \n     Courant editorial, May 14.\n       ``Even in the best of times, it is outrageous for companies \n     to engage in offshore shenanigans to avoid paying their fair \n     share of taxes. Doing so after the Enron scandal, in dire \n     fiscal times and when the nation is at war is \n     unconscionable.''--New York Times editorial, May 13.\n       ``American companies that have no headquarters, no \n     employees or operations in foreign tax havens should not be \n     able to lower their taxes by, in essence, acquiring an island \n     post office box.

Will my colleague yield for a second?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from Minnesota.\n  A lot of people are talking about Stanley Works. I represent the \nState where that company was located, with a wonderful history and \ntradition for many years of the Stanley Works Company, with the \ncontribution of employment in my State.\n  It is a source of great disappointment to many of us that they have \ntaken this position of setting up a shell operation, in this case in \nBermuda, with no people there at all--nothing--to avoid taxes. That is \ndeeply disturbing to people in my State. And we are embarrassed, in a \nsense, that this has become the poster child, if you will, on this \nissue.\n  But the Senator from Minnesota has raised a very important point, one \nthat all of us here, in a time such as this, over the last 10 months, \nafter 9/11 understand taxes may be too high. We need to work at that. \nWe need to improve the situation. But to have people stand up in a \ncompany and say that, right now, we are going to have profits trump \npatriotism, that we are going to worry about our pocketbook before we \nworry about what is best for America, is something over which all of us \nought to be outraged.\n  So I thank the Senator for raising this issue. We are going to have a \nvote shortly. I believe it is going to carry overwhelmingly, and it \nshould. The other body has voted similarly on a different bill. \nNonetheless, I suspect they may on this as well. We need to send a \nunited message that this kind of behavior we do not like to see in \nindividual citizens, who would trade their citizenship, and we do not \nwant to see it in corporations either.\n  I thank the Senator for the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I just want to also, for the record, say I have spoken \nto Senator Grassley, who said he would be very proud to be a supporter. \nAnd I talked with the staff of both Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, and we want to work together on exactly what the reach of this \nis. We will work hard on that in conference.\n\n  The date of 9/11 has been mentioned more than once. The truth is, it \nalso ties into Enron and WorldCom and all the rest. Frankly, people are \ntired. Thank goodness there are many corporations and businesses that \nare very good corporate citizens, but people are really tired of this. \nThis is an egregious practice.\n  Again, this amendment puts everybody on notice, forthwith, actually \nreaching back to January 1 of this year, if you are going to go to \nanother country and set up a dummy corporation and then shift some of \nyour profits to that corporation and not pay taxes, you are not going \nto be eligible for any of the defense contracts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe in short order the Senate will be \nprepared to dispose of this amendment. I wish to take a minute at this \ntime to express my appreciation and the appreciation of the entire \nSenate and I think a grateful country for the outstanding work that is \ndone year in and year out by these two Senators managing this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens are two unique personalities, \nfirst of all. The service they gave to their country and the military \nduring World War II would be enough by itself to cause us to want to \nexpress our appreciation to them. But their service in this institution \nand their leadership in these Defense bills year after year is really \noutstanding. They have done a tremendous job. They have helped keep \nAmerica strong. They have helped make sure we have the facilities and \nthe equipment our men and women need to do the job.\n  That is why when we made the decision to go to war against terrorism \nand put our men and women into a situation in Afghanistan to deal with \nal-Qaida, the terrorists, we had some incredible equipment. The \nAmerican people got glimpses of some of the tremendous things that have \nbeen done.\n  Once again this year they have done a fantastic job. Unless I am \nmistaken,\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\nthis is the largest Defense bill in the history of the country. It was \nasked for by the President. They have been very careful to be judicious \nin how they have handled it. But they have brought it to the floor in \nsuch a way that Senators on both sides of the aisle agree with their \nproduct, and I thought I should take a minute to tell them how much I \nappreciate it.\n  Obviously, I am prejudiced. In my neck of the woods we build ships. \nWe are very close to the Navy, but we also have Camp Shelby where \nSenator Inouye got his training at the beginning of World War II. They \nhave made sure that we paid attention to what we needed for the future \nin ships, even though the Navy actually had a declining request in this \narea.\n  On a personal basis and one based on knowledge of what would have \nbeen in the bill but what is in it, what needed to be done, I express \nmy appreciation to the managers and thank them for what they have done \nhere, in the past for the country, and what I know they will always do \nin their roles in the Senate.\n  They and their staffs spent many long hours hammering out the details \nof what amounts to the largest defense budget in the history of our \nnation and they are to be commended for their hard work.\n  I want to particularly thank Senators Inouye and Stevens for filling \na major hole in the defense budget--the distinct lack of ship \nproduction for our Navy. During this time of war against terrorism, we \nneed to maintain our ability to strike at the heart of our enemy far \nfrom American shores--namely, their training camps, intelligence \ncenters, chemical/biological weapon production facilities, and \nconventional arms caches. Ships play a central role in our ability to \nproject power and--before the actions of the Senate Appropriations Sub-\ncommittee on Defense--it looked like we, as a nation, were close to \nlosing a key pillar in our fight against global terrorism.\n  Mr. President, the military budget as presented to this body earlier \nthis year represented the largest increase in military spending that \nour country has seen in a long time, and yet the Navy's request for \nshipbuilding represented a decline in spending from the previous year. \nIt certainly was difficult to understand and even more difficult to \nunderstand given that our forces are engaged in combat overseas. This \nspending profile not only threatened the capability of our Navy, but \nalso threatened to severely dismantle our capability to produce ships \nin the United States. I don't need to spell out the dire implications \nof losing what little shipbuilding capacity that we have left in \nAmerica.\n  Thanks to Senators Inouye and Stevens and their staffs' hard work, we \nhave made great strides in righting our ship that was about to sink. I \nwant to applaud the foresight and efforts of committee staff, \nparticularly Charlie Houy, Steve Cortese, Leslie Kalan, Menda Fife and \nKraig Siracuse to correct this problem. They put a lot of hard work \ninto this mark-up and I believe they hit a home run for shipbuilding. \nThis SAC-D mark-up has set the vision for the future and will help the \nPentagon as they develop the shipbuilding plan for POM '04.\n  I also want to acknowledge the forward thinking of Pete Aldridge, \nJohn Young, and Dov Zakheim for identifying future funds in POM '04 \nthat will be leveraged into the fleet of tomorrow--a fleet that will be \nfully capable of addressing threats to our nation that we cannot yet \nenvision. An early version of the ship building plan for POM '04 \nincludes laying the keel for a CVN in 2007; ramps up production of \nVirginia Class submarines from one ship per year in fiscal years 2004 \nthrough 2006 to two ships in 2007 through 2009; production of three \nDDG-51 class ships per year in 2004 and 2005; commencement of DD(X) \nproduction in 2005 with continuation of that program well into 2020; \nsteady-state production of LPD-17 class ships through 2009; and a \nthree-year interval between production of LHA(R)/LHD class ships in \n2006 and 2009.\n  Again, I thank Senators Inouye and Stevens for putting together a \nDefense Appropriations bill that makes sense for our Navy, our nation, \nand our ship building industry. Thank you. I commend you for the great \nservice you have done for our Nation, our military, and our service \nmembers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4412.\n  The amendment (No. 4412) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the underlying Wellstone amendment was \nadopted; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct. The Wellstone amendment \nis now pending. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the action on amendment \n4412 be vitiated and the amendment withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4364) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken with Senator Grassley and \nwith his staff and the Staff of Senator Baucus about the definition of \nexpatriating firms and tax havens in my amendment. It would be my hope \nthat the conferees to the Defense Appropriations bill could conform the \ndefinition in my amendment with the definition in S. 2119, the \nReversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues. I think this is an amendment of \nwhich we can be proud, and I am very proud that it passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 4388 and 4422 Through 4434, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the managers of this bill, Senator Stevens \nand I, wish to submit several amendments for consideration. We ask \nunanimous consent that these amendments be considered en bloc and \nadopted en bloc. Before we do that, may I explain the amendments.\n  They are; an amendment for Senator Akaka earmarking $6 million for \ncritical infrastructure protection; an amendment for Senator Clinton \nearmarking $500,000 for renovation of a hangar at Griffiss Air Force \nBase; an amendment for Senator Inhofe earmarking $5 million for remote \nlogistic network; an amendment for Senator Feinstein earmarking $5 \nmillion for integrated chemical biological warfare detector chips; an \namendment for Senator Hutchison earmarking $1 million for nanoenergetic \nmaterial research; an amendment for Senator Frist and Senator Thompson \nearmarking $2 million for the Communicator force notification system; \nan amendment for Senator Landrieu earmarking $5 million for the D-Day \nmuseum; an amendment for Senator Nelson earmarking $6 million for the \nCenter for Advanced Power Systems; an amendment for Senator Bunning \nearmarking $1 million for security locks; an amendment for Senator \nKennedy earmarking $10 million for the Non-Self Deployable water craft \nstudy; an amendment for Senator Carnahan earmarking $850,000 for \nNational Guard medical equipment; an amendment for Senators Smith, \nWyden, and Murray to earmark $8 million for the Navy's Sealion program; \nan amendment for Senator Craig earmarking $3 million for foreign \ndocument digitization.\n  May I advise the Chair that there is not a single dollar added to the \nappropriation. These are just earmarks. It has been cleared by both \nsides.\n  I send the amendments to the desk. I ask that they be considered en \nbloc and approved en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Indiana \nis recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, in the list \nthat the distinguished Senator just read, was there a Lugar amendment \ndealing with weapons of mass destruction?\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. No.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will not object. I simply was hopeful \nthat the amendment might be included at this point.\n  Mr. INOUYE. It was objected to because it was not authorized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object, a point \nof parliamentary procedure: When would be the appropriate time for this \namendment to be considered or this Senator to offer the amendment or \nfor the managers to offer the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding the bill is still \nopen to amendment. The Senator still has his right to offer it at any \ntime.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Very well. So it would be appropriate, if I can gain the \nfloor, to do so following the resolution of the amendments the Senator \nhas offered. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask to amend the request of the Senator \nfrom Hawaii and ask unanimous consent that the amendment I shall send \nto the desk for the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, be adopted. It \ndeals with the awarding of a Medal of Honor flag to recipients of the \nMedal of Honor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4388 and 4422 through 4434) were agreed to en \nbloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4388\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the designation of a Medal of Honor Flag and \n   for presentation of that flag to recipients of the Medal of Honor)\n\n       On page 223, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124.

The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during the Memorial Day recess, it was the \nprivilege of this Senator to travel again with my colleague and \npartner, Senator Sam Nunn, and with Representative John Spratt and \nRepresentative Christopher Shays to a number of sites in Russia. One of \nparticular interest to us was the chemical weapons facility at \nShchuch'ye, which is approximately 1,200 miles east of Moscow. That \nparticular installation has been a part of the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program insofar as the United States has worked cooperatively \nwith Russia to put extensive fencing and various other security around \nwhat amounts to 1.9 million weapon shells--that is, chemical weapon \nshells--filled with nerve gas, saran, and VX.\n  I had visited the sites 18 months before, and this was a return to \nenvision precisely these 85-millimeter shells, these small shells that \nyou can put in a small suitcase. Indeed, I have an illustration of \nthis, Mr. President.\n  Here is the small suitcase, and here is the Senator from Indiana, and \na Russian major took the picture.\n  As we discuss proliferation, this intersection between terrorists and \nweapons of mass destruction, envision, if you will, that there are 1.9 \nmillion more of these 85-millimeter shells. The Russians on the site \nestimate if one shell was put into a stadium of 100,000 people, \neverybody would die. It has that degree of efficacy and it has this \ndegree of portability.\n  This is why the United States takes seriously the penning up of the \nchemical weapons of Russia. Russia has declared 40,000 metric tons. \nOne-seventh of them are at Shchuch'ye, in this condition. Also at \nShchuch'ye is our greatest hope in working with the Russians to destroy \nthe chemical weapons. They are in the process of building a plant that \nwill require U.S. money to complete. The German Bundesbank has \nappropriated money this year for this plant, and so has Great Britain, \nCanada, and Norway, in modest amounts, to join us.\n  The Russian Duma has appropriated substantially more money for this \npurpose. Why? Because Russia and the United States and many other \nnations ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. We did so 5 years \nago. The Russians did so a short time thereafter. It is a 10-year \ntreaty. We are almost at halftime and not the first pound of chemical \nweapons has, in fact, been destroyed because there was not the money, \nnot the technical organization, until at least this present point.\n  Mr. President, when I came back from Russia, Senator Biden, the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I were asked to come \nto the White House to visit with the President and the Vice President, \nCondoleezza Rice, and Andrew Card. Six of us sat there and talked about \nthe new treaty between the United States and Russia, on which we have \nhad testimony at some of our committee hearings. The point made by the \nPresident, Secretary Powell, and Secretary Rumsfeld is that we have a \nturn\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nof the road with Russia. We are not naive with regard to all of the \nproblems with Russia, but the President is asking for ratification of \nthis new treaty that would substantially reduce nuclear warheads in the \nnext 10 years.\n  I took the opportunity to point out to the President of the United \nStates that it is one thing to ratify a treaty, and to negotiate one to \nbegin with, and it is quite another to see actual results from the \ntreaty. We are working in this country to reduce our chemical weapons, \nand we hope to do so in the 10 years. We have pledged to do so under \nthe treaty. The Russians have a whole lot more of them. My point is \nthat there has not been a reduction there. In this case, it is not a \nlack of good will, it is a lack of money, lack of technical support.\n\n  In the midst of all of this, the dilemma for President Bush--and he \nraised this during our face-to-face meeting--is: What can I do about \nit? With the other Nunn-Lugar programs, the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Programs, the President could certify that the conditions \nimposed by Congress on the Nunn-Lugar Act are being met. In the past 10 \nyears, such certification has come each year. This year, it did not.\n  Ms. Rice and the Vice President advised the President that the \nadministration has sought authorization to waive the certification \nrequirement so that the money could be spent. In effect, no new \nprograms under cooperative threat reduction have occurred for 10 months \nof this fiscal year due to lack of certification and lack of waiver.\n  Now, in the supplemental appropriations bill we passed the other \nevening, as this becomes law--at least for the last 2 months of this \nyear--our Government can actively move to destroy weapons of mass \ndestruction with new contracts--nuclear, chemical, and biological--for \n2 months. In a conference now on the authorization of the Defense \nDepartment, there is a debate as to how long a waiver might last. The \nPresident has asked for permanent authority, and the Senate has offered \nthat in its bill. The House has offered, as I understand it, a 3-year \ntime for the President to waive this certification. But when we come to \nchemical weapons, the President apparently has no ability to waive \nanything, or to certify anything.\n  An additional six requirements are posed, and they have not been met, \nin the judgment at least of those in the administration who were \ninvolved in these deliberations. So as a result, nothing is happening \nwith regard to American money or the destruction of these weapons.\n  Following my meeting with the President, I wrote a letter to \nCondoleezza Rice, and I stated everything that I have indicated in \nthese remarks today. I appreciate the fact that she has responded and \nindicated to me that:\n  The President has repeatedly emphasized the importance of cooperative \nthreat reduction in his strategy to reduce and prevent the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, delivery means, and the \nmaterials and technology to develop them. Because of the program's \nvalue to the nation's security, the President has asked the Congress to \ngrant him permanent authority to waive CTR certification requirements \nif he determines that is in the national interest. We strongly support \nthe waiver provision of the Senate version of the FY2003 Defense \nReauthorization bill, and have urged the conferees to adopt it.\n  Our serious concerns about Russian chemical and biological weapons \nactivities make it difficult for the Secretary of State to certify \nRussia as eligible for CTR assistance. Waiver authority will enable the \nAdministration both to pursue essential CTR weapons reduction and \nnonproliferation projects, and to work with Russia to resolve our \nconcerns about its chemical and biological weapons activities.\n  Parenthetically, I might say that one of the concerns is the four \ninstallations, allegedly with biological weapons or preparations for \nthem, in Russia to which none of us have had access.\n  It is my hope in the coming recess to enter two of these and at least \nclear away whatever may be the dilemmas of those two situations and \nmaybe in the fullness of time to make the other two.\n  I have been permitted to go into a number of biological situations, \nin addition to the full gamut of the chemical ones, largely because \nthere is a sense of cooperative threat reduction.\n  The Russians themselves appreciate that if there are accidents, \ntheft, or a breakdown of the system, Russians will be killed first and \nin large numbers. This is a grim and serious business which ought not \nbe a part of parliamentary byplay and that has been the dilemma this \nyear.\n  Condoleezza Rice continues:\n\n       Similarly, we welcome your proposal of a waiver of the \n     legislative conditions on CTR assistance to construct a nerve \n     agent destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. As you point out, \n     the small, transportable munitions at Shchuch'ye pose a real \n     proliferation risk. The President underscored the importance \n     of assistance to Russian chemical weapons destruction in his \n     December speech at the Citadel and most recently in the G8 \n     Leaders announcement of Global Partnership Against the Spread \n     of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.\n       We have been working hard with Russia to meet the \n     legislative conditions on the Shchuch'ye project, and have \n     made considerable progress. Nevertheless, it may be difficult \n     to assess with confidence that the information we have from \n     Russia on its chemical weapons stockpile is full and \n     accurate. At a minimum, the information-gathering process \n     will be very time-consuming, but the proliferation threat \n     gives us no time to delay. Indeed, the Administration \n     concluded after its thorough review of nonproliferation \n     assistance to Russia that the destruction project at \n     Shchuch'ye should be accelerated.\n       Therefore, the Administration has urged the conferees to \n     the FY2003 Defense Authorization bill to provide the \n     President the authority to waive the conditions on CTR \n     chemical weapons destruction assistance, if he determines \n     that to do so is in the national interest.\n\n  Given this letter, Mr. President, I have offered the amendment that \nis at the desk. It achieves that objective of giving the President \nwaiver authority that he does not have with regard to these chemical \nweapons. In due course, the conference committee and the armed services \nwill come to a decision as to whether the request by the President for \npermanent waiver authority on all Nunn-Lugar programs is to be granted \nto the President.\n  In a commonsense way, I pray that will be the case. I cannot imagine \nthat it is in the national interest for us to deliberately, having \nauthorized money for Nunn-Lugar, having appropriated money for the \nNunn-Lugar program, to have it all tied up in terms of new projects for \n10 months.\n  My point to the President has been: Mr. President, that could very \nwell be the fate of a nuclear treaty with regard to warheads. Why do we \nbelieve that somehow that might be exempt because, clearly, American \nmoney is going to be involved if we are to make progress in seeing \nthose warheads reduced.\n  The Russians may want to reduce the warheads to 2,200 or 1,700 or \nwhatever figure is in their national interest, but they clearly do not \nhave the means to do so.\n  Some Americans, perhaps even Members of this body, may say: Well, \nthat is the Russian's problem; they made their bed; let them sleep in \nit. But it is our problem because those warheads are aimed at us. The \nnerve gas at Shchuch'ye will not be aimed at us if it is destroyed, and \nit can be destroyed during this historical window of opportunity.\n  Therefore, I earnestly ask for support of the Senate in adopting this \namendment so it is absolutely clear that the President has the \nauthority to give the waivers so that we may move ahead on something I \nthink is vital not only to our national interest but in the war against \nterrorism is imperative. My feeling always has been if the Senate had \nany idea of this general problem, there would be a speedy resolution.\n  The purpose of my speech tonight is to make sure this Senate does \nunderstand and makes a commitment to destroy these weapons as rapidly \nas possible, given the storage and given the destruction facility.\n  I add finally that for those who are at all wondering how they \ndestroy the stockpile, this is the weapon in the suitcase. It would be \ntaken down to a vacuum space. Two holes would be drilled in the bottom \nof the weapon. The material would be drained out and put in a chemical \nformulation which finally renders that toxic material without \nconsequence. This has to happen 1.9 million times. It will take 6 years \nif we begin now.\n  I hope it will begin now. My plea is for immediate action on the \namendment which I hope will be favorable.\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter addressed to Dr. Rice dated \nJuly 12, 2002, and her response to me dated July 30, 2002, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2002.\n     Dr. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Rice: We write out of great concern over the \n     current status of various projects in the Nunn-Lugar \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program at the Department \n     of Defense. Final disposition has yet to be reached on an \n     Administration request for permanent annual waiver authority \n     relative to legislatively-imposed conditions requiring \n     certification by the Executive branch in order to permit \n     elements of the program to go forward. That will remain \n     dependent on the outcome of a conference between the two \n     houses of Congress on the FY 2003 Defense Authorization bill.\n       Despite the Administration's difficulties in attempting to \n     secure permanent waiver authority from the Congress in order \n     to proceed with the overall Nunn-Lugar/CTR program, we are \n     encouraged that the Administration has continued to seek the \n     waiver to the certification requirements. The same cannot be \n     said with respect to the Administration's approach to the \n     Nunn-Lugar/CTR chemical weapons elimination project in \n     Russia. Congressional conditions--above and beyond those that \n     apply to CTR in general--continue to stymie and delay \n     construction of a chemical weapons destruction facility at \n     Shchuchye, Russia, that is decidedly in the national security \n     interests of the United States. A swift solution to the \n     current stalemate is only possible with strong Administration \n     leadership.\n       The project at Shchuchye was reviewed by the Administration \n     as part of its non-proliferation program review last year. In \n     a Fact Sheet released December 27, 2001, the White House \n     stated that: ``The Department of Defense will seek to \n     accelerate the Cooperative Threat Reduction project to \n     construct a chemical weapons destruction facility at \n     Shchuchye, to enable its earlier completion at no increased \n     expense. We welcome the contributions that friends and allies \n     have made to this project thus far, and will work for their \n     enhancement.'' Unfortunately, little progress has been made \n     in this direction.\n       Several of us recently visited Shchuchye and have come to \n     the conclusion that the U.S. needs to move forward \n     expeditiously if we are to eliminate this critical \n     proliferation threat. The depot houses nearly 2,000,000 \n     modern ground-launched chemical weapons. These artillery \n     shells and SCUD missile warheads are in excellent working \n     condition and many are small and easily transportable and \n     could be deadly in the hands of terrorists, religious sects, \n     or para-military units. We were told by our Russian hosts \n     that the weapons stored at Shchuchye could kill the world's \n     population some twenty times over. The size and lethality of \n     the weapons at Shchuchye are clearly a direct proliferation \n     threat to the American people.\n       Last year, the House of Representatives attached six \n     conditions to the Shchuchye project. Of the original six \n     conditions, four can be met but two continue to be \n     problematic. The remaining conditions require the Secretary \n     of Defense to certify that the information provided by Russia \n     on the size of its chemical weapons stockpile is full and \n     accurate and that Russia has developed a practical plan for \n     destroying its stockpile of nerve agents. We share the goals \n     associated with these conditions, but these same concerns \n     prompted the Administration to seek a waiver to the larger \n     certification requirements required under the Nunn-Lugar \n     program. Unfortunately, without a similar White House request \n     for a waiver at Shchuchye, it is unlikely that the Pentagon \n     will be able to begin construction of a facility to destroy \n     these weapons in the foreseeable future.\n       We urge the Administration to weigh in with conferees to \n     the FY 2003 Defense Authorization bill to include a national \n     security waiver of congressionally-imposed conditions on the \n     spending of funds authorized for chemical weapons elimination \n     under the Nunn-Lugar program. As the war on terrorism \n     continues we must ensure that terrorists do not intersect \n     with weapons of mass destruction. Failure to begin \n     destruction of the chemical weapons arsenal at Shchuchye \n     would leave these dangerous, highly portable weapons in an \n     unsafe and insecure location and vulnerable to proliferation. \n     Construction could start tomorrow if Congress were to embrace \n     the proper policy prescription.\n       The Administration's plans to speed up implementation of \n     this important Nunn-Lugar project cannot coexist with the \n     current Congressional conditions on the program. We urge you \n     to provide vitally needed leadership to permit the Pentagon \n     to begin dismantlement efforts. Without strong White House \n     leadership we fear that progress will again be stymied and \n     U.S. national security interests will suffer.\n       We look forward to discussing this with you in the near \n     future.\n           Sincerely,\n         Richard G.

Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: Thank you for your letter on the \n     Department of Defense Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) \n     program.\n       The President has repeatedly emphasized the importance of \n     CTR in his strategy to reduce and prevent the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction, delivery means, and the \n     materials and technology to develop them. Because of the \n     program's value to the nation's security, the President has \n     asked the Congress to grant him permanent authority to waive \n     CTR certification requirements if he determines that is in \n     the national interest. We strongly support the waiver \n     provision in the Senate version of the FY2003 Defense \n     Authorization bill, and have urged the conferees to adopt it.\n       Our serious concerns about Russian chemical and biological \n     weapons activities make it difficult for the Secretary of \n     State to certify Russia as eligible for CTR assistance. \n     Waiver authority will enable the Administration both to \n     pursue essential CTR weapons reduction and nonproliferation \n     projects, and to work with Russia to resolve our concerns \n     about its chemical and biological weapons activities.\n       Similarly, we welcome your proposal for a waiver of the \n     legislative conditions on CTR assistance to construct a nerve \n     agent destruction facility at Shchuch'ye. As you point out, \n     the small, transportable munitions at Shchuch'ye pose a real \n     proliferation risk. The President underscored the importance \n     of assistance to Russian chemical weapons destruction in his \n     December speech at the Citadel and most recently in the G8 \n     Leaders announcement of the Global Partnership Against the \n     Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction.\n       We have been working hard with Russia to meet the \n     legislative conditions on the Shchuch'ye project, and have \n     made considerable progress. Nevertheless, it may be difficult \n     to assess with confidence that the information we have from \n     Russia on its chemical weapons stockpile is full and \n     accurate. At a minimum, the information-gathering process \n     will be very time-consuming, but the proliferation threat \n     gives us no time to delay. Indeed, the Administration \n     concluded after its thorough review of nonproliferation \n     assistance to Russia that the destruction project at \n     Shchuch'ye should be accelerated.\n       Therefore, the Administration has urged the conferees to \n     the FY2003 Defense Authorization bill to provide the \n     President the authority to waive the conditions on CTR \n     chemical weapons destruction assistance, if he determines \n     that to do so is in the national interest.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Condoleezza Rice,\n     Assistance to the President for National Security Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  U.S. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) Holds Hearing On Nuclear Treaty With \n Russia, July 25, 2002, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC\n\n       Levin: My final question. Secretary Rumsfeld, the \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is coming to a halt \n     because of the inability to make the necessary \n     certifications. The Senate bill that's in conference contains \n     the legislative authority that the administration requested \n     which is permanent authority for the president to grant an \n     annual wavier of the prerequisites in the Freedom Support Act \n     and the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act. The House bill \n     contains authority to grant waivers for three years. I assume \n     that you support the administration positions relative to \n     permanent authority, and so, I won't ask you that. But if you \n     disagree with it, perhaps in your answer to the question I'm \n     going to ask you, you could let me know that, too. But here's \n     the issue. The permanent authority requested by the \n     administration to grant annual waivers of the prerequisites \n     to Implementation of the Cooperative Threats Reduction \n     Program does not include an ability to waive the special \n     prerequisites for the Russian chemical weapons destruction \n     program being carried out under the CTR program. President \n     Bush said that not only did he support this important effort \n     to destroy the Russian chemical weapons destruction program, \n     he actually wanted to accelerate it. But there's no authority \n     to waive those special prerequisites for the chemical \n     destruction, then that program is going to be shut down. Will \n     you be asking for waiver authority for the special \n     prerequisites for the Russian chemical weapons destruction \n     program?\n       Rumsfeld: The administration either has or will be asking \n     for that waiver authority with respect to the chemical weapon \n     destruction program----\n       Levin: Do you support that request?\n       Rumsfeld: Indeed, I do.\n       Levin: Thank you. General, you support that, too?\n       Myers: Yes sir.\n       Levin: Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment of the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I will be delighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Indiana and \nthank him and our former colleague, Senator Nunn, whom he has mentioned \non several occasions during his remarks this evening. These two \nindividuals have made a significant contribution to the improved \nenvironment in which the world finds itself today, with all of its \nproblems. Had it not been for the efforts of Senator Nunn and Senator \nLugar over the years, we would not find ourselves in the position we \nare today to significantly reduce the kinds of threats the Senator from \nIndiana just highlighted in his remarks.\n  I am confident this amendment will be overwhelmingly supported. It \nshould be. My cosponsorship is not a gratuitous act, but I want to be \nidentified with the substance of his remarks and, more importantly, the \nsubstance of this amendment.\n  We had some testimony this morning, in fact, before the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations in talking about Iraq. These are very \nfine hearings that the chairman of the committee, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Lugar have cosponsored to give us a wonderful opportunity to \nconsider what options we have with regard to Iraq.\n  I do not want to dwell on that except to point out that Ambassador \nButler this morning, when talking about various options and what we \nought to consider and specifically talking about the issue of \ncontainment and whether we have exhausted the containment approach, \nquestioned himself as to whether we had. But he said one thing we need \nto do, if anything at all, is to work more closely with Russia because \nthey could play a very important role.\n  What the Senator from Indiana is doing, not only with this amendment \nin the short term, is creating at least the possibility of that \ncooperation which may be essential in the months and years ahead.\n  It is a staggering statistic. I do not know if my colleagues were \nlistening carefully. Over the next 6 years, I presume working 5 or 6 \ndays a week, 10- or 12-hour days--that is how long it will take to \neliminate this incredible risk. The idea that we would be prohibited \nfrom doing so because we deny the President waiver authority because of \nan existing parliamentary situation or treaties that require some prior \naction I think would be a great missed opportunity.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana immensely for his efforts in this \nregard, and I thank Senator Nunn as well for his previous work here and \nhis continuing work. I wish to associate myself in this effort. This \nmay be one of the most important things we will do in this bill, and I \ncommend the Senator for offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut for his cosponsorship.\n  Cosponsoring this amendment are the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Mr. Biden; Mr. Domenici; Mr. Hagel; Mr. Graham; Mr. Levin, \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee; Mr. Dodd; and I am pleased to \nadd my colleague from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We are prepared to accept this amendment and take it to \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4435.\n  The amendment (No. 4435) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4443\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a couple of amendments the managers \nhave accepted, and I have another amendment that would be the subject \nof debate. I send those two amendments that I think are agreed to, to \nthe desk at this time and ask for their immediate consideration, either \nseparately or en bloc. The first amendment I would request be called up \nwould be amendment No. 4443.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4443.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To remove the waiting period in the limitation on use of \n    funds for conversion of the 939th Combat Search and Rescue Wing)\n\n       Beginning on page 221, line 24, strike ``60 days after''.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the first amendment would remove the \nreporting period required for the positioning of UH-60s and would allow \nthat the report be submitted at any time. It is largely technical in \nnature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4443.\n  The amendment (No. 4443) was agreed to.\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7705-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, AUGUST 1, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4444.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for leasing of transport/VIP \naircraft under any contract not entered into pursuant to full and open \n                              competition)\n\n       On page 223, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may \n     be used for leasing of transport/VIP aircraft under any \n     contract entered into under any procurement procedures other \n     than pursuant to the Competition and Contracting Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this calls for full and open competition \nin the case of a lease of a transport/VIP aircraft. It would address \nthe complaints of industry with respect to the Boeing 767 tanker lease \nand Boeing 737 transport/VIP lease and the first five multisensor \ncommand and control aircraft, and would replace the JSTARS E-3 AWACS \nand the RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft.\n  Basically, it calls for full and open competition for these aircraft, \nin the case of four 737 transport aircraft, and, as I understand, \nprospective Boeing 767 tanker aircraft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I misspoke. This amendment does not apply \nto the 767, only to the 737 aircraft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. With that amendment, the managers are prepared to accept \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the benefit of my colleagues, I have one more \namendment that is not agreed to and would require a rollcall vote, \nwhich I understand from the majority leader would be scheduled for \ntomorrow. I have a statement I would like to read concerning the \npending bill and then discuss the amendment, or if the managers so \nchoose, I would discuss the amendment first and then describe my views \non the overall legislation.\n  Mr. President, I send amendment No. 4445 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I object. I do not think we have a copy \nof that amendment yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nwith the reading of the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       On page 223, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. The Secretary of the Air Force shall not enter \n     into any lease for transport/VIP aircraft for any period that \n     includes any part of fiscal year 2003 until there is enacted \n     a law, other than an appropriation Act, that authorizes the \n     appropriation of funds in the amount or amounts necessary to \n     enter into the lease and a law appropriating such funds \n     pursuant to such authorization of appropriations.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask the managers of the bill if there \nare any further amendments that will be included in the managers' \npackage.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n[[Page S7710]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. There are no amendments left in the managers' package. \nHowever, there may be amendments brought up at this moment by others, \nbut we do not have any.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand there may be further amendments brought up \nfor a vote. I was speaking directly concerning the managers' package of \namendments which, as we know, sometimes are not voted on individually \nand included in the package. I am very interested in seeing the \nmanagers' package of amendments. I thank the managers so far that they \nhave been very helpful in sharing these amendments with me. I would \nlike to see the final package of managers' amendments before it is \nagreed to.\n  This amendment is a pretty straightforward amendment. It requires \nauthorization of appropriations for the leasing of any transport/VIP \naircraft. It would ensure that the Senate Armed Services Committee \nmaintained its relevance by requiring Senate Armed Services Committee \napproval and authorization of any tanker lease.\n  The amendment basically would instruct the Secretary of the Air Force \nthat he could not enter into a lease for transport/VIP aircraft for any \nperiod that includes any part of fiscal year 2003 until he submits a \nreport and there is a law enacted that authorizes the funds necessary \nto enter into the lease.\n  This is a very expensive acquisition on the part of the United States \nAir Force. I believe it should be authorized before this transaction is \nentered into. It is basically a matter of whether the Senate Armed \nServices Committee will maintain its relevance over the acquisition of \nvery expensive pieces of equipment. It would be appropriate for the \nArmed Services Committee to approve of it. That is the way we have \ntraditionally done business around here, particularly on issues of \nmajor consequences--although it has fallen into neglect in years past.\n  I do not think I need to elaborate further on the amendment except I \nbelieve it should be authorized before appropriated.\n  I see the distinguished manager of the bill on the floor. If he would \nlike to respond before I give my statement on the overall Defense \nappropriations bill, I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Congress has passed legislation, and \nthe President has signed it, that authorizes the Secretary of the Air \nForce to lease, for up to 10 years, these aircraft. It was a decided \npolicy of the Congress based on our advice.\n  The capital costs of acquiring such equipment now would be such that \nit would move out of the budget other items that have to be acquired in \nthe moneys needed for homeland defense. So we authorized the Secretary \nof Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into agreements \nnot to exceed 10 years for these aircraft. They are readily available \nfor lease. We limit the time they may lease them. But it is a very \nsuccessful practice in the business world and I think would be a \nsuccessful practice for the Department of Defense to lease this \nequipment when necessary and not to have standing around equipment that \nis not needed.\n  We believe a leasing policy is the best policy for this type of \naircraft. There are a series of competing aircraft available, but it is \nup to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Air Force to \ndecide which ones they want.\n  My advice to my friend from Hawaii, and I think he will join me, is \nthat we oppose this legislation. It would in effect modify the \nlegislation, the law that was passed in the last Congress that \nauthorized the procedure for which we are making available funds in \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur with the statement of my distinguished friend, \nand I associate myself with his remarks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator from Arizona has completed, I am prepared \nto offer a motion to table this amendment with the understanding that \nthe time for the vote would be established by the leadership sometime \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is fine with me, whenever he wants to \nmake the motion to table. I do have additional comments on the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, there is further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise again to address the issue of \nwasteful spending in appropriations measures, in this case, in the bill \nto fund the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003. This \nlegislation would provide $355.5 billion to the Department of Defense. \nEach year, in provisions too numerous to mention in great detail, this \nbill funds pork barrel projects with questionable relationship to \nnational defense at a time of scarce resources, budget deficits, and \nunderfunded, urgent defense priorities. This year's measure continues \nthis alarming tradition, by adding 581 programs not requested by the \nPresident, at a further cost of $5.2 billion.\n  America remains at war, a war that continues to unite Americans in \npursuit of a common goal to defeat international terrorism. All \nAmericans have made sacrifices for this war, and many have been deeply \naffected by it and at times harmed by difficult, related economic \ncircumstances. Our servicemen and women in particular are truly on the \nfront lines in this war, and are separated from their families, risking \ntheir lives, and working extraordinarily long hours under the most \ndifficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious but necessary task \ntheir country has set for them. The weapons we have given them, for all \ntheir impressive effects, are, in many cases, neither in quantity nor \nquality, the best that our government can provide.\n  For instance, stockpiles of the precision-guided munitions that we \nrelied on so heavily to bring air power to bear very effectively on \ndifficult, often moving targets in Afghanistan, with the least \ncollateral damage possible, are dangerously depleted. This is just one \narea of critical importance to our success in this war that underscores \njust how carefully we should be allocating scarce resources to our \nnational defense.\n  Despite the realities of war, and the serious responsibilities the \nsituation imposes on Congress and the President, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has not seen fit to change in any degree its \nblatant use of defense dollars for projects that may or may not serve \nsome worthy purpose, but that clearly impair our national defense by \ndepriving legitimate defense needs of adequate funding.\n  Mr. President, even in the middle of a war against terrorism, a war \nof monumental consequences that is expected to last for some time, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee remains intent on ensuring that part of \nthe Department of Defense's mission is to dispense corporate welfare. \nIt is a shame that at such a critical time, the United States Senate \npersists in spending money requested and authorized only for our Armed \nForces to satisfy the needs or the desires of interests that are \nunrelated to defense and even, in truth, unconcerned about the true \nneeds of our military.\n  An Investor's Business Daily article published late last year \nentitled At the Trough: Welfare Checks to Big Business Make No Sense, \nstated, ``[a]mong the least justified outlays [in the federal budget] \nis corporate welfare. Budget analyst Stephen Slivinski estimates that \nbusiness subsidies will run $87 billion [in 2001], up a third since \n1997. Although President Bush proposed $12 billion in cuts to corporate \nwelfare [in 2001], Congress has proved resistant. Indeed many post-\nSeptember 11 bailouts have gone to big business. Boeing is one of the \nbiggest beneficiaries. . . . While corporate America gets the profits, \ntaxpayers get the losses. . . . The Constitution authorizes a Congress \nto promote the general welfare, not enrich Boeing and other corporate \nbehemoths. There is no warrant to take from Peter so Paul can pay \nhigher dividends. In the aftermath of September 11, the American people \ncan ill afford budget profligacy in Washington. If Congress is not \nwilling to cut corporate welfare at a time of national crisis, what is \nit will to cut?''\n  Yet, Congress didn't get the message this year. In the FY03 defense \nappropriations bill we are considering today, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee added nearly $1.3 billion to Boeing's\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nprograms, constituting more than 20 percent of the total plus-ups in \nthe bill. As Defense Week noted unequivocally on July 22, ``in this \nbill, Boeing made out like a bandit.''\n  Mr. President, you will recall that last year, during conference \nnegotiations on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee inserted into the bill \nunprecedented language to allow the U.S. Air Force to lease 100 Boeing \n767 commercial aircraft and convert them to tankers, and to lease four \nBoeing 737 commercial aircraft for passenger airlift to be used by \ncongressional and Executive Branch officials. Congress did not \nauthorize these leasing provisions in the fiscal year 2002 National \nDefense Authorization Act, and in fact, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee was not advised of this effort by the U.S. Air Force during \nconsideration of that authorization measure.\n  Again this year--without benefit of authorization committee debate or \ninput--the Senate Appropriations Committee has added funding in the \nFY03 Department of Defense Appropriations bill for $30.6 million to \ncover initial leasing costs for the four Boeing 737 VIP transport \naircraft noted above. Furthermore, additional language in the bill \nmodifies a provision that had been carefully negotiated by OMB with \nappropriators last year, and may now permit the Air Force to circumvent \nstandard leasing arrangements and, with respect to the 100 Boeing 767s, \nmay allow the Air Force to extend the termination liability costs over \nthe full term of the lease.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the impact of these provisions has \nnot been adequately scrutinized, and the full cost to taxpayers has not \nbeen sufficiently considered. In fact, after review of the Air Force's \nproposed lease for the four 737s and its comparison of leasing and \npurchase options for these aircraft, it appears that certain leasing \ncosts are being hidden to make the leasing option appear more cost-\neffective.\n  For example, although the Department of Defense self-insures its \nequipment and would not take out an insurance policy if it purchased \nthese 737s, the Air Force's comparison of the leasing and purchase \noptions assesses at least $17 million in insurance costs to the \npurchase option, thereby inflating the estimated purchase price \nsignificantly. In addition, the proposed leasing arrangement includes \nprovisions requiring the Air Force to pay to insure the four 737 VIP \naircraft and, in the event of loss or destruction of an aircraft, \nrequiring the Air Force to pay a lease cancellation charge equal to \none-year's worth of lease payments, or $10 million. These provisions \nadd not only the cost of insurance, but also another $10 million to the \nleasing costs that would not be incurred under a traditional purchase \narrangement and have not been disclosed up-front in discussions with \nOMB or Congress. These examples of hidden costs illustrate the lack of \ntransparency of this transaction and strongly suggest that the Air \nForce's analysis of the $3.9 million advantage to leasing over purchase \nis illusory.\n  But you do not have to take my word for it. Rather, in a July 23 \nletter to Representative Curt Weldon on this matter, Congressional \nBudget Office Director Dan Crippen advised that the Air Force's \nestimated purchase price of the four 737s may be too high and that:\n\n       Small adjustments in the assumed purchase price, residual \n     value, or insurance cost would reduce the projected savings \n     from leasing the aircraft or make the purchase alternative \n     the less expensive option.\n\n  In its analysis, CBO notes that the cost of the purchase option is \nestimated and not based on any negotiation between the Air Force and \nBoeing. Significantly, CBO states,\n\n       Just as Boeing and the Air Force negotiated a lower lease-\n     price from Boeing's initial offer, CBO believes it might also \n     be possible for the Air Force and Boeing to negotiate a lower \n     purchase price for the aircraft, if the Air Force were a \n     willing buyer. CBO estimates that the Air Force would only \n     need to negotiate a purchase price about $1 million less per \n     plane than Boeing's initial estimate in order for the cost of \n     the purchase option to be equal to the cost of the lease \n     option, in net present value terms. . . . Using Air Force \n     data and a model for calculating commercial lease payments, \n     we estimate that a purchase price of $249 million (rather \n     than the $269 million price used in the Air Force's analysis) \n     would be consistent with the lease terms. . . . We estimate \n     that, if a purchase price for the four aircraft could be \n     negotiated for $249 million or $5 million less per aircraft, \n     then the purchase alternative would save about $15 million \n     compared to the lease.\n\n      GAO and CBO report that it would cost the government and \n     ultimately the taxpayers between $13.5 to $20 million less \n     to purchase the Boeing 737 VIP aircraft than to lease \n     them--but they report it could be more.\n  In addition, it is not clear that the Air Force has negotiated a fair \nlease price for these VIP aircraft. Financing experts advise that to \nevaluate whether leasing is the preferable option, as compared to \npurchase of aircraft, one month's lease payment should be equal to \napproximately 1 percent of the total cost of the aircraft. In GAO's \ncurrent analysis of the proposed Air Force lease, on which I have been \nbriefed, GAO contends that the Air Force's proposed lease with Boeing \nfor four 737 VIP aircraft is $32 million more than the norm that I have \njust stated. I am concerned that the Air Force appears to be going \nagainst the advice of financial experts not only by choosing to lease \ninstead of purchase these aircraft, but also by not getting a good deal \non the lease price. American taxpayers should be concerned by this \nbehavior.\n  I would like to note that OMB Director Mitch Daniels has often \nindicated his preference to maintain scrutiny of Government leasing \npractices out of regard for U.S. taxpayers. Just last year, in a letter \nfrom the OMB Director to Senator Kent Conrad, OMB cautioned against \neliminating rules intended to reduce leasing abuses. OMB's letter \nemphasized that the Budget Enforcement Act--BEA--scoring rules:\n\n       . . . were specifically designed to encourage the use of \n     financing mechanisms that minimize taxpayers' costs by \n     eliminating the unfair advantage provided to lease-purchases \n     by the previous scoring rules. Prior to the BEA, agencies \n     only needed budget authority for the first year's lease \n     payment, even though the agreement was a legally enforceable \n     commitment to fully pay for the asset over time.\n\n  OMB's letter continued by explaining that this loophole had permitted \nthe General Services Administration to agree to 11 lease-purchase \nagreements with a total, full-term cost of $1.7 billion, but to budget \nonly the first year of lease payments. OMB's letter stated:\n\n       [t]he scoring hid the fact that these agreements had a \n     higher economic cost than traditional direct purchases and in \n     some cases allowed projects to go forward despite significant \n     cost overruns. . . .\n\n  In my view, this leasing proposal for Boeing 737 VIP aircraft also \nputs the Air Force at risk of being unable to procure higher priority \nitems needed to fight the war on terrorism. On March 1, 2002, the Air \nForce presented Congress with a list of its top priorities encompassing \n38 items totaling $3.8 billion. Within its top 10 programs, the Air \nForce asked for several essential items that would directly support our \ncurrent war effort: wartime munitions, aircraft engine replacement \nparts, night vision goggles, anti-terrorism/force protection efforts, \nbomber and fighter upgrades and self protection equipment, and combat \nsearch and rescue helicopters for downed pilots; yet, the list also \nincludes these four VIP aircraft. In reviewing these Air Force \npriorities, I don't know what to be more critical about regarding the \nAir Force Secretary's effort on these VIP aircraft--that he's pushing \nin this time of war for this deal with Boeing for VIP aircraft or that \nhis 13th priority of the top 38 in this time of war is for VIP aircraft \nfor Executive Branch and congressional officials. Is it lost on the Air \nForce Secretary that we are at war?\n  I have asked OMB Director Daniels to continue his strong oversight of \nGovernment leasing practices, and I ask the Senate today to closely \nscrutinize this unprecedented, costly leasing deal for Boeing 737 VIP \ntransport aircraft. But, this Boeing deal is just another example of \nCongress's political meddling and how outside special interest groups \nhave obstructed the military's ability to channel resources where they \nare most needed. I will repeat what I've said many, many times before--\nthe military needs less money spent on pork and more spent to redress \nthe serious problems caused by a decade of declining defense budgets.\n  This bill includes many more examples where congressional \nappropriators show that they have no sense of priority when it comes to \nspending the\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\ntaxpayers' money. The insatiable appetite in Congress for wasteful \nspending grows more and more as the total amount of pork added to \nappropriations bills considered in the Senate so far this year--an \namount totaling nearly $7 billion.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the day when my appearances on the \nSenate floor for this purpose are no longer necessary. I reiterate--\nover $5.2 billion in unrequested defense programs in the defense \nappropriations bill have been added by the Committee. Consider how that \n$5.2 billion, when added to the savings gained through additional base \nclosings and more cost-effective business practices, could be used so \nmuch more effectively. The problems of our armed forces, whether in \nterms of force structure or modernization, could be more assuredly \naddressed and our warfighting ability greatly enhanced. The American \ntaxpayers expect more of us, as do our brave service men and women who \nare, without question, fighting this war on global terrorism on our \nbehalf. But for now, unfortunately, they must witness us, seemingly \nblind to our responsibilities at this time of war, going about our \nbusiness as usual.\n  Mr. President, I may be wrong. I may be wrong in all of the \ninformation I just provided to the Senate. There is legitimate room for \nlegitimate debate. I believe OMB and GAO have clearly stated that we \ncould save money by not leasing this aircraft. Certainly we could save \nmoney through competition and certainly we could save money to the \ntaxpayers by negotiating a better deal with the Boeing Aircraft \nCompany--which, by the way, although President Bush proposed $12 \nbillion in cuts to corporate welfare, Boeing is one of the biggest \nbeneficiaries. In other words, Boeing as the Defense Weekly noted \nunequivocally on July 22, in reference to the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee bill that we are considering today, Defense Weekly noted \nunequivocally on July 22, ``In this bill, Boeing made out like a \nbandit.''\n  I think they did. I think they did.\n  The managers of the bill and I could debate what is right and what is \nwrong as far as these numbers are concerned. I think I have compelling \nnumbers on my side that would indicate we could either lease or \npurchase at a much less cost than the appropriators put in the bill. \nBut the point here is that it should be authorized. It should not be \ndone by the Appropriations Committee without authorization. This is \nwhat we come back to time after time after time on the floor of this \nSenate.\n  Where is the role of the Senate Armed Services Committee to authorize \nthe purchase of aircraft worth many tens of millions of dollars? They \nhave been bypassed.\n  I hope the majority of my colleagues would recognize that an issue of \nthis magnitude deserves the hearings and scrutiny that can be conducted \nby the Senate Armed Services Committee. The job of the Appropriations \nCommittee is to appropriate funds that have been previously authorized. \nI hope my colleagues will agree with that.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of Appropriations Committee earmarks \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     FY2003  Defense Appropriations\n\n\n                        Military Personnel, Army\n\nUndistributed: Adopted legislative proposals........................6.4\n\n\n                        Military Personnel, Navy\n\nUndistributed: Adopted legislative proposals........................2.9\n\n\n                    Military Personnel, Marine Corps\n\nUndistributed: Adopted legislative proposals........................0.6\n\n\n                     Military Personnel, Air Force\n\nUndistributed:\n  B-52 force structure..............................................3.7\n  Adopted legislative proposals.....................................4.2\n\n\n                        Reserve Personnel, Army\n\nOther Training and Support:\n  Additional AGR end strength (Transfer from BA1)..................11.4\n  Sustainment of current AGR force.................................26.1\nUndistributed: Adopted legislative proposals........................1.0\n\n\n                        Reserve Personnel, Navy\n\nUndistributed: Adopted legislative proposals........................0.1\n\n\n                     National Guard Personnel, Army\n\nUndistributed:\n  Emergency Spill Response and Preparedness Program.................0.6\n  Adopted legislative proposals.....................................2.1\n\n\n                  National Guard Personnel, Air Force\n\nOther Training and Support: Additional AGR end strength.............0.8\n\n\n                    Operation and Maintenance, Army\n\nOperating Forces:......................................................\n  USARPAC C4I PACMERS...............................................5.0\n  USARPAC C4 shortfalls.............................................6.0\n  Hunter UAV.......................................................10.0\nTraining and Recruiting:\n  SROTC-Air Battle Captain..........................................2.0\n  SCOLA Language training...........................................1.0\n  Ft.

The Senator from \nAlaska has indicated he will move to table the amendment. I would like \n5 minutes, as the sponsor of the amendment, prior to the vote to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator completed his statement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that in addition to the 5 minutes \nfor Senator McCain, we have 5 minutes for the managers of the bill to \nspeak in favor of the motion to table. I ask unanimous consent that be \nthe case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was part of the request of the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. REID. Excellent. Perfect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the position of the Senator from Arizona \nis understandable from the point of view of not being really cognizant \nof the aging aspect of our aircraft. We found, for instance, on the \ntankers, the tankers that were flying nightly in and out of Afghanistan \naveraged more than 42 years of age. If you had told this Senator in \n1944 to fly a plane that was made 42 years earlier, 1902, it would have \nbeen laughable. Today, to have our people flying airplanes that were \nmade in Harry Truman's day, is laughable.\n  Just this past trip that we took to Europe, we flew on a plane that \nwas 28 years old. It was one of these planes for this type of purpose, \nof carrying personnel, not cargo.\n  We looked at this problem and we found that should we start an \nacquisition program for these new aircraft, which was requested by the \npeople from the Department of Defense who pointed out in many of these \nstatistics to us that the capital cost would be so great that it would \nforce out of the budget items that are absolutely essential to our war \nagainst terrorism and to the modernization of our military forces in \nother places.\n  We still have an absolutely difficult time replacing our ships--\nreplacing them at a rate that is far less than is necessary to maintain \nthe number of ships in the line that we have. But we are stuck in that \nkind of economics where we can't lease the kind of military vessels we \nneed for the Navy. But in this instance we are dealing with the \nworld of aviation, and we can lease. We can lease planes, and we can \nalso lease engines very competitively. There is a competitive market \nout there for both. There is a competitive market in the private sector \nfor the planes we are talking about. We are not entering into a market \nwhere there is monopolistic practice at all.\n  But for us to try to do what the OMB and the Congressional Budget \nOffice might have wanted originally would have required a massive new \nprocurement program in order to get the planes, and we would be getting \nthem one or two a year for 20 years. We are going to lease a fleet of \nthese to meet the needs of the Department of Defense and retire these \nplanes which are so old that the cost to merely maintain them far \nexceeds their value now. Beyond that, their reliability is so low that \nI have been told in many places the concept of redlining--telling the \npilots they cannot fly the plane because the plane won't pass even \nminimum standards--is so prevalent now in the Air Force that it is, in \npart, a matter of morale.\n  I believe we should do everything we can to shift the acquisition of \naircraft that we cannot lease into procurement accounts and try to get \nthose planes to meet our military needs. Those that we can lease in a \ncompetitive world, we should do so. When we do so, we lease them at an \nasset that can be returned to the commercial market at the end of the \nlease.\n  That is one of the things we have not been able to get real credit \nfor yet in terms of the people who are reviewing this matter for the \nSenator from Arizona. We will pursue that further.\n  But in this instance Congress and the White House agreed with us in \nthe last year--and previously--about the concept of leasing, that there \nare going to be other items that have to be leased.\n  When we were looking at some of the consequences of the terrible \nevents of 9/11, we found that the NATO AWAX planes were bought to the \nUnited States and flown over our major cities for a substantial period \nof time. There were 19,000 to 20,000 hours put on those planes during a \nperiod where otherwise they probably would not be getting anywhere more \nthan 100 hours a month. The engines on those planes have been \neffectively worn out.\n  We are going to have to go into that process. I would invite the \nArmed Services Committee to do some studying of its own. If it has a \nbetter way to get us the equipment we need now without breaking the \nbudget, I am sure the Senator from Hawaii and I would be pleased to \njoin.\n  The money for the leasing of these planes comes from the O account \nof the Department of Defense. It competes with all other things that \nO moneys are paid for. The Department is not going to be reaching out \nand leasing planes that are not needed. On the other hand, it is going \nto have to retire the planes that are so old now that their utility is \nso limited they should not be in the inventory of the U.S. Air Force.\n  I hope the Senate will support the position. I am prepared to make a \nmotion to table.\n  I understand that it will be handled under a previous agreement. I \nshall make the motion to table before the evening is over. But it is my \nunderstanding that the amendment is pending. We will just leave it that \nway, and I will ask unanimous consent that it be put aside for the \nconsideration of other matters that will come before the Senate this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4447\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Funds appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'' may be \n     used by the Military Community and Family Policy Office of \n     the Department of Defense for the operation of \n     multidisciplinary, impartial domestic violence fatality \n     review teams of the Department of Defense that operate on a \n     confidential basis.\n       (b) Of the total amount appropriated by title II under the \n     heading ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'', \n     $10,000,000 may be used for an advocate of victims of \n     domestic violence at each military installation to provide \n     confidential assistance to victims of domestic violence at \n     the installation.\n       (c) In each of the years 2003 through 2007, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to Congress an annual report on the \n     implementation of the recommendations included in the reports \n     submitted to the Secretary by the Defense Task Force on \n     Domestic Violence under section 591(e) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law \n     106-65; 113 Stat. 639; 10 U.S.C. 1562 note).\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think all of us were deeply concerned \nabout the four domestic violence homicides that occurred over the past \n6 weeks at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. The tragic murder of these \nyoung women by their husbands within such a short period of time is \ndevastating. It is devastating to the families of the victims. It is \ndevastating to their friends. It is devastating to the military where \nsoldiers and their families should be safe on base. And they should be \nsafe in their homes.\n  The Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence, which is made up of 12 \nmilitary and 12 civilian members, was charged by Congress to \ninvestigate domestic violence in the military and to make \nrecommendations for the Secretary on how to reduce the violence. In the \nintroduction in its first report, the task force wrote:\n\n       Domestic violence is an offense against the institutional \n     values of the Military Services of the United States of \n     America. It is an affront to human dignity, degrades the \n     overall readiness of our Armed Forces, and will not be \n     tolerated in the Department of Defense.\n\n  I don't think anyone who has followed the recent events in North \nCarolina would disagree. In fact, the North Carolina incidents, while \nunusual in that they are clustered within such a short period of time, \nare not unique. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service reported 54 \ndomestic homicides in the Navy and Marines since 1995. The Army \nreported 131 homicides since 1995 and the Air Force reported 32.\n  This is a problem that is by no means limited to the military, but \nits dimensions in the military are complex and need to be addressed. I \nknow Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz share that view. \nI applaud the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary for the attention they \nhave given to this issue and for the willingness they have shown to \naddress it.\n  The amendment which I offer today would help the military reduce \ndomestic violence in the ranks. In particular, it would ensure that \nfunds are used to establish an impartial, multidisciplinary, \nconfidential Domestic Violence Fatality Review Team at the Military \nCommunity and Family Policy Office. The team would be charged with \ninvestigating every domestic fatality in the military.\n  The purpose of the investigation would be twofold: First, the team \nwould determine what intervention and services were provided to the \nvictim and to the offender prior to the fatality; second, what \ninterventions and services could have been provided to the victim and \noffender that could have prevented the fatality.\n  The team would also aggregate data from domestic violence fatalities \nto help determine patterns so as to develop systemic responses to \ndomestic violence and prevent some tragedy from ever happening again.\n  The need for such a review is clear. The Defense Department Task \nForce found that ``fatality reviews have yet to become an important \nelement of DOD's overall response to domestic violence.''\n  It would recommend the use of the Fatality Review Team in order to \n``provide a mechanism for ongoing review of domestic violence policies \nand case practices that may inadvertently contribute to the death of a \nvictim or offender with the primary objective of contributing to \nsystemic improvements in a military community's response to domestic \nviolence.''\n  While the military is conducting the review in the Fort Bragg case--\nand this is an important first step--I believe and the task force \nbelieves that such reviews must become routine--not just at Fort Bragg \nbut all across the country.\n  The second part of this amendment would help the Department ensure \nthat there are victims advocates at every military installation who \nprovide confidential support and guidance exclusively to victims.\n  The Defense Task Force expressed concern about the ``stark contrast \nbetween the availability of victim advocacy services in the military \nand civilian communities.'' It later asserts that ``Victims should have \naccess to a well defined program for victim advocacy.'' And this should \nbe in every military installation.\n  The Defense Department does provide excellent family advocacy \nprograms to victims, but the Defense Task Force and other researchers \nhave found that the Family Advocacy Program, while serving an important \nfunction, can in many cases erect barriers to women finding safety for \nthemselves and their children.\n  Women have to be able to go to somebody where there is complete \nconfidentiality. That is extremely important.\n  The problem, in many cases, with the current system is that when a \nvictim reports abuse, that abuse must be reported to Command regardless \nof the victim's wishes. This lack of confidentiality has a profound \neffect on victims' willingness to come forward and find safety.\n  According to the task force, victims expressed ``fears related to \npersonal safety, loss of career and the belief that commanding officers \ngenerally appeared more supportive of the service member than the \nspouse who is the victim.''\n  That is important data, I say to Senators.\n  Caliber Associates conducted two studies that also concluded that the \nNo. 1 barrier to reporting domestic violence for victims is the fear of \nthe negative impact on the offender's career.\n  Other concerns with the current system are that ``the commanding \nofficer's lacking knowledge of the complex dynamics of domestic \nviolence led him/her to make decisions that placed the victim in unsafe \ncircumstances with respect to the offender'' and that the family \nadvocates often work with both the victim and the offender, leading \nvictims to believe that their safety concerns actually get lost or \nactually their safety concerns become more serious.\n  In sum, the task force reports, ``When the Military Services do not \nhave advocates exclusively for domestic violence victims, the current \nsystem often disempowers victims.'' It is for these victims that a \nvictim advocate is necessary.\n  This amendment does not replace the Family Advocacy Program, nor is \nit meant to be critical of its very good work. Rather, the amendment \nensures that victims whose lives are in danger have an alternative \nplace to turn to that is confidential and where their needs can be met \nwithout qualification. The victim advocates would aid women through \ncounseling, safety planning, and referral to civilian and military \nshelter, legal counseling, and medical and other relevant services so \nthey can provide for their own safety and the safety of their families \nwithout fear.\n  Finally, this amendment would require that the Secretary report to \nthe Congress on progress in implementing the regulations of the task \nforce. Domestic violence is something that we\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\nin Congress must constantly work to prevent, reduce, and eventually \nend. Having such reporting will help us work with the military to \naddress domestic violence in one part of our society.\n  Colleagues, what happened at Fort Bragg should never happen again. \nThis amendment represents a small step toward preventing future \ntragedies. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the distinguished chair of the committee that \nI have had an opportunity to do a lot of work dealing with domestic \nviolence, mainly because of my wife Sheila's work, and she has been my \nteacher. This is by no means an issue or problem just in the military. \nSome people say about every 15 seconds a woman is battered somewhere in \nour country, quite often in the home.\n  A home should be a safe place for women and children, but quite often \nit isn't. We passed the Violence Against Women Act, and we reauthorized \nit, and things are starting to change. It is not true, any longer, in \ncommunities, everybody is saying: Well, that's private business. It's \nnot our business.\n  We do not turn our gaze away from this any longer. But, \nunfortunately, it is a huge problem, and also for these children who \nwitness this violence.\n  I believe the Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Wolfowitz have shown \ngreat concern, and I appreciate that. This amendment is just an \nemphasis to put more focus on this and to have the Congress--the House \nand the Senate--working with our Defense Department. I believe it is a \nconstructive amendment and a positive amendment.\n  I understand, although I wait to hear from the distinguished chair, \nthat my colleagues are willing to accept the amendment. If that is the \ncase, that is wonderful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The managers wish to commend the Senator from Minnesota \nfor this amendment. And we are prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I join on this. I have to say that I don't use this word \ntoo often, but I was appalled at that story about the violence. We all \nhave tremendous respect for these young people representing our Nation \nabroad who get in harm's way and really are put under severe stress.\n  I hope it is not only associated with the concept of the victims of \nabuse, but we ought to find some way to have greater counseling \navailable to our people when they come home. Those of us who have come \nhome in the past know it is a traumatic experience for anybody, but for \nthose who have been deeply involved in combat, it is really difficult.\n  We should be very moved by that story. I think this will be the first \nstep in meeting that syndrome that has developed and trying to find \nsome way to prevent it in the future.\n  So I commend the Senator for his amendment, and I, too, support it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank both my colleagues. I cannot add to the words \nof the Senator from Alaska. He said it better than I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4447) was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4448\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have an amendment. I send it to the desk.\n  Is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment has been set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 4448.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide certain requirements and limitations regarding the \n use of government purchase charge cards and government travel charge \n               cards by Department of Defense personnel)\n\n       On page 223, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. 8124. (a) Limitation on Number of Government Charge \n     Card Accounts during Fiscal Year 2003.--The total number of \n     accounts for government purchase charge cards and government \n     travel charge cards for Department of Defense personnel \n     during fiscal year 2003 may not exceed 1,500,000 accounts.\n       (b) Requirement for Creditworthiness for Issuance of \n     Government Charge Card.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     evaluate the creditworthiness of an individual before issuing \n     the individual a government purchase charge card or \n     government travel charge card.\n       (2) An individual may not be issued a government purchase \n     charge card or government travel charge card if the \n     individual is found not credit worthy as a result of the \n     evaluation under paragraph (1).\n       (c) Disciplinary Action for Misuse of Government Charge \n     Card.--(1) The Secretary shall establish guidelines and \n     procedures for disciplinary actions to be taken against \n     Department personnel for improper, fraudulent, or abusive use \n     of government purchase charge cards and government travel \n     charge cards.\n       (2) The guidelines and procedures under this subsection \n     shall include appropriate disciplinary actions for use of \n     charge cards for purposes, and at establishments, that are \n     inconsistent with the official business of the Department or \n     with applicable standards of conduct.\n       (3) The disciplinary actions under this subsection may \n     include--\n       (A) the review of the security clearance of the individual \n     involved; and\n       (B) the modification or revocation of such security \n     clearance in light of the review.\n       (4) The guidelines and procedures under this subsection \n     shall apply uniformly among the Armed Forces and among the \n     elements of the Department.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than June 30, 2003, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     on the implementation of the requirements and limitations in \n     this section, including the guidelines and procedures \n     established under subsection (c).\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has recently \ncompleted another in a long line of studies about financial \nmismanagement at the Department of Defense. A GAO report shows how \nGovernment-issued charge cards were abused for the personal gain of \ncertain civilian employees and members of the Armed Forces.\n  This issue is not about irresponsible use of personal credit cards so \nmuch. This is about using a Government charge card for personal use and \nleaving the American taxpayers on the hook. In some instances of abuse, \nthe U.S. Government is left with only the interest on personal \npurchases to pay. In the worst cases of abuse, the Pentagon actually \nuses the funds that are appropriated for national defense to pay off \nthe questionable charges on these credit cards.\n  To understand the scale of the problem, it is important to understand \nhow many charge cards are being used. According to the Department of \nDefense, it maintains 1.7 million charge cards that were responsible in \nfiscal year 2001 for--now hold on to your hat--$9.7 billion in \nspending.\n  Neither the GAO nor I take issue with the well-regulated use of \nGovernment-issued charge cards. In the right hands, a charge card cuts \nthrough bureaucratic redtape, reduces paperwork, and limits the \nadministrative costs of processing purchase orders. But put a \ngovernment charge card into the hands of irresponsible individuals, and \nthey can do some real damage.\n  Take for example the case of a junior enlisted soldier at Fort Drum \nin New York. He ran up a bill of $10,029 on three travel cards, due \nmostly to charges made at a casino. Despite this serious abuse of the \ncharge card, in October 2000, the soldier was allowed to be honorably \ndischarged without punishment.\n  But that horror story is just the tip of the iceberg. One soldier ran \nup charges of $1,058 in personal charges, including some from the Dream \nGirls Escort Service. Not to be outdone, another junior enlisted \nsoldier ran up $2,278 in debt, including $110 from the Spearmint Rhino \nAdult Cabaret. According to the GAO, neither of those soldiers received \nany disciplinary action. These appear not to be isolated\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nincidents, either. The GAO says that it found about 200 individuals who \ncharged $38,000 in Fiscal Year 2001 alone at questionable \nestablishments offering ``adult entertainment.''\n\n  Those soldiers ought to be ashamed of themselves. They have betrayed \nthe trust of the public by using government money to fund their \ndalliances. It is a disgrace not only to the uniform that they wear, \nbut also to their superior officers who were apparently asleep at their \nposts.\n  In addition to using the cards for personal purposes, some \ncardholders play games with paying back the money that they owe. One \nsoldier in south Carolina ran up $35,883 in debt, then bounced 86 \nchecks, totaling $269,301, in a phoney attempt to pay off the card. It \nis small consolation that this soldier is undergoing a court martial \nfor his criminal behavior.\n  It appears that the astonishing lack of financial oversight in the \nDepartment of Defense has created a situation where it is easy to \nescape any kind of punishment. The GAO found 105 cardholders who held \nsecret or top secret security clearances who had bad debt written off \nof their travel charge cards. Out of this group, 38 still had active \nsecurity clearances even after they had experienced serious financial \ndifficulties.\n  I remind my colleagues of the serious security risks posed by \nindividuals with financial problems. Robert Hanssen, the former FBI \nagent, and Aldrich Ames, the mole at the CIA, betrayed their country \nfor money. In 1998, a retired Army officer, David Sheldon Boone, was \ncaught and accused of selling secrets to Russia. His excuse? He claimed \nthat financial problems led him to spying.\n  The amendment that I offer today with Senator Grassley proposes to \ncurb some of the most gross excesses of the charge card programs. \nFirst, the amendment limits the number of charge cards that can be made \navailable to service members or civilian employees of the Department of \ndefense to 1.5 million, a 10 percent reduction in the number of cards \nthat are now out there. This cap will eliminate unnecessary cards and \nreduce the chance that the charge card numbers will be stolen.\n  The amendment establishes a requirement that the Secretary of Defense \nevaluate the creditworthiness of an individual before issuing a charge \ncard. It is astounding that this common-sense step has not been taken \nbefore. But it has not, and as a result, the GAO found that charge \ncards are getting in to the hands of individuals with a history of \nwriting bad checks, making late payments on their personal credit \ncards, and even defaulting on loans. This must stop.\n  The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to develop uniform \ndisciplinary guidelines, so that members of each of the military \nservices are held to the same standard of conduct for their use of \ncharge cards. The amendment includes specific language on security \nclearances, so that security officials will be informed of the \nfinancial wrongdoings of individuals who have access to classified \ninformation.\n  Finally, the amendment keeps the pressure on the Department of \nDefense to continue its financial reforms by reporting to the \ncongressional defense committees not later than June 30, 2003, on the \nimplementation of reforms to the charge card programs.\n  I have no doubt that Secretary Rumsfeld is serious when he says that \nhe wants to straighten out the financial and accounting messes at the \nPentagon. He did not create these problems. They did not occur on his \nwatch. But it is now his watch. Someone has to be held accountable for \nthese scandals. William Wordsworth once said, ``No matter how high you \nare in your department, you are responsible for the actions of the \nlowliest clerk.''\n  Congress has an important role in making sure that the money that we \nappropriate for our defense is well-spent. It is the Legislative \nBranch, after all, that is entrusted with the power of the purse. When \nmoney is wasted, we have an obligation to step in and take corrective \naction. The amendment that I have proposed with the Senator from Iowa \nMr. Grassley, takes common-sense steps to crack down on the abuse of \ngovernment charge cards in the Department of Defense. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd-Grassley \nAmendment regarding Department of Defense credit cards. Many of my \ncolleagues will be aware of the ongoing oversight investigation that I \nhave been involved with for over 2 years now looking into abuses of \ngovernment purchase cards and travel cards issued by the Department of \nDefense. Working with the GAO, Chairman Horn's subcommittee in the \nHouse, and others, we have been able to uncover a disturbing number of \ninstances where DoD issued credit cards have been abused. We're not \njust talking about little abuses either. These cards have been used to \npurchase everything from cars to Caribbean cruises. They have been used \nfor mortgage payments and for cash in adult entertainment \nestablishments. The horror stories go on and on.\n  It is unfortunate that we are just now finding out about many of \nthese instances of fraud and abuse, but I am pleased that Secretary \nRumsfeld appears to be taking this problem seriously. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has announced a crackdown on credit card abusers \nand salary offsets and other tools are being used to recover funds from \nunauthorized charges. However, the question remains, ``How were these \nabuses allowed to occur in the first place?'' The answer is ineffective \ninternal controls. Receipts are not always matched with statements and \ninventory is not checked to make sure that DoD got what it paid for. We \nalso know that the Army doesn't always ask for the credit cards back \nwhen individuals leave the service. If you leave the cookie jar \nunguarded with the lid off, people are going to reach in and help \nthemselves when no one is looking.\n  Perhaps most alarming is the lack of credit checks. It seems obvious \nthat credit checks should be done on individuals before issuing them a \ngovernment credit card, but this is not currently the case. Not only is \nno one double checking to make sure these credit cards are used \nappropriately, but no one is checking to see if the individuals they \nare issued to are up to the responsibility. A little diligence up front \ncould prevent millions of dollars in fraudulent purchases that leave \nthe bank or the taxpayer holding the bill.\n  It is also true that once credit card abuses have been discovered, \nnot enough is done to follow up. I am glad that DoD is finally \nrecovering money that has been misspent, but this shouldn't be the end \nof the story. Those who abuse the trust that has been placed with them \nshould not get off scott-free. There have been individuals who have \nbeen court marshaled for fraudulent transactions, while others with \nsimilar misdeeds have been promoted. In fact, many individuals with a \nrecord of questionable purchases continue to hold a security clearance. \nUnder existing DoD rules, a person's level of financial responsibility \nis a key factor in determining whether that person holds a security \nclearance. Beyond simply requiring repayment, DoD needs to review the \npositions these people hold and consider disciplinary action. Failure \nto do so could even put our national security at risk.\n  The Byrd-Grassley Amendment requires the Department of Defense to \ntake the initial steps necessary to address many of these problems that \nhave been uncovered in our ongoing investigation. I commend Senator \nByrd for his initiative and leadership in this area and I am pleased to \nassociate myself with this amendment.\n  First, the Byrd-Grassley Amendment stems the tide of DoD credit \ncards, which are apparently being handed out willy-nilly to just about \neveryone, by limiting the number of government charge card accounts \nthat may be issued in fiscal year 2003 to 1,500,000. The amendment also \nrequires that DoD must evaluate the creditworthiness of an individual \nbefore issuing a government charge card and prohibits DoD from issuing \na card to anyone found not credit worthy. Finally, the Byrd-Grassley \namendment requires DoD to establish guidelines and procedures for \ndisciplinary actions against DoD personnel for improper, fraudulent, or \nabusive use of government charge cards, including reviewing and \npossibly modifying or revoking security clearances. The Secretary of \nDefense would then be required to report to the congressional defense \ncommittees on the\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nimplementation of these requirements by June 30, 2003.\n  The requirements in the Byrd-Grassley Amendment are all well founded \nbased on what I and others have been able to uncover regarding DoD \ncredit card abuses. They are all measures that should be put in place \nby DoD without delay as a starting point toward getting this credit \ncard debacle under control and preventing future abuses. This amendment \nshouldn't be needed as one would think all of the provisions would be \nimplemented by DoD out of simple common sense. However, I assure you \nthat it is needed, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Byrd and me \nin this important initiative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to commend the chairman of the \ncommittee on this most appropriate and timely amendment. As a manager \nof this measure, I am prepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I join the Senator from Hawaii and \nwelcome the opportunity to vote to accept this amendment. I think it is \na very modest step. The Senator from West Virginia has been restrained \nin terms of the abuses that we have heard about. This will start the \nprocess of putting us on a straight track.\n  I support the amendment and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4448.\n  The amendment (No. 4448) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Madam President, I have a series of amendments. None of \nthese amendments calls for new appropriations, and all of these \namendments are either earmarking or technical in nature. I will submit \nthem en bloc to be considered and passed en bloc.\n  I will explain the amendments. One is an amendment of Senator Miller \nearmarking $1 million for an information data warehouse; an amendment \nfor Senator Snowe earmarking $1.5 million for the Navy pilot human \nresources center; an amendment for Senator Graham earmarking $2.17 \nmillion for nanophotonic systems fabrication; an amendment for Senators \nSnowe and Sessions earmarking $5 million for kill vehicles; an \namendment for Senators Warner and Inouye earmarking $5 million for the \ncommon affordable radar processing program; an amendment for Senator \nBoxer encouraging the Department of Defense to allocate the budgeted \namount for the family advocacy program; an amendment for Senators \nTorricelli and Corzine to earmark $2.5 million for the disposal of \nmaterial from Reach A at Earle Naval Weapons Station.\n  I send the amendments to the desk.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I send to the desk an amendment of the \nSenator from Hawaii to add to that list.

Mr. President, I understand that the committee report \nincludes a $50 million Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. The \nprogram funds medical research projects with clear scientific merit \nwith direct relevance to military health.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Since military head injury is identified as the single most \nsignificant risk factor for the development of epilepsy, I would be \ninterested in including epilepsy research among the projects specified \nin the bill. Would the chairman be willing to see that the conference \ncommittee includes epilepsy research as a suggested project for the \nPeer Reviewed Medical Research Program?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be happy to address the Senator from Nevada's \nconcerns relating to epilepsy research in the conference committee.\n  Mr. REID. I thank Chairman Inouye for his consideration.\n\n\n                  DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \ndiscuss with my colleague the importance of research into Duchenne \nmuscular dystrophy, the most common lethal childhood genetic disease \nworldwide. Progress on slowing the relentless progression of the \ndisease has been nearly nonexistent, largely due to insufficient \nmechanisms to fund translational research. This research is closely \nlinked to the broader investigation of muscle and nerve damage \nfollowing toxin exposure, excessive exercise, and other motor neuron \ndisease, all of which have significant implications and relevance for \ndefense programs. For example, spinal cord injury is a major form of \ncombat and training-related injury. Motor neurons and motor neuron \ndisease is a potential target of bioterrorism. Muscle damage during \ntraining is a relatively common problem during basic training.\n  Recognizing this, the House of Representatives has included in the \nDefense Health Program in the Department of Defense appropriations $4 \nmillion dollars in funding for muscular dystrophy research. While I \nfiled and was prepared to offer an amendment to include this funding in \nour Senate bill, I am willing to forgo this amendment if the chairman \ncan assure me he supports this funding and will seek to ensure its \ninclusion in the bill's conference report.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with my colleague that this is an important area \nof research and that the House of Representatives has acted wisely in \nthis regard. I appreciate his willingness to save us time here today, \nand I assure him I will do all I can to see that the House amount \nremains in the final conference bill.\n\n\n                  Military Personnel Medical Research\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee for his foresight and leadership with the \nFY2003 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. I commend the \nChairman for including in this bill $50 million in the Military \nPersonnel Defense Health Program for a Peer Reviewed Medical Research \nProgram. Our military personnel face numerous unknown risks each and \nevery day. Providing funding to treat, mitigate or eliminate these \nrisks is the least we can do for those who have agreed to dedicate \ntheir lives to defending our nation and freedom.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the senior Senator from the State of Washington \nfor her kind remarks.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The bill specifically directs the Secretary of Defense, \nin conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, to select medical \nresearch projects of clear scientific merit and direct relevance to \nmilitary health. Included in the list of projects that could be funded \nthrough this project is an infectious disease tracking system.\n  In my home state of Washington, our military community has an urgent \nneed for such a system, facilitating the quick response to potential \nlife-threatening events. Public health has long been focused on the \nability to quickly identify epidemic diseases and intervene to protect \npublic safety rapidly and as efficiently as possible. Preparing for and \nresponding to a biologic crisis requires a clear understanding of such \ndimensions as geography, time frames, population demographics, \nresources, severity, and outcomes. The problem, at this point, is that \nthe public health arena lacks the type of information infrastructure in \nplace that is needed to guide an immediate response to a bioterrorism \nevent. Do you agree, that an information system to track infectious \ndiseases is a vital and worthy area of research?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree this is one area worthy of investigation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I point out that great strides have been made in the \narea of infectious disease tracking by Paladin Data Systems Corporation \nin Seattle, WA. They have the background and experience in healthcare \ninformation systems and could provide a real-time data repository to \naid in the detection of outbreaks of epidemic diseases as part of an \noverall effort to avert bioterrorism crises. Again, I thank the \nChairman for this foresight and leadership.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                         war-related illnesses\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Fiscal Year \n2003 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5010). This \nlegislation makes a valuable contribution to our Nation's efforts to \nenhance the quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nMarines as well as their families, while continuing to transform our \nmilitary forces to ensure that they are capable of meeting the threats \nto America's security now and in the future.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with my good friend from Michigan \nabout the merits of this legislation. Once again, Chairman Inouye has \nproduced an excellent bill that will ensure that our Nation's military \nremains the most capable fighting force in the world. Unfortunately, \nthis Nation has unresolved issues with regard to previous conflicts, \nsuch as Operation Desert Storm, and I believe we must continue to \npursue a better scientific understanding of war-related ailments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Committee bill seeks to improve pay \nand benefits for our military personnel and makes considerable \nimprovements in medical care that our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families receive. In addition, funding has been included to fund \na ``Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program'' that addresses a wide-\narray of important medical programs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Hawaii about \nthe significant efforts made by the Committee bill to address the well-\nbeing of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. Of particular \ninterest to me is peer reviewed medical research that examines Gulf War \nIllnesses and their relationship to Chronic Multi-Symptom Illnesses. I \nbelieve that this research, which is conducted by the Center for \nChronic Pain and Fatigue Research is providing valuable insights into \nundiagnosed post-deployment illnesses.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, my friend from Iowa is correct. For the \npast several years, the Center for Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research \nhas conducted research that is unique in its focus on the internal \nmechanisms and most effective treatment of Gulf War Illnesses and other \nundiagnosed post-deployment illnesses. This research has been funded by \nCongress each year and overseen by the U.S. Army Medical Research and \nMaterial Command and its peer review process. Continued funding for \nthis program will enable the continuation of research into a variety of \nillnesses reported by personnel upon returning from the Gulf War.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from South Dakota has noted, \nmany soldiers returned from the Gulf War with a variety of symptoms \nthat have no discernible cause. Although specific environmental \nexposures in the Gulf War cannot be ruled out as a\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\ncause, many believe that stresses triggering underlying conditions may \nhave contributed to these illnesses. I hope that efforts will be made \nto ensure that this bill provides adequate funding to ensure the \ncontinuation of this important research.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I understand the concerns that my \ncolleagues have regarding poorly understood illnesses that have \naffected military personnel in nearly every conflict since the Civil \nWar, and most recently in the Gulf War. As Chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I will work to ensure that adequate \nfunding is provided for the Center for Chronic Pain and Fatigue \nResearch in conference.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we appreciate the Chairman's concern and \nsupport for this work. We believe it has important implications for \nfuture generations of military personnel and we look forward to working \nwith him and the committee as this bill moves forward to do all we can \nto address this important issue.\n\n\n                  the uss scranton depot modernization\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair for recognition. I would like to express \nmy appreciation to Mr. Inouye, The Chair of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Defense, and to Mr. Stevens, the Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee, for the fine work they have accomplished in crafting this \nimportant FY2003 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. It has been \nmy pleasure, as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, \nto work with them on this bill, as well as on the defense portions of \nthe recently passed FY2002 Emergency Supplemental Bill, H.R. 4775. They \ncertainly do a masterful job of setting priorities and balancing \ncompeting needs.\n  I am also pleased that the Appropriations Committee chose to \nspecifically provide $90 million in the FY2002 Emergency Supplemental \nbill to accelerate the depot modernization period of the USS Scranton \nat the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from FY2002 to FY2003, as it will result \nin dramatically improved fleet readiness. In addition, it will free up \n$90 million in FY2003, which had been programmed for the USS Scranton \nto be used for other U.S. Navy critical submarine requirements. This \ncould include returning back to FY2003 the important USS Annapolis \ndepot modernization period at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, which the \nNavy was recently forced to slip from FY2003 to FY2004, because of a \nNavy funding shortfall.\n  I would like to direct a question to my friends, the chair and the \nranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Is it the \nSubcommittee's understanding that the appropriation of the additional \n$90 million to accomplish the USS Scranton depot modernization period \nin FY2002, now gives the U.S. Navy flexibility to allocate the FY2003 \nUSS Scranton funds to meet other critical submarine requirements?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is correct. \nIt is the understanding of the Defense Subcommittee that the FY2003 $90 \nmillion that the Navy had requested for the USS Scranton, may now be \navailable to the Navy to meet other critical submarine depot \nmodernization requirements.\n  Mr. STEVENS.  I would tell the Senator from New Hampshire that it is \nalso my understanding that the Navy now has the flexibility to \nreprioritize those FY2003 funds.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, and the Chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, regarding the B-1 bomber.\n  The B-1 remains the backbone of our nation's bomber fleet by \nproviding our military with a reliable, long-range bomber capable of \ndelivering a large amount of munitions to targets thousands of miles \naway. Nowhere was the continued importance of the B-1 more clear than \nover the skies of Afghanistan during the major battles of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Since October, B-1s have dropped more than 38 percent \nof the bombs in Operation Enduring Freedom while maintaining over a 78 \npercent mission capable rate. I am particularly proud of the \naccomplishments of the B-1 because a portion of the fleet is stationed \nat Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home state. On many occasions, I have \nhad the opportunity to meet with the men and women who fly and maintain \nthese planes, and each time I am struck by their dedication and \nprofessionalism.\n  In order to maintain the integral role the B-1 plays in our national \nsecurity, the Department of Defense has committed to reinvest the \nsavings from the consolidation of the fleet into the modernization of \nthe remaining aircraft. Currently, the Air Force is in the midst of a \nmulti-year plan to upgrade the B-1 to improve its reliability, \nsurvivability, and lethality.\n  One aspect of this ongoing effort is the Defense System Upgrade--\nDSUP--program which will replace the existing defensive system on the \nB-1 with components of the ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Electronic \nCountermeasures--IDECM--system, the ALR-56M Radar Warning Receiver, and \nthe ALE-55 Fiber Optic Towed Decoy, FOTD. Completion of this upgrade \nwill greatly enhance the survivability of the B-1 and improve its long-\nrange penetrating bomber capabilities.\n  During the course of the DSUP program, problems arose with the \ndeployment of the towed decoy system. It should be noted that these \nproblems were not unique to the B-1, but did slow progress on the \nupgrade program. However, I was pleased to learn recently that DSUP \ntesting of the towed decoy has once again begun. On June 25, a test was \nconducted at Edwards Air Force Base in which two decoys were \nsuccessfully deployed and towed from a B-1. This was followed by a July \n25 test in which a decoy was deployed and towed while the B-1 flew with \nvarying wing sweep positions. It is my hope these tests demonstrate the \nDSUP program is back on track.\n  At the time the House and Senate Appropriations Committees were \nwriting the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense appropriations bills, these DSUP \nproblems had not been addressed. As a result, the bills currently \ncontain reductions in funding for the B-1 program. The House version of \nthe Defense appropriations bill rescinds $67 million in Fiscal Year \n2002 funding, and cuts the President's Fiscal Year 2003 request for the \nB-1 by $82 million. These cuts would terminate the DSUP program \ncompletely and would cripple the B-1 modernization program. The Senate \nversion of the Defense appropriations bill would rescind $32 million in \nFiscal Year 2002 funds and cut $40 million from the B-1 request for \nFiscal Year 2003. I would like to thank the Chairman for including \nreport language that would allow the Air Force to request reprogramming \nof funds for the B-1 if the DSUP problems are resolved.\n  In the time since these bills were written, I believe we have seen \nprogress within the DSUP program. It is my hope that we can address \nthis funding issue within conference to restore funds for DSUP or \nprovide additional funds for other aspects of the B-1 modernization \nprograms.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share my colleague from South Dakota's \nsupport for the B-1 and believe maintaining the B-1's capabilities is \nin our national security interests. I am concerned that the cuts \nproposed, particularly in the House version of the bill, are imprudent \nand could do lasting damage to our nation's military capabilities. \nAlthough I have not yet been able to confer with the Air Force about \nthe newest test flights with the towed decoy, the results would seem to \nobviate the need to delay or restructure this program. More tests are \nexpected in the weeks to come, and I am hopeful that in conference we \nwill find a way to restore DSUP funding. If that seems imprudent when \nthis matter is taken up in conference, I urge the committee to transfer \nthe proposed DSUP funding into other B-1 modernization programs. For \nexample, the B-1 is next scheduled to have its radar replaced with a \nversion of the system now used on the F-16. It is important to me that \nwe retain the funds within the B-1 upgrade program and reinforce the \nAdministration's pledge that all savings from fleet reduction will be \nreinvested in B-1 modernization.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I share Senator Johnson's and Senator \nDaschle's continued interest in maintaining the B-1 as a long-range, \npenetrating bomber. This plane's recent performance in Afghanistan \ntestifies to its ability to help the nation deal with the types of \nthreats we face in the 21st century. I appreciate their bringing to\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\nmy attention the recent progress in the DSUP testing program. I will \nwork with my colleagues from South Dakota to address B-1 funding issues \nwhen the defense appropriations bill goes to conference.\n\n\n                      Operating Room of the Future\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the distinguished chairman yield \nfor the purpose of a colloquy concerning a program of great importance \nto ensuring the continued health and safety of our nation's Armed \nForces?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be happy to yield to my friend, the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, at present, the military lacks a process \nin which emerging medical technologies can be adapted and tested in \nreal time emergency situations that replicate high velocity and \nsurgical care settings. With the assistance of the Senator from Hawaii, \nCongress last year appropriated $2.5 million to begin development of a \nnational test bed to implement the U.S. Army Medical Research and \nMateriel Command's ``Operating Room of the Future'' strategy to remedy \nthis situation. This test bed, to be based at the University of \nMaryland Medical Center, aims to improve the performance of these \nemerging technologies and expedite their transfer to medical care in \nthe battlefield. This will be done via testing new approaches to video-\nassisted coordination, synchronized communications, mobile computing \noptions, telesurgery techniques and distance learning. While \nspearheaded by UMMC, this program is linked via a number of \ncollaborations with both industry and the military.\n  In its fiscal year 2003 Defense appropriations bill, the House has \nincluded $3 million of the $9 million necessary to continue work on the \nOperating Room of the Future initiative. The Senate bill directs the \nSecretary of Defense to consider the Operating Room of the Future for \nfunding under the Defense Health Program's $50 million Peer Reviewed \nMedical Research Program. I am pleased that both bills contain language \nsupportive of the Operating Room of the Future, and I respectfully \nrequest that the Chair work with his colleagues on the conference \ncommittee to ensure that the continued funding needs of this critical \nprogram are being met.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I certainly recognize the importance of this program and \nhave been pleased to work closely with the Senator from Maryland on it \nin the past. Indeed, the Senator will recall that we recently visited \nthe University of Maryland Medical Center to receive a briefing from \nboth Army and hospital officials about the progress and importance of \nthis project. You may be certain that I will continue to work on behalf \nof the Operating Room of the Future as we proceed to conference.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman for his continued efforts on \nbehalf of our men and women in uniform, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work closely with him on this vital project.\n\n\n                     chemical agent warning network\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I commend the committee's work to support \nvery necessary research in the area of chemical and biological \ndetection, response and defense. I also applaud the committee's \nrecognition that there are many existing good ideas as well as on-going \ninitiatives worthy of consideration by the Department as it develops \neffective technologies for our Nation's chem.-bio defense. As you may \nknow, one of these excellent efforts is a program that was initiated by \nthe U.S. Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, \nCBIRF, and authorized by the Senate in S. 2514. This program focuses on \nthe development of emergency response technologies by first responders, \nthe demonstration of a chemical agent warning network and the \ncoordination of response among military and civilian assets. Will the \nCommittee work to include in the list of programs to be considered \nunder the Chem-bio Defense Initiatives Fund, this initiative to \ndemonstrate a chemical agent warning network and other emergency \nresponse technologies for use by first response units?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. The committee will work to \ninclude this among the program initiatives to be considered within the \nChem-bio Defense Initiatives Fund, the Marine Corps' CBIRF program to \ndevelop a chemical agent warning network and develop emergency response \ntechnologies for first responder units.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the chairman for his hard work and consideration \nof this initiative.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend from \nHawaii, the Chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, \nSenator Inouye in a colloquy on funding for the Advanced Seal Delivery \nSystem (ASDS). I am concerned over the decision to cut advanced \nprocurement funds for this critical special operations program. This \nwill delay this critical program. As you know this manned mini-\nsubmarine is used for the clandestine delivery of Special Operations \nForces. It is a vast improvement over the current SEAL delivery system.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her interest in \nASDS. As you are aware the first ASDS boat has encountered two \ntechnological challenges that must be overcome: screw noise and \nbatteries. These issues require additional research and development. \nSince the budget was submitted, the Special Operations Command decided \nto restructure this program and has delayed procurement of the second \nASDS boat until these issues have been solved. The Committee therefore \nreduced advanced procurement funding.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am aware of the problems facing the ASDS. The \nCarderock Naval Research Laboratory and scientists at Penn State \nUniversity are working on the solution for screw noise. We believe a \nsolution is well underway for this problem. A solution for the battery \nproblem has been more elusive. The Navy has decided to develop Lithium-\nIon batteries for this purpose, but funded only one Lithium-Ion battery \ndeveloper and a solution has been slow at best. Is the Chairman aware \nthat the ASDS prime contractor funded a competing effort to develop \nLithium-Ion batteries? A leading U.S. manufacturer of Lithium-Ion \nbattery technology is close to meeting the ASDS battery need. The Navy \nprogram manager is excited by this alternative. As you know, I \nrequested that funds be added to the FY 03 Defense Appropriation bill \nin order to allow the Navy to fund an alternative solution to help \nresolve the battery issue.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I share your concern over development of a Lithium-Ion \nbattery for ASDS. The Committee provided an additional $8 million for \nProcurement, Defense Wide at the request of the Senators from Maryland. \nWe expect the Navy to use these funds to ensure competition to develop \nthese Lithium-Ion batteries can take place and subsequently result in a \nmore rapid solution to ASDS battery needs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the Committee's increase in procurement \nfor ASDS batteries. As you are aware the House provided $12 million for \nprocurement of a Lithium-Ion Polymer battery and shifted $22.5 million \nfrom advanced procurement to research and development. I hope we will \nbe able to fulfill the Navy's request to move $23.2 million from \nadvanced procurement to research and development in Conference. \nNonetheless, I am concerned that restricting the battery procurement to \na Lithium-Ion Polymer battery will result in less competition.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the Senator from Maryland for her steadfast \nsupport of this program and appreciate her concern. I will explore the \npossibility of increasing research and development funding for ASDS and \nlanguage that facilitates competition for the Lithium-Ion battery in \nconference, so that we can get this new technology deployed sooner.\n  Mr. BYRD. I rise to engage the mangers of the FY 2003 Defense \nAppropriations bill, Senators Inouye and Stevens, in a colloquy on Navy \nBasic Research funding.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would be glad to discuss this matter with the Chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I, too, would be glad to join with my colleagues to \nreview this matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Earlier this year, I received information from our \nAppropriations Committee staff which caused me some concern about the \nDefense Department's budget request for Navy basic research in fiscal \nyear 2003. The information indicated that over the past five years, \nfunding levels for basic research have stayed at roughly the same level \nor have grown slightly, in real/constant dollar terms--that is,\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\nexcluding increases for inflation. Growth in funding for applied \nresearch, however, has been significant, averaging about 10% per year. \nIndeed, the perception and reality of a greater emphasis on applied \nresearch is common in both private and public labs. Just as we've found \nto be the case in the private sector, the federally funded labs have \nbeen forced to be better `marketers' of their products. This has led to \na greater emphasis on applied research because, by its very nature, the \nwork being done in applied research is more product-oriented. For \nfiscal year 2003, the Defense Department proposes to cut funding for \nthe Navy's basic research program--a cut of 1% in real terms.\n  This shift in emphasis to applied research is understandable. But, if \nthis shift comes at the expense of funding basic research programs, our \nscience and technology programs will suffer in the long run. Basic \nresearch is the fuel for the engine of invention. Without a growing \nunderstanding of the fundamentals of our physical environment--energy \nsources, molecular structures, materials, and biological systems, to \nname just a few--our scientific prowess will weaken and our \ntechnological edge will become dull.\n  Given these concerns, I believe it is prudent that Congress sustain \nfunding for this important program at traditional levels. That is why I \nam pleased to report that this bill includes, at my behest, a $6 \nmillion increase for the Navy Research lab. I want to thank the \nmanagers of the bill--the Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator \nInouye, and the Ranking Member, Senator Stevens--for agreeing with my \nrecommendation and for their continuing efforts to enhance our \nmilitary's technology edge.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for bringing this \nmatter to the Senate's attention and for his continuing support of \nAmerica's armed forces.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I also thank the Senator for his efforts regarding Navy \nbasic research and the Navy Research Lab. This is an important \ninitiative, and one that I am pleased that Senator Stevens and I could \ninclude in the bill that we have brought before the Senate.\n\n\n                       aerospace worker training\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman for \nthe tremendous job that he and the members of his subcommittee have \ndone to craft this bill. I support their efforts to ensure that our \nNation continues to have the best-trained and equipped military force \nin the world.\n  As the chairman knows, my State has a long history of achievement in \nthe field of aviation and harbors an enormous pool of talented \nindividuals capable of turning innovative technological discoveries \ninto manufactured reality rapidly and efficiently. We also have one of \nthe most highly skilled pools of aerospace workers in the world.\n  I believe that the security of our Nation and the future of the \naviation industry will rely heavily on the development and \nimplementation of highly advanced composite materials. But for the \nlarge-scale deployment of existing and future technologies to develop, \nit is critical that our Nation have the skilled workforce capable of \nunderstanding these next generation materials.\n  That is why I appreciate the subcommittee's support of a new \ninitiative to train aerospace workers in the use and manufacturing of \ncomposite materials.\n  Edmonds Community College and Central Washington University in \nWashington State are developing a program aimed at improving the \nscientific and technical competencies of high school and college \ngraduates in the area of materials used in manufacturing technologies. \nThis program will develop a comprehensive curriculum to meet the \ngrowing demand for a workforce trained in materials science and will \nidentify best practices for the industry.\n  We believe that this will become a model teaching and training \nprogram for the ever-changing materials technology field, and will \ninvolve future integration with advanced, cutting-edge basic research \nin composites materials and engineering conducted at the University of \nWashington. Taken together, this collaboration in Puget Sound \neducational resources in the material sciences will maintain and \nstrengthen our country's foremost position in aerospace research, \ndevelopment and manufacturing.\n  This will provide a wealth of opportunities for incumbent aerospace \nworkers to update their skills in newly developed processes, and may \nserve to pique the interest of students in material sciences and \nenergize future generations to engage in math, science, manufacturing \nand engineering careers.\n  So I want to thank the chairman and the subcommittee for their \nrecommendation that the Senate provide $500,000 in this bill to \nimplement the first phase of this program and confirm that it is the \ncommittee's intention that the funds provided in the Air Force \nMaterials Science account be used for this program at Edmonds Community \nCollege. I further want to ask the chairman if he will work with me to \nensure that the funding provided for this program is maintained in \nconference and expanded in future years to further this effort.\n  I thank the presiding officer and the chairman, and look forward to \nhis response.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator is exactly right, it is the \nintent of the legislation to provide $500,000 for the program in \nWashington.\n  I assure the Senator that I will work with my colleagues to support \nthese funds.\n  Preparing for the use of innovate materials in future aircraft \ndesigns is critical to enhancing air superiority. I will work with the \nSenator to address these needs in this year's legislation and will \ncarefully consider ways to enhance those efforts in years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, the \nSenate resume consideration of H.R. 5010, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, at 2 p.m., Thursday, August 1; there be 50 minutes \nremaining for debate divided as follows: 10 minutes each for the two \nleaders or their designees and the two managers or their designees, and \nthat the only first-degree amendments remaining in order be the McCain \namendment, No. 4445 and the Committee-reported substitute; that there \nbe 10 minutes of debate with respect to the McCain amendment with the \ntime equally divided and controlled between the managers and Senator \nMcCain; that at the use or yielding back of that time, without further \nintervening action, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment; that \nif the McCain amendment is not tabled, then relevant second-degree \namendments would be in order to the McCain amendment with no time \nlimitation on the relevant second-degree amendments; that upon \ndisposition of the McCain amendment the committee-reported substitute \nas amended be agreed to, the bill then be read a third time, and the \nSenate vote on passage of the bill; that Section 303 of the \nCongressional Budget Act be waived; that upon passage the Senate insist \non its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes off the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, without further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4445\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the McCain amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the two managers leave, I don't \nknow how enough could be said about the way this bill was managed. This \nis the largest Defense bill in the history of the world and the United \nStates. Yet we started this just a few hours ago, and it is finished \nand no one can complain about this not having been scrubbed. Staff from \nall the offices have had the opportunity to come and do what they \nbelieve is appropriate.\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\n  But the good work on the bill was not only done here on the floor but \nin subcommittee and the full committee--which has just been topped off \nby the remarkable good work of these two sensational Senators.\n  I speak for both sides of the aisle that if a chapter had to be \nwritten on how to manage a bill, it should go to Senators Inouye and \nStevens because that is how a bill should be managed. I have never seen \nanything like it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I thank my leader. But I believe that \nmuch credit should go to the staff. We have one of the finest staff \nmembers in the whole Senate. I refer to Charlie Houy on the majority \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President. I repeat that. We are blessed with \nprobably the hardest working staff in the Congress. I am grateful to my \ngreat friend and chief assistant, Steve Cortese, for his work.\n  But I would say this to the Senator from Nevada. For those of us who \nserved in uniform, I think the greatest privilege there is is being \nable to manage this bill because it affects the people who have \nfollowed us, being willing to take up arms to defend our country. I \nknow of no better group to work with and no group that really needs our \nhelp more than they do.\n  I thank the Senator for his kindness.\n  We would pay you for the job. It is like flying. I used to tell \npeople they are paying me to fly and I would have paid them to let me \nfly. But I would pay for this job.\n  It is an amazing, amazing feeling to know we can accomplish some of \nthe things we did tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are all very proud of the men and \nwomen of the military as they have responded to the attacks of \nSeptember 11 and as they continue to protect us here at home and around \nthe world.\n  As we work on the Defense appropriations bill, we have an obligation \nto the men and women who are defending us to make sure they have the \nresources and the equipment they need.\n  Tonight, I rise in strong opposition to the McCain amendment on which \nthis body will be voting tomorrow morning. The Senator from Arizona \npersists in his efforts to redefine an issue that this entire Congress \nhas already endorsed and that the President has signed into law.\n  The McCain amendment addresses both the 767 and the 737 lease \nprovisions that were endorsed by an overwhelming bipartisan margin less \nthan 1 year ago.\n  Frankly, I am puzzled that this issue continues to come up. The \nAppropriations Committee engaged in this issue following consideration \nof the Defense authorization bill last year. The issue came to light in \npart because of the terrorist attack on our country, the global war on \nterrorism, and the tremendous demand placed upon our air refueling \nfleet.\n  This issue was not a sleight of hand to undermine the authorizing \ncommittee. We acted out of necessity as our country responded to \nSeptember 11 and to terrorism. We had a lengthy debate, thanks to the \nSenator from Arizona, and the Congress agreed to go forward using the \nlease option as the vehicle to give our men and women in uniform the \nasset they need.\n  Not long ago, the Senate considered the Defense authorization \nlegislation. The Senator from Arizona sits on that committee. That was \nthe bill to have this debate. The Senator complains that the \nappropriations bill is the wrong place to authorize. Yet here we are \nconsidering an authorizing amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona on an appropriations bill.\n  I read his amendment, and I want my colleagues to understand what is \nreally at stake.\n  The Senator from Arizona wants us to open the doors to the Air Force \nand the Department of Defense to Airbus. It is quite simple to me. One \nU.S. company manufactures commercial aircraft of this type. One, and \nonly one, U.S. company can meet the Air Force's needs.\n  The issue before the Senate is whether U.S. workers or European \nworkers will manufacture U.S. military aircraft. That is the bottom \nline. That is what the vote will be about tomorrow.\n  Let me also say that the Senator from Arizona has a broader agenda \nthan the language in this amendment. Listen to his rhetoric. He \ninterchanges the 737 and the 767 lease programs approved by the \nCongress. The language in his amendment is about the 737 lease, but he \nreferences, time and again, the larger issue of the 767 tanker lease.\n  So let's talk about the 767 tanker lease. Since September 11, one \npiece of equipment has become more critical than ever, air refueling \ntankers. These flying gas stations allow us to project our military \naround the globe. In fact, tankers are the backbone of our air \ncapability.\n  Just look at the war in Afghanistan. Our B-2 stealth bombers had to \nget from their base in Missouri to Afghanistan and back. They needed to \nbe refueled in the air nine times. Our bombers, which left the airbase \non Diego Garcia, had to be refueled three times to reach their targets \n3,000 miles away. So we needed the tankers to get our aircraft over \nthere.\n  We also relied on our tankers to keep our planes going during the \nfighting. During the heaviest bombing of the Afghanistan battles, 30 to \n35 tankers were in the air nearly around the clock to refuel 100 \ntactical jets. Even carrier-based warplanes needed the aid of air \ntankers to strike their targets in Afghanistan.\n  Here at home, many of our cities were protected by combat air \npatrols. Those patrols relied on air refueling tankers.\n  As Air Force Lt. Gen. Plummer put it:\n\n       In the opening campaign of this war, every bomb, bullet and \n     bayonet brought into the theater got there thanks to our \n     aging refueling tanker fleet. . . .\n\n  Our reliance on tankers has grown 45 percent from fiscal year 2001. \nSo whether it is projecting our force around the world or supporting \nour aircraft in the middle of a fight or keeping our homeland safe, the \nmen and women of our military rely on our KC-135 tankers.\n  But there are serious problems with these tankers. They are old. In \nfact, they are among the oldest aircraft in the entire service. Because \nthey are so old, they are not reliable, they are often down for \nrepairs, and they cost a fortune to maintain.\n  Just look at the figures. The average age of these tankers is 41 \nyears. One-third of the fleet is unfit to fly at any given time due to \nmechanical failure. Each plane requires a full year of maintenance for \nevery 4 years spent on duty. A 41-year-old aircraft runs on parts that \nare not commercially available. Corrosion is also a significant \nproblem. In fact, KC-135s spend about 400 days in major depot \nmaintenance every 5 years.\n  So what we have are old planes that cost a fortune to keep flying and \nthat are often down for repairs. That is not what you want in an \naircraft that is used to protect your military around the world in the \nmiddle of a war.\n  Some have suggested that we just keep repairing the existing planes, \nand we could do that. But it does not make sense financially. It takes \nthose planes out of service for a very long time. It would forfeit new \nplanes that are more flexible, more reliable, and more efficient.\n\n  Let me share with the Senate something Secretary Rumsfeld said \nearlier this year:\n\n       We needed to begin moving out some of the older pieces of \n     equipment that are--aircraft and various things that require \n     so much upkeep and maintenance and so much on spare parts, \n     that it is unwise to continue to try to maintain them.\n\n  Secretary Rumsfeld also said:\n\n       So you end up trying to take a 1934 Oldsmobile and prop it \n     up for another five, six years, and there's a point beyond \n     which that doesn't make good sense.\n\n  We have reached that point.\n  I show you a picture of an old Oldsmobile. I think it is actually a \n1939 Olds, but it proves the same point.\n  We could keep repairing them, but it does not make sense to keep \npumping money into a 41-year-old airframe. It is expensive. If you want \nto keep one of these old planes going, you probably are going to have \nto remove the plane's metal skin because these planes, as I said \nbefore, have a lot of corrosion.\n  I share with my colleagues a photograph showing some of the problems \nwith the metal on these aging tankers.\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\n  To ``re-skin'' this airplane costs $26 million. Does it make sense to \ndo that to 100 planes? Mr. President, $26 million is an awful lot of \nmoney to fix one problem with one 41-year-old plane.\n  After you have replaced the skin of the aircraft, it is probably \ngoing to need new engines. That is not cheap. To put a new engine in \n100, 125 tankers is going to cost $3 billion. That is a lot of money \nfor a 41-year-old airplane.\n  There are other parts that need to be replaced. It would be one thing \nif you could fix them all today, but it takes a long time to overhaul \nthese tankers. Right now, we are overhauling four a year. At a certain \npoint, it is just not worth dumping money into these old planes.\n  K-135s were first delivered to the Air Force in 1957. On average, \nthey are 41-year-olds, and we are paying for it. They have been around \nlonger than most of the people who are flying them. There is no \nquestion they must be replaced with new tankers; the only question is \nwhen.\n  I would love for us to be able to buy these new tankers today, but \nthere is not enough money in the Air Force's procurement budget. So \nmany of us in Congress have worked very hard to work out a more \nflexible approach, an approach that is used with commercial aircraft \nall the time.\n  In December, Congress approved, and the President signed, legislation \nto authorize the Air Force to negotiate with Boeing on a 10-year lease \nof 100 new 767 aircraft to use as air tankers. Congress has authorized \nthe lease program for both the 767 and the 737 aircraft. My colleagues \nwill recall that the bill to authorize these lease programs for the Air \nForce was approved by this Senate 96 to 4.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues what the Secretary of the Air \nForce, James Roche, wrote to me in a letter. I will quote:\n\n       The KC-135 fleet is the backbone of our Nation's Global \n     Reach. But with an average age of over 41 years, coupled with \n     the increasing expense required to maintain them, it is \n     readily apparent that we must start replacing these critical \n     assets. I strongly endorse beginning to upgrade this critical \n     warfighting capability with new Boeing 767 tanker aircraft.\n\n  That is from Air Force Secretary James Roche.\n  My home State of Washington is home to the 92nd Air Refueling Wing. \nThere are approximately 60 air refueling tankers that are based outside \nof Spokane, WA. I have been to Fairchild. I have visited personally \nwith the families. I know the difficult missions these crews handle for \neach one of us every single day. And I know the men and women of the \n92nd Air Refueling Wing need these aircraft.\n  The Senator from Arizona talks about leasing aircraft as if the lives \nof our men and women in uniform were not at stake. I remind my \ncolleagues that we are talking about equipping young American pilots \nand the missions they support to go forward with the greatest \nopportunity to succeed.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the Senate, tomorrow, to table the McCain \namendment.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the events of the past 11 months \nhave forced every American to become more vigilant against the threats \nto our nation's security. I want to commend the chairman, Senator \nInouye, and the ranking member, Senator Stevens, for bringing to the \nfloor a bill that responds to such threats by better protecting our \nNation's citizens as well as our servicemen and women.\n  Even before the attacks of September 11th of last year, however, our \nNation's military began to see that traditional notions of warfare and \ndefense would have to evolve to meet new and ever more dangerous \nthreats. The bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen, for example, made clear \nto us that our naval forces must be equipped with the most advanced \nsurveillance and response vessels available.\n  It is for this reason that I have an amendment in support of the \nNavy's development and demonstration of the SeaLion craft. This vessel, \ndesigned for coastal area operations here in the United States and \nabroad, has already begun to prove itself capable of meeting the \nchallenges faced by our Navy today, and well into the future.\n  Military operations in coastal areas involve significantly different \nchallenges from deep water operations, such as reduced operational \nspace and environmental clutter. Accordingly, surveillance, weapon \nsystems and naval tactics designed for deep water operations are \ninadequate for the complex environmental and dimensional aspects of the \ncoastal battle space. In such areas, small boats can effectively \nprotect coastal installations, combat blue water navies, and hinder \nfreedom of navigation for these navies and their supply ships.\n  The rapidly evolving nature of maritime warfare, the threat of \nterrorist activities against our naval forces abroad, and the need to \nprotect our own ports here at home: each of these challenges require \nthat the United States make a concerted effort to maintain a solid lead \nin the development of advanced technologies for coastal operations.\n  The SeaLion craft is perfectly positioned to support this role. It is \na high speed, low-radar-signature vessel whose unique versatility lends \nitself to a broad spectrum of mission applications, from surveillance \nto interdiction to engagement. The SeaLion has already received strong \nendorsement from the Naval Sea Systems Command for its utility in \nspecial operations, and is poised for further evaluation as part of the \nNavy's Littoral Combat Ship platform.\n  This amendment would allow $8 million of funds appropriated by the \nbill to be used for the continued development, demonstration and \nevaluation of the SeaLion vessel. I ask for my colleagues' support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7728-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that my remarks appear at someplace \nin the Record other than in association with the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in response to the terrorist acts of \nSeptember 11, the Bush administration--like so many other \nadministrations before it--has chosen to demonstrate its tough stand \nagainst something. In the case of the Bush administration, it is a \ntough stand against terrorism and its concern for the safety and well-\nbeing of the American people by boldly maneuvering the Federal chess \npieces to create a new Department called Homeland Security.\n  It is an impressive move, Mr. President--this reorganization of the \nGovernment. Many say that it is the greatest reorganization during the \npast half century. I think it could very well be said that it is the \ngreatest reorganization since the Founding Fathers reorganized the \nGovernment in 1787.\n  At that particular time, the 13 colonies--by then 13 States--had been \nunder the operation of the Articles of Confederation. And many of those \nwho served in the Senate in 1789 had been Members of the Congress under \nthe Articles of Confederation and had been Members of the Continental \nCongress, which first met on September 5, 1774. The Framers of the U.S. \nConstitution reorganized our Government so that when their work product \nhad been ratified by the States--the required number of nine for \nratification--we then became the United States of America. We were no \nlonger under the Articles of Confederation. That constituted a \nreorganization of our Government.\n  But I am talking about a reorganization that is being proposed today. \nI say that it is the most massive reorganization that has occurred \nsince the Framers reorganized the Government\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\nthrough the ratifying conventions and the ratifications by the \nrequisite necessary number of States--reorganized the Government so \nthat it was no longer a government under the Articles of Confederation. \nRather, it was the United States Government under the United States \nConstitution.\n  As to the current proposal, it is no wimpy reorganization. To check \nterrorism within our borders, the administration has proposed to \nestablish a massive new Department of Homeland Security. It will be a \nDepartment so large that it will affect an estimated 170,000 Federal \nemployees and will constitute the largest Department--the third \nlargest--after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs.\n  From what I have read, the thousands of workers of this proposed \nDepartment will be doing essentially the same job they are already \ndoing, but they will be doing it under a different newly consolidated \nroof with different lines of authority. Why the administration seems to \nthink that these workers will perform their duties better just because \nthey are transferred to a new agency has both bothered and baffled me \nuntil late last week.\n  Last week, President Bush let it be known that if any version of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security passes the Congress which ensures Civil \nService protections, collective bargaining rights, and other provisions \nto safeguard Federal workers' rights and protections, he will veto it.\n  At first, I thought this was simply another of the usual pokes at \nFederal workers. There is the unfortunate implication in the \nPresident's veto threat that the current Federal workforce is so full \nof slackers--there are some there, no doubt--but it is so full of \nslackers and ineptitude that he may need to get rid of them all and \nhire a new Federal force.\n  But then as I thought about the President's claims that the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security will need the ability--get \nthis--to act ``without all kinds of bureaucratic rules and obstacles,'' \nI began to have other concerns about the Bush administration's \nintentions.\n  It may be that this White House crowd, comprised of CEOs, corporate \nmanagers, and other wealthy business elites, may be seeking to use the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to further their efforts to run the \nFederal Government more like a corporation, seeking freedom to hire and \nfire dedicated public servants, many of them experts in their fields, \nat will.\n  By the way, the actions of CEOs are not exactly models--and I am not \ntalking about all CEOs, of course. But the actions of CEOs we have been \nreading about recently are not exactly models on which to run much of \nanything these days, and I hope that I am not detecting the same \ncavalier attitude about Federal pensions that we have seen in press \naccounts detailing the horrific pension ripoffs by some of our large \ncorporations.\n  No one wants to deny the administration the ability to take \nreasonable steps to foster flexibility within the proposed new agency, \nbut I question the real motivation behind the administration's \nobjections to worker protections. Let's face it, the players in this \nadministration do not have much of a reputation as champions of basic \nprotections for workers.\n  President Bush is currently pushing the Congress to subject 425,000 \nFederal jobs to contractor competition by the end of his term. This \nadministration has made it a goal to take Federal jobs and dole them \nout like candy to private firms, apparently.\n  In drafting its proposed reorganization, the administration started \nwith a panel of four--four white collar political players; four white \ncollar political players in the bowels of the White House, in the \nsubterranean caverns of the White House.\n  Who were the geniuses behind this idea? Mr. Andrew Card, a fine \ngentleman--I like him, a very able man; former Gov. Tom Ridge, a fine \ngentleman, a very able official, who has had great experience in \nrunning the Governor's office in one of our larger States in the Union, \none of the States that was among the first 13, by the way. Then there \nis the White House counsel, I believe his name is Gonzales. I am not \nsure I know him very well. And then the fourth in this quartet of \nmaster planners is none other than Mr. Mitch Daniels, the Director of \nthe Office of Management and Budget.\n\n  So there is the quartet. Not quite the caliber, I would say--although \none may wish to debate it--it may be worthy of argumentation--not quite \nthe caliber of the committee of five that wrote the Declaration of \nIndependence: Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, William \nLivingston, and Roger Sherman. Roger Sherman is the only one of the \nfive who signed all of the founding documents of this great Nation. Now \nthere was a committee of five.\n  So while there may be some argument as to how one would stack up \nagainst the other, I would put my bets on the committee of five that \nwrote the Declaration of Independence. I will stay with them. No \ndisrespect intended, of course, to the White House committee of four, \nbut they operated in secret in the bowels of the White House. I \nunderstand that when the President unveiled this massive monstrosity, \nsome of the Department heads in the Government had not been in on the \ndeal until the day that it was sprung.\n  It sprang like Aphrodite from the ocean foam. She sprang from the \nocean foam and was carried on a leaf to the Island of Crete. She later \nappeared before the gods on Mount Olympus and, of course, they were \ndazzled by her beauty. This Homeland Security plan came into being \nabout like that, or one might compare its sudden emergence with the \ngoddess Minerva who sprang from the forehead of Jove, the forehead of \nJupiter. Minerva sprang fully armed and clothed from the forehead of \nJove.\n  That is about the way this thing came into being. That was the \ngenesis of it, down there in the White House. It was conceived in \nsecret and was born in secret, and there we are.\n  So the administration has given these white-collar political \nplayers--there were four of them in the beginning--free rein to move \nFederal workers around from one agency to the other in the name of \nhomeland defense. That same administration now appears poised to \nsabotage the pay, the health benefits, and the retirement benefits of \nthe very Federal workers it wants to involve with safeguarding our \nhomeland security.\n  There is nothing like threatening jobs and health benefits to give a \nboost, of course, to the morale of the employees of a new and very \nimportant Department. This is just what we need to energize our new \nHomeland Security Department, is it not? They will like that--\njeopardize their benefits and their pay and their jobs. Imagine the \nconcentration level of nail-biting employees concerned about where \ntheir next paycheck is coming from. Think about that. And what will \nhappen to their families if the Bush administration prevails in freeing \nitself from the normal restrictions which safeguard Federal workers' \nrights?\n  For those who doubt my concerns, I ask them to examine the Bush \nadministration's attitude toward Federal workers. It has been clearly \nexpressed by recent comments. Administration spokesman Ari Fleischer, \nfor example, has said that Federal workers need to be stripped of their \nrights and protections because managers in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will need the ability to fire a worker who was drunk on the \njob and as a result allowed terrorists into the country. Great stuff! \nGreat motivation, for a Federal workforce on whom we will rely for our \nsafety, and those of our families and friends and associates, and \npeople all over the country.\n  I do not see anyone defending drunken workers. Not me. I would not \ndefend a drunken worker. We do not have to strip all Federal workers of \ntheir basic rights and threaten their pay and retirement benefits in \norder to deal with one worker who has been drinking on the job. I \ncertainly do not defend that kind of behavior.\n  This comment was a needless and irresponsible cheap shot at hundreds \nof thousands of dedicated, hard-working Federal employees who are \nlaboring day and night in many instances for far less money than they \ncould be earning in the private sector. I think Mr. Fleischer owes them \nall an apology. Federal workers are not the problem. They are the \nunsung heroes who are protecting our homeland.\n  Pause for a moment and think about that. They are the Border Patrol \nagents. Federal workers are the Border\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nPatrol agents guarding our 6,000-mile-long borders when we think of \nboth borders with Mexico and Canada. All day, and all night while the \nrest of us are sleeping, they are guarding those borders, guarding us. \nThose are Federal workers. They are the Customs Service inspectors who \nhave been working around the clock since September 11 to prevent \nweapons of mass destruction from being carried in containers through \nour ports of entry. Those are Federal workers. They are the postal \nworkers who have to think about delivering packages of anthrax. They \nare the Federal workers who have had to deal with the anthrax threat. \nWhat about the Center for Disease Control workers who must confront the \nhard reality of a possible bioterrorist attack every day?\n  Federal employees are the rank-and-file workers who do the bulk of \nthe work in securing the homeland, and they will continue to do the \nbulk of the work in securing this country from sea to shining sea. They \nare the workers who will do the bulk of the work in securing the \nhomeland but who will receive little of the credit and the glory that \ngo to the administration's political appointees.\n\n  The President has asked these Federal employees to be the frontline \nsoldiers in the war on terrorism. They are out there at every hour of \nthe day and the night, somewhere, guarding the ports of this country, \nguarding the borders of this country, guarding the airports of this \ncountry, standing on guard. And the President would reward them by \ntrying to take away their basic labor, civil service rights, and job \nprotections?\n  I was especially alarmed by OMB Director Mitch Daniels' explanation \nfor stripping Federal workers of their rights. Mr. Mitch Daniels said:\n\n       Our adversaries are not encumbered by a lot of rules. Al-\n     Qaida does not have a three foot thick code. This department \n     is going to need to be nimble.\n\n  This is a startling, as well as frightening, remark. Since when did \nal-Qaida become our role model for labor-management relations? I \nthought we were out to destroy al-Qaida, not emulate them. Ha, ha, ha, \nha, ha. No, they do not have a 3-foot code of rules. Al-Qaida also does \nnot have this code which I hold in my hand, the Constitution of the \nUnited States, but we do. We have this code, this Constitution.\n  Is this administration using the 19th-century industrial robber \nbarons as its role model for labor-management relations? What is going \non in the heads of these so-called administration spokesmen? The \nPresident had better rein in some of these spokesmen. Destroying the \nbasic rights of Federal workers is not how we should be combating \nterrorism. The fight against terrorism does not have to be fought by \nworkers stripped of basic labor rights. Denying basic rights and \nprotections to workers always makes recruitment of skilled and \nexperienced employees difficult.\n  But just as important as the necessity that our Federal workforce be \na secure workforce, a workforce composed of employees who know they \nwill be protected from politics, cronyism, and favoritism, it must be a \nworkforce armed with protections that can allow them to speak out about \nmismanagement without fear of losing jobs.\n  It is rank-and-file Government workers, who are on the job every day \nand night, keeping Government operating, protecting you, Mr. President, \nprotecting me, protecting our friends in the fourth estate there in the \ngallery. These are the Government workers who make the Government \nfunction, and they are the Government workers upon whom we now depend \nto protect us.\n  I can't help but think of those incredible workers at FEMA who have \ndone such a tremendous job, time and time again, in response to floods \nin West Virginia and in crisis situations in every other State in the \nUnion. It was a Federal employee of the Customs Service who apprehended \na terrorist, Ahmed Ressam, with 134 pounds of explosives in December of \n1999 at the border in the State of Washington. Later, the terrorist \nconfirmed that it was his intent to bomb Los Angeles Airport during the \n2000 New Year's celebration. These are the players that this \nadministration threatens to strip of their rights and benefits.\n  The assertion that Federal workers cannot be disciplined under \nexisting Federal guidelines is somewhat of a myth. There are strict \nperformance requirements for Federal workers already in place. There \nare performance reviews annually and initial hires on probation for 1 \nyear. No new rules are necessary. No new blanket exceptions for basic \nlabor rights are needed by this administration. This administration has \nnot even got legislation in place which clearly identifies the mission \nof this new Department, and this administration is already trying to \nblame the Federal workforce for any potential failures that might occur \nin the future.\n  Again, I say, slow down. Let's slow down. Let's slow down. Let's slow \nthis proposed legislation down. I am not saying today that I am against \na Department of Homeland Security. But what is the rush? What is the \nrush? Consider carefully a veto threat of any bill setting up a \nDepartment of Homeland Security which does not give this White House \nsweeping new powers, sweeping new powers to abolish workers rights and \nworkers protections.\n  Imagine that; imagine a veto that would do that. I think the agenda \nof this White House is becoming very, very clear. And we had better \npause, we had better stop, we had better look, and we had better \nlisten. Talk about passing this massive new law, creating a massive, \nmonstrous behemoth by September 11, by an artificial deadline! This \nlegislation would emasculate certain portions of this Constitution \nwhich I hold in my hand--emasculate it! Trample it into the dirt!\n  Mr. President, I have been here 50 years. I am not in the Senate \ntoday because I need a Senate salary. I could have retired 2 years ago \nwhen my 7th term was completed. I could be drawing a check today, a \nretirement check. I have been in the Senate and the House 50 years. I \ndon't have to work here to put bread and butter on the table for my \nwife, to whom I have been wed 65 years and 2 months, the day before \nyesterday. I don't have to have it. Why am I here? I should be at home \nwith her. I should be living with my grandchildren, my great-\ngrandchildren, enjoying a little leisure at the end of a long, long \nworklife that began in the mining camps of southern West Virginia a \nlong time ago.\n  No, I am here to protect this Constitution and this Institution of \nwhich you, Senator, from Minnesota, and you, Senator, from Hawaii, and \n97 other Senators are a part. That is it. Some give their lives on the \nbattlefield in wars. There are others of us who give our lives in \npublic service. I am one of them.\n\n  Let's slow down. We don't know what the unintended consequences will \nbe of the passage of this legislation. Study the House bill. Study the \nHouse-passed bill. The House passed a bill after 2 days of debate. I \nbelieve there were 132 Members of the House who voted against that \nbill. Were they against homeland security? No! Those Members of the \nHouse who voted against that bill were as much for homeland security as \nI am, as much as the President of the United States is. They were for \nhomeland security. I am for homeland security. I defy anyone to say \nthat the Senator in the chair, that the Senator who sits just behind \nme, or any other Senator, is against homeland security.\n  Many times I have stood before that desk up there and put my hand on \nthe Holy Bible, and I have sworn to support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is \nwhy I am here. We are in too big a hurry to pass this bill. For what \nreason? Because there is an election coming on.\n  And then there were some well intentioned souls, but so gullible, as \nto suggest that we ought to do this big ``thing'' before September 11 \nor by September 11, the anniversary of the most horrendous attack \nagainst this country that has ever occurred. Why September 11?\n  We have a duty to discuss this bill at length. I say to all Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, hear me, the people out there across this \ncountry are not clamoring for this legislation. The politicians are \nclamoring for it. The same people who will work under this new Homeland \nSecurity Department are already working today for homeland security in \nthe various agencies that will be transferred to this department. They \nare already on the job. The Appropriations Committees of\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nboth Houses have already acted to release funds for homeland security \ntime and time again, last year and this year.\n\n  Then, the people of this country are being urged to pressure their \nrepresentatives to act on this Department. This Department was \nconceived in the bowels of the White House by four Federal workers--\nfour members of the White House staff!\n  Take time to study what we are about to do! Read title 8 of the \nHouse-passed bill. It scares me! Read title 8.\n  I think the agenda of this White House is becoming very clear. It is \nnot homeland security that this White House is lusting after. Bin Laden \nis not the only target at which this administration is pointing its \nsix-gun. Clearly in the bull's eye is also the job security of \nthousands of Federal employees and the core values of rights for the \nworkers. And there it is. I will have more to say on this subject.\n  I am talking about the Constitution and about this Institution, Mr. \nPresident. Think of it! Think of the blood that has been shed by men \nand women over these past 216 years to uphold this Constitution, to \nprotect the security of this country.\n  There is a man in the chair (Mr. Cleland) who has given everything \nbut his life for his country. I would be ashamed to run against him. I \nwould be ashamed to be a candidate, put myself up against that man--or \nthis man here behind me (Mr. Inouye).\n  We had better go slow. We can easily tear down in a few weeks what it \nhas taken centuries to build.\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town;\n     With a ``Ho, heave, ho'' and a lusty yell,\n     They swung a beam and the sidewall fell.\n     I said to the foreman, ``Are these men skilled\n     The type you'd hire if you had to build?''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed,\n     Just common labor is all I need;\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n     I said to myself as I walked away,\n     ``Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7731-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7731-S7733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRISIS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DODD. First, I commend my colleague from Hawaii for his fine \nleadership on the pending matter before the Senate dealing with the \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  The matter that I wish to address regards the nation of Haiti, a \ntragedy that is unfolding a short distance from our own shores, \nliterally only 90 or 100 miles away from the coast of the United \nStates. As yesterday's New York Times article entitled ``Eight Years \nAfter Invasion, Haiti's Squalor Worsens,'' written by David Gonzalez, \nmakes abundantly clear, the people of Haiti in that article, as we \nknow, are on the verge of despair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article written by David Gonzalez in \nthe New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Eight Years After Invasion, Haiti's Squalor Worsens\n\n       Sonia Jean-Pierre's life is one of apocalyptic misery. With \n     hardly any food or work, her only refuge is a concrete cell. \n     The searing sun is blotted out by cardboard pasted over the \n     windows. On the wall by her bed, she has scrawled, ``Jesus \n     Christ is coming soon,'' like a promise of salvation to greet \n     her every morning.\n       Ms. Jean-Pierre and hundreds of neighbors live as squatters \n     inside the old Fort Dimanche Prison once the brutally \n     efficient killing chamber of the Duvalier dictatorships. A \n     prison no longer, it has been renamed, hopefully, Village \n     Democratie. The poor cram themselves into the dingy cells and \n     even inside the old sentry towers that look out over the \n     surrounding shanties, where 2,000 more souls live without \n     water, schools or electricity. Some are so desperate they eat \n     pancakelike disks of bouillon-flavored clay. Poverty is the \n     only jailer.\n       ``We are free prisoners,'' said Ms. Jean-Pierre, who rested \n     one recent afternoon on the cool concrete floor. ``We are \n     still living like prisoners.''\n       Nearly eight years after the United States led an invasion \n     of Haiti to oust a military junta and restore President Jean-\n     Bertrand Aristide to power, Village Democratie is just one \n     measure of this country's despairing slide.\n       Increasingly exasperated with Mr. Aristide's government, \n     which has yet to resolve a two-year-old deadlock with its \n     opposition, the United States and European countries have \n     blocked some $500 million in aid, hoping to encourage greater \n     democracy. Critics say the decision has merely eroded the \n     hopes and deepened the poverty of this country's seven \n     million or so people.\n       For a nation as poor as Haiti, withholding the money has \n     become both carrot and stick. Haiti still lingers near the \n     bottom of the United Nations' annual survey of living \n     conditions. Life expectancy is less than 53 years. \n     Preventable diseases go untreated. The yearly income of the \n     average family is less than is needed to sustain a single \n     person.\n       Mr. Aristide calls the withholding of the aid an \n     ``embargo.'' His American supporters, including the \n     Congressional Black Caucus and well-paid lobbyists, say it is \n     immoral to withhold the aid and punish the Haitian people, as \n     government agencies go without budgets, plans or projects to \n     provide water, health care and schools. Some $150 million \n     from the United States, they note, might not only improve \n     roads, water and health but also create jobs.\n       Still, diplomats and aid officials say, Mr. Aristide's use \n     of the term ``embargo'' reflects calculated rhetoric more \n     than reality. Trade and travel continue, and relief, \n     including contributions from the United States, flows into \n     Haiti through nongovernmental groups.\n       Solving Haiti's problems, they argue, will take more than \n     just an infusion of aid. Most important, they say Mr. \n     Aristide has yet to prove that his government has escaped the \n     corruption and destructive self-interest of governments past.\n       Meanwhile, the political stalemate, which arose over a \n     disputed election, and the international response to it, have \n     stalled what little functioning government democracy might \n     have brought.\n       ``The situation is getting worse for the majority of the \n     people,'' said the Rev. Jan Hanssens, a Roman Catholic priest \n     who sits on the Justice and Peace Commission of the Bishops' \n     Conference. ``There is certainly no hope unless there is a \n     drastic reassessment of Haitian society itself. If things \n     simply go on as now, there is no chance.''\n       Along the streets of Village Democratie, faith in \n     politicians is as elusive as a decent job. Faded posters of \n     Mr. Aristide, wearing the presidential sash and with his arms \n     outstretched, are his only presence.\n       Laughing young men crouched at the entrance to the former \n     prison and gambled a few wrinkled gourde notes, the country's \n     currency. Inside, past corridors whose crumbled walls reveal \n     a weed-choked courtyard, people walked home after church \n     clutching hymnals titled ``Songs of Hope.''\n       Inside tiny rooms with cardboard walls, slim shafts of \n     sunlight cut through the haze of charcoal smoke from braziers \n     where pots of rice boiled. There are no sewers or running \n     water anywhere in the neighborhood, and when the rains come \n     they leave fetid puddles where malaria-carrying mosquitoes \n     breed.\n       ``Artistide said here is the room of the people,'' said \n     Dorlis Ephesans. ``But he has never showed his face here.''\n       Some of the residents had tried to leave Haiti during the \n     1991 coup that ousted Mr. Aristide. Some made it to Miami, \n     some died and others like Israel Arince, were caught at sea \n     and returned.\n       The same America that sent him back to Haiti and restored \n     Mr. Aristide to power in 1994, Mr. Arince said, now make life \n     impossible.\n       ``They have blocked the country from getting aid,'' he \n     said. ``We are human beings and we do not like to live like \n     this. Only animals should live here.''\n       In La Saline sum, down a busy road near the prison that is \n     often choked with carts and traffic, pigs waded through \n     streams of human waste and poked their snouts into mountains \n     of garbage in a drainage canal. Young women dropped plastic \n     buckets into a sewer and hauled out a gray water they would \n     use to wash their floors. Potable water is too expensive.\n       ``There is no way to be healthy here,'' said Elisena \n     Nicolas, who spends a third of her income on water. ``But you \n     have to keep the children clean.''\n       As hard as it is to conceive, people come to La Saline to \n     escape rural misery. In the Central Plateau town of Cange, \n     doctors with the Zanmi Lasante clinic and children commonly \n     died from malaria or diarrhea, while tuberculosis and AIDS \n     killed their parents. Even polio, once thought to have been \n     eradicated, has resurfaced recently.\n       Although the clinic receives no international aid, doctors \n     said they worked with many Haitian government clinics in \n     nearby villages where the frozen aid has left them unable to \n     cope. In recent years, their volunteer clinic's patient load \n     has tripled to 120,000, with patients sometimes walking five \n     hours for free care.\n       Dr. Paul Farmer, an American who helped found the clinic in \n     the 1980's, said he could not prove that the blocked aid \n     resulted in more suffering, but the deteriorating conditions \n     were evident. International aid, provided on an emergency \n     basis to charitable groups, was no substitute for a working \n     government, he said.\n       ``One of the world's most powerful countries is taking on \n     one of the most impoverished,'' he said of the United States \n     decision to withhold aid. ``I object to that on moral \n     grounds. Anybody who presides over this blockade needs to \n     know the impact here already.''\n       But Haiti's record of official corruption and \n     mismanagement, regardless of who was in power, has given \n     pause to many international aid officials. A recent study by \n     the World Bank concluded that 15 years of aid\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n     through 2001 had had no discernible impact in reducing \n     poverty, since projects were carried out haphazardly and \n     government officials aid not sustain improvements.\n       Today, for instance, a maze of rat-infested pipes is all \n     that is left of a potable water project after funds ran out \n     before the pipes could be connected to the water main.\n       At the same time, political opponents and diplomats said, \n     the government has money to provide cars for legislators or \n     pay off neighborhood groups that are its foot soldiers and \n     that the opposition charges, have been used to intimidate \n     government opponents.\n       As a result, diplomats and aid officials said Mr. Aristide \n     must not only resolve this political crisis, he must also \n     show that he will allow economic and administrative reforms \n     to guarantee that any forthcoming aid will be honestly spent.\n       ``We are saying we want to help you,'' said a European \n     diplomat, who noted that the European Union was ready to \n     provide $350 million. ``But you must help us help you. You \n     comply, I'll comply.''\n       Absent any aid or a political pact, people scrape by as \n     they have for years, sharing what little they have or \n     sacrificing themselves for their children. In the \n     neighborhood of Fort Sinclaire, a dilapidated maze of shacks, \n     indigent teenagers with tuberculosis sleep on sheets spread \n     out on hard concrete porches.\n       A soft carpet of soggy wood chips blankets the entrance to \n     the neighborhood, as men carve wooden bowls to sell to \n     tourists who have yet to return to Haiti. Lionel Agustain, a \n     woodworker, sometimes earns two dollars a day, not enough to \n     prevent him from losing his home a few years ago.\n       A friend lets him sleep on a rickety cot inside a gym where \n     the weights are improved for gears and other car parts. The \n     walls are tauntingly decorated with wrinkled posters of \n     bodybuilders with bulging chest and bicep Mr. Agustian is \n     thin, and he sometimes eats only a bowl of rice.\n       ``We don't know when they are going to fix things,'' he \n     said. ``We suffer. And when you suffer enough, you die.''\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I share with my colleagues briefly the \nsituation in Haiti. This is one of the most desperate countries in the \nworld, a few miles from our shore. There has been pending over the last \n2 years a $500 million request through the Inter-American Development \nBank. The United States of America, and several of its allies, are \nholding up the disbursement of these funds to one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. Seven million people in that country are \nsuffering incredibly. It is being held up over a question of whether or \nnot institutions in that nation are as strong as they ought to be, \nwhether or not there is corruption, and whether or not the elections \nthat occurred in 2000 were fair, open, and honest.\n  I am not going to argue about any of that. There is corruption. The \nagencies, administration, and structures are very weak. The elections \nin 2000 had major flaws in them. I am not arguing about that, either. \nBut for the strongest, wealthiest nation in the world, that stands 90 \nto 100 miles away from one of the poorest nations in the world, and to \nhave us deny Inter-American Development Bank funds, through our power \nand influence, to reach these desperately poor, dying people, where \nlife expectancy is age 53, where there are problems with malaria, \ndiarrhea, and tremendous hardship--polio has reemerged on this island--\nI think is terribly wrong.\n  This article, written by David Gonzalez, points out how desperate the \nsituation is in Haiti. I will not read all of the article but he talks \nabout shanties, he talks about the former prison at Fort Dimanche, a \nprison in Port-Au-Prince where now 2,000 people live without any water, \nschooling, or electricity. These are fellow human beings who are in \ngreat despair, living under the worst possible of circumstances.\n  In rural areas as well, local clinics have shut down and one clinic, \naccording to David Gonzalez's article, in the Central Plateau town of \nCange, doctors with the Lasante Clinic dealt with 120,000 patients who \ncame to them in recent years. The clinic's patients tripled to 120,000, \npatients sometimes walking 5 hours for care.\n  As I mentioned, tuberculosis, malaria, and now even polio, once \nthought to be eradicated, is emerging. I am hopeful that the IDB, the \nInter-American Development Bank, would listen to those who have been \nsupportive of this Bank. I have been supportive, as many of my \ncolleagues have, over the years. For the IDB to hold back on these \nfunds any longer is wrong.\n  Haiti is sinking deeper and deeper into irreversible poverty. The \nextent of the heartache now being endured by the Haitian people is \nsimply unspeakable. Their suffering is devastating and it is far \nreaching. In some places there is no potable water, there are no \nsewers, there are no basic medicines on hand to treat disease, no \nmedical infrastructure in place to ward off otherwise easily \npreventable diseases.\n  Haiti ranks as one of the lowest on the U.N. survey of living \nconditions. As I mentioned, life expectancy is age 53. Of course, the \ndespair and hopelessness which prey upon the victims of such suffering \ncannot be quantified.\n  It is the people of Haiti, in my view, who should be our concern \ntoday, not the flaws of their political institutions. I am deeply \nsaddened and incensed in many ways that we are planning electoral \nnegotiations over the clear, tangible plight of a people.\n  Ironically, it is the United States that has taken the lead in \npreventing Haiti from receiving assistance from the International \nDevelopment Bank, the institution that is supposed to be the premier \nregional development agency. Proponents of withholding crucial IDB \nfunding point to Haiti's weak institutions, to the need for drastic and \ntimely economic and administrative reforms, as a prerequisite for \nrestarting assistance.\n  It is true, Haiti is an impoverished nation with weak institutions. \nIt is true there is corruption at high levels. I do not deny that. And, \nyes, there is a serious need for reform in these areas. It is also very \ntrue that poor countries breed weak institutions and seek to strengthen \nthemselves and help their people with the assistance of international \nhumanitarian aid, but that is not the real reason that assistance is \nbeing withheld. The real reason funds are being withheld is political--\n-- namely, as leverage in an ongoing Organization of American States \nnegotiations to resolve issues related to the May 2000 elections of \nthat country.\n\n  The Secretary-General of the OAS has endeavored over the last 2 years \nto resolve the political stalemate in Haiti and the disputed 2000 \nparliamentary elections. He has put on the negotiating table a balanced \nand credible proposal for resolving the election dispute and is working \nto ensure the security and other matters of concern to the Haitian \nsociety that are being seriously considered by the Haitian Government. \nI believe they are.\n  That said, Haiti has flawed elections. Absolutely. We are talking \nabout a country without a long historial tradition of democracy. While \nthis worsens, and public faith in government is reduced to zero, what \nremains of the fragile democracy is eroded further. Even in the United \nStates, with our proud history, peaceful transition of power, orderly \nelections, and representative governments, we have had significant \ntroubles with our own elections. Merely look at what happened in the \nyear 2000 in this country with our elections. No one is perfect.\n  In one of the most desperately poor nations in the world, it should \nnot be a great surprise that institutions and electoral processes are \nnot what we would like them to be. By not providing basic help, by the \nUnited States blocking the assistance reaching the desperately poor \npeople, we are not strengthening the institutions but making it worse \nand harder for the Nation to get back on its feet.\n  I have always strongly opposed linkage between ongoing political \ndialog and the Haitian access to resources of the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank. These moneys have been held hostage for too long. The \ndamage to the Haitian economy is devastating. The good-faith efforts of \nthe Government in responding to the OAS initiative should be more than \nenough justification for beginning the process of loan disbursements \nfrom the Inter-American Development Bank. Although the state of despair \nin Haiti is all the justification that should be needed for an \ninstitution whose primary obligation, as the IDB, is to promote \neconomic and social development in this hemisphere, and they are doing \nanything but that.\n  Shame on the Inter-American Development Bank for being used in this \nmanner. It does not speak well for an institution that for the most \npart has a good reputation. Shame on the Government of the United \nStates for pressuring the IDB to do so. Seven million people are \ndesperately in need of help. We have gone on now for years denying this \nbasic assistance. It is time to put\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\na stop to playing politics with Haitian lives, and it is time to \nrespond to the unfolding crisis in Haiti. I urge the administration to \nwithhold, to lift the embargo, on the dollars.\n  For those who have supported the IDB year in and year out, it has \nbeen terribly disappointing to me that they have continued to acquiesce \nin the demands of the Bush administration to deny the disbursements of \nthese dollars. I hope they will take the action of saying they have \nwaited long enough and they will provide the assistance needed to the \nHaitian people.\n  We are about to leave for a month and the situation is growing worse. \nI ask my colleague to take a look at the David Gonzalez article in the \nNew York Times yesterday. This is a snapshot of what is going on in the \ncountry and what desperately poor people are suffering as a result of \nthe lack of support. They would suffer anyway. I am not suggesting this \nwill solve all their problems. It is hard to believe we are holding up \nthe funds--seeing how these people live, how these children are being \nraised, only a few miles off our shore, when we could make a little bit \nof a difference. We could also strengthen the very institutions we are \ncomplaining so strongly about if we provided that kind of help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7733-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      VETERANS HEALTH CARE NETWORK\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I regret to come to the floor today with \na concern that I find absolutely extraordinary--even shocking.\n  This is a memorandum which represents an extraordinary broken promise \nto the veterans of our country. I want to share it with my colleagues \nwho I think would share with me a sense of outrage over what is \ncontained in this memorandum.\n  This is a memorandum from Laura Miller, Under Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs for Health for Operations and Management, which she circulated \non July 18. It orders the directors of the Veterans Health Care Network \nin the country to end their veterans outreach activities.\n  Let me read from the memorandum. It says specifically:\n  In this environment, marketing the VA services with such activities \nas health fairs, and veteran open houses to invite new veterans to the \nfacilities, or enrollment displays at VSO meetings are inappropriate. \nTherefore, I am directing each network director to ensure that no \nmarketing activities to enroll new veterans occur within your networks.\n  In other words, the promise made to veterans and their families that \nthese services will be available to them--and many of them don't know \nexactly what all the services are--that is why we put into place the \noutreach efforts in order to guarantee that people aren't denied those \nservices which they might have forthcoming. Those services are not now \ngoing to be provided. They are not going to be reaching out to veterans \nto make them aware of them. I find that absolutely extraordinary.\n  There are approximately 70 million people who are potentially \neligible for VA benefits and services because they are veterans and \nfamily members or survivors of veterans. They stand to lose those \nbenefits because the VA is simply going to hide or retreat from \nreaching out in the way that all of us here in Congress specifically \ncodified and put into law that they do.\n  I know the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is a Vietnam veteran and is \na distinguished, decorated veteran. I absolutely can't believe that he \nknows this went out. I can't believe that it went out under his order, \nparticularly when you compare it to his own statement on the VA Web \nsite. There is a statement by the Secretary that says:\n  Our goal is to provide excellence in patient care, veterans' benefits \nand customer satisfaction. We have reformed our department internally \nand are striving for high-quality, prompt and seamless service to \nveterans.\n  With respect to ``prompt,'' in this memo the Deputy Under Secretary \nsays:\n  The most recent enrollment shows a 13.5 percent increase in users \nthis year compared to the same time last year, and a 15 percent \nincrease in enrollment while expenditures rose 7.8 percent. Against the \noutcome of this situation is a waiting list for patients to be seen in \nmany clinics across the country and general waiting times that exceed \nVHA's standard of 30 days. Moreover, actuarial projections indicate a \nwidening gap in the demand versus resource availability.\n  ``Demand versus resource availability''--those of us from New England \nsat with the Secretary several months ago and made it clear to the \nSecretary that there is an increasing crisis in our VA system because \nof the lack of resources.\n  The ``greatest generation'' veterans--those of World War II--are now \ndemanding services of the VA in greater numbers than before. Our \nmilitary efforts these days are increasing the awareness and the need \nof many people who served for those services. Yet here we are being \ntold we have demand that is exceeding the resources.\n  The resources don't have to be exceeded. That is a matter of \nbudgeting priority of this administration. There are many areas where \nit is obvious that the administration has decided it is more important \nto put money, rather than for the veterans, and in order to keep the \npromise to the veterans of the country.\n  In today's Greenfield Recorder in Massachusetts, a VA spokesperson \nsaid the reason the VA has cut these services is ``because right now we \ncan't give them the kind of care that they deserve.''\n  That is an extraordinary statement in the face of the current \nsituation with troops in Afghanistan and other parts of the world, with \nthe increasing demand of our military and with potential operations in \nIraq that are the subject of hearings before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee today.\n  Under Secretary Miller's memorandum notes that enrollment has \nincreased by some 15 percent. So the budget ought to reflect that. The \nbudget ought to reflect that we need to keep the promise to our \nveterans. The fact is, almost every single budgeting effort in the last \nfew years has been inadequate for the VA. The VA has consistently \nreceived less funding than necessary facing this growing demand.\n  In the fiscal year 2002 budget, there was initially an $80 million \nshortfall for veterans medical care in New England alone. And although \nthis region has confronted the most severe shortages, the situation \nthroughout the country has been similarly bleak.\n  This year, and in previous years, colleagues in the Senate have \nfought to try to up that amount of money. Last week, Congress passed a \nsupplemental with some additional $417 million, but the fact is, the \nincrease in this year's spending is not adequate to meet the demand. It \nis critical that we provide veterans services to nearly 5 million \nveterans in 2003.\n  It is almost so obvious that it should go without saying, but I hope \nthis is going to be reversed immediately. I hope the administration is \ngoing to keep America's promise to our veterans. And I hope they will \nplus up that budget sufficiently to meet the demand and to keep faith \nwith the promise made already to the past several generations of \nveterans and the promise that is today being made to the next \ngeneration of veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7733-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7733-S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MAJ. GEN. WILLIE B. NANCE, JR., U.S. ARMY\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, very soon one of our Nation's finest \nsoldiers will retire from active duty after more than three decades of \ndedicated service to our country. Major General Willie B. Nance, Jr., \nwill retire from the United States Army on November 1, 2002, after \nserving for 34 years. During his distinguished career, General Nance \nserved in a remarkable range of roles, from buck private to two-star \ngeneral, from foot soldier to the manger of one of the most \nsophisticated weapon systems our nation has ever built. General Nance, \nI am proud to say, is a native of Mississippi, and I believe it \nappropriate that the Senate take not of his distinguished career as his \nretirement approaches.\n  General Nance entered the Army in 1968 as a member of the Mississippi \nAll-Volunteer Company, a group of 200 Mississippi volunteers who \nenlisted at the same time under an Army volunteer enlistment campaign. \nHaving proven himself early as a soldier, he was recruited directly \nfrom Basic Training\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\ninto Officer Candidate School, from which he graduated as the honor \ngraduate in 1969.\n  Commissioned into the Infantry as a second lieutenant, General \nNance's early assignments included duties as a rifle company platoon \nleader, reconnaissance platoon leader, and battalion assistant \noperations officer in Korea. He also served twice as an instructor at \nthe U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, GA. As a young captain, \nGeneral Nance was a communications officer, battalion adjutant, and \ncompany commander in the 3rd Armored Division in Germany. Between these \nassignments, he completed Airborne training and was an honor graduate \nfrom the demanding Ranger course.\n  After 13 years of infantry service, General Nance was assigned to the \nArmy Acquisition Corps. In repeated assignments to acquisition \nleadership positions, he developed expertise in every area of \nacquisition management. After serving as an Assistant Product Manager \nfor three years, he became the Executive Officer to the Commanding \nGeneral of the Department of the Army Research and Development Command, \nEurope. As a lieutenant colonel, he managed the Bradley Fighting \nVehicle TOW missile subsystem. As a colonel, he managed both the Army \nTactical Missile System and the Brilliant Anti-Tank munition programs. \nBetween command assignments, General Nance taught acquisition strategy \nas a professor at the Defense System Management College.\n   In his first assignment as a general, General Nance served for two \nyears as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Space and Strategic \nDefense Command. In this position, he oversaw with efficiency, \ninnovation, and compassion a significant reorganization and reduction \nof the technical element of the command.\n  From 1996 to 1998, General Nance served as the Army's Program \nExecutive Officer for Tactical Missiles. In this position, he was \nresponsible not only for managing many complex missile programs costing \nseveral billion dollars annually, but also for creating a strategic \nvision that would guide all army tactical missile programs through the \nArmy's transformation process.\n  In 1998, General Nance undertook perhaps his most challenging \nprofessional task when he became Program Director and Program Executive \nOfficer for National Missile Defense, and he took that post at a \nparticularly difficult time. He inherited a program that had for years \nreceived inadequate funding, and although the missile threat to our \nnation continued to grow, there were still sharp disagreements among \npolitical leaders about how to respond to this threat. Every aspect of \nthe program was under intense scrutiny by the administration, the \nCongress, and the media. General Nance directed a team of government \nand contract workers that stretched from Alabama to Alaska, from \nMassachusetts to the Marshall Islands, and from Colorado to California \nto Hawaii. Under these difficult conditions, General Nance not only put \nthe National Missile Defense program on sound footing, he guided it to \ndramatic successes. In October 1999, his team--on its first attempt--\nachieved the first successful intercept of a reentry vehicle in space \nby a missile defense kill vehicle. That feat has since been repeated \nthree times. It now seems almost routine. But there is nothing routine \nabout such complex technical accomplishments, nor the extraordinary \nleadership that made them possible.\n  In 2001, the Bush administration undertook a strategic review that \nopened the door to more capable missile defenses, and General Nance \nhelped lead an intensive effort to develop and evaluate new approaches \nto defending the United States against missile attack. This effort \nresulted in a fundamental change in the nation's missile defense \nprogram. General Nance was selected to turn this new vision into \nreality when he became the first Program Executive Officer for the \nBallistic Missile Defense System. In this role, he implemented the \nSecretary of Defense's guidance to create a single, integrated \nBallistic Missile Defense System out of ten disparate missile defense \nprograms already under way. That effort required a careful balancing of \nnew concepts for missile defense with already ongoing technical work. \nUnder General Nance's leadership in this, his final assignment, the \nmissile defense program continued to make extraordinary progress toward \nprotecting our nation and its armed forces, with the Ground-based \nMidcourse, Patriot PAC-3, and AEGIS missile defense systems all scoring \nsuccesses in flight testing.\n  General Nance's vision of a single integrated missile defense system \nis becoming a reality today and it will be a lasting legacy of his \nservice to our country. But his legacy goes far beyond even that \nimportant contribution. It extends to the soldiers he has touched \nthroughout his career, to the example he has set, to the sacrifices he \nhas made in long, distinguished, and selfless service to our nation.\n  I am very proud that General Nance is from Mississippi, and that his \nwife, Jonnie is also a Mississippian. We are very proud of both of them \nand we wish them much continued success and happiness together in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7734-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7734-S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IRV KUPCINET: 90 YEARS OF A CHICAGO INSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Chicago \ninstitution and a good friend, Irv Kupcinet, on the occasion of his \n90th birthday on July 31, and to pay tribute to his outstanding \ncontributions to the veterans of the Chicago area. While best known for \nhis work in journalism, Kup has also dedicated a major part of his life \nto serving his community's veterans.\n  Born in 1912, Irv grew up in Chicago. Early on, he had a job cleaning \nPullman Co. railroad cars so that he could earn money to attend \ncollege. He went on to receive his journalism degree from the \nUniversity of North Dakota in 1934. While in college, he was involved \nas both the director of athletic publicity and as the quarterback of \nthe football team. So, during the week, he wrote about sports and on \nSaturday, he played them. Initially he was headed toward a future in \nfootball. He was even selected for the 1935 College All-Star football \nteam, which led him to begin a short career in professional football \nwith the Philadelphia Eagles.\n  However, a shoulder injury led him to a new path in life, as he \nshifted from sports player to sports writer. Kup began as a writer for \nthe Chicago Times in 1935. Chicago readers have been enjoying the \nwritings of ``Kup'' ever since. After all these years, Irv still writes \n``Kup's Column'' in the Chicago Sun-Times today.\n  Additionally, Kup broadcast Chicago Bears games on the radio for 24 \nyears with another Chicago icon, Jack Brickhouse. In 1959, he debuted \nhis own local television talk show which ran for 27 years. He has been \nhonored with the coveted Peabody Award and has won a total of 16 local \nEmmy awards for his show.\n  Irv has been inducted into two halls of fame--one for journalism and \none for Chicago sports. And, he also is recognized in the Hall of Fame \nat the University of North Dakota and the National Jewish Hall of Fame. \nIn 1986, the Wabash Avenue Bridge in Chicago officially became the Irv \nKupcinet Bridge in honor of his 50 years with the Chicago Sun-Times.\n  One of the things that has always impressed me about Kup is that \ndespite all of his endeavors in sports and in journalism, he always \nmade time to give back to his community, to give back to Chicago. That \nis what truly puts Irv Kupcinet in a league of his own. He is the \nfounder and the host of the annual Chicago Sun-Times Purple Heart \nCruise for veterans, which began in 1945 and continues today.\n  At the end of World War II, Irv wanted to recognize the soldiers who \nrisked their lives for their fellow Americans. He found a way to do so \nin conjunction with the Purple Heart veterans organization. The \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart of the U.S.A. is a Congressionally \nchartered national service organization for veterans that offers \neducational programs, outreach programs, computer training courses, and \na long list of other programs aimed at serving our country's veterans. \nIllinois, alone, has over 860 Purple Heart veterans. With the Purple \nHeart and the Chicago Sun-Times, Irv has hosted this annual cruise. He \nsaid in his autobiography that his cruise ``celebrates the veterans of \nall our wars, men and women who put their lives on the line so that the \nrest of us could live in peace and freedom.'' In a sense, this cruise \nis a reprise of the USO servicemen club, a one\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nday floating revival held each year sometime between Pearl Harbor and \nV-J Day. The veterans who attend the cruise leave with no less than 50 \ngifts when they step off the boat. That is a small gift compared to the \nsacrifices each veteran made for his or her country. Through Kup's \ninitiative with the Purple Heart Cruise, Chicago is the only city that \nshows this brand of gratitude to our veterans. Irv has been recognized \nwith the General John Logan Chicago Patriot Award for his service for \nthe Purple Heart cruises.\n  Kup, on his 90th birthday and every day, serves as a role model to \nall who read his column, listened to his television and radio \nbroadcasts, followed his sports career, and benefit today from his many \ngood works.\n  A few weeks ago it was my good fortune to be invited to join Kup and \nhis buddies for their Saturday brunch at a Michigan Avenue hotel. It \nwas a great gathering of old friends, swapping stories, telling jokes \nand celebrating good times in life.\n  I extend my sincere congratulations to Kup on his 90th birthday, \nthank him for the difference he has made in his hometown of Chicago and \nask that a great column by Bob Greene, written in his honor, be printed \nin the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  The Deadline Dash: Kup Is Turning 90\n\n       I suppose stranger things have happened than this--a column \n     in the Sunday Tribune celebrating and praising a columnist \n     for the Sun-Times--but special moments call for special \n     gestures. Kup is about to turn 90.\n       Irv Kupcinet's 90th birthday is on the last day of this \n     month. Kup's Column is now in its 60th year--he began writing \n     it in 1943. He lost his dear wife Essee last year, and his \n     health has not been so great, but he is as much a part of \n     Chicago as . . .\n       Well, I was going to say as much a part of Chicago as the \n     John Hancock Center, but Kup's Column was around way before \n     the Hancock was constructed. I was going to say as much a \n     part of Chicago as the Wrigley Building, but Kup was born \n     years before the Wrigley went up. In the end, there is no \n     comparison. You properly say that a person or an object is as \n     much a part of Chicago as Kup, not the other way around.\n       He has always loved this city so. The son of a bakery truck \n     driver, Kup set for himself a work ethic that is phenomenal. \n     When he attended the University of North Dakota and played \n     quarterback on its football team, he also served as the \n     university's director of athletic publicity, writing press \n     releases during the week and leading the team on Saturdays. \n     The late Gene Siskel and I would often marvel to each other \n     about Kup's work schedule. In essence, during his peak years, \n     Kup worked a nine-day week: He wrote six newspaper columns a \n     week, skipping only Saturdays; he taped his ``Kup's Show'' \n     television program over two days; and on Sundays during \n     football season he and Jack Brickhouse were the play-by-play \n     men on Chicago Bears radio broadcasts on WGN.\n       Brick and Kup--there was nothing like them anywhere else in \n     the country. It might not have sounded like a symphony, but \n     it sure sounded like Chicago. Kup in his prime was this \n     physically huge, commanding poresence--he played professional \n     football for the Philadelphia Eagles, and later was an on-\n     field NFL head linesman. When he began writing his column in \n     Chicago, he became an instant and larger-than-life star.\n       He made the decision early to try to be fair both in print \n     and on the air, and chose generosity over smallness. He was \n     the biggest name in this town before anyone now working in \n     any print or broadcast newsroom got started, yet he made a \n     practice of going out of his way to be welcoming to new \n     colleagues. When I was given a column at the Sun-Times at the \n     age of 23, the first note I got was from him. Written in \n     heavy copy pencil over a tearsheet of the story announcing \n     the new column, the message was short: ``Bob--Congrats! \n     Kup.'' Did it matter? More than 30 years later, I still have \n     it.\n       The pride of his life was Kup's Purple Heart Cruise. Each \n     year he would take military veterans, many of them from \n     hospitals, out on a boat in Lake Michigan for a day of \n     entertainment, food and fun. He started the cruise while \n     World War II was still raging, and it lasted for 50 years. \n     Once I was with him on the cruise--there was Kup on the \n     gangplank, wearing a commodore's cap--and an elderly former \n     soldier said to him, ``Kup, I bet you don't remember who I \n     am.'' Not missing a beat, Kup gave him a hearty Kup \n     backslap--I thought the old soldier was going to go tumbling \n     into the water--and boomed out: ``Of course I know you! \n     You're a grand old veteran!''\n       Kup's interviewing style on ``Kup's Show'' was one of a \n     kind--I remember him leaning close to Henry Kissinger once \n     and thundering out, in that amazing Kup voice: ``Henry, what \n     the hell, pardon my French, is going on in Cambodia?''--and \n     like everything else he did, it was pure Chicago.\n       I talked with him the other day. Like so many people who \n     reach 90, he finds that most of his friends are gone; he said \n     he spends most of his time at home, and that ``I'm weak much \n     of the time.'' He always worked so hard, he said, because \n     ``turnout out a good story was more fun than anything else I \n     could think of.'' Feeling weak or not, he seems to have made \n     a determination, based on the toughness and strength of the \n     old Kup: A great and legendary era in Chicago newspapering is \n     coming to an end, and he is going to be the last man \n     standing.\n       In newsrooms not just in Chicago, but all over the \n     country--newsrooms where people who once here are now \n     employed--the mention of Kup brings a smile and thoughts of \n     home. It's probably not possible to speak for all of those \n     men and women--all of the editors, writers and photographers \n     with a Chicago connection--but as he turns 90 I'll bet I \n     speak for most of them right now. He has never liked fancy \n     writing, and he has always tried to make his point directly \n     and unambiguously with as few words as possible, so I'll say \n     it that way:\n       We love you, Kup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7735-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday Senate and House conferees \nreached final agreement on the Conference Report for H.R. 333, the \nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2002. I look \nforward to Senate consideration of this measure in September, following \nHouse action on the conference report.\n  It seems inevitable in a bill nearly five hundred pages in length, \neven with our most diligent efforts, that the conferees sometimes fail \nto catch all drafting errors. Shortly after the conference was \nconcluded, it was brought to our attention that the effective date \nprovision of Section 1234 contained an error. Section 1234 is not a new \nprovision of law but a reiteration of current law, which Senator Baucus \noffered as a amendment to the Senate-passed bill. The House and Senate \nconferees agree to retain the provision during our conference. This \nsection makes clear that a claim that is in bona fide dispute over the \nexistence of liability, or the amount of that liability, cannot be used \nas a weapon for bringing an involuntary bankruptcy action.\n  This clarification is consistent with the 1984 legislative history of \nthis portion of Section 303 of the Bankruptcy Code. It also tracks the \ndecisions of all five Courts of Appeals that have ruled on the bona \nfide dispute bar to the bringing of involuntary bankruptcy actions. \nSection 1234 restates and strengthens Congressional intent that an \ninvoluntary bankruptcy action should not be employed by creditors \nseeking to gain more leverage than they would have if they litigated \ncontract disputes in the proper judicial forum. A party to a dispute \nover the amount or liability for a claim should not also be \ndisadvantaged by the stigma and expense of an involuntary bankruptcy \nproceeding. Our overcrowded bankruptcy courts should not be burdened \nwith such disputes.\n  In as much as Section 1234 restates existing law, it is given \nimmediate effect upon enactment. As it currently reads, due to a \ndrafting error, it would not apply to cases now pending before the \nbankruptcy courts. This mistake would have a particularly perverse \neffect in the five federal circuits that have already ruled that the \nbona fide dispute standard applies to both liability and the amount \nthereof.\n  As soon as the conferees became aware of this mistake, we worked to \nfashion a correction contained in a concurrent resolution to be adopted \nsimultaneously with the conference report. In order to dispel any \nconfusion regarding Congressional understanding and intent in this \nmatter, I am placing the relevant portion of the agreed upon Concurrent \nResolution in the Record. It directs the Clerk of the House to correct \nthe enrollment of H.R. 333 by amending it as follows:\n  ``Section 1234(b) of the bill by striking `shall not apply with \nrespect to cases commenced under Title II of the United States Code \nbefore such date' and inserting `shall apply with respect to cases \ncommenced under Title II of the United States Code before, on, and \nafter such date'.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7735-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7735-S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n HONORING AL SANTORO, SECRETARY-COMMISSIONER OF THE OCEAN COUNTY BOARD \n                              OF ELECTIONS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

After completing his education, Mr. \nSantoro served in the United States Army from 1958 to 1960 in Germany.\n  During his tenure at the Ocean County Board of Elections, Al Santoro \nhas been an important part in making our democracy work. His efforts \nhelped ensure that the electoral mechanisms in place succeeded and that \nour elections are fair and just to all. The lifeblood of our democracy \nis the assurance that our political process works and that its \nintegrity is not in question. Al Santoro has helped to make that a \nreality for the citizens of Ocean County. Surely, there can be no \nhigher calling in our Republic.\n  So, I join the people of Ocean County and the entire State of New \nJersey in recognizing Al Santoro for his outstanding service to the \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7736-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO JESSE W. ALLEN\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to \nrecognize a man whose lifelong dedication to civic, military, and \nreligious service has enriched not just my State of Nevada but the \nNation as a whole.\n  Jesse W. Allen grew up in the poverty-stricken era of the Great \nDepression in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After losing his father at the \nage of fourteen, Mr. Allen dropped out of grade school in order to \nsupport his family. His labor taught him responsibility, integrity, and \nthe value of hard work. Mr. Allen embraced these values and imparted \nthem on others throughout his life.\n  At age 17, Jesse Allen enlisted in the U.S. Navy. In his forty-one \nmonths of service, Jesse proudly served his country; first by dodging \nGerman submarines across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the U.S.S. Texas, \nand then by fighting off Japanese fire and suicide bombers as a gun \ncaptain in the South Pacific. By the time Mr. Allen was honorably \ndischarged in 1945, he had received 13 Battle Stars, a Silver Star, and \na Presidential Unit Citation.\n  After leaving the service, Jesse returned to Tennessee where he made \nup for his lack of a formal education by acquiring his GED and \nenrolling in Tennessee Temple Bible College. For three years, he worked \nfull time at night in a woolen mill so that he could support his family \nwhile attending college on the GI Bill. This hard work paid off in 1948 \nwhen Mr. Allen was ordained as a minister.\n  Jesse began spreading Christian principles throughout the United \nStates on street corners, in jails, nursing homes, home meetings, and \neven in the tuberculosis sanatarium. Eventually, he established many \nchurches and drew such a following that his preaching was carried on \nradio stations throughout the Southeast.\n  Jesse lived by the same Christian values that he preached. He went \ninto the bootleggers' back woods, where few dared to go, to bring out \nthe sick and elderly who needed to see a doctor. He worked with \nfamilies suffering from marriage problems and with troubled teens \nthroughout the Nation. My home State, Nevada benefitted from his \npassion as Mr. Allen worked with abused, neglected, and abandoned \nchildren at the Southern Nevada Children's Home in Boulder City, and \nlater, as he opened his own home to afflicted youths from Clark County. \nHis group home achieved record success rates for Clark County Juvenile \nServices for five consecutive years, earning him a commission as an \nHonorary Deputy Constable.\n  Today, Mr. Allen is the father of four and the grandfather of \nfourteen. He has lived an exemplary life of patriotism, citizenship, \nand dedicated service. He overcame the obstacles of his impoverished \nupbringing to help others, using values that inspire those he touches \nto do the same. For this reason, I am proud to recognize Mr. Jesse W. \nAllen. Men like him are rare, but are one of our country's greatest \nassets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7736-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF THOMAS A. PANKOK, FORMER NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLYMAN\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nThomas A. Pankok. Mr. Pankok has been a great public servant and an \noutstanding member of the community over the years.\n  Mr. Pankok currently resides in Pennsville, New Jersey. He married \nAlma Land in 1958 with whom he has three children, Thomas Pankok Jr., \nKathy and Timothy and seven grandchildren.\n  Thomas Pankok is a graduate of Salem High School and a veteran of the \nUnited States Navy. He served four years during the Korean conflict. In \n1956, after his tour of duty, Thomas Pankok began a lengthy career with \nBell Telephone Company, serving 30 years with the company.\n  In 1981, Thomas Pankok was elected to the State Assembly. As a member \nof the Assembly, Mr. Pankok served two terms and authored many \nimportant pieces of legislation. After his first term in the Assembly, \nhe was awarded with the ``Freshman Legislator of the Year'' award, \npresented by the State Association of Counties.\n  In addition, to his work in the State Assembly, Thomas Pankok also \nserved over 15 years as a Salem County Freeholder. The role of state \nand local government is vital to our democracy. For our federal system \nof government to succeed, we must have effective and committed leaders \nat the state and local level. The United States Congress needs and \nrelies on partners like Thomas Pankok in local government and I salute \nhim and thank him for his efforts.\n  So, I join with Salem County and the entire State of New Jersey in \nrecognizing Thomas A. Pankok, an outstanding public servant, citizen, \nveteran and father. His efforts upon the behalf of the people of Salem \nCounty have been vital to the community and are much \nappreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7736-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I speak about hate crimes \nlegislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last year. \nThe Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 7, \n2000 in Los Angeles, CA. A woman ran over a 65-year-old Hispanic man, \nJesus Plascensia, twice in a parking lot. Authorities say that the \nperpetrator made comments about her hatred of Hispanics after the death \nand referred to the victim as ``dead road kill.'' The assailant was \ncharged with murder and hate crimes in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7736-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7736-S7737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN RECOGNITION OF DELAWARE FIGHFIGHTERS SELFLESSLY FIGHTING NATIONAL \n                                 BLAZES\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the status \nof the National Fire Plan, the 2002 Wildfire season and the Delawareans \nwho risked their lives to save others. Since January 1, over 47,000 \nwildfires have burned more than 3,200,000 acres around the country. The \nvast majority of these fires have been small, just a few acres at most; \nhowever, several have been massive fires consuming hundreds or \nthousands of acres. To those living nearest these fires, they have \nsuffered a tremendous loss. But thanks to the outstanding effort and \ntireless dedication of firefighters from around the country, many of \nthese large wildfires have been suppressed, and the smaller fires have \nbeen prevented from growing larger.\n  While wildfires tend to be a greater problem in the West, concern for \nthe residents, for their health, for their\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nsafety, and for their homes extends nationwide. In Delaware, we have \nnot experienced the devastating effects of fires seen in other states, \nyet men and women from my state have been willing to stand shoulder to \nshoulder with their brothers and sisters in helping fight these \ndevastating fires.\n  The Delaware Wildfire Fire Crew, a 20-member advanced firefighting \ngroup made up of eight Department of Agriculture Forest Services \nemployees and twelve volunteers has been on the road for two weeks, \nbattling fires in Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia. Most recently, \nthe crew helped put out a lightning sparked fire that burned \napproximately 850 acres of the George Washington National Forest in \nVirginia.\n  Their heroism and their selflessness were apparent. I want you to \nknow that my heart was filled with pride when I learned this convoy of \nDelaware firefighting personnel was en route to offer assistance. These \nmen and women were willing to stop what they were doing at a moment's \nnotice. They were willing to put their own lives on hold, leave their \nown families, and help those who needed help.\n  At some point, all of us need to look back and take stock of where we \nhave been and where we are going. Have we lived our lives in the \nservice to others, or merely for ourselves? Have we made clear our \ncommitments and worked with purpose to fulfill them, or simply \nmeandered in search of a cause? At the end of the day, can we say with \nconfidence that we did our best and worked to our fullest potential?\n  For these firefighters, and the thousands of others fighting this \nseason's wildfires, the answers are clear. They live a life of service. \nThey embody a commitment to excellence that serves as an example and an \ninspiration to us all. Whether working to protect those of us here in \nDelaware, or risking their lives to fight the raging wildfires of the \nWest, they proved to us that if a family is in trouble, if a fire \nthreatens a home--Delaware's volunteer firefighters will be there for \nus--and for America--leading the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7737-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROGER C. CLOUATRE\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to pay a posthumous \ntribute to one of the most dedicated leaders of my State, the late \nRoger C. Clouatre. As a corporate executive of Vulcan Chemical Company, \nas well as a member of the Ascension Parish School Board, he \ndemonstrated dedication, pride in his work, and a commitment to the \nwell being of those he represented and served.\n  Much has changed in our Nation since September Eleventh. There is a \ngrowing, yet genuine enthusiasm for the things that are truly \nimportant, our family, our friends and the welfare of our country. Long \nbefore these tragic events, however, the man I memorialize here today \npracticed these ideals. He leaves behind a proud family; a thankful \ncommunity and a Nation better off, because he was an American citizen \nfor 53 years.\n  His friends say he ``completed 80 years of work in 53 years of \nlife.'' It is a record of accomplishment that we can all learn from. \nYet, even though he battled cancer for the last 12 years of his life, \nit did not diminish his devotion to his children, his compassion for \nhis friends and his dedication to the work of the Ascension Parish \nSchool Board. His planning and execution were always based in reality, \nbut he himself represented an idealist's view of a man serving God, \nfamily and friends. He made us all laugh and kept a positive attitude \nthat always seemed to affect our daily outlook on life.\n  His son Spencer, a graduate of West Point, said eloquently at his \nfather's funeral that although Roger has the potential for national \nservice, he instead invested every moment of his energy on the \ncommunity he dearly cared about, and the family he loved so much.\n  Roger and his wife Katherine were the proud parents of four children, \nSpencer, Stephanie, Styles and Stuart, each a blessing in their own \nright.\n  Though many awards and accolades found him in life, his service and \ndedication to his community were largely responsible for the public \nsupport of a $30 million bond issue that is creating new schools and \nexpanding educational facilities throughout the parish.\n  Again, his son Spencer put it best when he said:\n  ``We were all very lucky to have him at the local level, for his \ncapabilities surely could have affected state and national events. He \nwas a leader--a Chief Executive Officer, a General--someone that we all \nwanted to follow, a role model we all emulated in some way or \nanother.''\n  His deflection of self at the height of the me-generation and the \nuncompromsing support of others that he demonstrated throughout his \nlife, even at times of unspeakable pain, should provide all of us with \nthe inspiration to go forward in our work.\n  Unfortunately, all of my colleagues will not know Roger Clouatre. \nLooking back, I see how fortunate I happened to be to have had the \noccasion to seek the wonderful advice of this great American. Though he \nwas seemingly lost in the deep fabric of this mighty Nation, he was in \nfact, a quiet hero. May Roger's star always reflect a wonderful \nluminance upon our Nation and provide all of us with a reminder of the \nthousand ways in which we may all work to make this a greater Nation \nstill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7737-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JACK F. OWENS, IN MEMORIAM\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of Mr. Jack. F. Owens upon his passing. Jack was \na good friend and a man who made remarkable contributions toward \neducational opportunities for thousands of Delawareans. He was a man \nwith a kind heart, diverse interests, great abilities and boundless \nenergy.\n  Jack was born in Easley, SC. After graduating from Easley High School \nwhere he excelled in various sports, Jack went to Furman University \nwhere he continued his academic and athletic exploits, lettering in \nthree sports, and graduating in 1952.\n  After serving his country as a member of the United States Marine \nCorps, Jack returned to South Carolina and began a career in academia, \nfirst in the Pickins County School system and then at Greenville \nTechnical College.\n  Responding to the call of then Delaware Governor Charles Terry, Jack \ncame to Delaware to help open Delaware's Technical and Community \nCollege in Sussex County in March of 1967. He was the school's first \nadministrator and headed the Sussex County campus for twenty-eight \nyears, retiring in 1995. In 1993, Jack received Delaware's highest \nhonor when he was awarded ``The Order of the First State.''\n  As Governor, I had the honor of signing into law legislation that \nnamed the Sussex Campus in Jack's honor. Today, it is called ``The Jack \nOwens Campus.'' The energy and commitment found in the students and \nfaculty at DelTech are, in large part, due to Jack's vision.\n  Even after his retirement, Jack remained committed to public service. \nHe served on numerous boards and commissions including The Arthritis \nFoundation, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and Ducks Unlimited, and \nserved as a board member of the Beebe Medical Center and as Chairman of \nthe Delmarva Chicken Festival. He received honorary doctorate degrees \nfrom Wilmington College and the University of Guadalajara, Mexico, \nwhere he helped establish a community college system.\n  Jack leaves behind his wife Donna, 6 children and 6 grandchildren. He \nalso leaves behind many friends, colleagues and several generations of \nstudents who are living more productive, satisfying lives today because \nJack made the decision thirty-five years ago to come north to Delaware.\n  Jack's lifelong dream was that students in Sussex County would have \nthe opportunity to receive undergraduate and advanced degrees in their \nhome county. He lived to see that dream fulfilled.\n  Jack's legacy will live on in the lives of those he helped shape, in \nthe halls of education facilities he helped build, and in the hearts of \nthose who were lucky enough to call him their friend. I rise today to \ncommemorate Jack's life, to celebrate his life, and to offer his family \nsupport. Jack embodied the best of Delaware. He will be sorely \nmissed.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7738-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n                       IN RECOGNITION OF PASTABIL\n    ITIES RESTAURANT AND THEIR OUTSTANDING COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY \n                             REVITALIZATION\n\n Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Iron Hill \nBrewery and Restaurant for its outstanding commitment to community \nservice. The National Restaurant Association has recognized the \nrestaurant as a finalist in their Restaurant Neighbor Award. The \nnational distinction rewards restaurants for outstanding philanthropic \nwork.\n  In his State of the Union address earlier this year, President Bush \nunveiled the USA Freedom Corps, challenging every American to commit at \nleast two years of their life to serving their community and their \ncountry. Iron Hill Brewery and Restaurant in Newark, Delaware has \nexceeded the President's call to action.\n  The restaurant takes its name from a historic Delaware landmark where \nGenerals Washington and Lafayette battled with General Cornwallis to \nensure American liberty and freedom. Today, Iron Hill carries on this \ntradition of fighting for freedom. For the past four years, Iron Hill \nhas been a major sponsor of the ``Race Against Family Violence'' which \ntakes place each year on Mother's Day weekend. The race benefits Child, \nInc., a nonprofit organization that helps free children and families \nfrom the threat of domestic violence through prevention, education, \ntreatment and advocacy.\n  To date, the Iron Hill family has raised $16,000 through the ``Race \nAgainst Family Violence.'' The operation has also taken an active role \nin the revitalization of downtown Wilmington, donating food and \nservices and raising money for organizations such as the March of \nDimes. Iron Hill has turned the act of giving to the community into a \ntradition. Twice a year, they provide a complete dinner for Delaware \nTechnical & Community College's culinary class.\n  Volunteer service is vital to the improvement of our community, and \nIron Hill Brewery and Restaurant has lent their time and energy at \nevery turn.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSally Hawkins, owner and president of WILM NewsRadio in Delaware. On \nher 80th birthday she remains a vibrant and purposeful woman, a \ndedicated entrepreneur and a celebrated public servant.\n  Sally started and maintains what is now the only remaining privately-\nowned and operated all-news radio station in the country. In an era \nwhen single-station AM radio operations have all but disappeared, she \nbuilt a respected news station from the ground up--earning my respect, \nand the respect of her peers along the way.\n  As chair of the National Governor's Association and now as the DLC's \nchair for Best Practices, I've spent some time touring the country and \nhighlighting the nation's very best programs, businesses and \ninnovators. WILM certainly ranks among the best. The inroads made by \nSally and the family, her family, at WILM are unparalleled.\n  WILM News radio strives to reinforce the foundation of community \nradio. The station's programming transcends race, creed, income and \npolitical boundaries. Its commitment to community outreach and support \nof the arts and non-profits has helped keep organizations vital during \nthe crucial development stages.\n  In a business environment in which the pressure to cut costs for the \nsake of profit is common, Sally has never wavered in her commitment to \nbalanced coverage and public service. WILM is heavily committed to \nproviding a neutral forum in which all political aspirants may enjoy \nequal time to debate issues in front of the public. Sally seeks to \nenlighten listeners, making them better citizens and more informed \nvoters.\n  How many of us can say that we are proud of the life that we've lived \nand the service that we've provided to the community?\n  In a career that spans decades, Sally has led the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters Board, as well as the boards of the Better \nBusiness Bureau, the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration. She has served on the executive \ncommittee of the Grand Opera House, the external affairs committee of \nChristiana Care, and on the boards of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Goldey-\nBeacom College, the Delaware Council of Economic Education, the Girl \nScout Advisory Council and the Delaware Community Foundation. Last \nyear, she was named The Ledger's 2001 Entrepreneurial Woman of the \nYear. This remarkable woman, at the helm of one of our state's most \nimportant news outlets since 1972, has done much to pave the path for \nwomen who want both successful careers and families and for First State \norganizations who dare to dream big.\n  Fueled by dedication and determination, Sally Hawkins took control of \nWILM thirty years ago. Today she still runs the day-to-day operations \nof the station, writes copy, mentors and travels internationally.\n  Today, I commend Sally Hawkins for her talent and perseverance, and \njoin all of those whom she has touched, in celebrating her life. Happy \nbirthday, Sally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7738-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7738-S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO VICE ADMIRAL THOMAS J.

Mr. President, I pay tribute to an exceptional \nleader--Vice Admiral Tom Kilcline, Sr., in recognition of his \nremarkable career of service\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nto our country. Tom served his country for over 50 years as a \ndistinguished Naval Officer and as President of The Retired Officers \nAssociation, TROA. Having battled cancer for over three years, Tom \npassed away on July 11, surrounded by his family at the Naval Medical \nCenter, Bethesda, MD.\n  In 1943, at the height of World War II, he enlisted in the Navy from \nKokomo, IN and was appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy in 1945. Tom \nenjoyed a distinguished career as a Naval Aviator; he flew in Korea, \nbecame an accomplished Test Pilot, commanded a tactical carrier based \nsquadron during Vietnam, and flew actively, including tactical jets, \nuntil his retirement as Commander Naval Air Forces, US Atlantic Fleet \nin 1983.\n  Admiral Kilcline was an incredible leader and tireless advocate for \nour Navy. During my tenure as the Secretary of the Navy, Tom headed the \nOffice of Legislative Affairs and, while there, we worked closely \ntogether to push for legislative initiatives to improve readiness and \nto provide for much of the modern naval force you see today.\n  Following his retirement, he served as National President of The \nRetired Officers Association where he continued to work with Congress \non behalf of thousands of our retired service personnel for nearly 10 \nyears.\n  Tom's greatest ally and strength was his devoted wife of 52 years, \nDornell Thompson of Pensacola, FL. Dornell, a daughter of a naval \naviator, was by his side through all his battles, from championing the \ncause of our country and our military families, to his fight with \ncancer.\n  They have had four children: Rear Admiral Tom, Jr., on duty with the \nNaval Aviation Warfare Staff at the Pentagon; Lt. Patrick, lost in an \nF-14 accident; Lt. Kathleen, a Navy doctor killed in an auto accident; \nMary, devoted daughter and navy wife of Captain Bob Novak; and seven \nloving grandchildren.\n  Admiral Tom Kilcline will be greatly missed by his family, friends \nand this Nation, but his legacy of devotion to family and service to \nhis country remain with us forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7739-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN NOWAK\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. John \nNowak of Fairview, KY. Mr. Nowak, who operates a farm outside of \nHopkinsville, KY, has recently garnered national praise for his \ninnovative and effective farming techniques.\n  Hay samples produced by Mr. Nowak earned the Best Pure Alfalfa, Best \nAlalfa with Grass and Best of Show awards during the American Forage \nand Grassland Council held in Minneapolis earlier this month. These hay \nsamples underwent a rigorous laboratory analysis for relative feed \nvalue, protein fiber and mineral content as a part of the criterion.\n  As every farmer in Kentucky knows first hand, the high level of \nhumidity combined with irregular rainfall and nighttime dew can create \na very taxing and unfriendly farming environment. Oftentimes, these \nfactors result in an unproductive and unprofitable season, but this has \nnot been the case for Mr. Nowak. Mr. Nowak, through hard work and \ninventive thinking, has been able to successfully overcome these \nunpredictable and intrusive obstacles. He has truly become a pioneer \nfor commercial hay production in Kentucky and the entire United States.\n  John Nowak's practices have also been noticed by such noted \nagriculturists as Dr. Garry Lacefield, a University of Kentucky \nextension forage specialist at Princeton's Agriculture Research and \nEducation Center. He is one of Nowak's most adamant supporters. Dr. \nLacefield plans on working closely with Mr. Nowak in the future to \nfurther improve the sellability and commercial marketing of hay.\n  In a capitalistic society such as the one we have in the United \nStates of America, innovation and ingenuity play such vital and \nimportant roles in our economic success. I applaud Mr. Nowak's \nentrepreneurial spirit and urge him to continue to find better and more \nimproved ways of production.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7739-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO MS. MARSHA VAN HOOK\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today among my colleagues \nto congratulate Ms. Marsha Van Hook of Somerset, KY. On July 16th, \nMarsha Van Hook was the proud recipient of the Ted Jaskulski National \nPublic Policy Award. This award is presented annually to an individual \nwho has contributed to public policy efforts on behalf of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities. Ms. Van Hook was nominated by the 26 \nmembers of the Kentucky Developmental Disabilities Council, KDDC, for \nher advocacy efforts related to disabilities.\n  In keeping with the goals and values of the KDDC, Marsha Van Hook has \ntirelessly and selflessly worked to ensure that children and young \nadults throughout the Commonwealth suffering from developmental \ndisabilities have the right to an education, the opportunity to work \nand support themselves, and the access to affordable health care and \ntransportation in their respective communities. Specifically, Ms. Van \nHook's strong advocacy and involvement at the local and state level has \nbrought a heightened sense of awareness to local communities across \nKentucky concerning people with developmental disabilities and the \ndilemmas they face on a daily basis. She has been the eloquent voice of \nreason for advocacy and has also been an instrumental force in getting \nlegislation passed regarding transportation needs for the disabled.\n  This most recent accolade is not the first time Ms. Van Hook has been \nduly recognized for positive influence on society. Both the Kentucky \nState Senate and House as well as many disability groups throughout the \nCommonwealth have presented her with awards.\n  Currently, Marsha Van Hook is employed by the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, ARC, where she is actively involved with their ``Partners \nin Advocacy'' training program. This program offers training and \nsupport to individuals and their families in developing and expanding \nmuch needed advocacy skills. She also participates in several \ncommissions and committees at both the state and local level.\n  I ask that my fellow members of the Senate join me in congratulating \nMs. Marsha Van Hook for this prestigious and noteworthy award and thank \nher for all that she has done and is doing to advance the cause of \nchildren and adults suffering from developmental disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7739-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7739-S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF DR.

Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nreflect on the work of a very special woman and friend, Dr. Mimi \nSilbert, whose extraordinary commitment and compassion have greatly \nenhanced the quality of life for so many people in California and \nacross the Nation. The Jewish National Fund will present Mimi with its \nWoman of Valor Award on September 24 in Los Angeles.\n  Mimi serves as President, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the \nDelancey Street Foundation, which, since 1971, has helped thousands of \nsubstance abusers and get back on their feet. The foundation is known \nto be the largest of its kind in America.\n  The Delancey Street Foundation has centers in New York, New Mexico, \nNorth Carolina and Los Angeles, but its headquarters in San Francisco \nare the most well-known. Located on the San Francisco waterfront, the \n400,000-square-foot complex is the largest self-help facility in the \ncountry. The complex houses 500 residents and contains Delancey's \nnational moving company, catering company, a screening room, the \nDelancey Street Restaurant and Crossroads Cafe.\n  Athough best-known for her work with the Delancey Street Foundation, \nMimi also serves as a powerful voice for reform. She recently wrote, \ndesigned and implemented a new juvenile justice system for the city of \nSan Francisco, which has served more than 2,000 young people. City \nagencies and community-based organizations worked together to create a \none-stop Community Assessment Center for arrested young people, two \nafterschool facilities, and other programs. Mimi also used her \nextensive expertise to work as a prison psychologist and police \ntrainer, as well as teach at the University of California at Berkeley, \nSan Francisco State University, and the Wright Institute.\n  Mimi truly personifies the Jewish National Fund's Woman of Valor\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nAward.

A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 6910 South Yorktown Avenue in Tulsa, \nOklahoma, as the ``Robert Wayne Jenkins Station''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nRobert Wayne Jenkins, a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier who was \ntragically killed while serving the Tulsa community and to introduce \nlegislation that would redesignate the Southside Station Postal Service \nfacility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the ``Robert Wayne Jenkins Station''.\n  On December 21, 2001, Robert Wayne Jenkins said goodbye to his wife \nAmber and daughter Caitlyn and left home for work. Arriving with his \nusual friendly and positive attitude, Robert prepared for his mail \nroute. Before leaving the office to deliver the mail on his route, \nRobert gave his customary message to a fellow letter carrier: ``be \nsafe''. That afternoon, Robert was senselessly gunned down while on his \nroute, dying instantly.\n  Robert Wayne Jenkins was in his ninth year of dedicated service in a \njob he truly loved. His co-workers respected his dedication and \nprofessionalism, and Robert was also greatly admired for his love and \ndevotion to his wife and daughter. The spirit and vitality with which \nRobert served the U.S. Postal Service and his community will live on in \nthe hearts of those who were privileged to know him.\n  Rededicating the southside station in Tulsas as the Robert Wayne \nJenkins Station is an honor most appropriate for an American who asked \nfor so little but who gave so much to his family, his friends, the \nUnited States Postal Service, and the Tulsa community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBERT WAYNE JENKINS STATION.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 6910 South Yorktown Avenue in Tulsa, \n     Oklahoma, and known as the ``Southside Station'', shall be \n     known and designated as the ``Robert Wayne Jenkins Station''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\n     record of the United States to the facility referred to in \n     subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     Robert Wayne Jenkins Station.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2829. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Merit Systems \nProtection Board and the Office of Special Counsel, to provide for the \nprotection of certain disclosures of information by Federal employees, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Today I rise to introduce legislation \nreauthorizing the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, and the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, MSPB. These two agencies safeguard the merit system \nprinciples and protect Federal employees who step forward to disclose \ngovernment waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The Office of Special Counsel protects Federal employees and \napplicants from reprisal for whistleblowing and other prohibited \npersonnel practices. OSC serves as a safe and secure channel for \nFederal workers who wish to disclose violations of law, gross \nmismanagement or waste of funds, abuse of authority, and a specific \ndanger to the public health and safety. In addition, OSC enforces and \nprovides advisory opinions regarding the Hatch Act, which restricts the \npolitical activities of Federal employees. It also protects the rights \nof Federal employee, military veterans and reservists under the \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.\n  The Merit Systems Protection Board monitors the Federal Government's \nmerit-based system of employment by hearing and deciding appeals from \nFederal employees regarding job removal and other major personnel \nactions. The Board also decides other types of civil service cases, \nreviews regulations of the Office of Personnel Management, and conducts \nstudies of the merit systems. Together, OSC and MSPB act as stalwarts \nof justice for the dedicated men and women who serve the public.\n  In addition to reauthorizing these two important agencies, my bill \nwould restore congressional intent regarding who is entitled to relief \nunder the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA. On several occasions, \nCongress has had to revisit the WPA to close loopholes in the law. \nCongress has been forced to specify that ``any'' disclosure truly means \n``any'' disclosure. This is regardless of the setting of the \ndisclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the \ndisclosure is made.\n  Since Congress amended the WPA in 1994, the Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which has sole jurisdiction over the WPA, has continued to \ndisregard clear statutory language that the Act covers disclosures such \nas those made to supervisors, to possible wrongdoers, or as part of an \nemployee's job duties.\n  In order to protect the statute's foundation that `any' lawful \ndisclosure that an employee or applicant reasonably believes is \ncredible evidence of waste, fraud, abuse, or gross mismanagement is \ncovered by the WPA, language in this bill codifies the repeated and \nunconditional statements of congressional intent and legislative \nhistory. It specifically covers any disclosure of information without \nrestriction to time, place, form, motive, or context, or prior \ndisclosure made to any person by an employee or applicant, including a \ndisclosure made in the ordinary course of an employee's duties, that \nthe employee or applicant reasonably believes is evidence of any \nviolation of any law, rule, or regulation, or other misconduct \nspecified.\n  The bill also addresses another burden created by the Federal Circuit \nnot found in the Whistleblower Protection Act. In interpreting the \nmeaning of `reasonable belief,' the Federal Circuit held that the \nreasonableness of the whistleblower's belief that the government \nviolated the law or engaged in gross mismanagement must first begin \nwith a presumption that public officers performed their duties \ncorrectly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law. \nHowever, this presumption can only be overcome by ``irrefragable \nproof'' to the contrary. The irrefragable standard is impossible to \novercome and has a chilling effect on those who would disclose \ngovernment wrongdoing. As such, this new provision states that any \npresumption that a public officer has performed their duties in good \nfaith must be overcome by substantial evidence.\n  My bill also codifies an ``anti-gag'' provision that Congress has \npassed annually since 1988 as part of its appropriations process. The \nyearly appropriations language bars agencies from implementing or \nenforcing any nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement that does not \ncontain specified language preserving open government statutes such as \nthe WPA, the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, and the Lloyd \nLafollette Act, which prohibits discrimination against government \nemployees who communicate with Congress. Moreover, Congress unanimously \nhas supported the concept that Federal employees should not be subject \nto restraint nor suffer retaliation for disclosing wrongdoing.\n  Now more than ever, Federal employees must feel comfortable coming \nforward with information concerning violations of law or actions that \ncould cause substantial harm to public safety. We must support the \nbrave men and women who come forward to report wrongdoing. We must \nensure that such acts of bravery are not rewarded with retaliation.\n  Protection of Federal whistleblowers is a bipartisan effort. \nEnactment of the original bill in 1989 and the 1994 amendments enjoyed \nunanimous bicameral and bipartisan support. More recently, Senators \nLevin and Grassley joined me in introducing S. 995, which makes many of \nthe same amendments to the WPA as this bill. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with me in clarifying the WPA and supporting the reauthorization \nof two very important agencies.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2829\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 314\n\n       Whereas registered nurses comprise the largest health care \n     work force in the United States, numbering more than \n     2,700,000;\n       Whereas registered nurses are integral to health care \n     across human lifespan, from the nurse midwives who attend \n     deliveries, to staff nurses who care for us during times of \n     acute injury or illness, to geriatric nurse practitioners who \n     manage end-of-life care;\n       Whereas nursing is a rewarding profession that offers \n     diverse career paths for men and women;\n       Whereas registered nurses provide direct patient care and \n     manage teams of medical professionals in hospitals, clinics, \n     community health centers, offices, nursing homes, and the \n     homes of patients;\n       Whereas there is a growing disparity between the supply of \n     and demand for registered nurses that is leading to an \n     overwhelming shortage that will place great strains on our \n     health care system;\n       Whereas this burgeoning shortage represents confluence of \n     powerful demographic and social forces, including declining \n     nursing school enrollment and increased exodus from the \n     profession;\n       Whereas the lack of young people in nursing has resulted in \n     a steady and dramatic increase in the average age of a \n     registered nurse in the United States;\n       Whereas the average age of a working registered nurse is 43 \n     years, meaning that the nursing workforce is aging at twice \n     the rate of other occupations in the United States;\n       Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that \n     331,000 registered nurses, or 15 percent of the current \n     workforce, will retire between 1998 and 2008;\n       Whereas the health care needs of the Nation are expected to \n     increase greatly as the baby boom generation reaches \n     retirement age;\n       Whereas a recent survey of hospitals across the Nation \n     concluded that nursing shortages are already causing \n     emergency department overcrowding, emergency department \n     diversions, increase waiting time for surgery, discontinued \n     patient care programs or reduced service hours, delayed \n     discharges, and canceled surgeries;\n       Whereas 4 agencies under the Department of Health and Human \n     Services recently demonstrated the relationship between \n     registered nurses and patient care in a study that found \n     strong and consistent evidence that increased registered \n     nurse staffing directly relates to decreases in the incidence \n     of urinary tract infections, pneumonia, shock, and upper \n     gastrointestinal bleeding, and decreases in the length of \n     hospital stays;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine and the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services have recently released reports \n     detailing the need for increased registered nurse care in \n     nursing facilities;\n       Whereas the American Nurses Association has identified a \n     need to improve the recognition of the value of nursing and \n     the image of the nursing profession;\n       Whereas registered nurses did not hesitate to respond to \n     the extraordinarily dangerous situations resulting from the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, putting their own \n     lives at risk and acting heroically to help save as many \n     lives as possible in the impact zones; and\n       Whereas registered nurses have historically cared for \n     patients regardless of the risks of war, violence, or of \n     contracting debilitating illnesses: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a postage \n     stamp commemorating registered nurses; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued not \n     later than 1 year after the adoption of this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL TO CITIZENS' STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to the chairperson of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory \n     Committee.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the value of nurses and the importance of the nursing \nprofession to the Nation's health care system. My legislation expresses \nthe Sense of the Senate that a Nurses Care for America postage stamp \nshould be issued in appreciation of nurses and everything that they do \non behalf of their patients.\n  Registered nurses, specifically, comprise the largest health care \nwork force in the United States, numbering more than 2,700,000. These \nregistered nurses provide direct patient care and manage teams of \nmedical professionals in hospitals, clinics, community health centers, \noffices, nursing homes, and the homes of patients. Registered nurses \ndid not hesitate to respond to the extraordinarily dangerous situations \nresulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, putting \ntheir own lives at risk and acting heroically to help save as many \nlives as possible in the impact zones.\n  In all the years that we have acknowledged how much nurses mean to \nthe delivery of health care and our quality of life, we have not done \nenough to ensure the viability of nursing as a profession. The 2001 \nAmerican Nurses Association, ANA, National Survey revealed that 715 \nhospitals had 126,000 openings for nursing positions and an 11 percent \nvacancy rate. Nursing schools across the country report that enrollment \nhas significantly decreased and the ANA also projects that 65 percent \nof present nurses will retire within this decade. These statistics \nsignal a nursing crisis and that, in turn, means a health care crisis \nfor this country. I am very proud of my Senate colleagues for passing \ncrucial legislation, like the Nurse Reinvestment Act and the Veterans \nAffairs Nurse Recruitment and Retention Act, to help remedy this \nsituation. We must continue to support measures which will promote \nnursing and enable nurses to provide needed care, which is why my \nlegislation that encourages the creation of a postage stamp honoring \nthis worthwhile and important profession is so important.\n  Please join with me and the American Nurses Association to support \nthis measure and recognize the vast contributions made by nurses who \ncare for America. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/31/senate-section/article/S7748-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7748-S7750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4350.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT 107-14\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, still as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing protocol transmitted to the Senate on July 31, 2002, by the \nPresident of the United States:\n  Protocol to Amend Convention for Unification of Certain Rules \nRelating to International Carriage by Air (Treaty Document No. 107-14).\n  I further ask that the protocol be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Protocol to Amend the Convention for the Unification of Certain \nRules Relating to International Carriage by Air Signed at Warsaw on \nOctober 12, 1929, done at The Hague September 28, 1955 (The Hague \nProtocol). The report of the Department of State, including an article-\nby-article analysis, is enclosed for the information of the Senate in \nconnection with its consideration of The Hague Protocol.\n  The Warsaw Convention is the first in a series of treaties relating \nto international carriage by air. The Hague Protocol amended certain of \nthe Warsaw Convention Articles, including several affecting the rights \nof carriers of international air cargo. A recent court decision held \nthat since the United States had ratified the Warsaw Convention but had \nnot ratified The Hague Protocol, and the Republic of Korea had ratified \nThe Hague Protocol but had not ratified the Warsaw Convention, there \nwere no relevant treaty relations between the United States and Korea. \nThis decision has created uncertainty within the air transportation \nindustry regarding the scope of treaty relations between the United \nStates and the 78 countries that are parties only to the Warsaw \nConvention and The Hague Protocol. Thus, U.S. carriers may not be able \nto rely on the provisions in the Protocol with respect to claims \narising from the transportation of air cargo between the United States \nand those 78 countries. In addition to quickly affording U.S. carriers \nthe protections of those provisions, ratification of the Protocol would \nestablish relations with Korea and the five additional countries (El \nSalvador, Grenada, Lithuania, Monaco, and Swaziland) that are parties \nonly to The Hague Protocol and to no other treaty on this subject.\n   A new Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for \nInternational Carriage by Air, done at Montreal May 28, 1999 (the \n``Montreal Convention'') is pending on the Senate's Executive calendar \n(Treaty Doc. 106-45). I urge the Senate to give its advice and consent \nto that Convention, which will ultimately establish modern, uniform \nliability rules applicable to international air transport of \npassengers, cargo, and mail among its parties. But the incremental pace \nof achieving widespread adoption of the Montreal Convention should not \nbe allowed to delay the benefits that ratification of The Hague \nProtocol would afford U.S. carriers of cargo to and from the 84 \ncountries with which it would promptly enter into force.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nThe Hague Protocol and that the Senate give its advice an consent to \nratification.\n                                                      George W.
