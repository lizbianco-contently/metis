Madam President, on January 28, I addressed the reasons why \nI believe the President is correct to move this nation forward in the \ndeployment of a national missile defense. I pointed out then that the \nthreat is too great not to proceed when the technical means are at \nhand.\n  Today, I wish to address the issue of the costs of defending America \nagainst the threat of ballistic missile attack. At the end of January, \nthe Congressional Budget Office released yet another of its reports \npurporting to show the costs to the American taxpayer of a system to \ndefend the United States against such an attack. Opponents of missile \ndefense rushed to use the study to bolster their arguments. For reasons \nI will discuss, portions of the CBO report are seriously flawed, and \nopponents' cost arguments are fallacious. Today, I intend to set the \nrecord straight, and to demonstrate that we can afford missile defense.\n  The first problem with the CBO report is that it was prepared at the \nrequest of national missile defense skeptics various Senators who \ncarefully defined the options they wanted analyzed in their letter to \nthe CBO. As a result,\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\nCBO, as with its April 2000 report, provides a selection of options, \nwith high and low estimates for each option, none of which necessarily \nreflects the actual system that will be built. Each is representative \nonly of possibilities, and many are not being contemplated. As such, \nCBO's estimates tend to range from around $40 billion over 14 or 15 \nyears to around $187 billion. The high-end numbers, however, are \nderived from options that exceed anything the Department of Defense is \nconsidering. Options that can be used to inflate the cost of missile \ndefenses include increasing the number of land-based interceptor sites, \nthe number of X-band radars on land and at sea, the number of \nsatellites in constellations, the number of ships that will have to be \nbuilt versus modifying existing ships for sea-based assets, and so on.\n  Also, CBO's cost estimates vary widely, depending upon which of its \nscenarios and assumptions one wishes to use. For example, its April \n2000 report includes cost estimates for one and two ground-based sites \nwith varying numbers of interceptors and X-Band radars and associated \nspace-based sensors, ranging from $29 billion to $60 billion. This wide \nvariance in estimates--a factor of 100--renders its analysis virtually \nmeaningless, except for the rhetorical use of opponents.\n  The high range of the new study--$187 billion--is CBO's estimate of \nthe cost of a 3-site national missile defense system and a full \nconstellation of space-based lasers--an option not planned by the \neither the Clinton or Bush Administrations. This tactic of inflating \nthe cost of national missile defense was similarly employed in the 2000 \nstudy.\n  At least part of the reason for this methodology again can be laid at \nthe feet of the report's sponsors. CBO has estimated the cost of a \nnational missile defense employing the artificially derived assumptions \nrequired by the letter from the Senators. It was their letter, not any \nDepartment of Defense plan, that required the CBO study to include the \ncost of the nonexistent third site. The same letter also requested cost \nestimates for a stand-alone sea-based midcourse system, despite the \nfact that no such system is envisioned by the Administration. It \nshould, therefore, be no surprise that CBO came up with a high estimate \nin the neighborhood of $187 billion to build the national missile \ndefense system defined by its skeptics rather than the Defense \nDepartment.\n  To CBO's credit, it denied the request of the sponsors' letter to \ninclude in its estimate Brilliant Pebbles--canceled in 1993--and \nappropriately treated as ``conceptual'' the sea-based boost-phase \nkinetic energy idea. CBO explained its reluctance to factor into its \nstudy cost estimates for Brilliant Pebbles by noting that:\n\n     the most recent complete technical description of [Brilliant \n     Pebbles] dates from 1992 [and] little additional work has \n     been done on space-based interceptors since Brilliant Pebbles \n     was terminated early in the Clinton Administration.\n\n  With regard to a sea-based boost phase kinetic energy, it writes \nthat:\n\n     sea-based boost-phase defenses are . . . currently in the \n     very early stages of conceptual development [and] there are \n     substantial uncertainties regarding the needed capabilities, \n     system architecture, technologies, and schedule for \n     developing and deploying such defenses.\n\n  I should note that I remain a strong supporter of Brilliant Pebbles \nand hope that it is seriously pursued at some point in the future. That \nthe program's revival would entail financial costs is, of course, a \ngiven, if it were ever actually considered.\n  CBO did include an estimated cost of $68 billion for a 24-satellite \nconstellation of Space-Based Lasers, despite the Appropriations \nCommittees having killed the long-range program, the Administration's \nbudget request reflecting little emphasis on that program, and despite \nthe fact that very little is known about the characteristics of any \nsuch satellites that may eventually be built. CBO also included in its \nestimate the construction of nine new AEGIS ships, each outfitted with \n35 advanced interceptors, while omitting consideration of the \npossibility of converting existing AEGIS ships for the new mission.\n  At the request of the Senators who requested the study, CBO also \npriced options as though they will all develop and deploy concurrently, \nand without regard for the relationships between programs. In other \nwords, it estimated program costs in what we call a ``stovepipe'' \nfashion: programs exist parallel to and independent of each other. \nDeliberately ignored by the report's congressional sponsors is the \ncommon base from which these programs develop and from which they will \noperate, for example, feeding off of common sensor and processors. Once \nagain, CBO warned against using such an approach. To quote again from \nits cover letter to Senators:\n\n     (A)s you requested, CBO's assumptions about the architecture \n     and components of the sea-based system reflect its use as a \n     stand-alone system, not as an adjunct to a ground-based \n     system.\n\n  To summarize, then, CBO's high-end estimates are derived from the \nfollowing questionable practices requested by Senators:\n  No. 1, use of exaggerated scenarios, for example, the third ground-\nbased site and the construction of new ships;\n  No. 2, inclusion of drawing board programs that may or may not be \nincluded in some distant architecture, but certainly won't be developed \nconcurrent with other covered programs; and\n  No. 3, use of pricing and inventory requirement methodologies that \nmay bear little or no relationship to a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  The second problem with the analysis is the context.\n  It assumes circumstances similar to other weapon acquisition \nprograms. But the development of missile defenses, does not easily \nallow for such analysis. Unlike a new aircraft, for example, there is \nno existing national missile defense system from which to draw \ncomparisons to programs under development. A decade of lost opportunity \nhas left us with no alternatives but to field the systems currently \nunder development.\n  Yet, look at some of CBO's assumptions from its April 2000 report, \nwhich attempt to redefine a missile defense program to some \nhypothetical norm:\n\n       Differing estimates for procurement arise for two reasons. \n     First, CBO believes that in addition to the 100 deployed \n     interceptors, the system would need 82 additional \n     interceptors to use in testing and to replace ones lost in \n     accidents or engagements. The Administration puts the number \n     of additional interceptors at 47. However, CBO's larger \n     figure is more consistent with the experience of previous \n     missile programs. It includes 20 additional interceptors for \n     operational testing and evaluation because CBO assumes that \n     the system will need a total of 30 tests over its first five \n     years of operations. (The Peacekeeper missile program \n     conducted about 20 tests during its initial five years of \n     operations, and the Navy's Trident missile program conducted \n     about 40 tests in its first five years.) In addition, CBO \n     projects that a greater number of spare interceptors (20 \n     instead of five) will be necessary to replace ones that are \n     destroyed during engagement or tests and to allow for \n     unforeseen events such as damage during maintenance.\n\n  The problem with this approach is that it estimates the cost of a \nmake-believe program. It devises a program it thinks will be necessary \nand runs the numbers on that. With regard to the number of additional \ninterceptors required for testing and spares, for example, CBO relies \non the histories of ballistic missile programs that have no bearing on \nor relationship to the air defense interceptors being contemplated.\n  To summarize, then, the CBO report includes a very wide variance of \ncosts, depending upon a number of variables, many of which may bear no \nrelationship to the eventual system architecture, and it derives \nassumptions based upon the experience of programs that have little or \nno relationship to the components of a missile defense system.\n  The second point relates to the tactics of missile defense opponents.\n  Missile defense opponents, such as the sponsors of the CBO report, \ninvariably employ a series of misleading arguments to advance their \ncase against missile defense. One is the misuse of total program life-\ncycle costs. Another involves the use of improperly derived cost \nestimates by adding together numbers that even CBO clearly states \nshould not be added. A third argument used by missile defense opponents \nis that money spent on missile defense programs comes at the expense of \nother programs.\n\n  With regard to argument number one, it is not fair to evaluate the \ncost of a program without spreading it out over the life of the \nprogram. But many\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nmissile defense opponents do precisely that. CBO's estimates are for a \n14-year time span. To cavalierly throw total program life-cycle costs \naround without regard to annual expenditures is to distort the debate \nover the program's value. As one analyst exposed the problem:\n\n       Estimating the cost of missile defenses over a 14-year \n     period would have been akin to devising a similar cost \n     estimate in 1958 for the cost of five generations of \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles (the Titan I, the Titan \n     II, the Minuteman I, II, and III) through 1972. If the \n     procurement cost of these systems--likely more than $200 \n     billion--had been debated prior to the decision to develop \n     ballistic missiles, perhaps Congress would have been equally \n     shocked by the ``sticker price'' of deploying a nuclear \n     deterrent for the next 14 years.\n\n  The second argument or tactic of missile defense opponents involves a \nmisuse of data contained in the CBO report despite CBO warnings. For \nexample, if one simply adds the various high-end estimates, ignoring \nthe lower estimates and CBO's own caveats against taking such an \napproach, it could appear as though the cost of a National Missile \nDefense system would exceed $180 billion. And it turns out that is \nexactly the conclusion the report's congressional sponsors emphasize. \nIn their prepared statement issued upon release of the report, the \nthree senators wrote the following: ``The report . . . shows that \ndeveloping, deploying, and maintaining a modest layered system that \nincludes ground, sea and space-based elements could easily cost well \nover $150 billion.'' Yet, the CBO stated in its cover letter to the \nSenate sponsors, ``The cost estimates that CBO has prepared for \nindividual systems should not be added together to yield an estimate of \nthe total potential costs of national missile defense.'' But that is \nprecisely what Senate opponents of missile defense are doing.\n  Missile defense opponents use the high-end CBO estimate as a baseline \nfrom which the rhetoric escalates to even higher cost estimates. Some \nexamples:\n  One of our esteemed colleagues, in a floor statement on June 25, \nstated the following:\n\n     The Congressional Budget Office in an April 2000 report \n     concluded that the most limited national missile defense \n     system would cost $30 billion . . . If we hope to defend \n     against the accidental launch of numerous highly \n     sophisticated missiles of the type that are now in Russia's \n     arsenal, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \n     cost will almost double, to $60 billion . . . This is what \n     the Congressional Budget Office had to say in March 2001: \n     Those estimates from April 2000 may now be too low . . . Is \n     it any wonder that some critics believe that a workable \n     national missile defense system will cost more than $120 \n     billion?\n\n  From $30 billion to $120 billion.\n  Another Senator was described in the New York Times on September 11 \nas saying that:\n\n       ``The cheapest system proposed by the Bush Administration . \n     . . would cost $60 billion over 20 years, but could rise to \n     as much as $120 billion . . . A more complicated system that \n     would combat decoys or munitions that carry biological \n     weapons--known as a layered defense would cost between one-\n     quarter trillion and half a trillion dollars,'' Mr. Biden \n     said.\n\n  This Senator is reported to have said, that quickly, the estimated \ncost to defend the American public from ballistic missile attack, in \nthe eyes of those who oppose any such defenses, went from CBO's lowest \nnumber of $40 billion to ``one-quarter trillion.'' Exaggeration? Yes.\n  Inevitably, cost estimates for missile defense are used out of \ncontext. The use of exaggerated lump-sum figures to portray national \nmissile defense in the most negative light is intellectually dishonest. \nEven many critics of national missile defense claim to support the \ncomponents to defend against shorter range missiles, like Iraqi Scuds.\n  Taking such support for theater missile defense programs into \naccount, the remaining portion of the overall missile defense budget \nallocated for defense of American cities usually represents less than \ntwo percent of the defense budget. That's right: less than two percent. \nThe fiscal year defense appropriations bill included $331 billion. Of \nthe $8.2 billion in that bill authorized for missile defense, only $3.8 \nbillion is directed toward the so-called midcourse segment, which \nincludes the ground and sea-based systems capable of intercepting \nintercontinental-range missiles. That amounts to one percent of the \nfiscal year 2002 defense budget for national missile defense. I will \nrepeat that.\n\n  That amounts to one percent of the fiscal year 2002 defense budget \nfor national missile defense.\n  For fiscal year 2003, the defense budget request is $379 billion. The \namount requested for missile defenses is $7.8 billion. Of that amount, \nagain, around $3 billion will go for systems designed to defend the \nUnited States. Again, that is only one percent for National Missile \nDefense programs. The Department of Defense's budget documents show \nthat the annual expenditure for all missile defense programs will rise \nto $11 billion in 2007, a time when total defense spending is expected \nto be around $450 billion. So, in 2007, when national missile defense \nprograms will be in or near the operational stage of development, and \nassuming they represent as much as half of all missile defense \nprograms, they will still represent only one to two percent of defense \nspending, while all missile defense programs constitute two to three \npercent.\n  A third argument is that missile defense will rob other needy \nprograms of necessary funding.\n  Some folks try to portray the missile defense programs as robbing \nfrom other more important things, more pressing national security \nrequirements, and other needs more close to the heart of the American \npeople.\n  For example--and I will just quote one or two of these--the Senators, \nin their statement accompanying the release of the new CBO report, \nwrite:\n\n       If the Administration decides to pursue such a costly \n     program, it could draw resources away from programs to \n     counter other, more likely and more immediate threats we know \n     we face: terrorism, attacks with anthrax or other biological \n     and chemical agents, the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and delivery systems that are far more likely to \n     be used than are ballistic missiles, such as trucks, ships, \n     airplanes, and suitcases.\n\n  One of the Senators involved here is the majority leader. It is my \nunderstanding that the distinguished majority leader has proposed to \npay for the approximately $15 billion in energy subsidies in the energy \nbill that we are going to be taking up perhaps this week by offsetting \nthat with the user fees that are collected by the Customs Agency.\n  U.S. Customs has a responsibility in this war on terror, a very \nserious responsibility. As these Senators pointed out, one of the \nlikely possibilities, anyway, of threat to the United States is the \ndelivery of a weapon of mass destruction in the cargo hold of a ship. \nThat, of course, is exactly the kind of thing for which Customs is \nsupposed to check.\n  So on the one hand the distinguished majority leader is at least \nrecorded as having suggested that we take money away from the Customs \nService, money which could be spent to check this kind of thing, and \npay for subsidies in the energy bill with that funding. It is my belief \nthat we should do both. We have to leave the Customs fees with the \nCustoms Service which has a massive responsibility. They need more \nmoney, not less, to do what we want them to do with their regular job \nas well as fighting the war on terror.\n  We also need to spend the kind of money that is required to ensure \nthat we do not have a threat from ballistic missile attack. We can and \nshould do both.\n  Other Senators made similar comments, but I believe these arguments \nare demonstrably wrong. I will illustrate why with discussion on three \nbrief points: First of all, spending to protect our Nation from another \nterrorist attack; secondly, costs of other weapons programs; and, \nthird, what I would call porkbarrel spending.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, the United States \nhad budgeted $10.3 billion to combat terrorism for fiscal year 2002. \nThat was before September 11. Back in August, once again, the \nCongressional Research Service had provided my office estimated federal \nexpenditures for border security of $14 billion for the current fiscal \nyear. Taking into account some degree of overlap, we can reasonably \nsurmise that between $15 billion and $20 billion was budgeted by the \nBush administration for what we now call ``homeland defense'' before \nthe attacks on the World Trade Center and the\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nPentagon. And this omits the $20 billion from the emergency \nsupplemental and the cost of ongoing military operations intended to \neliminate the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan, as well as a \nsupplemental appropriations request we will soon receive in the range \nof $10 to $20 billion.\n  The budget request for fiscal year 2003 includes $38 billion for \nhomeland security, double the amount for 2002. In addition, the amount \nbudgeted for national defense will be $379 billion, almost all for \nconventional and special forces. Compare that with the $3 billion we \nare spending on national missile defense. Clearly, the opponents' \nclaims that other defense and domestic security projects, especially \nour efforts to deal with terrorism, are suffering because of missile \ndefense are just plain wrong.\n  How about other weapons programs?\n  The total costs of any major procurement program can appear daunting. \nTactical fighter modernization--the development and acquisition of the \nF/A-18E/F, the F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter--is anticipated, if we \naccept CBO's numbers, to cost $350 billion through the year 2020.\n  To date, we have spent over $10 billion on the V-22 Osprey program, \nwhich continues to prove a developmental headache and accidents of \nwhich have cost the lives of 30 Marines. The Department of Defense \ncalculates that the V-22 program will cost a total of $38 billion.\n  These are all high total costs. Taken out of context, they can be \nexploited by opponents of individual programs. The $350 billion figure \nfor tactical fighter modernization, in particular, has been used to \nbuttress arguments against these aircraft, given the absence of a \nserious threat to U.S. air superiority.\n  Such arguments, however, would be misleading. They ignore the \nimponderables, such as the need to ensure air superiority throughout \nmuch of the 21st century, and the fact that procurement costs are \nspread out over many years. They ignore cost-benefit analyses that \ndemonstrate fewer units required to accomplish missions that require \nfar greater numbers of older, less capable models. They ignore missions \nassigned to platforms that may not be readily apparent because they do \nnot fit into conventional images of how such platforms are used.\n  So, it is not persuasive to argue against missile defense based on \nthe seemingly large total cost spent over time.\n  Finally, what about he argument that other needs go unmet because of \nwhat we would be spending on missile defenses? We rarely hear many of \nthese same critics decrying the expenditure of considerable amounts of \ntaxpayer money for porkbarrel projects that contribute neither to \nnational security nor to our economic well-being. I direct my \ncolleagues attention, for example, to the February 6 column by Robert \nSamuelson in the Washington Post. Samuelson notes that, ``since 1978, \nfederal outlays to support farmers' incomes have exceeded $300 \nbillion.'' Samuelson goes on to write: ``But wait: Congress is about to \nexpand the subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nnew farm legislation would increase costs by $65 billion over a 10-year \nperiod, on top of the $128.5 billion of existing programs.''\n  These figures make what we are spending on national missile defense \npale by comparison.\n  Samuelson's column argues persuasively that the $300 billion in farm \nsubsidies have had no--repeat, no--discernable impact on agricultural \nproduction in the United States, on farmer incomes, or on the \ncontraction in the number of small family farms.\n  My colleague Senator McCain regularly produces lists of items added \nto spending bills for purely parochial reasons. For example, he \nidentified $3.6 billion worth of pure pork in the current year's \ndefense appropriations bill--an amount exceeding our expenditure for \nnational missile defense. And this is an annual phenomenon and \nrepresents just one of the 13 annual appropriations bills, all of which \nare loaded up with pork every year. Senator McCain estimated that the \ntotal spent on pork for fiscal year 2002 equals $15 billion three times \nthe amount historically spent on missile defense programs per year.\n  As a final thought, when discussing the cost of a national missile \ndefense system, we should attempt to inject a little integrity into the \nprocess. The liberal public policy organization, The Center for Defense \nInformation, recently published a report concluding that, since 1983, \nthe United States has spent ``roughly $44 billion'' on national missile \ndefense. The implication is intended to be that we have nothing to show \nfor all that money, and should not spend more. The center further \nconcludes that the cost of a three-site national missile defense \nsystem--the nonexistent third site that I mentioned earlier--would \n``likely'' cost more than $60 billion.\n  The $44 billion spent since 1983 on national missile defense amounts \nto $2.3 billion per year--less than 1 percent of defense spending. The \nsuggestion that we have little or nothing to show for the money spent \nignores two very important facts: No. 1, the research and development \neffort has given us a strong base of knowledge for what is technically \nfeasible; has contributed to the development of the theater and short-\nrange systems such as the Patriot PAC-3 that most of us agree are \nneeded; and has generated a large number of technological spinoffs, for \nexample, in the areas of cancer screening, computer chip production, \nand laser eye surgery; and, second, to the extent not all of the money \nwas spent to produce a deployable system, we must recognize that, for 8 \nyears, we had an administration vehemently opposed to actually \ndeveloping and building a system to defend this country against missile \nattack.\n  To the extent we did not make as much progress as could have been \naccomplished, the 8 years that were ``lost'' was because the Clinton \nadministration was committed to the notion that we didn't need missile \ndefenses, that arms control and deterrence would protect us against \nthose who would do us harm. While money was spent on research, there \nwas no commitment to actually deploy a national missile defense system. \nAdherence to the ABM Treaty, which was considered ``the cornerstone of \nstrategic stability,'' was sacrosanct. As Deputy Defense Secretary \nWolfowitz, in response to an inquiry regarding the eventual cost of the \nBush administration's missile defense plans, said in his July 12 \nstatement before the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       . . . we have not yet chosen a systems architecture to \n     deploy. We are not in a position to do so because so many \n     promising technologies were not pursued in the past. The \n     program we inherited was designed not for maximum \n     effectiveness, but to remain within the constraints of the \n     ABM Treaty.\n\n  That is the real problem.\n  So in conclusion, there is no question that the cost to build a \nnational missile defense system will be high. Freedom is not free. We \ndo not know the exact cost, both because we are struggling to make up \nfor lost time and we were constrained by an outdated treaty from which \nPresident Bush is wisely extricating us. We do not know how many \nsatellites we will need, because political decisions are still to be \nmade regarding the scale of the threat against which a defensive system \nwill be deployed. And we are only now getting a handle on questions \nthat should have been answered years ago, for example, the feasibility \nof various technologies for interceptors and sensors.\n\n  While we don't know precisely how much it will cost to build a \nnational missile defense system, we do have some sense of what it could \ncost if we don't build one. A nuclear-armed missile targeted against \nNew York City would do far more damage than did the aircraft that \nstruck the World Trade Center. It would, in fact, destroy the city. The \nramifications for the people, the whole country, and our national \neconomy would, obviously, be enormous.\n  Just to try to quantify the fiscal costs, the Congressional Research \nService states that most credible projections of the cost to the \ninsurance industry from the September 11 attacks range from $40 to $70 \nbillion. And that's just the impact on the insurance industry. Arnaud \nde Borchgrave discussed the impact on the economy in a recent column in \nthe Washington Times, stating, ``. . . the accumulated damage to the \nU.S. and world economies is now thought to be almost $700 billion.'' \nObviously, the cost in human lives is incalculable.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  The cost of a system to defend against that attack would be minuscule \nin comparison. In fact, as pointed out, the cost of defending against \nterrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction, or even \nconventional weapons, far exceeds what we spend on missile defenses.\n  The missile threat develops faster than does the means to counter it. \nWe are neither spending extravagantly, nor inappropriately. We are \nseeking to deploy a layered defense that optimizes technologies that \nhave been developed over the past two decades, and that are continuing \nto evolve.\n  Opponents of national missile defense are free to continue to oppose \nthe President's plan. That is their right. There is an old saying, \nthough. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion; no one is \nentitled to his or her own facts. Missile defense programs should be \ndiscussed with the same respect for context and intellectual honesty \nthat we afford the programs on which the other 98 percent of the \ndefense budget is allocated. Only then, can we make the informed \ndecisions we were sent here to make.\n  That concludes my remarks on this matter of the cost of national \nballistic missile defense. I spoke before on the need for national \nmissile defense, and I will speak in the future on the question of the \nlegal authority of the President to withdraw the United States from the \n1972 ABM Treaty.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Madam President, last Friday night, I attended the Maine \nAnnual Fisherman's Forum in Rockport, ME. This is a wonderful event \nthat brings leaders from the industry together to talk about problems \nthat the fishing industry is experiencing. We have a wonderful fresh \nfish dinner and then there is an auction held which annually raises \nthousands of dollars in scholarship money.\n  But this year, a shadow was cast over the entire forum. We arrived at \nthe forum only to learn that earlier that day, the National Marine \nFisheries Service had unveiled a Draconian response to a Federal \nlawsuit that had been filed that affects the ground fishing industry. \nThe response proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service would \nhave a devastating impact on our fishermen in Maine.\n  The life of a fisherman is already a difficult one. He or she \nencounters rough weather, and we have suffered devastating losses of \nlife in the fishing industry in Maine. It is a difficult life. They are \nproud, independent people who ask only that they be given a fair chance \nto earn a living.\n  The fishermen of my State have been leaders in pioneering \nconservation efforts. They understand it is necessary to have some \nrestrictions to preserve the fish stocks for future generations, but \nwhen we get into a situation where lawsuits are being filed and Federal \nregulators respond in a way that is completely indifferent to the needs \nof the fishing industry, we make the life of Maine's fishermen \nvirtually impossible.\n  Already we have seen years and years of escalating restrictions that \nhave driven many fishermen out of business, cut the incumbent \nprocessors, suppliers, and fish auctions, and strained coastal \ncommunities that are the heart of Maine. In fact, 1,200 fishermen have \nparticipated in retraining programs, and the Coastal Workforce Board, \nwhich runs these programs, estimates that represents only a third of \nthe total number of displaced fishermen.\n  Since 1995, the ground fishing industry has been limited to only 88 \ndays at sea, a restriction that has been extremely difficult for those \nin the industry to bear. Nevertheless, they have coped, they have \nmanaged to endure, even under the restrictions of only 88 days at sea. \nImagine the shock of Maine fishermen when they learned that Federal \nregulators were proposing to cut in half the number of days they can be \nat sea.\n  Furthermore, they have restricted the number of days that can occur \nduring the peak season for fishing. Only 22 of the days can occur \nduring the peak season. This is devastating. Imagine that, our \nfishermen are being told they can only go to sea for 44 days a year in \nthe Gulf of Maine.\n  Some Federal regulators in the regulatory community have pointed out \nthat the fishermen would still be allowed to use their full allowance \nof days during the nonseason months. Those are the months between \nOctober and May. Again, I wonder to whom these regulators are talking. \nSurely they know those months are not practical for a sustained fishing \neffort. Fishermen encounter low stocks, low prices, and, most of all, \nhazardous weather.\n\n  The restrictions in the proposals put forth by the National Marine \nFisheries Service go even further. Each day that a fisherman goes out \nto sea, no matter how short the trip, even if the fisherman is only out \nfor a few hours, will be counted as a full 24 hours at sea. The \nproposal also calls for restricted fishing areas.\n  In short, these restrictions will have a devastating impact on the \nground fishing industry in Maine, an industry made up of small, \nindependently owned businesses, an industry made up of proud, \nindependent men and women. They are already struggling to make a \nliving, given all the other restrictions that have been imposed. The \nNMFS proposal would now make it virtually impossible for many ground \nfishermen to survive.\n  It comes as a particular disappointment to me that Federal regulators \ndid not consult with members of the fishing community when they were \nconfronted with this Federal lawsuit. It is so frustrating that the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service ignored the letter I sent them asking \nthat they bring all the stakeholders to the table to work out a \nresponse to this lawsuit. Instead, Federal regulators essentially shut \nour fishermen out of the process, and that is one reason they came up \nwith such an ill-conceived proposal that does not reflect the reality \nof earning a living as a fisherman in the State of Maine.\n  The proposal put forth by Federal regulators is even more surprising \nbecause it comes at a time when both scientists and fishermen agree \nthat ground fish stocks are rebounding, that the conservation efforts \nalready underway, that the regulatory restrictions already in place are \nhaving a beneficial impact.\n  Again I stress, our fishermen are in the forefront of conservation \nefforts. They are keenly aware of the importance of rebuilding the \nfishing stocks. After all, fewer fish mean fewer activities and fewer \nopportunities for our fishermen to make a living.\n  In fact, Maine's fishing industry, working together with marine \nscientists, have been pioneers in the use of conservation techniques \nand self-regulation in fishing management, but our efforts to rebuild \nour ground fish stocks are only useful if a ground fish industry \nremains. Any effort to rebound ground fish stocks must guarantee the \nsurvival not only of the fish but of the fishermen.\n  When I think of the amount of money that has been squandered in \ncostly lawsuits, it is so unfortunate because those are funds that \ncould have been put into research. Those are funds that could have been \nused to bring everybody to the table to work out and devise a \ncommonsense solution to the problems of rebuilding the fishing stocks.\n  Let me give an example of what the impact will be on one fisherman in \nMaine. I heard from a fisherman named Sam Viola about this issue. Sam \nis a fisherman from Portland, ME, who owns two 70-foot draggers and \nfishes for haddock, hake, and cod. His brother is a fisherman, as was \nSam's dad. That is typical in Maine. Families, generation after \ngeneration, will go to the sea to earn a living.\n  Sam said that finally, after years of scraping by due to catch \nrestrictions and limits on fishing days per year designed to restore \nthe ground fishery, he\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nhas been able to make a living to support himself and his family. He \nbelieves the seas are now teeming with fish. He has seen such a rebound \nin the stocks, and he is very worried that the latest regulations \nproposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service will put him and many \nof his fellow fishermen out of business.\n  I share the grave concerns of the responsible fishermen such as Sam \nand those fishermen with whom I talked on Friday night at the annual \nfisherman's forum. They are good people. They know the sea better than \nany regulator in Washington, DC. How unfortunate it is, how wrong it \nis, that Federal fishing regulators did not involve the people who know \nthe Gulf of Maine the best: The fishermen who are out there earning a \nliving.\n  I am going to be working with my colleagues in both the House and the \nSenate and particularly with Maine's senior Senator, Ms. Olympia Snowe, \nwho is the ranking Republican on the subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover this issue, to develop a plan, to develop an alternative approach \nthat recognizes we can both support our fishermen and have the seas \nteeming with fish.\n  It is a false choice to say our fishermen can only go to sea half the \nnumber of days that they are now allowed, a restriction that is already \nextremely difficult for many fishermen and their families to accept. \nThese further restrictions, the new approach proposed by the National \nMarine Fisheries Service, I fear, will spell the end for many Maine \nfishermen. It will make it simply impossible for them to earn a living; \nthe restrictions are so onerous, so unreasonable, and so strict.\n  We need a different approach, and I believe if Federal regulators had \nonly taken the time to involve the experts in the industry, the men and \nwomen who are fishing in the Gulf of Maine, we would have come up with \na far better approach, an approach that would not only continue the \nprocess of rebuilding the fishing stocks in Maine, in the Gulf of \nMaine, but also would allow our hard-working, proud, and independent \nfishermen to earn a living.\n  This is an issue on which I will continue to be working with the \nChair and others.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, today, as I have done every year I \nhave been in the Senate, I want to especially commemorate the \nanniversary of Texas independence. Many know--many do not know--the \nhistory of Texas, but I am very proud of the heritage we have. Texas is \nthe only State that came into the Nation as a nation. There was a \ntreaty that was made between the United States and the Republic of \nTexas for Texas to come into the Union. The freedom the Texans got in \n1836 was hard fought and it was a long time coming. They were a part of \nMexico. The Mexican Government was becoming more oppressive, and they \nwere taxing the people, they were not giving them religious freedom, \nand they finally passed a law that said no one could emigrate from the \nUnited States into the Texas territory of Mexico.\n  So the people rebelled. They had to fight for their independence, and \none of the most famous battles in the history of our country was the \nBattle of the Alamo.\n  I commemorate Texas Independence Day, which is March 2, every year, \nby reading the letter from William Barret Travis, that has become very \nfamous, as he was holding down the fort at the Alamo. This was at a \ntime when the convention was meeting at Washington-on-the-Brazos to \nmake the formal declaration of independence from Mexico for Texas. My \ngreat, great grandfather was one of the delegates to that convention. \nHe represented Nacogdoches, just as Thomas Rusk did.\n  Thomas Rusk was the first Senator to hold my seat. He and my great, \ngreat grandfather, Charles S. Taylor, were very good friends. They were \npartners, and they were certainly patriots in the fight for freedom for \nTexas.\n  It is with that background I would like to read the letter from \nWilliam Barret Travis, remembering there were 184 Texas rebels in the \nAlamo at the time. There was a huge army of Santa Ana's out there, and \nthis was the second day of the siege of the Alamo, February 24, 1836.\n\n       Fellow citizens and compatriots: I am besieged by a \n     thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Ana. I have \n     sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours \n     and have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender \n     at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the \n     sword, if the fort is taken. I have answered the demands with \n     a cannon shot, and our flag still waves proudly from the \n     wall. I shall never surrender or retreat.\n       Then, I call on you in the name of liberty, of patriotism \n     and of everything dear to the American character, to come to \n     our aid, with all dispatch. The enemy is receiving \n     reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three to \n     four thousand in four or five days. If this call is \n     neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as \n     possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due \n     to his own honor and that of his country--Victory or Death.\n       William Barret Travis, Lt. Col, Commander.\n\n  It turns out there were 3,000 to 6,000 Mexican soldiers. They did \ntake the Alamo, which did not have reenforcements. Gen. Sam Houston \ndecided it would be a waste of manpower to send reinforcements because \nhe thought the cause was lost. Those 184 men were able to hold off the \nMexican Army for days, and that allowed Gen. Sam Houston to gather his \nforces. The Declaration of Independence was signed on March 2, 1836, \nand because he was able to marshall the forces after the Alamo and take \na stand at San Jacinto, that is where the war was won and the Republic \nof Texas was formed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I understand we are going to be going \nback to a vote pretty soon relative to the issue of antifraud \nprovisions associated with election reform. We all have different views \non this issue. I can certainly recognize and support the simplicity of \nencouraging voters to have a relatively easy method to vote and \nregister. However, Mr. Bond, the Senator from Missouri, has made quite \na point of how fraud occurs. I gather we have seen scams, particularly \nin Missouri, relative to voter fraud, registering dead neighbors and \ndiseased alderman, and in one case a dog that evidently voted several \ntimes and the jig was up when the dog was called for jury duty.\n  A system that allows that much flexibility is a little too flexible. \nI hope we address reasonable requirements to encourage people to vote \nbut have reasonable identification so we do not have fraudulent \nactivities such as the dog that was called to jury duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1412-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1412-S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I came to the floor last week to talk \nabout Iraq. I indicated that U.S. forces enforcing the no-fly zone \nsince 1992 were fired on for the second time this year. Of course, our \nforces responded by destroying an Iraqi air defense group north of \nBaghdad. This is a continuing commitment we have had to enforce a no-\nfly zone under the U.N. proclamation over Iraq.\n  The inconsistency is that, on one hand, we are enforcing this no-fly \nzone; on the other, we are importing oil from Iraq. Even on September \n11, when the attack on the Trade Centers occurred, we were importing a \nlittle over 1 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq. Today we import \nsome 875,000 barrels. We are enforcing a no-fly zone, putting\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\nthe lives of our men and women at risk, yet we are becoming even more \ndependent on that part of the world for our oil supply.\n  As I indicated, this is the second time this year we have bombed \nIraq, taking out targets. We are off to a troubling start. Last year, \nIraq shot at U.S. forces enforcing the no-fly zone some 400 times. We \nresponded with a like force some 25 times. On one hand, we make a fist \nat Iraq; on the other, we want to take their oil.\n  As I indicated, in September there was more than a million \nbarrels. This is a point that I think has been lost to some extent, but \nit has not been lost on the brave men and women who enforce this no-fly \nzone each day.\n\n  I would like to read a passage I found in today's National Journal. \nIt quoted BG Edward Ellis, Commander, Northern Watch, Combined Task \nForces. He says very eloquently:\n\n       I know the rules of engagement are sometimes frustrating \n     for my pilots, whose natural reaction when they get shot at \n     is to want to do some leveling, leveling of something. But \n     anyone who thinks that military action shouldn't be governed \n     by political constraints is naive. The political reality is \n     we're not at war with Iraq at this point, and if we reacted \n     harshly, we could force the hand or limit the options of U.S. \n     policymakers who are trying to figure out what to do about \n     Saddam Hussein.\n       Having said that, I do think there is merit to the argument \n     that the policy makers might want to address this issue \n     sooner than later, because of the inherent jeopardy of this \n     mission.\n       Saddam has put a bounty on our heads.\n       The bottom line is, we continue to fly and the Iraqis \n     continue to shoot at us. Nobody should be especially \n     surprised if eventually they happen to hit something.\n\n  That comes from BG Edward Ellis, Commander of the Northern Watch, \nCombined Task Forces.\n  Our Nation was built on the premise that statesman and soldier are \ntwo different professions. But in this instance, I hope my colleagues \nwill make a note of the warning of General Ellis from the front lines, \nthat perhaps his wisdom will guide us to make the right choices for \ndealing with Iraq and certainly the right choices about our dependence \non Iraq; that is, to substantially eliminate that dependence and reduce \nour dependence on imported oil through the Mideast.\n  I was also struck by a Gallup Poll that came out the other day. It \nwas in USA Today and a number of our national periodicals. I am told it \nwas the most comprehensive poll on Muslim countries and their views \nwith regard to America. They polled people in Pakistan, Indonesia, \nLebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. I don't know \nabout you, Mr. President, but when I read those results they were \nfrightening, and they should give us pause. Residents of these \ncountries viewed America unfavorably by a 2-to-1 margin. Some of these \ncountries are supposed to be good friends of ours, but their views and \ntheir people's attitude towards us certainly doesn't show it.\n  Friends or not, we get a lot of energy from this area, and I think we \nhave become dangerously reliant upon them. Let's look at the numbers: \n61 percent of the residents of those countries, in polling information \nfrom Gallup, suggest that the Arabs were not responsible for 9-11. In \nother words, those who carried citizenship from those countries, they \nbear no responsibility. Only 18 percent of the people in these \ncountries believe that Arabs were even involved in the terrorism that \ntook place on September 11.\n  In Kuwait, 36 percent said the attacks were justifiable, the highest \nnumber of any country. That is rather troubling to me because we only \nhave to go back to 1992 when we fought a war to keep Saddam Hussein \nfrom invading Kuwait and going on into Saudi Arabia. Here is Kuwait, 36 \npercent of the people say the attacks were justifiable. If it were not \nfor our action, Saddam Hussein would be in Saudi Arabia today; he would \nhave taken over Kuwait.\n  Only 9 percent say U.S. military action in Afghanistan is justified. \nLet me say that again. Only 9 percent, according to the Gallup Poll, \nsay U.S. military action is justified even though the people of \nAfghanistan were happy, in our view at least, to throw off the yoke of \nthe Taliban and al-Qaida that was strangling them to death, certainly, \nin our opinion, using that country as a clubhouse for gangsters and \nterrorists.\n  I am appalled by these figures. I am worried and I think it should \nbother all Members of this body. Why? Because we are too dependent on \nthese countries that clearly have a different view of the United \nStates. The poll shows the United States has a 16-percent approval \nrating in Saudi Arabia. I hope that irony is not lost, that we also get \n16 percent of our oil from Saudi Arabia.\n  What are we going to do about it? The governments of some of these \ncountries are friends of ours, but what about the people? The Gallup \nPoll shows that, despite our money, our aid, our support, they either \ndon't like us or they don't trust us, or both.\n  What really concerns all of us is the manner in which this lack of \ntrust, this hatred, is fostered within these countries. We know that \nfundamentalist schools in some of the Muslim countries do not \nnecessarily preach democracy. We have heard about these schools, where \nthey teach youngsters to hate western ideas, western democracy, and \nespecially America. The real concern is they are teaching some of these \nyoung people who are going to be the leaders of tomorrow. These are \nyoungsters who might grow up believing that dying while killing an \nAmerican is a great thing. These are the young people who will not \nforever be satisfied with their government's sending them to schools. \nThey will want to take the power themselves from what they learned. As \nwe know, children are very impressionable.\n  What I am concerned with today is what this leadership could become. \nI am also concerned at the lack, in this body, of a concentrated effort \nto reduce our dependence on oil from that part of the world. We are \nsending money to Saddam Hussein every day for oil--somewhere in the \narea of $15 million every day.\n  Our President has taken a strong stance for energy independence, \nagainst terrorism, recognizing that we can't eliminate that dependence \nbut we can reduce it.\n  I think the Gallup Poll numbers are so true. I think it is also true \nthat we should reflect, at this crucial time, on our relationship with \nIraq, particularly our knowledge that Saddam Hussein has been able to \nevade the monitoring activities of the United Nations within Iraq, \nparticularly recognizing that we have not had any inspectors there \nunder the U.N. for nearly 4 years, particularly in view of the fact \nthat we have evidence that shows he has a missile capability, a \ndelivery capability, and that he may be working towards a biological \nand/or nuclear warhead.\n  Where is he aiming? We know Israel is one of the countries within his \nsights. The question is, When do we address and resolve, if you will, \nwhat this threat might become? Do we initiate, through a mandate, \ninspections that occur immediately? And what kind of reaction can we \nexpect from Saddam Hussein? Clearly, the U.N. is unable to do its job, \nbut this threat is increasing. It is being fostered by dollars from the \nUnited States that we pay Saddam Hussein for his oil at the same time \nwe are bombing him and taking out his targets. He is using the money to \nkeep his Republican Guard alive. He is obviously using the money to \ndevelop his missile capability.\n  The question is, How do we begin to unwind Iraq? What is it going to \ntake? Do we wait for an action that costs American lives? This is a \nvery sobering question, but I cannot stand in this body and condone our \ncontinued dependence on oil from a neighbor such as Saddam Hussein.\n  I challenge the leader, who has previously given me his assurance \nthat we would be able to address in this session an action that would \nbe initiated against Iraq, Senate action expressing not only our \ndispleasure but setting up the mechanics to ensure that we did not \npurchase any more oil from Saddam Hussein. We can do that, just as we \ninitiated action against Iran, from which the United States has not had \nany oil for many years. Basically, what we are talking about is a \nsanction. We have sanctions against Libya. We have sanctions against \nIran. But I find it very frustrating that we have not gone forth and \nsanctioned Saddam Hussein and oil imports coming to the United States \nfrom Iraq.\n\n  As I mentioned some time ago, when we had the unanimous consent \nagreement--and the Record will show that the leader allowed me an \nopportunity to bring this matter up at the appropriate time--I will \nagain bring this\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\nmatter up with the leader for his consideration. I think the time is \nright to initiate such action of a sanction against oil from Iraq.\n  We find ourselves in a situation where not only are we enforcing a \nno-fly zone but we are taking out targets when he attempts to take us \ndown, suggesting that it is certainly not in the national interest of \nour Nation to maintain this kind of relationship. I will be calling on \nthe majority leader to honor his commitment to me to allow us to take \nup a sanction against Iraq. I suggest we do it as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1414-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEINZ AWARDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after the sudden and untimely death of \nour colleague--and my friend--Senator John Heinz, in 1991, his wife, \nTeresa Heinz, set about devising a suitable and characteristic memorial \nto his memory. As she has said, such a task is especially difficult \nwhen the goal is to honor someone as complex and multi-faceted as \nSenator Heinz was. She realized that no static monument or self-serving \nexercise in sentimentality would do, and that the only tribute \nbefitting Senator Heinz would be one that celebrated his spirit by \nhonoring those who live and work in the same ways he did.\n  Those of us who had the privilege of knowing Senator Heinz remember, \nwith respect and affection, his tremendous energy and intellectual \ncuriosity; his commitment to improving the lives of people; and his \nimpatience with procedural roadblocks when they stood in the way of \nnecessary progress. For Senator Heinz, excellence was not enough; \nexcellence was taken as a given. What made the difference was the \npractical--and, yes, pragmatic--application of excellence to the goal \nof making America a better nation and the world a better place. \nAlthough John Heinz thought and worked on a grand scale, he understood \nthat progress is more often made in small increments: one policy, one \nprogram, even one person, at a time. We also remember the contagious \nenthusiasm and palpable joy with which he pursued his goals and lived \nhis life.\n  Teresa Heinz created the Heinz Awards to celebrate and carry on these \nqualities and characteristics--five awards in each of five categories \nin which John was especially interested and active during his \nlegislative and public career: Arts and Humanities; the Environment; \nthe Human Condition; Public Policy; and Technology and the Economy. In \neach of these areas, the Heinz Awards recognize outstanding \nachievements. In fact, the annual Heinz Awards are among the largest \nindividual achievement prizes in the world.\n  The six men and women who are being honored with this year's Heinz \nAwards--the eighth annual Awards--have just been named. They are a \ndistinguished and accomplished group of men and women whose lives and \nwork have truly made a difference.\n  This year the Arts and Humanities Heinz Award is shared by Dudley \nCocke and Rick Lowe. Mr. Cocke, with his Roadside Theater company based \nin Whitesburg, KY, has worked in hundreds of communities in 43 States. \nHe is a leader in the movement to cultivate locally based art all \nacross America. Mr. Lowe is an artist and activist who founded Project \nRow Houses in Houston as a way to bring a world-class art project to a \nlow-income neighborhood where such art is rarely seen and experienced.\n  The Heinz Award in the Environment is conferred on Dr. Jane \nLubchenco. An expert in biodiversity, conservation, and global change, \nDr. Lubchenco, of Oregon State University, is one of the most \ninfluential and respected voices in environmental policy.\n  Cushing Dolbeare receives the Heinz Award for the Human Condition. \nFor five decades, as many members of this House well know, Ms. \nDolbeare, the founder of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, has \nworked across party lines to make low-income housing a government \npriority. I am proud to say that Ms. Dolbeare is a resident of \nPhiladelphia, PA, my home city.\n  The Heinz Award for Public Policy is awarded to retired Air Force \nGeneral Lee Butler, of Omaha, NE. General Butler's efforts to end \nnuclear proliferation and change America's nuclear deterrence policy, \nhave resulted in increased global awareness of the threat of nuclear \nwar and nuclear weapons.\n  Dr. Anita Borg, of Palo Alto, California, receives the Heinz Award \nfor Technology, the Economy and Employment. The creator of the \n``Systers'' information-sharing Internet network for women, she has \nbeen in the forefront of promoting women's participation in the \nadvancement and uses of technology, and particularly computing.\n  Occasionally the Heinz Awards program bestows a special honor--the \nChairman's Medal--on a truly exceptional nominee whose career has been \ndistinguished by a pattern of singular accomplishment and character. \nThis year a Chairman's Medal has been awarded to Dr. Ruth Patrick--who \nis, I am again proud to say, a resident of Philadelphia, PA--who is \ntruly a scientific pioneer. Still actively working and contributing at \nthe age of 93, Dr. Patrick is one of the world's leading biologists and \na pioneer in predicting ecosystem risks at a time before such risks \nwere a part of general scientific knowledge. I had the opportunity to \nmeet with her relatively recently, and she is really a dynamo at 93.\n  I know that every Member of this body joins me in saluting Teresa \nHeinz for creating such an apt and appropriate way of honoring the \nmemory of our late colleague; and also in congratulating these \ndistinguished Americans, recipients of the eighth annual Heinz Awards, \nfor the way their lives and contributions have--and continue to--carry \non the spirit and the work of Senator John Heinz, and have helped to \nmake America, and the world, truly a better place for all of us.\n  I yield the floor. In the absence of any other Senator in the \nChamber, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 6 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. 565, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 565) to establish the Commission on Voting \n     Rights and Procedures to study and make recommendations \n     regarding election technology, voting, and election \n     administration, to establish a grant program under which the \n     Office of Justice Programs and the Civil Rights Division of \n     the Department of Justice shall provide assistance to States \n     and localities in improving election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to require States to \n     meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \n     administration requirements for the 2004 Federal election, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Clinton amendment No. 2906, to establish a residual ballot \n     performance benchmark.\n       Dodd (for Schumer) modified amendment No. 2914, to permit \n     the use of a signature or personal mark for the purpose of \n     verifying the identity of voters who register by mail.\n       Dodd (for Kennedy) amendment No. 2916, to clarify the \n     application of the safe harbor provisions.\n       Hatch amendment No. 2935, to establish the Advisory \n     Committee on Electronic Voting and the Electoral Process, and \n     to instruct the Attorney General to study the adequacy of \n     existing electoral fraud statutes and penalties.\n       Hatch amendment No. 2936, to make the provisions of the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965 permanent.\n       Schumer/Wyden amendment No. 2937, to permit the use of a \n     signature or personal mark for the purpose of verifying the \n     identity of voters who register by mail.\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\n       Smith of New Hampshire amendment No. 2933, to prohibit the \n     broadcast of certain false and untimely information on \n     Federal elections.\n       Bond amendment No. 2940 (to Amendment No. 2937), to permit \n     the use of signature verification programs to verify the \n     identity of individuals who register to vote by mail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, or their designees.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote \nonce again on cloture with respect to the election reform bill. I come \nto the floor to take a couple of minutes to say that, once again, \nOregon's two Senators will be working together on a bipartisan basis to \ntry to protect the voting rights of folks who, in a small State 3,000 \nmiles from here, have come up with a system that I think can be a \nnational model. It has empowered Americans. It empowered the people of \nour State--like, essentially, no other--in the Senate special election \nthat was held in 1996, when three times the level of voter interest was \nshown as was shown in the previous Senate special election.\n  My colleague, Senator Smith, lost in that election by a small amount. \nHe waged a valiant campaign. He has become a colleague with whom I have \nworked very closely. To his great credit, after an election that I won \nnarrowly, he made it clear there were no instances of fraud or flagrant \nviolations that tainted the election. That is why the two of us, on a \nbipartisan basis, feel so strongly about protecting Oregon's election \nrights.\n  I see another northwesterner in the Chamber and currently presiding. \nI know the occupant of the chair feels strongly about protecting the \nrights of those in Washington State who vote by mail.\n  We are willing to meet our colleagues on the other side more than \nhalfway. We have said that from the very beginning. Northwesterners are \nnot a part of the Rules Committee. We have tried very hard to work with \nour colleagues. I have believed for some time that there is the \nframework of a compromise that could address the concerns of those on \nboth sides. The senior Senator from Missouri makes a good case that \nmore does need to be done to address fraud. I think the appropriate \ntime to do that is in the registration process--what is essentially the \nfront end of the voters' involvement in the political process. I am \nwilling to meet him more than halfway in addressing those concerns.\n  The chairman of the Rules Committee, Senator Dodd, has worked on a \nvariety of compromises to try to address the concerns of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, and he and I are going to continue to do \nthat. But we do have to voice our strong objection to gutting a system \nthat is working, that has empowered thousands and thousands of voters.\n  Unfortunately, if we go forward today with the bill as written, it \nwill do great damage to those States that do vote by mail. Every review \nof the disputed 2000 election showed that there were a variety of \nerrors with punchcard voting machines. But what we want to do is \naddress those concerns and not roll back the clock, which is what you \nwould do if you did damage to States that vote by mail. We think our \nsignature verification process is a good one. It is one that has been \nin place to ensure that there are not those who would engage in fraud. \nAt the end of the day, we think voting by mail--the process \nused exclusively in Oregon--is not one that should be thrown overboard \nto deal with problems of fraud in other parts of the country. We have a \nsystem that works. We have a system that empowers the people in our \nState. It is not a system riddled by corruption.\n\n  I am going to yield the floor now because I see the chairman of the \ncommittee and ranking minority member here. Both of them have been very \nhelpful in working with this Senator. I want them to know that, however \nthe vote turns out, I am going to continue to work with them. I assure \nthem, having just spoken with my colleague, Senator Smith, tonight as \nwell, that he and I are working right now on ideas to address the \nconcerns of both sides of the aisle to get over this Oregon issue. \nOregon's two Senators are united on a bipartisan basis to address this \nconcern.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at 6:15 this evening, the Senate will \nvote on cloture, that is to cut off debate on a pending amendment which \nwould permit voting on a signature alone. This has been a contentious \nsubject because there are those who contend that it ought to be that \neasy for somebody to vote, contrasted with others of us who believe \nthat simply on a signature it is insufficient to avoid fraud.\n  The underlying bill on election reform is a very important bill. \nThere is no need to recount what happened in the Presidential election \nof the year 2000, with special emphasis on Florida, to emphasize the \nneed for reform of the voting process, to bring modern technology into \nplay, to avoid the chads and the dimples, and to find a way to have \nvoters' intent recorded honestly and completely.\n  The drafters of the underlying bill have worked very hard on all \naspects of it, including ways to deal with this question of fraud. They \ncame up with a compromise which said somebody could be accorded the \nright to vote if there was a photo identification, or if the individual \nhad some other document which showed that person was in existence, such \nas a utility bill or a bank statement or a government check or a \ngeneralized provision or any kind of a document which is similar, to \nshow that a voter, ``Mr. John Voter,'' ``Mrs. Jane Voter,'' actually \nwas in existence.\n  The reason for this procedure to avoid fraud is that many people have \nbeen on the rolls who were not in existence: names from decedents, \nnames from nonexistent people, and animals that were represented to be \nnamed people. In an effort to be funny, I think the latter reference \nhas sort of denigrated the subject, which is really very serious.\n  But my view is, the requirement for some document to show that a \nperson is in existence is minimal and necessary. I say that based on \nthe experience I have had as District Attorney of Philadelphia in \nprosecuting vote fraud.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer comes from the State of Delaware, \nwhich is pretty close to Philadelphia. It is widely known that in a \nrough, tough political city, such as Philadelphia, there is a lot of \nvote fraud. It happens to be a fact of life.\n  During my 8 years as District Attorney of Philadelphia, from the \n1960s into the 1970s, I prosecuted many people for vote fraud in both \npolitical parties--Republicans and Democrats. It is a very serious \nproblem.\n  But if you have someone who can vote simply on a signature, then that \nperson can register with a signature. Someone could register as ``Mr. \nJohn Voter'' with a signature, and it being on file on the voters' \nrolls, later they could mail in a vote, ``Mr. John Voter,'' which is \nthe same signature and that person may not be in existence at all.\n  I had a little discussion on Friday with the Senator from Oregon \nabout this subject and made the point that, it is a case which cannot \nbe successfully investigated or cannot be successfully prosecuted. You \nsimply have to have an identity of a person whom you can locate to \nserve a warrant of arrest and to bring into court and to prosecute. But \nif there is no such person as ``Mr. John Voter,'' if it is a name which \nis fictitious, backed up only by the signature on registration or the \nsignature on voting, you simply can't prove it.\n  The Senator from Oregon brought up one illustration: Somebody who \nboasted about having done it. Well, if you have a confession, you can \nprosecute, if you establish the corpus delicti as well, but that is so \nhighly unusual and so unrealistic in dealing with the underlying \nproblem, as not to require extended refutation.\n  On Friday morning, I heard on the radio the voice of the majority \nleader objecting to the position taken that there ought to be some \ndocument identifying the name with the voter, saying that Senator Bond, \nwho has been the major proponent of the position I have articulated--\nthat Senator Bond was insisting on photo ID, which is not the\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\ncase. The underlying bill does not insist on photo ID. If it did, I \nwould have a different position. It requires and insists only on a \ndocument which shows the identity and some document showing the person \nis in existence.\n  I noted the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, was quoted over the \nweekend saying that if his amendment, the one which is pending now on \nthe cloture vote, is not accepted, that we go ahead and pass the \nunderlying bill. It is my hope that the majority leader, who controls \nthe calendar, will leave the bill up and have it passed.\n  Democrats have had a majority on the committee. They reported this \nbill out in its current form, which, as I say, is a carefully crafted \ncompromise. It is my view that the bill in that posture ought to be \nacted upon by the full Senate and ought to be enacted, even if the \nSchumer amendment is not part of the bill because cloture cannot be \nobtained on the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 2937, WITHDRAWN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am about to make a unanimous consent \nrequest on behalf of the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nOregon, so we can move and get to the cloture vote. I thank all of \nthose who have worked over the weekend and all day today. We are down \nto an issue or two--maybe one, frankly. I hope we can resolve that.\n  In order to demonstrate the good faith we have in this effort, I ask \nunanimous consent--and I have spoken with Senator Schumer--that the \nSchumer-Wyden amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, we have made some great progress today. In \nfact, we have pretty much agreed on a package dealing with issues such \nas the uniform standards, the savings clause, and several other items. \nI will not go through them now. I will provide a litany of what we have \nagreed upon afterwards. We are down to maybe the issue of Oregon and \nWashington. In order to get us moving along, and rather than trying to \nwrite that last piece here tonight, we wanted to indicate to our \ncolleagues where we were on this issue. This place works on comity, and \nwe have to rely on good-faith commitments. I am satisfied that what we \nhave agreed to today will be part of a final package. I turn to my \ncolleague now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I thank my good friend from \nConnecticut for withdrawing the Schumer amendment. That is certainly a \nstep in the right direction. I echo his observations that even though, \nafter the cloture vote, I understand we may be going to energy, we are \nclose to passing an election reform bill of which I think Members on \nboth sides of the aisle can feel proud. I have assured my friend from \nConnecticut that we are going to work to pare down the remaining \namendments on our side. I know he is going to be doing the same thing.\n  We believe there are only a few issues that are serious, and, \nhopefully, we will be able to say to the majority leader soon that we \nhave the ability to put together a agreement that we can bring this up \nand, hopefully, dispose of it in half a day.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I know the Senator from Oregon may want to \nmake additional comments. I agree with those sentiments, and our \nmessage would be to both sides and the media that this has been very \nproductive. This is a complicated issue. It obviously involves local \ncommunities, States, up to the Federal Government, in the \ndecisionmaking process.\n  It has not been easy to pull this all together. We are on the brink \nof doing something very worthwhile, something very historic, as we both \ndescribed over the last number of months. The decision to set this \naside while we move to energy--normally one might say that is a death \nknell. I have been assured by the majority leader, who cares deeply \nabout this issue, that as soon as we have a package that we can bring \nforward, which I am convinced we can, we will get to that matter and \nresolve it.\n  This is not putting it on a side track where it will languish in the \ncoming weeks. We intend to work intensely over the next several days to \nbring back an agreement, hopefully the end of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to mention to my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle the vote we are about to have at 6:15 p.m, \nhopefully, will be the same vote. It is a vote to oppose cloture, even \nthough we are toward the end of this bill. The reason is, we have not \nbeen able to figure out which of our amendments will be shut out by the \ninvocation of cloture. I urge my Republican colleagues to, once again, \nvote no on cloture, while at the same time saying I think we are very \nclose to wrapping up this bill, as the Senator from Connecticut and I \nhave previously outlined tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to yield to our colleague from New \nYork, whose amendment I just withdrew on his behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky controls the \nremainder of the time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky controls the time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield a minute and a half to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I do not mind if the Senator from Oregon speaks first \nfor 1 minute. He needs another minute, and I will take the remaining 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The remaining time I have I yield in equal division to \nthe Senators from Oregon and New York.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Kentucky. I will \nbe brief. I want it understood tonight that in the withdrawal of this \namendment, I am doing this as part of a good-faith effort to find \ncommon ground with my colleagues. The people of Oregon feel so strongly \nabout this issue that I could not let this bill go to final passage \nuntil it protects Oregon's election rights, but I would like to advance \nthe consideration of the legislation by this body. That is why I am not \nobjecting tonight.\n  Senator Smith and I will continue to work with our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to address this issue. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, if the Senator from Connecticut has not \nasked unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment, I do, or concur in \nthat request.\n  I wish to make three points. First, it is the strong view of those of \nus on this side--certainly of me--that while this amendment has a great \ndeal of merit, the bill is more important than the amendment. I am \nwilling to withdraw it not because I think any deal was broken; it was \nclearly not. We all had agreed there would be amendments and, in fact, \nit is our side's understanding there was an agreement that the Gregg \namendment would be accepted and there would be a vote without a \nfilibuster. That was explicit. If anything, if any deal was broken, it \nwas done on the other side.\n\n  Two, the amendment is an important amendment because there are, as I \nmentioned in my speeches, hundreds of thousands of people, if not \nmillions, for whom it will be much harder to vote. This amendment would \nhave made it easier for them to vote without increasing fraud by very \nmuch. We believe in the amendment, and we will try to deal with this \nissue in some other way, in some other form.\n  Third, the bill is an excellent bill. The Senator from Connecticut, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from Missouri, and myself have \nspent a great deal of time on it. It will improve elections. It will do \na lot to prevent the Floridas from happening and the 2000s from \nhappening. I think it would be wrong to let the entire bill go down \nbecause of this worthy amendment. Therefore, I have no problem in \nwithdrawing it to move the bill forward. That is something each of us \nis called upon to do: To see things go forward for the legislative \nprocess and avoid gridlock.\n  I will withdraw the amendment if it has not been withdrawn already. \nIf it has, I concur in the withdrawal.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been withdrawn.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time of 6:15 \np.m. having arrived, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on S. 565, the \n     election reform bill:\n         Christopher Dodd, Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, Ron Wyden, \n           Debbie Stabenow, Patty Murray, Tom Daschle, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Daniel Inouye, Carl Levin, Max Baucus, Joe \n           Biden, Pat Leahy, James M.

Madam President, I am sure I share the disappointment of \na number of our colleagues in our inability to come to some closure on \nthis legislation. But I will say the good news is the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut, the manager of the bill, and the Senator from \nKentucky, his co- manager, have agreed to continue to attempt to work \nout what remaining differences exist.\n  I will also say, because so much good work has been done, it is my \nstrong desire to bring this bill to a successful completion. We are \ngoing to do that. I have made a commitment to Senator Dodd and to all \nof our colleagues that at such time as we have been able to work out \nprocedurally a way to resolve these final matters, we will bring the \nbill back under a unanimous consent agreement.\n  So when that unanimous consent agreement is reached, it is my desire \nand my commitment to renew the debate on this issue. This is too \nimportant to let go. It is too important not to find some final \nresolution to the remaining questions.\n  We spent a lot of time on this bill. I don't want to lose that \ninvestment in time and effort. Obviously, the stakes are quite high. We \nrecognize those stakes. We recognize the effort made. We recognize the \nprogress we have made in the last couple of weeks. We are just not \nquite there yet.\n  But as I have noted on several occasions, it is my strong desire to \ngo to the energy bill. That will be what we do tomorrow. I hope \nSenators will be prepared to come to the floor midmorning, 10 o'clock. \nWe will begin the debate on energy. I am sure there will be opening \nstatements, and we will begin entertaining amendments. I hope Senators \nare prepared to have a good debate about energy. We will hopefully \nresolve that issue and move to other questions.\n  It is my expectation that if some agreement has not yet been reached \non the campaign finance reform bill, I will be asking unanimous consent \nto take that up as well. It will be the only thing that would take us \noff the energy bill prior to the time we complete it. But my hope is we \ncan reach some agreement procedurally on the campaign finance reform \nbill as well. If not, of course, when we resolve these issues, if we \ncan resolve them, on energy, my intention is to move to the campaign \nfinance reform bill.\n  So we have a full agenda over the course of the next 3 weeks. Energy \nbegins tomorrow. Hopefully campaign finance reform and election reform \ncan also be addressed successfully before we complete our work in this \nwork period.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, every February our Nation celebrates Black \nHistory Month to recognize the contributions that African Americans \nhave made to America. It provides us with a special time to commemorate \nthe accomplishments of African Americans and reflect upon their role in \nour country's diversity and growth. I believe it is important to \nacknowledge the vision of leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and Thurgood Marshall and the efforts of countless \nothers who struggled to bring down the barriers of inequality in this \ncountry. They confronted enormous obstacles to make life better for \nfuture generations and for all Americans.\n  As we reflect upon our Nation's history, we see that America has made \ngreat strides in improving the status of ethnic and racial minorities. \nToday African Americans are leaders in our communities, the arts and \nsciences, and the business world. We no longer accept legal \ndiscrimination in any form. We no longer allow the use of poll taxes \nthat prohibited African Americans from voting. And we no longer \ntolerate discrimination in public accommodations, such as water \nfountains, lunch counters or movie houses reserved for whites only.\n  While taking pride in how far we have come, we must recall the \npainful memories of segregation and intolerance in the not so distant \npast. Up until the 1950's, casinos and hotels in my own State of \nNevada, like many public accommodations did not welcome blacks. But \nwhen the Moulin Rouge opened its doors in Las Vegas in 1955, African \nAmericans were received warmly. There they could find lodging, enjoy \nthe casino and see the best entertainers of the day. The Moulin Rouge \nbecame one of our Nation's first major interracial hotels and paved the \nway for the integration of all of Nevada's\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\ncasinos. I support efforts to preserve the Moulin Rouge as an important \npart of African American history in Southern Nevada.\n  In addition to making political and social gains, blacks are now \nenjoying unprecedented economic success. African-American unemployment \nand poverty levels are at record lows. There continues to be a \nsignificant rise in African American home ownership and a dramatic \nincrease in loans to African American entrepreneurs.\n  Despite all of our progress as a society expanding opportunities for \nall, I know we can do better. We still have more work to do and more \nchallenges we shall overcome.\n  The population of blacks and other minorities continues to increase \nand flourish across America, but African Americans often lack the \nservices and resources they need to receive a quality education and in \nturn to achieve a better place in society. Nearly half a century after \nBrown v. Board of Education, most minority students still attend \nschools that are predominantly minority. On average, they are in larger \nclasses, use older books, receive less challenging lessons and have \nteachers with less training in the subject being taught.\n  Fortunately, Congress passed a bipartisan ``Leave No Child Behind'' \neducation reform package, which became law this year to correct these \ninequities by making sure that well-trained teachers are in every \nclassroom, setting higher standards for all students and providing \nschools with the resources to meet these new standards. To continue \nimproving the quality of education and expanding opportunities for all \nAmericans, our next step must be to raise the standards for safety, \ncharacter and discipline in our schools.\n\n  Although our nation has made substantial progress, blacks still lag \nbehind financially and are disproportionately represented among \nAmerica's poor. Congress should increase the minimum wage not only to \nhelp youths and African Americans but all of our Nation's citizens, \nespecially working single mothers, better meet the needs of their \nfamilies. In addition, providing unemployment and health care benefits \nfor those who have been hindered by the recession, will help dislocated \nworkers and their families get back on their feet and continue to \nimprove their lives. We also need to find creative, effective ways to \nnarrow the earnings gap between whites and African Americans.\n  Making these improvements will take the dedication of all Americans. \nBlack History Month is an appropriate time to recognize those helping \nAmerica move forward. I would like to pay particular tribute to some \nwho are leading the way in northern Nevada:\n  Delores Feemster has been a activist in Washoe County for many years \nworking for the underdog, organizing voter registration efforts in \nblack churches, and inspiring members of younger generations to make a \ndifference. In fact, her son Lonnie got involved in social activism \nduring his youth and now serves as president of the Reno-Sparks chapter \nof the NAACP.\n  Evelyn Mount started a food program many years ago before any social \nservices agencies offered this kind of help and has provided thousands \nof Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners to needy families of every color.\n  Bertha Mullins has worked in the community on equal employment and \nhousing issues for many years.\n  Bernice Martin Mathews has been a leader in improving access to \nquality health care and serves as the assistant minority leader in the \nState Senate.\n  I would also like to acknowledge some African American leaders from \nsouthern Nevada:\n  Shirley Barber, who for over 40 years as a teacher, principal and now \nas a Clark County School Board Trustee has served students and \nencouraged greater parental involvement in education;\n  Yvonne Atkinson Gates, a Clark County Commissioner who was recently \nelected to chair the Democratic National Committee's Black Caucus;\n  Joe Neal, the longest serving African American member of the Nevada \nSenate; and\n  Lt. Col. (Ret.) Thomas Leigh, long active in senior issues, who has \nserved on various State commissions and led an AARP chapter in West Las \nVegas.\n  I am proud of these Nevadans and others like them across the country \nworking to promote equality and diversity.\n  They have toiled for a better life for African Americans and indeed \nfor all Americans, and their work makes our state and our nation \nbetter.\n  Although Black History Month officially ends when February does, let \nus continue to celebrate the achievements of African Americans each and \nevery day. Our efforts to recover from the tribulations of September 11 \nremind us that by working together we become a stronger America. We \nmust join together and continue fighting to make sure that all \nAmericans enjoy equal opportunities for justice, quality education, and \neconomic prosperity.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, last month we celebrated Black \nHistory Month in the United States, and I took to the floor each week \nwe were in session to speak for a moment or two about the tribulations \nand contributions of Black Oregonians.\n  I want to make one more statement, however, since recognition of \nthese contributions really cannot, and should not, be confined to any \nsingle month of the year. We must not spend the next eleven months \noblivious to the monumental strides and invaluable contributions that \nblack Americans have made since the birth of our Nation. The \nindividuals who opened the west and helped build my State, people like \nMoses Harris, George Washington Bush, and York, must not remain obscure \ncharacters in the annals of Oregon history. Countless other men and \nwomen, who never achieved prominence, are also owed our gratitude for \nhelping make Oregon, and America, a better home for all her citizens.\n  The efforts of black Americans have helped Oregon shed the days when \nit was marked by racial intolerance and exclusion. When my predecessor, \nformer-U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield, was a State senator, he was forced \nto take the great opera singer Marian Anderson to Portland because no \nhotels in Salem would serve a black woman. Thankfully, now Salem not \nonly hosts black women in hotels, but in the State senate as well. We \nhave come a long way as a State and as a people, and we should be \ngrateful.\n  In the decades following the passage of the Fair Employment Practices \nAct in 1949 and the State Public Accommodations Act in 1953, Oregon \nbegan slowly to address some of the other problems still facing black \nOregonians, such as discrimination in housing and segregation in the \npublic schools. Also of note, in 1969, Portland State established a \nBlack Studies Program. In 1972 the first black person, William McCoy, \nwas elected to the State legislature, and in 1980, Oregon crowned her \nfirst black Rose Festival Queen, Robin Marks. All along, organizations \nsuch as the NAACP and Urban League have been helping to guide my \nState's progress.\n  Not all difficulties facing black Oregonians have been resolved, \nhowever. While most students are benefitting from a successful \nstatewide battle to reduce school dropout rates, black students are \nstill dropping out in large numbers, and at the same rate they have for \nthe past three years, 11 percent, compared with a 4.5 percent dropout \nrate for white students. There are economic distinctions as well, a \nblack Oregonian is more than twice as likely to be poor than a white \nOregonian. These and other disparities are not merely coincidences, and \nwe have much work ahead of us if we are to change the circumstances \nthat contribute to current racial inequalities in Oregon.\n  Still, the trend for all Oregonians has been positive over our \nState's history, and I see nothing but progress in our future. Oregon \nhas had strong black leaders since the Lewis and Clark expedition, and \na history of overcoming obstacles much more daunting than what we face \ntoday. Today, Oregon is home to a diverse and prosperous citizenry made \nup of people from every conceivable background and racial composition. \nWhile our Constitution used to prevent black Americans from moving to \nour State, Oregon now has a growing minority population that fuels our \neconomy, and enriches our local culture. This might never have been \npossible without the efforts of early black pioneers, and the thousands \nof black Americans who came to Oregon in the\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\nmiddle of the last century, bringing with them a thirst for equality, \nand the wherewithal to achieve it.\n  We should not celebrate the contributions of black Americans for just \none month. The lives we lead 365 days a year have been shaped by \nindividuals and groups who have changed America, and Oregon, forever. \nOur lives are richer and freer because of the contributions of black \nOregonians, and I, for one, will remember that year round.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 3, \n1993 in Lincoln, NE. A gay man, Harold Grover, 51, was stabbed and \nbeaten to death by two men. The attackers, Eldon T. Leger and Clifford \nA. Privat, both 19, were charged with first-degree murder in connection \nwith the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1419-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TRIBUTE TO GEORGETOWN COLLEGE FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe players and coaches of the 2001 Georgetown College football team.\n  On December 15, 2001, the Georgetown College Tigers defeated the \nUniversity of Sioux Falls by a score of 49-27 to win the 46th Annual \nNAIA Football National Championship. Under the expert leadership of \ncoach Bill Cronin, the Tigers finished with a perfect 14-0 record for \nthe second straight year and became only the 9th team in NAIA history \nto win consecutive National Championship titles. Clearly, this is a \nremarkable accomplishment.\n  Although the Bluegrass State is widely known for producing great \nbasketball teams, the Georgetown College Tigers are doing their very \nbest to let the Nation know that Kentucky is also the home of great \nfootball. This season's victory marks the third time the Tigers have \nclaimed the national title and caps a remarkable 28-game winning \nstreak. In addition to bringing home another national championship in \n2001, the Tigers also captured their fourth straight Mid-South \nConference title. Through hard work, determination, and skill, this \nteam has established itself as a football powerhouse.\n  It should also be noted for the record that in addition to being star \nathletes, these players are also dedicated students. Georgetown College \nhas a long standing history of academic excellence and has been rated \nby U.S. News & World Report as one of the Nation's top liberal arts \ncolleges for the last seven years. During the 2001 season, the Tigers \nproved they could juggle the intense responsibility of being student-\nathletes. As a result, 15 Tigers were named Mid-South Conference \nScholar-Athletes.\n  I want to congratulate the Tigers for their tremendous success. They \nhave made the State of Kentucky very proud. I ask each of my colleagues \nto join me in honoring Georgetown College, history-making coach Billy \nCronin, and most importantly each and every talented player on the 2001 \nChampionship Tiger team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1419-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BARBARA F. WEAVER\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant in Rhode Island, Barbara F. Weaver, who is \nretiring from her position as Chief Information Officer for Rhode \nIsland's Office of Library Services after a long and distinguished \ncareer.\n  With an impressive background in libraries and government, Barbara \ncame to Rhode Island as the new Director of the Department of State \nLibrary Services in 1991. During her tenure she has made a significant \ncontribution. She is credited with expanding the information role of \nthe Department into the Office of Library and Information Services, and \nwith the creation of that office, she has the distinction of becoming \nRhode Island's first Chief Information Officer.\n  A leader in the library and information management worlds, Barbara \nhas been responsible for coordinating the state's management \ninformation systems and coordinating library services to state \ngovernment and to libraries throughout the state. She is credited with \nthe creation of RI.gov, the state's World Wide web portal, and setting \nthe stage for e-government in Rhode Island. She successfully brought \nRhode Island through the y2k phenomenon without incident and has \nefficiently and effectively been in the forefront of new technologies.\n  Barbara has also been active nationally as evidenced through her work \nwith organizations like the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies \nand the National Association of Chief Information Officers. Her vision, \ninitiative and professionalism are indeed noteworthy, and I have been \nproud to work closely with this outstanding professional on legislative \ninitiatives geared to enhancing literacy, technology and accessibility.\n  Rhode Islanders have been fortunate to have Barbara Weaver devote \nnearly a decade of service to our community. She has increased public \nand government awareness of the value of library services and leaves a \nlasting legacy of significant achievements which have brought library \nand information policy boldly into the new century.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Barbara Weaver for her \nprofessionalism, unwavering commitment, and inspired vision. I am \nhonored to join others in my state in offering praise and admiration of \na grateful community for all her great work.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nRichard Weldon upon his retirement from the New Castle Conservation \nDistrict Board of Supervisors. Dick served on the Board for twenty-\nthree years. He has been a respected colleague and remains a trusted \nfriend.\n  In his twenty-two years as Board Vice Chair, Dick was an effective \nliaison between Delaware's State legislature and State agencies, \npromoting water and soil conservation. He was a strong advocate for the \nrole of conservation districts and the driving force behind the \nconstruction of a new conservation office for the New Castle \nConservation District and the U.S. Department of Agriculture agencies.\n  I had the pleasure of serving alongside Dick's brother, Curt Weldon, \nin the House of Representatives from 1987 to 1992. We all share a \npassion for protecting the environment, an enthusiasm that ensured we \nremained focused over the years to protecting our area's historic and \nopen spaces. Together, we worked across party lines to ensure that a \nbalance between progress and preservation was struck. Today that \nbalance appears precarious without Dick.\n  Dick held a position of leadership within the National Association of \nConservation Districts for many years. As Delaware's Governor, I \nappointed Dick to the Soil and Water Advisory Council. He was also \nChair of the Coastal and Urban Committee from 1994 to 1997.\n  Dick led the Committee to hold the National Urban Conservation \nConference, the first successful coordination of Federal agencies with \nurban conservation programs. His leadership brought Federal agencies to \nthe table, harvesting the support of the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency, the National Resource Conservation Service, and the Federal \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. The successful conference \npooled their interests, goals and resources and resulted in efficient \nand productive initiatives.\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\n  After thirty-eight years of service, Mr. Weldon retired from Star \nEnterprises in 1993, having also retired as regional chair of the \nRepublican Committee in Delaware in 1978.\n  Dick and his wife Fay continue to be active members in their \ncommunity, particularly within their church. The joy of their four \nchildren and nine grandchildren will undoubtedly keep their days full.\n  Richard Weldon defined his career working for clean and practical \nenergy solutions, earning a reputation for promoting conservation while \nprotecting resources. Upon his retirement he leaves a legacy of \ncommitment to public service for both his children and grandchildren \nand the generations that will follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1420-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BEVERLY LAFFERTY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nBeverly Lafferty of Rapid City, SD. On March 1, 2002, Bev retired from \nChild Protection Services after 34 years of dedication to the children \nand families in my home State of South Dakota.\n  Bev began her career as a child protection social worker in Rapid \nCity on July 1, 1968. Her gentle nature and caring heart have helped \nmany families in South Dakota through the adoption process. As a \nfounding member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have had \nthe honor of nominating Bev for the coalition's annual Angels in \nAdoption awards. Bev is an example to our entire Nation of the joys \nassociated with adoption, and I commend her work, especially her \ndevotion to Native American children and families.\n  Adoptive parents, judges, social workers, and others involved with \nthe adoption process truly are angels who do not gain the recognition \nthey deserve on a day to day basis. Bev's recognition as an ``Angel in \nAdoption'' in 2001 was one way for me to help recognize the important \ncontributions Bev makes to the lives of children and to our \ncommunities.\n  As a parent, I know the challenges and joys of raising a family, and \nthat is why I have made it one of my priorities in Congress to make \nadoptions easier for families. Bev's work in Rapid City has made the \nadoption process easier for children and families in that community. \nAlthough I know that she will be missed, her impact in the adoption \ncommunity will be felt for many years to come. I wish her all the best \nas she moves on to enjoy the next phase of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1420-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1420-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1420-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 4, 2002, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1206.

A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nto increase the Government contribution for Federal employee health \ninsurance; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Improvement Act of 2002 along with my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes. This bill would reduce the \nemployee portion of premiums costs under the Federal Employee Health \nBenefits Plan.\n  Our Federal employees work hard for the American people and they \ndeserve quality benefits.\n  What is the need for this legislation?\n  Health insurance premiums for Federal employees and retirees rose an \naverage of 13.3 percent this year. In contrast, wages rose by 4.77 \npercent in the Washington-Baltimore area. This follows a 10.5 percent \nincrease last year, and increases of greater than 9 percent for 2000 \nand 1999. As a result, premiums are nearly 50 percent greater than they \nwere just five years ago.\n  The Federal program provides health insurance coverage to about 9 \nmillion government workers, retirees and family members. More than \n800,000 of these workers live in the DC metro area.\n  Health insurance costs are skyrocketing, and Federal employees are \npaying a greater share of their take home pay for health care each \nyear. Currently, Federal employees pay anywhere between 28 percent to \n30 percent of premiums. In the private sector, other large employers \npay at least 80 percent of premiums and employees pay 20 percent \naccording to recent data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nand the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n  How would this bill help solve this problem?\n  This bill would change the financing formula for Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program (FEHBP). Under this approach, the federal \nagencies would pay 80 percent of the weighted average for premiums. \nThis would help reduce the out-of-pocket health care costs for federal \nemployees and improve the affordability of FEHBP immensely.\n  What would this mean to Federal employees?\n  My bill would help improve the affordability of health care insurance \nfor all 9 million. Currently, about 250,000 Federal employees do not \nhave health insurance. Many of them cannot afford health care insurance \nat the current rates. My proposal would improve the affordability of \nhealth care insurance so that many of these workers would be able to \nafford coverage.\n  Providing quality benefits for Federal employees is also an important \ntool in helping recruit and retain a high quality workforce and compete \nwith the private sector and other state and local governments.\n  This bill would have an enormous impact in my State, Maryland, but \nwould also benefit Federal workers nationally. Under this proposal, the \npercent that a Federal employee pays in health insurance premiums would \ndecline, putting more money into Federal employees pockets each pay \nperiod.\n  This bill improves benefits for our hardworking Federal employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUNNING:\n  S. 1984.

You have been a friend in \n     our mutual concerns about routing out terror around the \n     world,'' and, ``I look forward to the Olympics. It's going to \n     be a magnificent moment for the sporting world to have the \n     Olympics return to Athens. I'm confident your country will do \n     a fine job'';\n       Whereas as a member of NATO, Greece has assigned members of \n     its air force to fly surveillance missions over the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Greece is a stabilizing force by virtue of its \n     political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region, \n     is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, and will \n     hold the presidency of the European Union in 2003;\n       Whereas Greece, geographically located in a region where \n     Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent \n     relations with Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas Greece has had extraordinary success in recent \n     years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing \n     tensions between Greece and Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2002, marks the 181st anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2002, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nalong with 52 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 2002, as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''\n  One hundred and eighty one years ago, the Greek people began the \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient \nGreeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme \npower to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew \nheavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient \nGreece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson \nproclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for \nthe light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, \nthen, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of \ntheir efforts to return to that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been passed by the Senate since 1984 with overwhelming \nsupport. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1423-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1423-S1424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 215--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING MARCH 17, 2002, \n                    AS ``NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Frist, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Specter, and Mr. Voinovich) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, events of the day may turn our attention \noverseas, but it is essential to remember those who are fighting an \nongoing battle right here at home. This battle has been raging for \ngenerations and consists of fighting to protect this Nation's most \nvaluable resource: our children. Youth are the future of the Nation; \nthey need to be both valued and protected. Sadly, however, as my \ncolleagues know, this precious resource is threatened daily.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to talk about a tremendous \ninitiative between the public and private sector that has been reaching \nout to youth for nearly twenty years. Project Safe Place is a program \nthat was developed to assist our Nation's youth and families in crisis. \nThis partnership creates a network of private businesses trained to \nrefer youth in need to the local service providers who can help them. \nThose businesses display a Safe Place sign so that young people can \neasily recognize a ``safe place'' for them to go to receive help.\n  In his State of the Union Address President Bush called for every \nAmerican to commit at least two years or 4,000 hours to the service of \nneighbors and our Nation. The goal of National Safe Place Week is to \nrecognize the thousands of individuals who work to make Project Safe \nPlace a reality. From trained volunteers to seasoned professionals, \nthese dedicated individuals are working together with the resources in \ntheir local communities and through their ties across the Nation, to \nserve young people. Because of Project Safe Place, this all happens \nunder a well-known symbol of safety for in-crisis youth.\n  Project Safe Place is a simple program to implement in any local \ncommunity, and it works. Young people are more likely to seek help in \nlocations that are familiar and non-threatening to them. By creating a \nnetwork of Safe Places across the nation, all youth would have access \nto needed help, counseling, or a safe place to stay. However, while the \nprogram has already been established in 39 States, there are still too \nmany communities that don't know about this valuable youth resource.\n  If your State does not already have a Safe Place organization, please \nconsider facilitating this worthwhile resource so that young people who \nare abused, neglected, or whose futures are jeopardized by physical or \nemotional trauma will have access to immediate help and safety in your \ncommunity. To create more Project Safe Place sites in Idaho, the staff \nin three of my State offices have gone through the training to make \nthem Safe Place sites, and now have the skills and ability to assist \ntroubled youth. In the next five years, Project Safe Place hopes that \nevery child in America will have the opportunity to connect with \nsomeone who can provide immediate help by easily recognizing the Safe \nPlace sign.\n  I look forward to the U.S. Senate passing this resolution and \ndesignating the week of March 17-23, 2002 as National Safe Place Week. \nThis action will recognize the importance of Project Safe Place and \nsend a message that we will keep working to protect our children. As we \nsaw following the tragic events of September 11, volunteers truly do \nmake a difference every day, and in passing this resolution, the Senate \nwill be applauding the tireless efforts of the thousands of dedicated \nvolunteers across the Nation for their many contributions to the youth \nof our Nation through Project Safe Place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/04/senate-section/article/S1424-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2966.

Mr. President, I was interested the other day when I \nheard that the de facto ruler, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah, \nmade a statement which was received by many in this country as if it \nwere a statement of fact, as if it were something new, a\n\n[[Page S1428]]\n\nconcept for peace in the Middle East that no one had ever heard of \nbefore. I was kind of shocked that it was so well received by many \npeople who had been down this road before.\n  I suggest to you that what Crown Prince Abdullah talked about a few \ndays ago was not new at all. He talked about the fact that under the \nAbdullah plan, Arabs would normalize relations with Israel in exchange \nfor the Jewish state surrendering the territory it received after the \n1976 Six-Day War as if that were something new. He went on to talk \nabout other land that had been acquired and had been taken by Israel.\n  I remember so well on December 4 when we covered all of this and the \nfact that there isn't anything new about the prospect of giving up land \nthat is rightfully Israel's land in order to have peace.\n  When it gets right down to it, the land doesn't make that much \ndifference because Yasser Arafat and others don't recognize Israel's \nright to any of the land. They do not recognize Israel's right to \nexist.\n  I will discuss seven reasons, which I mentioned once before, why \nIsrael is entitled to the land they have and that it should not be a \npart of the peace process.\n  If this is something that Israel wants to do, it is their business to \ndo it. But anyone who has tried to put the pressure on Israel to do \nthis is wrong.\n  We are going to be hit by skeptics who are going to say we will be \nattacked because of our support for Israel, and if we get out of the \nMiddle East--that is us--all the problems will go away. That is just \nnot true. If we withdraw, all of these problems will again come to our \ndoor.\n  I have some observations to make about that. But I would like to \nreemphasize once again the seven reasons that Israel has the right to \ntheir land.\n  The first reason is that Israel has the right to the land because of \nall of the archeological evidence. That is reason, No. 1. All the \narcheological evidence supports it.\n  Every time there is a dig in Israel, it does nothing but support the \nfact that Israelis have had a presence there for 3,000 years. They have \nbeen there for a long time. The coins, the cities, the pottery, the \nculture--there are other people, groups that are there, but there is no \nmistaking the fact that Israelis have been present in that land for \n3,000 years.\n  It predates any claims that other peoples in the regions may have. \nThe ancient Philistines are extinct. Many other ancient peoples are \nextinct. They do not have the unbroken line to this date that the \nIsraelis have.\n  Even the Egyptians of today are not racial Egyptians of 2,000, 3,000 \nyears ago. They are primarily an Arab people. The land is called Egypt, \nbut they are not the same racial and ethnic stock as the old Egyptians \nof the ancient world. The first Israelis are in fact descended from the \noriginal Israelites. The first proof, then, is the archeology.\n  The second proof of Israel's right to the land is the historic right. \nHistory supports it totally and completely. We know there has been an \nIsrael up until the time of the Roman Empire. The Romans conquered the \nland. Israel had no homeland, although Jews were allowed to live there. \nThey were driven from the land in two dispersions: One was in 70 A,.D. \nand the other was in 135 A.D. But there was always a Jewish presence in \nthe land.\n  The Turks, who took over about 700 years ago and ruled the land up \nuntil about World War I, had control. Then the land was conquered by \nthe British. The Turks entered World War I on the side of Germany. The \nBritish knew they had to do something to punish Turkey, and also to \nbreak up that empire that was going to be a part of the whole effort of \nGermany in World War I. So the British sent troops against the Turks in \nthe Holy Land.\n  One of the generals who was leading the British armies was a man \nnamed Allenby. Allenby was a Bible-believing Christian. He carried a \nBible with him everywhere he went and he knew the significance of \nJerusalem.\n  The night before the attack against Jerusalem to drive out the Turks, \nAllenby prayed that God would allow him to capture the city without \ndoing damage to the holy places.\n  That day, Allenby sent World War I biplanes over the city of \nJerusalem to do a reconnaissance mission. You have to understand that \nthe Turks had at that time never seen an airplane. So there they were, \nflying around. They looked in the sky and saw these fascinating \ninventions and did not know what they were, and they were terrified by \nthem. Then they were told they were going to be opposed by a man named \nAllenby the next day, which means, in their language, ``man sent from \nGod'' or ``prophet from God.'' They dared not fight against a prophet \nfrom God, so the next morning, when Allenby went to take Jerusalem, he \nwent in and captured it without firing a single shot.\n\n  The British Government was grateful to Jewish people around the \nworld, particularly to one Jewish chemist who helped them manufacture \nniter. Niter is an ingredient that was used in nitroglycerin which was \nsent over from the New World. But they did not have a way of getting it \nto England. The German U-boats were shooting on the boats, so most of \nthe niter they were trying to import to make nitroglycerin was at the \nbottom of the ocean. But a man named Weitzman, a Jewish chemist, \ndiscovered a way to make it from materials that existed in England. As \na result, they were able to continue that supply.\n  The British at that time said they were going to give the Jewish \npeople a homeland. That is all a part of history. It is all written \ndown in history. They were gratified that the Jewish people, the \nbankers, came through and helped finance the war.\n  The homeland that Britain said it would set aside consisted of all of \nwhat is now Israel and all of what was then the nation of Jordan--the \nwhole thing. That was what Britain promised to give the Jews in 1917.\n  In the beginning, there was some Arab support for this action. There \nwas not a huge Arab population in the land at that time, and there is a \nreason for that. The land was not able to sustain a large population of \npeople. It just did not have the development it needed to handle those \npeople, and the land was not really wanted by anybody. Nobody really \nwanted this land. It was considered to be worthless land.\n  I want the Presiding Officer to hear what Mark Twain said. And, of \ncourse, you may have read ``Huckleberry Finn'' and ``Tom Sawyer.'' Mark \nTwain--Samuel Clemens--took a tour of Palestine in 1867. This is how he \ndescribed that land. We are talking about Israel now. He said:\n\n       A desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given \n     over wholly to weeds. A silent, mournful expanse. We never \n     saw a human being on the whole route. There was hardly a tree \n     or a shrub anywhere. Even the olive and the cactus, those \n     fast friends of a worthless soil, had almost deserted the \n     country.\n\n  Where was this great Palestinian nation? It did not exist. It was not \nthere. Palestinians were not there. Palestine was a region named by the \nRomans, but at that time it was under the control of Turkey, and there \nwas no large mass of people there because the land would not support \nthem.\n  This is the report that the Palestinian Royal Commission, created by \nthe British, made. It quotes an account of the conditions on the \ncoastal plain along the Mediterranean Sea in 1913. This is the \nPalestinian Royal Commission. They said:\n\n       The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer \n     track, suitable for transport by camels or carts. No orange \n     groves, orchards or vineyards were to be seen until one \n     reached the Yavnev village. Houses were mud. Schools did not \n     exist. The western part toward the sea was almost a desert. \n     The villages in this area were few and thinly populated. Many \n     villages were deserted by their inhabitants.\n\n  That was 1913.\n  The French author Voltaire described Palestine as ``a hopeless, \ndreary place.''\n\n  In short, under the Turks the land suffered from neglect and low \npopulation. That is a historic fact. The nation became populated by \nboth Jews and Arabs because the land came to prosper when Jews came \nback and began to reclaim it. Historically, they began to reclaim it. \nIf there had never been any archaeological evidence to support the \nrights of the Israelis to the territory, it is also important to \nrecognize that other nations in the area have no longstanding claim to \nthe country either.\n  Did you know that Saudi Arabia was not created until 1913, Lebanon \nuntil\n\n[[Page S1429]]\n\n1920? Iraq did not exist as a nation until 1932, Syria until 1941; the \nborders of Jordan were established in 1946 and Kuwait in 1961. Any of \nthese nations that would say Israel is only a recent arrival would have \nto deny their own rights as recent arrivals as well. They did not exist \nas countries. They were all under the control of the Turks.\n  Historically, Israel gained its independence in 1948.\n  The third reason that land belongs to Israel is the practical value \nof the Israelis being there. Israel today is a modern marvel of \nagriculture. Israel is able to bring more food out of a desert \nenvironment than any other country in the world. The Arab nations ought \nto make Israel their friend and import technology from Israel that \nwould allow all the Middle East, not just Israel, to become an exporter \nof food. Israel has unarguable success in its agriculture.\n  The fourth reason I believe Israel has the right to the land is on \nthe grounds of humanitarian concern. You see, there were 6 million Jews \nslaughtered in Europe in World War II. The persecution against the Jews \nhad been very strong in Russia since the advent of communism. It was \nagainst them even before then under the Czars.\n  These people have a right to their homeland. If we are not going to \nallow them a homeland in the Middle East, then where? What other nation \non Earth is going to cede territory, is going to give up land?\n  They are not asking for a great deal. The whole nation of Israel \nwould fit into my home State of Oklahoma seven times. It would fit into \nthe Presiding Officer's State of Georgia seven times. They are not \nasking for a great deal. The whole nation of Israel is very small. It \nis a nation that, up until the time that claims started coming in, was \nnot desired by anybody.\n  The fifth reason Israel ought to have their land is that she is a \nstrategic ally of the United States. Whether we realize it or not, \nIsrael is a detriment, an impediment, to certain groups hostile to \ndemocracies and hostile to what we believe in, hostile to that which \nmakes us the greatest nation in the history of the world. They have \nkept them from taking complete control of the Middle East. If it were \nnot for Israel, they would overrun the region. They are our strategic \nally.\n  It is good to know we have a friend in the Middle East on whom we can \ncount. They vote with us in the United Nations more than England, more \nthan Canada, more than France, more than Germany--more than any other \ncountry in the world.\n  The sixth reason is that Israel is a roadblock to terrorism. The war \nwe are now facing is not against a sovereign nation; it is against a \ngroup of terrorists who are very fluid, moving from one country to \nanother. They are almost invisible. That is whom we are fighting \nagainst today. We need every ally we can get. If we do not stop \nterrorism in the Middle East, it will be on our shores. We have said \nthis again and again and again, and it is true.\n\n  One of the reasons I believe the spiritual door was opened for an \nattack against the United States of America is that the policy of our \nGovernment has been to ask the Israelis, and demand it with pressure, \nnot to retaliate in a significant way against the terrorist strikes \nthat have been launched against them.\n  Since its independence in 1948, Israel has fought four wars: The war \nin 1948 and 1949--that was the war for independence--the war in 1956, \nthe Sinai campaign; the Six-Day War in 1967; and in 1973, the Yom \nKippur War, the holiest day of the year, and that was with Egypt and \nSyria.\n  You have to understand that in all four cases, Israel was attacked. \nThey were not the aggressor. Some people may argue that this was not \ntrue because they went in first in 1956, but they knew at that time \nthat Egypt was building a huge military to become the aggressor. \nIsrael, in fact, was not the aggressor and has not been the aggressor \nin any of the four wars.\n  Also, they won all four wars against impossible odds. They are great \nwarriors. They consider a level playing field being outnumbered 2 to 1.\n  There were 39 Scud missiles that landed on Israeli soil during the \ngulf war. Our President asked Israel not to respond. In order to have \nthe Arab nations on board, we asked Israel not to participate in the \nwar. They showed tremendous restraint and did not. Now we have asked \nthem to stand back and not do anything over these last several attacks.\n  We have criticized them. We have criticized them in our media. Local \npeople in television and radio often criticize Israel, not knowing the \ntrue facts. We need to be informed.\n  I was so thrilled when I heard a reporter pose a question to our \nSecretary of State, Colin Powell. He said:\n\n       Mr. Powell, the United States has advocated a policy of \n     restraint in the Middle East. We have discouraged Israel from \n     retaliation again and again and again because we've said it \n     leads to continued escalation--that it escalates the \n     violence. Are we going to follow that preaching ourselves?\n\n  Mr. Powell indicated we would strike back. In other words, we can \ntell Israel not to do it, but when it hits us, we are going to do \nsomething.\n  But all that changed in December when the Israelis went into the Gaza \nwith gunships and into the West Bank with F-16s. With the exception of \nlast May, the Israelis had not used F-16s since the 1967 6-Day War. And \nI am so proud of them because we have to stop terrorism. It is not \ngoing to go away. If Israel were driven into the sea tomorrow, if every \nJew in the Middle East were killed, terrorism would not end. You know \nthat in your heart. Terrorism would continue.\n  It is not just a matter of Israel in the Middle East. It is the heart \nof the very people who are perpetrating this stuff. Should they be \nsuccessful in overrunning Israel--which they won't be--but should they \nbe, it would not be enough. They will never be satisfied.\n  No. 7, I believe very strongly that we ought to support Israel; that \nit has a right to the land. This is the most important reason: Because \nGod said so. As I said a minute ago, look it up in the book of Genesis. \nIt is right up there on the desk.\n  In Genesis 13:14-17, the Bible says:\n\n  The Lord said to Abram, ``Lift up now your eyes, and look from the \nplace where you are northward, and southward, and eastward and \nwestward: for all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to \nyour seed forever. . . . Arise, walk through the land in the length of \nit and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to thee.''\n\n  That is God talking.\n  The Bible says that Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the \nplain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar before the \nLord. Hebron is in the West Bank. It is at this place where God \nappeared to Abram and said, ``I am giving you this land,''--the West \nBank.\n  This is not a political battle at all. It is a contest over whether \nor not the word of God is true. The seven reasons, I am convinced, \nclearly establish that Israel has a right to the land.\n  Eight years ago on the lawn of the White House, Yitzhak Rabin shook \nhands with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. It was a historic occasion. It \nwas a tragic occasion.\n  At that time, the official policy of the Government of Israel began \nto be, ``Let us appease the terrorists. Let us begin to trade the land \nfor peace.'' This process continued unabated up until last year. Here \nin our own Nation, at Camp David, in the summer of 2000, then Prime \nMinister of Israel Ehud Barak offered the most generous concessions to \nYasser Arafat that had ever been laid on the table.\n  He offered him more than 90 percent of all the West Bank territory, \nsovereign control of it. There were some parts he did not want to \noffer, but in exchange for that he said he would give up land in Israel \nproper that the PLO had not even asked for.\n  And he also did the unthinkable. He even spoke of dividing Jerusalem \nand allowing the Palestinians to have their capital there in the East. \nYasser Arafat stormed out of the meeting. Why did he storm out of the \nmeeting? Everything he had said he wanted was offered there. It was put \ninto his hands. Why did he storm out of the meeting?\n  A couple of months later, there began to be riots, terrorism. The \nriots began when now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon went to the Temple \nMount. And this was used as the thing that lit the fire and that caused \nthe explosion.\n  Did you know that Sharon did not go unannounced and that he contacted \nthe Islamic authorities before he went and secured their permission and \nhad permission to be there? It was no surprise.\n\n[[Page S1430]]\n\nThe response was very carefully calculated. They knew the world would \nnot pay attention to the details.\n  They would portray this in the Arab world as an attack upon the holy \nmosque. They would portray it as an attack upon that mosque and use it \nas an excuse to riot. Over the last 8 years, during this time of the \npeace process, where the Israeli public has pressured its leaders to \ngive up land for peace because they are tired of fighting, there has \nbeen increased terror.\n  In fact, it has been greater in the last 8 years than any other time \nin Israel's history. Showing restraint and giving in has not produced \nany kind of peace. It is so much so that today the leftist peace \nmovement in Israel does not exist because the people feel they were \ndeceived.\n  They did offer a hand of peace, and it was not taken. That is why the \npolitics of Israel have changed drastically over the past 12 months. \nThe Israelis have come to see that, ``No matter what we do, these \npeople do not want to deal with us. . . . They want to destroy us.'' \nThat is why even yet today the stationery of the PLO still has upon it \nthe map of the entire state of Israel, not just the tiny little part \nthey call the West Bank that they want. They want it all.\n  We have to get out of this mindset that somehow you can buy peace in \nthe Middle East by giving little plots of land.
