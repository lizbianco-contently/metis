We still need Your \nemancipation from customs that constrict, practices that patronize, \nsuperiority that scrutinizes, and attitudes that anger. Keep us in the \nbattle for equality in education, job opportunities, and social \nadvancement for all Americans.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about where the \nSenate is and where the Senate is going. Obviously, we are coming to \nthe end of the session. I presume the maximum we will be here is 2 \nweeks after this week, a total of 3 weeks, unless circumstances change.\n  We have, of course, as usual, a lot of legislation that could be \ndone. There are a lot of issues about which we have talked this year \nthat need to be finalized. All those issues rise to the top at the end \nof a session.\n  More importantly, we are faced with the fact that there is limited \ntime, and the process takes a good deal of time. Therefore, it is \nnecessary, it seems to me, for us to choose priorities and decide what \nwe must complete before we go into recess for the election and after \nand, of course, do whatever we can but that those need to be our \npriorities.\n  I am one who believes strongly in the fact that one has to make \npriorities, in any group, although this group is not an easy one to \nmanage. Decisions need to be made with respect to what we need to do \nand, frankly, finding some limits on how long we can spend on different \nissues.\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\n  We only have time for a relatively few items to be completed, in my \nopinion. Some of them are more fairly obvious and some are quite \nimportant. Obviously, we have to complete homeland security. We have \nbeen on that bill now, I believe, 3 weeks. Hopefully, we will finish it \nvery soon. Because of the time, it needs to be completed soon.\n  Quite frankly, we find ourselves in a delay, a stalling arrangement \nhere that is not where we need to be. Are there differences of views? \nOf course, and they need to be resolved, but that is what the system is \nabout, and we need to go on.\n  We are going to be faced very soon with a resolution with respect to \nIraq. In fact, we are working on it now. It is an issue that needs to \nbe addressed and addressed quickly. Again, it will take a certain \namount of time, but we do need to address it, and we need to address it \non the basis that it is a priority with which we need to deal, however \none feels about it.\n  Defense appropriations: We are going to find ourselves not having \ndealt with more than half the appropriations bills by the time we go \ninto recess, but many of them can probably be tided over for several \nmonths with a continuing resolution, funding the agencies at the level \nthey have been in the past year. It is not an unusual occurrence. But \nDefense appropriations, in this instance, is quite different because of \nthe circumstances relating to terrorism.\n  Defense appropriations need to be completed. More resources obviously \nneed to be available to our military so when we ask our military to do \nwhatever we ask them to do, they have the best support we can possibly \ngive to them.\n  The CR needs to be dealt with so we do not have the Government being \nstopped because of no financing. Remember, we did that a number of \nyears ago. We cannot let that happen, of course.\n  There are lots of issues people will talk about that indeed are \nimportant, and if we had our way, they could all be done. \nUnfortunately, a lot of those issues have not been brought out of \ncommittee and to the floor so we can move them forward. I believe 8 out \nof 13 appropriations bills have not been dealt with yet.\n  We are going to soon have to deal with a payback for Medicare. I find \nat home--and I am sure everyone else does, too--more physicians are not \ntreating Medicare patients because the reimbursement has gone down, and \nit is scheduled to go down more the first of next month. Frankly, this \nwould be a relatively easy issue to fix. We know what the percentages \nare, and we could do something about that.\n  An issue that I have talked a great deal about and that is more \ndifficult--and I do not think we will accomplish but many of us would \nlike to--is pharmaceuticals. We need to find a way to make \npharmaceuticals more available to the elderly particularly. We have \nworked on that a great deal and have not come to a conclusion and will \nnot, in my opinion, by the time this session is over.\n  We have spent a good deal of time on energy. Certainly, energy is an \nissue that affects not only the economy but it affects terrorism and \nthe upheaval in the Middle East where we have let ourselves become 60 \npercent dependent on imported energy. We need to change that. We need \nto have a policy. We have not had a policy for some time. We are now in \nthe process of developing that policy in a conference committee, and we \nneed to get that finished.\n  We talked about drought relief. It is on the table. We can do that.\n  Unfortunately, we will probably not be able to deal with terrorism \ninsurance, which is too bad. It is a good issue because it has to do \nwith the economy. It has to do with the resistance to constructing \nbuildings, for example, when you cannot have insurance for them.\n  There are lots of other issues, such as tort reform and health care \ncosts. I think we have to move on those issues. We have to move ahead \nwith the budget resolution, which we have not had for the first time in \na number of years.\n  One may say, what is the difference? The difference is not only does \nit help us deal with what we are going to spend, but it has an \noperational aspect to it that says if you spend over what you have \nagreed to for the budget, there have to be 60 votes to pass it, which \nis the kind of resistance we need when we are spending too much money.\n  We have already talked about prescription drugs. That is an issue we \nreally need to deal with. There are a number of ideas, and we need to \nconsider them.\n  The permanent tax cut, of course, again, has to do with stimulating \nthe economy, and we have talked about that a great deal as something we \nneed to do.\n  There are also the issues of homeland security and welfare reform. \nWelfare reform is pretty much ready to go in the committee. We are \ngoing to have to have a temporary passage to keep that in place because \nit expires shortly. These are the things we need to deal with, as well \nas the appropriations bills.\n\n  I urge that we set some priorities, decide what it is we are going to \ndo over this time, and set some time goals so we can work at it. Then I \nthink we really have to enforce it.\n  Today, for example, it will be 5 o'clock on a Monday before we get \naround to voting, and I suspect we will be out again next Friday. The \ntime has come when we really need to take the time that is available to \ndo what we have to do. That is our challenge, and certainly it is not \neasy.\n  It is difficult because we all have different ideas about what issues \nare most important. We have some compelling issues that clearly need to \nbe moved on because of the shortage of time. I urge we move that way \nand complete the work that is necessary for it to be done before we \nleave in October.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the time I have this afternoon, I want to \naddress three subjects. The first relates to an issue we are going to \nbe taking up tonight, which is the cloture motion on an amendment \nrelating to the Interior appropriations bill. The Domenici-Craig \namendment dealing with forest health will go down if cloture is \ninvoked. Therefore, I urge my colleagues not to vote to invoke cloture.\n  I also acknowledge that the efforts to try to reach a compromise on \nhow to protect our forests from disease, infestation, poor health, and \nfire have not borne fruit, and it is unlikely there will be an \nagreement reached in a bipartisan way sufficient to allow us to pass \nsomething that will provide relief to those, particularly in the West, \nwho have forests that need this kind of treatment. That being the case, \nwe are going to have to find another way to deal with the issue.\n  The administration is committed to forest health. The President has \nlaid out a plan, and I think administratively the Departments of the \nInterior and Agriculture will do the very best they can to work within \nthe existing law to manage our forests to bring them back to health and \nto prevent fires.\n  The reality is that this failure to reach an agreement will have \ndisastrous consequences, not just in terms of fire but the health of \nour forests, particularly in the West, and that is not a situation we \nshould be very proud of in this body.\n  We tried very hard, particularly those of us who represent the \nWestern States, to educate some of our colleagues about what we mean by \nforest management. There is not much debate in the scientific community \nabout what ought to be done to our forests, maybe 75 million acres of \ntrees. They need to be treated, and by that we mean there needs to be a \nprocess whereby the dead, dying, and diseased timber, as well as the \nvery small diameter timber, is removed so the forest can sustain the \nlarger trees we want to preserve and return forests to the healthy \nconditions they were in maybe about 100 years ago. This means opening \nup the canopies and providing more opportunity for grass. The trees \nthat would be thinned would not only remove a source of competition to \nthe larger trees in terms of soaking up the moisture and nutrients from \nthe soil, but also providing fuel for forest fires which, instead of \njust creeping along the ground as they did 100 years or so ago, are now \nusing these small trees to basically climb a ladder up to the crowns of \nthe big trees.\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\n  What we see on television, when we see the pictures of these enormous \nforest fires, is the canopies of the big trees literally superheating \nand then exploding into flame, and this is what spreads the fire for \nmiles and miles.\n  If the dead and dying fuel on the forest floor is removed, the down \nfuel as well as those small-diameter trees that are literally choking \nthe forests to death right now, it is not only opened up for the trees \nand other flora and fauna that we want to grow properly but it also \nremoves a significant fire danger. That is what the scientific \ncommunity understands needs to be done.\n  The problem is that there are radical environmentalists who do not \nwant to see this done. Ironically, our goal is the same: To protect \nthose beautiful big trees and to create a healthy environment for all \nof the other flora and fauna. But they are so afraid that a timber \nindustry will be either preserved or regenerated, and that that timber \nindustry will soon set its sights on cutting the big trees as well, \nthat they are really willing to cut off their nose to spite their face; \nthat is to say, to risk the health of the entire forest in order that a \ntimber industry is not encouraged to take hold.\n  In my State of Arizona, there is not any more timber industry, so we \nare not interested in bringing an industry back. It is gone. There are \na couple of small mills that can take small-diameter timber and make 2 \nby 4's and fiberboard. The White Mountain Apache Indian Tribe has two \nsmall mills that can handle larger diameter timber which they cut on \ntheir reservation.\n  But this is not about creating a timber industry in Arizona. It is \nnot about logging. We are not going to have logging as we used to know \nit. It is about companies being permitted to do the Government's work \nof cleaning out the forests and making a little bit of profit. They are \nnot going to do it for free. We do not have enough money in the budget \nto pay the cost of doing that. They have to be willing to do it for the \nsmall amount of money they can make on the products they are now \npermitted to sell.\n  That is what this debate has been all about, and I am very \ndiscouraged that the radical environmental movement has such a \nstranglehold on some politicians that even though they will privately \ntell us they understand the scientists are right, that we do need to go \nin and manage our forests, they are not willing to confront these \npeople in an open forum. It has been an interesting one-sided debate we \nhave had in the Senate. No one has defended the other position. The \nreason is because it is indefensible. It boils down to a political \nissue. That is too bad for the forests.\n\n  I understand what happens when we are not able to reach agreement. We \nare not going to be able to get 60 votes to carry the day. As a result, \nwe have to find another way to do this. Therefore, depending upon what \nthe assistant majority leader and others decide to do at the end of the \nday, that issue may well be behind us as of tonight as something we \nwill deal with in the Senate. That is too bad. We should have been able \nto deal with that.\n  I add a postscript before I turn to the next subject. Some on my side \nof the aisle have criticized the majority leader because he was able to \nsecure in an appropriations bill special relief for his home State of \nSouth Dakota and the Black Hills by doing exactly what we are talking \nabout, thinning those forests. He did that by, in effect, waiving all \nenvironmental considerations. In other words, the legislation provided \nthe sufficiency for environmental achievement and nothing further was \nrequired to clean up these forests.\n  There was criticism. I suppose one could criticize the use of the \nprocess in the way that he did but frankly, I cannot criticize what he \nwas attempting to achieve and what will be achieved as a result of his \nactions. The Black Hills are some of my favorite forests in this \ncountry. I used to vacation there as a young boy. I love the Black \nHills. I am glad the majority leader saw fit to save the Black Hills. I \nwish we could apply something close to that same management technique \nfor the rest of the country's forests. I find it ironic people would \npermit it to be done in this one area, which I support, but nowhere \nelse.\n  I hope we can find a way to address this in the future, put the \npolitics behind us, and get back to a scientific resolution of the \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9005-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the second subject I address is a resolution \nthe White House has sent Congress for consideration of Presidential \nauthority to deal with the problem of Iraq. There have been questions \nraised this weekend about the language of the resolution and the need, \nin some people's minds, to define it and provide greater definition.\n  My own view is the President and his administration did a very good \njob at crafting a resolution which will give the President the \nauthority he needs to do the things we understand have to be done. I am \na little worried about trying to be too cute in drafting language that \nwill constrain the President in a variety of ways, not because we do \nnot want to know what the President has in mind, but because we do not \nwant to come back to the Congress every time the President needs some \nadditional component of authority in fighting this war on terror.\n  The immediate need is to grant the authority to follow up on the \nresolutions that were violated by Saddam Hussein, and that if the \nUnited Nations is not going to take action, and it is not, then for the \nUnited States to be able to do that. We will pass that resolution by a \nfairly wide margin both in the House of Representatives and in the \nSenate. I am hoping Members of this body will not view it necessary to \ndraft the language in such a way that it puts the interests of the \nUnited States behind the authority of the United Nations.\n  The U.S. Government and those who represent the people of America \nwill act on behalf of the security interests of the American people. \nThat ought to be our first objective, not to try to resurrect the good \nreputation of the United Nations, not to put the U.S. position in a \nsubservient role to the Security Council of the United Nations, and not \nto subject our decisionmaking or the President's authority to act to \napproval first of a body in the United Nations.\n  I therefore urge my colleagues not to succumb to the temptation of \ninserting language which would submit first to the United Nations and \nthen the U.S. Congress.\n  It was my understanding--perhaps I should have asked unanimous \nconsent before I began to speak--that I would be allotted 20 minutes, \n10 minutes beyond the usual time.\n  Mr. REID. We have a limited amount of time. We have Democrats that \nneed to speak.\n  I am sorry, but I have to object.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I then have 30 seconds to explain that I had been told \nthat I would have 20 minutes, and I have calibrated my remarks to \nreflect that? I regret I will not be able to finish these remarks.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator. We on this side \nhave speakers who wish to speak. If the entire allotted time is not \nused--I think it will be; we have our time allotted--perhaps the \nSenator wants to wait around to see if Democrats show up when they are \nsupposed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, fellow Senators, I will not get a chance \ntoday to accomplish what I intend to accomplish. I assure those who are \nlistening they will not have to wait long to get the rest of it because \nas we get time this week, we will start talking a little bit.\n  The majority side, led by the majority leader and the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, last week took to the floor one or two times with \nlengthy discussions about the American economy, with comments by each \nof them about who was to blame for the economic shortcomings that exist \ntoday.\n  I start with the economic downturn. Many Members and a few Americans \nremember the name Joseph Stiglitz. He was chairman of President \nClinton's\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers. He is quoted in the Atlantic Monthly, \nOctober 2002, page 77. He was known as an erudite and academically \nbrilliant economist. He summarized when asked: When did the downturn \nstart?\n  He said:\n\n       The economy was slipping into recession even before Bush \n     took office, and the corporate scandals that are rocking \n     America began much earlier.\n\n  In this article he is explaining the American economy, which had been \nso buoyant for almost 10 years. We spoke of it from both sides of the \naisle, with great admiration and fantastic respect for who did what, \nwho did not do what, and why did this American economy grow.\n  He is suggesting the beginnings of the downward trends, in response \nto a question:\n\n       The economy was slipping into recession even before Bush \n     took office . . .\n\n  Not when he sent us a budget; not when he sent us a tax bill; not \nwhen he recommended we have tax cuts to perk this economy up; not when \nhe recommended we spend more money to continue perking it up. Before \nthose events occurred, the American economy was slipping into \nrecession.\n  It is all right by this Senator that we come to the floor and state \nwhat we think. It is all right with me if we state them in political \ntones. It is all right with me if we state them with overtones that are \npatently political. It is someone's responsibility, when they think \nthat is the case, to at least try to respond.\n  I will not be able, in the next 5 or 6 minutes, to respond to what \nprobably was more than an hour last week by two or three on the other \nside, led by their leader, the majority leader, and the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and what they had to say when they blamed the \nPresident of the United States for almost everything that is going \nwrong with the economy, in spite of many of them knowing that this is \nthe fact, that this is the salient fact--that it all began long before \nthat. We may be even fortunate that the economy, in its downward \npressures, did not get worse. Perhaps it did not get worse because we \ndid some things right under the leadership of the President and with \nCongress. Although it was difficult, hard work, we did follow most of \nhis suggestions to try to get out from the slippage.\n\n  In less than a week we will enter the new fiscal year, the year of \n2003. Let me repeat, in less than 1 week we will be entering the new \nFederal fiscal year, fiscal year 2003. As this new fiscal year \napproaches without us having enacted even one appropriations bill for \nnext year, I have been struck by some of the statements being made on \nthe floor--principally on that side of the aisle, and principally by \nleaders of the majority party.\n  Recently, the majority leader and the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee have taken to the floor to criticize the President's handling \nof the economy. I would like to be as honest as I can about this, so \nlet's try to be honest as to what this is all about. This is politics, \nin my humble opinion, at its worst. Unwilling or afraid to face up to \ntheir own responsibilities, unable to defend their own record for \nfailing to enact a budget in the Senate for the first time in the \nhistory of the Budget Act, they are now trying to confuse the public \nand somehow blame the President or the House of Representatives--which \nhappens to be Republican by a few votes--for their failure. So now the \ntime has come to play the blame game and to run away from whatever you \nhave done and pin it on somebody else. That is this time of year.\n  This is important, and I would like the record to be clear. Back in \nMay, the majority leader blamed the lack of a budget on an evenly \ndivided membership in the Senate. Earlier this month, the chairman of \nthe Democratic National Committee, Mr. McAuliffe, appearing on a Sunday \nmorning show--I think it was ``Face The Nation''--said: Don't blame us: \n. . . we need 60 votes for a budget.\n  Finally, last week the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nreferring to an amendment that was voted in the Senate on June 20, \nclearly implying that it was a Senate budget, literally said here on \nthe floor:\n\n       . . . we got 59 votes for that proposal on a bipartisan \n     basis. We needed a supermajority, which is 60.\n\n  Let me be as clear as I possibly can. We have not voted on a budget \nresolution in the Senate this year. We have not voted on a budget this \nyear in the Senate. This will be the first time in the Budget Act's \nnearly 27-year history that the Senate has not adopted a budget \nblueprint. Say what you want about what it is or what it is not, we \nhave always seen fit to adopt one. As tough as it was, as many hard \nvotes as it took in the hours allotted under law, we always got one. We \ngot one out of the committee when we were practically tied, for all \nintents and purposes. But no budget resolution has been brought to the \nfloor of the Senate to be debated and voted on this year.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee knows this. The majority leader \nknows this. To even hint that we have considered a budget is an \nabsolute insult to those of us who worked to make this process a \nfunctional part of fiscal decisionmaking here in the Senate.\n\n  If my time is up, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). The Senator from Nevada, the \nassistant majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9006-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9006-S9008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the senior Senator from New \nMexico, has a chart. He talks about when the downtown started. The fact \nis, it is here. To try to divert attention from the problems of this \ncountry by trying to talk about when this problem started really \ndoesn't do the trick. Presidents are blamed or given credit for what \nhappens during their 4 years of office. That is the way it is, and that \nis the way it should be. The fact is, during this administration the \neconomy has gone downhill every month the President has been in office.\n  To talk about when a problem started, we had problems during the 8 \nyears that Clinton was President, but he was able to respond to make \nsure the country went on an upward path after that. The fact is, \nPresident Bush, no matter what he received when he was President, has \ndone nothing to alleviate the problem. He has made it worse.\n  I would say to my friend from New Mexico, if he read the rest of \nStiglitz's article, I find Stiglitz blames much, if not all, of the \nproblems of this economy directly on the President, President Bush's \neconomic policies. We just had Stiglitz appear before the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee and he spent all afternoon telling us \nwhat was wrong with the Bush economic policies. Joseph Stiglitz has won \na Nobel Prize in economics. He is one of the most renowned economists \nin the world. He places the blame at the foot of the President of the \nUnited States, President Bush, for the economy we now have.\n  There may have been some corporate problems that started many years \nago. But, remember, this White House wanted to bring corporate America \nto the White House--and they did. There is no better example of that \nthan the fact that when the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission was having his confirmation hearings, he said he wanted to \nbring a kinder more gentle SEC to America. That is what we have had at \nthis White House. They simply have been kinder and gentler. They \nbrought corporate America to the White House. The American people do \nnot want that.\n\n  My friend also mentions in passing the United States of \nRepresentatives, which is controlled by the Republicans by just a few \nvotes. Those of us who have served in the House of Representatives know \nthe party that controls the House of Representatives controls the \nagenda over there. That is the way it works. It has always worked that \nway. One reason we have gotten nothing done in the Congress is because \nthe Republican majority in the House of Representatives decided a long \ntime ago they were not going to have anything happen this year. That is \nwhy we have every conference report stuck in a dark hole in the House \nof Representatives. They won't let us do anything on bankruptcy. They \nwon't let us do anything on terrorism insurance. They won't let us do \nanything on election reform. They won't let us do anything on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They won't let us do anything on our generic \ndrug bill, and on and on.\n  Whether it is 1 or 100 vote, it doesn't matter in the House of \nRepresentatives. It works like the parliamentary\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nsystem. The party in power controls the agenda, and the House \nleadership has stated publicly that they are going to have nothing \nhappen. They don't want their members to take tough votes, just like on \nthe bankruptcy bill.\n  For the former chairman of the Budget Committee to come here and \nblame the problems on the budget--we don't have a budget because they \nwon't let us have a budget--the fact is, the Appropriations Committee, \nunder the leadership of Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, made sure \nthat all appropriations bills were under the budget numbers, even \nthough we didn't have budget numbers. The budget numbers are good \nnumbers. They will not let us do the budget bills because of the same \nreason--the same reason. The House of Representatives has not moved \nappropriations bills.\n  You see, the Senate passed out of committee every appropriations \nbill. It has been done long since. But the House refuses to move on the \nbills. Therefore, we cannot do them. We are going to have a cloture \nvote on the Interior bill, which the Presiding Officer has worked on, \nnot for hours, not days, but weeks, trying to come up with a compromise \nto meet the needs of the American public in the western part of the \nUnited States on firefighting but has been unable to work anything \nelse. But that Interior appropriations bill is extremely important. It \nis not as if there is no money going to firefighting. There is 800 \nmillion extra dollars in this Interior bill to fight fires.\n  But they only want them to be fought--in the minds of the \nRepublicans--the way they want to fight them. Do you know how they want \nto fight them? Take all environmental standards and go out and start \nchopping and burning anything in the forest that a lot of lumber \ncompanies want.\n  I say to my friend--he is my friend--the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico that this won't sell. To come and say the problem started \nbefore President Bush became President is to blame it on somebody else. \nThe President of the United States is stuck with an economic standard \nin this--his--administration, and for 2 years this economy has been \ngoing downhill, downhill, downhill. You can't blame it on September 11. \nThe Afghanistan war caused about 25 percent of the problem. But all \neconomists indicate that the other problem is right at the foot of this \nadministration--whether it is tax policy or their other economic \npolicies--which is responsible for 75 percent of our downturn.\n  We have all been affected. People in Nevada--in fact, people in every \nState in the Union--have been affected by the downturn in the economy. \nMany Nevadans, and people who live in all 50 States, have seen their \nretirement savings disappear in the wake of corporate crime, accounting \nabuses, and stock market declines.\n  The Las Vegas Review-Journal, the largest newspaper in Nevada, which \nhas a circulation of a quarter million--to say it is conservative is a \ngross understatement; it is really conservative. It really focuses on \ngovernment a lot. However, as conservative as that newspaper is, they \nwrote an editorial one day last week--in fact, the day after Senator \nDaschle gave a speech on the floor with the charts that he had--under \nthe headline ``Daschle is right.'' I thought they made a misprint when \nI picked up that newspaper. But they had not. They believe Tom Daschle \nis right.\n  This newspaper with a conservative bias, and which seldom has kind \nwords for Democrats or the majority leader, said in this editorial that \nAmerica needs a new economic direction and President Bush's policies \nhave failed.\n  The Las Vegas Review-Journal said:\n\n       The economy is showing an anemic 1 percent rate of growth, \n     the majority leader charged. Under the Bush administration \n     the Nation has lost 2 million jobs and $4.5 trillion in stock \n     market value--much of it melting out of individual Americans' \n     retirement acts. Foreclosures are up, and the government is \n     once again spending Social Security surpluses to pay for \n     other programs . . . it would be a mistake to dismiss the \n     statistics he cites. They are real, as are the economic \n     doldrums they describe.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       President Bush has indeed failed to do all that he could \n     and should have done to put America back on the path to \n     vibrant economic growth, opportunity and prosperity.\n\n  That is about as direct as you can get.\n  It doesn't stop there. Robert Novak--I have great respect for Robert \nNovak. I consider him a friend. But I have to tell you that he has \nrarely said anything nice about me, and rarely has anything nice to say \nabout Democrats. He is a very conservative political pundit, and he is \na good one. I have appeared on his show on a number of occasions. He is \nhard, but he is fair. You always know where he is coming from. But \nrarely does he join with us in criticizing Republicans and what they \nare doing. But he did yesterday. I think it was yesterday. I read about \nit in the paper. It may have been Saturday. He said something very \nsimilar to what the Las Vegas Review-Journal said. But his column is \nprinted all over America, and in the Washington Post, of course.\n  In this piece, under the headline ``Avoidance Agenda''--and in other \nnewspapers the same column had a different headline: ``Winning Without \na Vision''--in this piece, Novak takes Republicans to task for offering \nno domestic alternative to the ``kitchen table'' issues which Democrats \nare discussing and working on: Prescription drugs and other health \nbenefits, corporate accountability, pension protection, Social \nSecurity.\n  According to Novak:\n\n       Midsummer Democratic exuberance has vanished, and \n     Republican anxiety has faded--thanks to Iraq's eclipsing \n     economic issues six weeks before midterm elections. Yet, \n     beneath the surface, thoughtful Republicans ask: What will it \n     mean for the party to sneak by on November 5 without a vision \n     and, indeed, without an agenda?\n       George W. Bush is committed to being a war President, \n     unwilling to use the bully pulpit to press domestic programs, \n     especially without support from Congress.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       The crowding out of corporate corruption by war against \n     Iraq unquestionably has brightened Republican prospects for \n     winning both houses of Congress, saving President Bush from \n     electoral disasters frequently visited on new presidents at \n     midterm. However, apart from the war on terrorism, the \n     Republican Party flinches from standing for much of anything \n     in the 2002 election.\n       The problem is that Republicans--including Bush himself--do \n     not pursue a domestic alternative.\n       This is a matter of concern for the future and perhaps even \n     for this election among a variety of wise old heads in the \n     GOP. One early GWB-for-president backer voiced displeasure \n     with Bush's handling of an economy in which corporate profits \n     are low, investor confidence has been shattered and consumer \n     confidence is in jeopardy. ``He does not seem worried enough \n     about the economy, does not express himself forcefully \n     enough.'' The president does not share his father's boredom \n     with domestic affairs, but there is no doubt he sees his \n     destiny as winning the war against terrorism and not as \n     reformer of the tax system.\n       There are officials inside the administration who signal \n     their concern by suggesting it is necessary to come up with \n     new domestic initiatives.\n       Bush and the Republican Party actually risk a lot tying \n     themselves to the limited goal of maintaining a House \n     majority. By accepting the caution urged on him by Capitol \n     Hill, the president abdicates a vital responsibility of the \n     president as a party leader. Any new initiatives await \n     passage of an Iraq resolution or perhaps even congressional \n     adjournment, leaving a Republican voice that is muted on \n     everything but Iraq.\n\n  I started saying a couple of weeks ago, as others have said, that \nthis country is a big country; we can have a big political agenda. We \ncan focus on Iraq, as we should, but we can focus on other things. The \nadministration is focusing only on Iraq. Let us talk about the other \nissues. Let us talk about the stumbling, faltering economy, which we \nmust address.\n  If you were planning on retiring, Mr. President, this year, you would \nhave to wait, on average, 7 years before you could retire. You would \nhave to work an extra 7 years because you have lost that much--mostly \nin the stock market. People who were going to retire can't retire. If \nyou started out with $100 in savings, you now have about $65 in \nsavings. That is it. You multiply that, and you will see what it does \nto somebody who is building for retirement.\n  The Las Vegas Review-Journal has not changed its political \nphilosophy; they have had the same political philosophy for decades. \nAlso, I would say that Robert Novak hasn't changed; he has had the same \npolitical philosophy for 30 or 40 years.\n  The Republicans' proposed solution to economic woes plaguing Nevada \nand\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nthe entire country are far different from those favored not only by \nSenate Democrats. I also not only speak for Senate Democrats but I \nspeak for mainstream Nevadans and Americans.\n  I have no doubt that Republicans will continue to criticize and even \nmislead readers about our policies, and that is too bad. To come here \ntoday and to say the problems of this country are the result of \nsomething that started a long time ago is ridiculous. I have no doubt \nwe must continue to address the problems that face this country, and we \nmust continue to address them focusing on more than Iraq. This country \nhas more ability to do that.\n  I am very disappointed that my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, would come here and cite Joseph Stiglitz as supporting the \npolicy of this country going back to the last administration when, in \nfact, if you read anything that Stiglitz writes, he talks about the \neconomy being bad as a result of what happened with this \nadministration's economic policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9008-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9008-S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GREG MADDUX\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Nevadan, Greg Maddux.\n  Greg Maddux is a baseball player. That is a tremendous \nunderstatement. He is one of best pitchers in professional baseball \ntoday and considered among the best to ever play the game.\n  Yesterday Greg won this 15th game of the season for the 15th year in \na row, tying a record set by Cy Young.\n  For those who do not follow baseball or are not aware of the \nsignificance of this accomplishment, let me explain that Cy Young was \none of baseball's first superstars. He pitched about a hundred years \nago, starting in 1890 and finishing his career in 1911. Cy Young set \nmany records that last to this day and will likely never be broken. He \nbecame the standard by which all pitchers who followed, even now about \na century after him, are judged. In fact, the honor bestowed each year \non the best pitcher in each league is known as the Cy Young award.\n  Greg Maddux became the first player to ever win four consecutive Cy \nYoung awards with his dominant performances in the early to mid 1990s. \nHis latest achievement testifies to his continued excellence, his \nendurance and consistency and his continued hard work.\n  Greg was born on April 14, 1966, the youngest of three children born \nto parents Dave and Linda Maddux. Dave was in the Air Force so the \nfamily including Greg's brother Mike and sister Terri moved around a \nlot but eventually settled in Las Vegas.\n  At Valley High in Las Vegas, Greg Maddux earned All-State honors in \nbaseball his junior and senior years. He was selected by the Chicago \nCubs in the second round of the free agent draft while he was still in \nhigh school, and following his graduation in 1984, he joined their \nminor league system. He made quick progress in the minors, earing a \ncall up to the big leagues in 1986 at age 20, becoming the youngest Cub \nin the majors since 1967. He won his first start on September 7 of that \nyear with a complete game victory against the Cincinnati Reds, who were \nhis favorite team as a youth. And later that month he won his second \ngame when he beat his brother Mike, himself a successful professional \nplayer who pitched for 15 years in the major leagues. In fact, Mike \npitched for 10 major league teams over 15 years. But for his brother, \nGreg, he would be Las Vegas's most famous major league pitcher.\n  You can imagine how proud the Maddux family must have been to see \nthese 2 brothers competing against each other as they had years earlier \nwhen they played whiffle ball games in the backyard, and the \nsatisfaction Gregg took in overcoming his big brother.\n  Greg started playing catch with his dad when he was just 2 years old \nand made enough progress that several years later he skipped tee ball \nand started playing peewee ball against boys much older and bigger than \nhim.\n  Although he was the smallest and youngest kid on the team, Greg \nbecame the starting pitcher and the best player on the team, and his \nfather--who coached the team--already saw signs that Greg was destined \nto be a star.\n  The Maddux family had a passion for sports, and the children learned \nthe key to success was effort.\n  ``I think our household was like every other American household,'' \nsays Greg's mother, Linda. ``It was routine. They had school, homework, \nbaseball practice, and chores around the house.''\n  One of the values that David and Linda Maddux tried to instill in \nGreg and his two siblings was a ``good work ethic.''\n  ``Each one had his jobs around the house,'' she says, ``and they did \nthem without question.''\n  That hard work clearly has paid off throughout Greg Maddux's career, \nhelping make him the winningest pitcher of the 1990s.\n  He is not physically imposing--he stands less than 6 feet tall and \nweighs perhaps 175 pounds. He doesn't overpower but baffles batters \nwith his pinpoint control and mastery. A maxim normally applied to real \nestate could also describe the keys to Greg Maddux's successful \npitching: location, location, location.\n  He works efficiently, using economy of pitches. In yesterday's \nrecord-setting victory 61 of his 76 pitches were strikes. And last year \nhe averaged only 1 walk per 9 innings.\n  As different as it is to draw a walk from him Greg is also stingy in \ngiving up runs.\n  He concluded the 1990s with a 2.54 ERA over the decade, the third \nlowest ERA for any decade since 1910, behind only Hoyt Wilhelm (2.16) \nand Sandy Koufax (2.36) in the 1960s. In 1995, he became the first \npitcher to log back to back seasons with an ERA under 1.80.\n  His main pitches include a fastball in the mid-80s, a curve ball, \nslider and changeup. But whatever he throws, he regards his favorite \npitch as strike three.\n  Teammate John Smoltz, also a Cy Young winning pitcher says of Greg, \n``Every pitch has a purpose. Sometimes he knows what he's going to \nthrow two pitches ahead. I swear, he makes it look like guys are \nswinging foam bats against him.''\n  And an opposing team's scout remarks, ``Maddux is so good, we all \nshould be wearing tuxedos when he pitches.''\n  Greg Maddux has been described as a scientist who dissects opposing \nteams, an artist who paints the corners of home plate and a magician \nwho can perform wonders with a baseball and make a talented batter \ndisappear.\n  Sports Illustrated hailed him as the ``best pitcher you'll ever \nsee.''\n  When he takes the mound, he presents a clinic, masterfully working \nthe plate and using his arsenal of pitches. With guile, cunning and a \npoker face, he outsmarts opponents and keeps them guessing. It has been \nsaid that he can throw any pitch anywhere he wants on any count. As a \nresult, batters are seldom able to hit the ball solidly and are often \noff balance, resulting in a harmless grounder or fly ball.\n  Not only is Greg Maddux an outstanding pitcher, but an all around \nbaseball player, as he can field, hit and run the bases very well. He \nholds numerous records for putouts, assists and double plays, and is \nconsidered one of the best-fielding pitchers of all time. He has won 12 \nconsecutive Gold Glove Awards for his fielding and is likely on his way \nto yet another.\n  As I said he works hard on his batting, normally not something \npitchers are known for. In 1999, he hit 2 home runs and averaged .264.\n  Clearly, Greg Maddux is willing to give his all to help his team win \nthough he manages to keep his cool regardless of the circumstances.\n  His calm demeanor and humility mask a fierce determination and \ncompetitive spirit that have earned him the nickname ``Mad Dog.''\n  Greg has been one of the major reasons the Atlanta Braves have been \nable to win their division an unprecedented 12 years in a row and again \nthis year have the best record in the league.\n  He wears number 31, but since joining the Braves as a free agent in \n1993, he has been the number 1 pitcher on a team that includes 2 other \nCy Young winners, Smoltz and Glavine.\n  Yet Greg is a modest man who downplays his achievement.\n  ``I never really thought about it,'' Maddux said of the record he set \nyesterday. ``It feels good to be healthy enough to get it.'' He praises \nhis teammates for much of his success and cites winning the World \nSeries with the\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\nBraves in 1995, not any individual achievement, as his greatest and \nproudest moment in sports.\n  Watching Greg Maddux on the mound, Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone \nsays he is well aware that he is seeing a future Hall of Famer. For \nwinning the Cy Young, his glove and spikes are already in the Hall, and \nGreg Maddux certainly will be voted in as soon as he is eligible, five \nyears after he retires.\n  As much of a success and a role model as Greg Maddux is on the \nbaseball field, he is also a success and role model in life.\n  He is a devoted family man, married to a wonderful wife Kathy. They \nhave a daughter, Amanda Paige and a son Chase Alan.\n  Greg can afford to live anywhere. I know that we are happy that he \nand his family have chosen to live in Las Vegas and to contribute \ngenerously to others in the community, whether signing autographs for \nfans or giving his time and money towards charitable causes.\n  Greg states that he has no use for the glamorous life which his money \ncould buy and describes himself as ``your average Joe.''\n  Kathy and Greg lead the Maddux Foundation, which is involved in \nseveral charitable activities in Las Vegas and Atlanta. The Foundation \nsupports children's homes, domestic crisis shelters, and boys' and \ngirls' clubs.\n  ``Our foundation is low key,'' Maddux said. ``We've never really \nsolicited anyone outside before.''\n  ``The goal is to give more money to charity. It's about `How much can \nwe give?' instead of `How much can we profit?' ''\n  In recent years, the Madduxes have expanded their philanthropic \nefforts, and brother Mike also has a foundation that helps children. \nGreg participates in golf tournaments whose proceeds go to the Southern \nNevada chapter of the Candlelighters, which works with families whose \nchildren are battling cancer, and Safe Nest, which helps victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  To my friend, Greg Maddux, a great baseball player and great American \nI want to thank you for all you have done for Las Vegas and for Nevada, \nas a role model for all America.

Mr. President, I spent the weekend in my home State of \nIllinois, from the southern part of the State, the metro east, St. \nClair County, Madison County, and the city of Chicago, going from one \nplace to another, and it is interesting to me that people will stop and \nask me about our going to war in Iraq.\n  I have not found a single person who makes any excuses for Saddam \nHussein. I will not. He is a man who certainly distinguished himself--\nif that is the word--in the history of this world: for his aggression, \nhis militarism, his inhumane treatment of his own people and his \nneighbors.\n  He is someone who cannot be trusted but must be watched carefully and \nclosely. He is someone who must be monitored at all times for fear he \ncould go too far in his development of weapons and his development of \nmilitary strategies as a threat to the world. Everyone concedes this. I \ncertainly concede it.\n  We found what he was all about when he invaded Kuwait. We have \nwatched him closely ever since. The United Nations put restrictions on \nwhat he can do in defense of his own nation, limitations on his own \nmilitary power. One of those limitations prohibits weapons of mass \ndestruction: chemical weapons, biological weapons, and nuclear weapons.\n  The United Nations started inspecting for those weapons after the \nPersian Gulf war. Saddam Hussein threw every obstacle he could find in \ntheir path. He discouraged them when he could, and ultimately the \ninspections were withdrawn 4 or 5 years ago. We still do a flyover with \nour planes to watch everything that happens in his country, not to \nmention all the other sources of intelligence. We worry about him, as \nwe should.\n\n  Having said all those things, and the fact that almost everyone \nacknowledges them to be true, it is still interesting, as I go around \nmy State--a State which is fairly diverse in terms of its economy, in \nterms of its culture, in terms of its politics--there is no ground \nswell for America to invade Iraq and to displace Saddam Hussein from \npower.\n  The idea of a land invasion, for what the President calls a ``regime \nchange'' has not brought the people out cheering, as they cheered after \nSeptember 11 when we said we were going after Osama bin Laden and al-\nQaida. Instead, what I hear from the people I speak to in Illinois is \nthat certainly we have to keep an eye on this man, but why should we do \nit alone? Shouldn't the United States have standing with it a coalition \nof countries around the world? Why would we do this by ourselves? Isn't \nit better to invite other nations to be part of it because there is \nstrength in numbers, more clarity of purpose, a sharing of the burden \nnot only of the war but of controlling Iraq after it is defeated?\n  I can tell you that Thomas Friedman, the foreign Times correspondent \nfor the New York Times, said it best. He said: Our situation in Iraq, \nif we go it alone, is much the same as the person who walks into the \nstore and sees a sign which says, ``If you break it, you own it.''\n  If we displace Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, then, frankly, as \nthose who displaced him, we will have a burden to bring some stability \nand security to that country. Is it not better for us, in that \ncircumstance, to have other Western civilized democratic nations \nstanding behind us, not only behind the muzzle of the gun pointed at \nhim but standing in league with us to make sure Iraq is peaceful and \nsafe for a long time?\n  Let me add one other element that comes up time and again. This is a \ndifferent world since September 11 of last year. We have to measure our \nforeign policy against its impact on terrorism. There is not a country \nin the world which would knowingly attack the United States. We have \nthe best military in the world, the best men and women in uniform, the \nbest technology, but we know we are vulnerable, we are vulnerable to \nterrorism.\n  If we make that decision to go it alone in Iraq, to do it by \nourselves, and say to the rest of the world, we don't care what the \nopinion of the United Nations is or any other country is, we will go it \nalone, would that not invite a backlash from parts of the world that \nare preaching extremism and fundamentalism? Wouldn't that, \nunfortunately, sow the seeds of terrorism?\n  Isn't it far better for us to have a coalition with Arab States, as \nPresident Bush's father did in the Persian Gulf, a grand coalition of \ncountries that say Saddam Hussein has to be watched carefully?\n  When I saw the resolution that President Bush sent us last week, that \nis not his intension, that is not his design. If you think that trip to \nthe United Nations was an appeal to that body to move forward and do \nthings, it might have been, but, frankly, his resolution he sent to us \nbasically says: Ignore my speech; ignore my visit to the United \nNations; ignore the United Nations; give me the authority to do it by \nmyself.\n  I have no doubt we could win that war, that we could displace Saddam \nHussein, but isn't there a better and more cautious and more prudent \nand more successful strategy we should consider--bringing in the United \nNations for real inspections, unconditional inspections, enforced with \nmilitary force, if they must be, including some troops from the United \nStates, to make sure the inspectors get into the places they need to; \nand failing that, if Saddam Hussein stops the inspectors, that we issue \nan ultimatum to him through the United Nations, that if you do not \nallow unconditional inspections, you can expect there will be a \nforceful effort by the countries of the world to enforce United Nations \nresolutions already in place? Isn't that a far better approach than to \nsay, we have a battle plan; we are going to attack; we will send you a \nnote, United Nations, and let you know what happens?\n  The United Nations should not dictate American policy, but President \nBush's father was right. When you can involve a coalition of nations \naround\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\nthe world in your effort to bring peace to a region, you have a far \ngreater chance of success, world acceptance, sharing the burden; and, \nultimately, the American people would not stand by themselves but stand \nin concert with those of like mind and like values.\n  As I return to Illinois, people tell me over and over again: Senator, \nwhen you go back, please go to the floor of the Senate and express our \nfeelings that we do need a coalition of force, not just for the \nprinciple and value of it but for the military significance of it, not \njust so we are not standing alone but so we are validated in the eyes \nof the world that what we are standing for is not just a narrow \ninterest of the United States but in the best interest of a free and \npeaceful world.\n  That is what makes sense. That is what we ought to move forward with.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from Illinois, is it true, when you \nreturned to Illinois, people were asking about things other than Iraq?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Exactly true.\n  Mr. REID. Are people concerned about the stumbling, staggering, \nfaltering economy?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is where I was \nheaded next.\n  This chart, which I have brought to the floor, talks about the lost \nprivate sector jobs in the last 50 years. Look at what has occurred \nunder President Eisenhower through George W. Bush. Look at the only \nperiod that shows red ink, the net loss of jobs; and it turns out to be \nunder President Bush.\n  The people of Illinois talk about Iraq because it is in the \nheadlines. That is all the media talks about. But when it comes to the \nissues they worry about, this is what they are concerned about. There \nare not enough jobs, not enough good-paying jobs.\n  Unfortunately, under this administration, the economy is not even a \nmajor issue. They are ignoring it. I asked last week--and I will renew \nmy request to the President--can you give us 1 hour a week on America's \neconomy, 1 hour to talk about income and job security? That is a valid \nissue.\n\n  Take a look at long-term unemployment. It has more than doubled under \nPresident Bush. In January 2001, when he came to office, there were \n648,000 under long-term unemployment, people unemployed for half a \nyear. That number has more than doubled in this period of time. The \nPresident may rally America to stand behind him, as he should, on the \nwar on terrorism and foreign policy. But he ought to rally America to \nwork, give people opportunities so they can be employed, so they have \nsome opportunity to enjoy the benefits of this country.\n  We are facing now the weakest economic growth in 50 years. This chart \nshows economic growth, the average rate of growth over the last 2 \nyears. Under President George W. Bush, it has been 1.0 percent. The \nnext worst President, since Eisenhower, was his father. Then you have \nto go back to Gerald Ford to find another bad period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9010-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9010-S9011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 10 additional minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't see \nanyone here wishing to speak. It is my understanding morning business \nhas, under the previous order, ended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The next period of time is for debate on the cloture \nmotion; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is to \nresume consideration of H.R. 5093.\n  Mr. REID. So is it now time to debate the Dodd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, to discuss the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I don't see anyone here, so I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Illinois be recognized for 10 minutes and that the \nRepublicans be given an extra 10 minutes also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will yield at least a portion of my time \nto my friend from North Dakota.\n  Look at the rate of growth under the Bush Presidency. Is it any \nwonder the President does not want to talk about the economy?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I should have included that this time comes from the debate \non the Dodd amendment, that that number be lessened by 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you have the weakest economic growth in 50 years, \nthere is no reason for you to talk about it. Certainly this Bush White \nHouse will not. They won't bring this issue to the American people \nbecause they don't have much to tell us.\n  The news we have seen on the economy is well known. Take a look at \nwhat has happened in terms of the market value of those who own stocks, \nthe New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, $4.5 trillion of lost stock \nmarket wealth between January 2001, when President Bush came to office, \nand August 2002. That, of course, represents not just a loss in stock \nmarket wealth, it is a loss of savings. It is a loss of college savings \naccounts for kids. It is a loss of pension plans, 401(k)s, and people \nmaking new plans with their lives because of the bottom falling out of \nthe stock market.\n  Of course, last week we saw the Dow Jones crashing even further. The \npeople in the Bush administration do not want to discuss this. They \ndon't want to talk about turning this economy around. They want to talk \nabout rallying troops.\n  Let's rally the American people to get the economy back on its feet. \nLet the President give us 1 hour a week talking about what we can do to \ntry to get this economy moving forward again.\n  This stock market decline is a new record. If you look at the \nsharpest percentage decline in the Standard & Poor's 500, only Herbert \nHoover has a worse record than President George W. Bush. Herbert Hoover \nin the Great Depression saw the stock market decline by 30 percent. So \nfar, under President George W. Bush we have seen a decline of 21 \npercent--historic declines. It is no wonder the President does not want \nto discuss this.\n  Look as well at what workers are facing who still are on the job. The \ncost of health insurance has inflated dramatically since the President \ncame to office: family coverage, 16 percent; individual coverage, 27 \npercent.\n  The biggest single complaint I have heard from businesses, labor \nunions, and individuals in the State of Illinois: the cost of health \ninsurance. Senator, what are you going to do about it? The honest \nanswer is that this Congress has done nothing about it, nor has the \nPresident proposed anything significant.\n  When we consider the issues we should be about, national security is \nNo. 1, I agree, but it is not the only issue facing America. We need to \ndiscuss issues of pension security and income security and health care \nsecurity and the future of Social Security. Those are issues American \nfamilies worry about every single day. We in the Senate should worry \nabout them as well.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator from \nIllinois. He is right. Iraq is not an irrelevant issue. It is a very \nimportant issue. The President will find, as we finish all of these \ndiscussions, that we will have a pretty unified voice on what we do \naround the world, but we need to do that through the United Nations, \nwith other partner countries, as part of a coalition. At the end of the \nday, this country will have led the way towards that result.\n  It is also the case, when most people sit down around the supper \ntable and talk about their lives, they are talking about subjects that \nare much different from Iraq. They are discussing issues such as: Do we \nhave a good job; does it pay well; do we have job security; do we send \nour kids to good schools; do grandpa and grandma have decent health \ncare; do we live in a safe neighborhood? All of those issues exist as \nwell.\n  There are some who don't want to talk about any of those issues. They\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nsay: These issues somehow are irrelevant.\n  They are not irrelevant to people out of work, who are concerned \nabout their jobs, concerned about opportunities for themselves and \ntheir children, concerned about the ability to buy health care, to pay \nfor health insurance, to afford their prescription medicine. The \nSenator is absolutely correct. There are a lot of other issues we must \nresolve.\n  This Senate is at parade rest; I am guessing because there are some \npeople here who don't want us to do anything on these issues, whether \nit is health care, the economy, or corporate scandals. And \nincidentally, I won't have time to talk much about that, but we have \nnot finished on that issue, the issue of corporate scandals. We are \ntalking about hundreds of millions and billions of dollars frittered \naway by CEOs and others who have run corporations into the ground.\n  A recent study by the Financial Times says that of the 25 largest \nbankruptcies in America, prior to bankruptcy 208, executives took $3.3 \nbillion out of the companies prior to running them into the ground. \nShould we do something about that? We should. That issue isn't over, \ndespite the fact there are some in this Chamber and downtown who resist \nevery step of the way.\n  We have a lot to do. There is a lot on the agenda, a lot on our \nplate. Frankly, there are some people who are sitting here with their \nfeet on the brakes. They don't want anything to happen on issues that \nmatter a great deal to the average American family.\n  I have listened attentively to the presentation. I was going to come \nover and make a presentation myself. I will do that tomorrow.\n  The answer is, yes, let's be very concerned about Iraq, about foreign \npolicy, about the war on terrorism. Let's be concerned about it, do it \nseriously. But let's also understand it is not the only subject. There \nare other important considerations impacting on the lives of American \nfamilies with which we need to be dealing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. Average families \nhave to worry about a lot of issues: the health of their children, \nwhether they can make the mortgage payment. If families can face more \nthan one responsibility, our Government certainly can.\n  It is not enough to say we are just going to focus on the Middle East \nand what might happen there in the years to come; let's talk about what \nis happening in the middle west and the East and the South and the \nNorth, all across the United States. What are we doing to make sure \nthis economy turns around and gives people a chance?\n  I spoke to a friend of mine in the plumbers union in Chicago who told \nme that the cost of prescription drugs for retirees last year went up \n300 percent in his one local. He said: I don't know if we can meet our \nobligation to our seniors that we promised over the years.\n  As for corporate greed and scandals, the Senator from North Dakota \ntalks about the bankruptcies and the money squandered before \nbankruptcy. There is a company called Tyco where the CEO, Mr. Kozlowki, \nhas been written up in the Wall Street Journal. Their company didn't go \ninto bankruptcy. It is still in business. But what he did to it was to \nbleed it of a lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nyears leading up to his resignation.\n  All of these things have discredited American business. They have \ndiscredited the good, honest businesspeople who lead our Nation \neffectively. Frankly, they have put a damper on America's feelings \nabout buying stock. The President needs to address this.\n  We passed the Sarbanes bill. It was a good bill. I was glad to vote \nfor it. There is more to do: the bankruptcy code, that corporate \nbankruptcy will take into account when people have squandered the money \nof corporations so that it comes back into the corporation and away \nfrom these corporate executives; that they be charged with crimes when \nthey are guilty. All of these issues need to be taken up. It is an \nagenda which we should face because it is an agenda the American people \nface every single day. And unless and until we do that, we are not \nmeeting our obligation.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9011-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is that the understanding?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The order said Senator Campbell had 20 minutes, Senator \nDodd had 20, and Senator Inouye had 20. Is that all right with the \nSenator from Colorado?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. REID. When we started this debate, we gave 10 minutes to the \nDemocrats and 10 minutes to the Republicans, leaving 20 minutes on each \nside. Senator Inouye said that would be OK with him. If we need more \ntime--\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I think 10 will be enough. Perhaps I can ask unanimous \nconsent if it is not; that is, 10 minutes for Senator Inouye and 10 for \nme?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. Why don't we do this. There is no one here to use the \nRepublicans' morning business time. Why don't we give you back, so you \nhave enough time, 25 minutes, and let's make sure Senator Dodd has \nthat. So I think that will extend the vote 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is fine. Has Senator Dodd spoken yet?\n  Mr. REID. No, he has not. The vote would take place at 5:40, and \nSenator Dodd will have 25 minutes and Senators Campbell and Inouye \nwould have 25 minutes.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask the leader, has Senator Inouye been here yet?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. This debate would end at 4:30; is that right?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. But the Republicans are entitled to 10 minutes in \nmorning business. They may use that.\n  Mr. DODD. Does this require a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, Mr. President.

Under the previous order, there will now be \ndebate on the Dodd amendment No. 4522 until 4:40, equally divided \nbetween Senators Dodd, Inouye, and Campbell, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the amendment is offered on behalf of myself \nand Senator Lieberman. I presume he will be coming to the floor at some \npoint. He has a strong interest in the amendment. I want to be notified \nby the Chair when I have consumed 10 minutes, so I can leave time for \nSenator Lieberman.\n  I begin by thanking my colleagues from Hawaii and Colorado. They were \nvery generous--they are all the time, but particularly last week--in \nconducting a hearing on the subject matter that is the subject of this \namendment. They graciously listened to a series of witnesses from the \nadministration, from Connecticut, mayors from towns in Connecticut, \nalong with other interested parties on the subject matter generally of \nthe recognition process at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. So any \ndiscussion of the matter before us\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\nshould begin with an expression of gratitude to both of these \ndistinguished Members of the Senate for their willingness to listen to \nthe case we presented.\n  Again, I express my gratitude to them. They are friends of mine, and \nthis is one of those awkward moments that can happen when good friends \nfind themselves on opposite sides of an issue.\n  Secondly, I had a good meeting last week with some of the national \nrepresentatives of the Native American community from Indian country \nhere in the Senate. I did state to them, which I will state here as \nwell, that I take great pride in the relationship I have with my Indian \nconstituents in Connecticut, as I have had around the country--on \nnumerous occasions, whether appearing in Window Rock, AZ, or with the \nGila River tribes, and others; with my good friend from Alaska, and \nothers; I take a great deal of pride in my strong support for the \nNative American community.\n\n  What brings us here, and what Senator Lieberman and I are raising, is \nthe concern that we have over the present recognition process. It is a \nconcern that was not generated by my State alone. It was, in fact, \ngenerated by a study done by the Government Accounting Office, backed \nby representatives of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 2000, the \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs stated before the U.S. Congress \nthat the system was terribly broken and in need of repair. I don't know \nof anyone who disagrees with that.\n  Now, there are suggestions on how best to repair this. The problem is \nthat while we are waiting for the repairs to occur, recognitions are \ngoing forward. In many cases, of course, they will be proven to be \nabsolutely well-deserved, but others may not be. My concern is when \nthat happens, it not only does damage to the communities and others who \nmay be adversely affected by those decisions, but I argue just as \nstrongly that an adverse impact occurs as well on existing tribal \nnations that have long sought recognition, and suspicions are raised \nabout the validity and credibility of the process. Those who have \nreceived recognition I think are devalued as well. There are now \npending 222 recognition petitions before the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  I have put up a chart showing where they are in the country. Many \nStates, of course, have none; 37 States have at least 1 pending. In my \nState there are 12. Understand the size of my State. It is about 110 \nmiles by 50 miles. There are national parks in this country that are \nlarger geographically than my State. Some counties in various States \nare larger than Connecticut. So when you start talking about 12 \npetitions pending, you can begin to understand what the impact can be, \nparticularly if there are concerns about the validity of some of the \npetitions pending. Massachusetts has 6, Rhode Island has 5, California \nhas 53, North Carolina has 16, South Carolina has 11, Michigan has 10, \nLouisiana has 10, Missouri has 9, and so forth.\n  My colleagues are more than welcome to look at the list I have. There \nis a particular poignancy in Connecticut because of the number. Every \nsingle petition may be entirely meritorious. I would not, for one, \nsuggest that they should not be approved if, in fact, that is the case. \nBut, if you will, what provoked this particular concern to raise this \namendment was a decision reached only a few weeks ago where two \npetitioning parties in Connecticut recognition were each denied \nseparate recognition. But the Bureau of Indian Affairs, contrary to the \nrecommendation of the technical staff, recognized, in effect, a third \ntribe, and said both of these tribes are not two separate tribes, but \none.\n  That may be a very legitimate conclusion, but you can understand the \nconcern when all of a sudden, without any hearings, they arrived at a \nthird conclusion, and the Assistant Secretary found that to be the \nresult. So that raises concerns, obviously, in the minds of many \npeople. Imagine two people seeking grant applications, both \napplications are rejected, and the Secretary of some agency construed a \nthird grant application. It seems to me that goes beyond any parameters \nthat Congress has extended to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in this kind \nof a process.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have already seen statements from the \nAssistant Secretary of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I quote him:\n\n       I am troubled by the money backing certain petitions, and I \n     do think it is time that Congress should consider an \n     alternative to the existing process. Otherwise, we are more \n     likely to recognize someone that might not deserve it.\n       The more contentious and nasty things become, the less we \n     feel we are able to do it. I know it is unusual for an agency \n     to give up a responsibility like this, but this one has \n     outgrown us. It needs more expertise and resources than we \n     have available.\n\n  Mr. President, we could not agree more. I am not suggesting with this \namendment, by the way, that any of the applications should be rejected. \nThis bill would involve a 1-year moratorium to put the brakes on in \norder to put in place a recognition process that is predictable, \ncredible, that would allow people to have an opportunity to respond, if \nyou will.\n  I don't believe a year is asking too much. I know there are tribes \nthat have been waiting decades, in some cases, for recognition. I feel \nas strongly about what has happened to them as I do in areas where \nrecognition may be extended where it may not be warranted. The process \nis broken if you have to wait 25 years to be heard. That itself makes \nthe case. That argues for the amendment and not against it.\n  So we feel strongly this amendment is not an egregious reach of \nauthority.\n  Many people all the time ask us for support on various matters. I \nhave certainly cast many votes where parts of the country have been \naffected by drought or other natural disasters. This is not a natural \ndisaster. It is not even a disaster. It does not rise to that level, \nbut my colleagues ought to understand when we have this kind of \npressure occurring in a relatively small piece of geography where \nconcerns are being raised despite recommendations of a technical staff \nand other recommendations, one can understand the urgency. I think any \nSenator representing his or her State faced with this kind of issue \nwould take a similar position.\n  It is with a sense of regret that we have moved forward. I wish we \nhad more time to wait and that another year or two would be adequate. \nBut in the next year or two, we are going to find a lot of these \nrecognition petitions to have been ruled upon. They may be ruled \ninvalid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will let my colleagues proceed and share a \nfew thoughts. The General Accounting Office is the last point I will \nmake. In their study released last November, they were highly critical \nof the BLM. They did not just speak about Connecticut. They talked \nabout the country. They said the Assistant Secretary has rejected \nseveral recent recommendations made by the technical staff, all \nresulting in either proposed or final decisions to recognize tribes \nwhen staff recommended against recognition.\n  I am not suggesting staff is always right in these matters or \nsuggesting they are right and the Assistant Secretary is wrong. \nHowever, it seems to me it ought to be a source of some trouble when we \nhave that kind of conflict of opinions occurring. Especially with 222 \npetitions pending, with criteria being used selectively, I think it is \ndangerous and could provoke a lot of hostility which we ought to avoid.\n  I urge the amendment be adopted, and I withhold the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first, I thank Senator Dodd and Senator \nLieberman. I know, probably better than most in this Chamber, the \nexemplary voting record they have had and the strong voice they have \nbeen in supporting American Indians nationwide, people who very often \nare left out and do not have a very strong voice in the Congress. They \ndo not have all the lobbyists that many groups have. They do not have \nthe input that many other groups have. I know both these Senators have \ndone a great job for them.\n  In this particular case, my friend and colleague, Senator Inouye, the \nchairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, is going to move to table the \namendment offered by Senators Dodd and Lieberman. I reluctantly say it \nis the right thing to do for our colleagues to vote to table.\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n  During the time we have been considering the fiscal year 2003 \nInterior appropriations bill and Senator Dodd's amendment, the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs has held a hearing on two bills to address \nthe Federal acknowledgment process introduced by both of these great \nSenators.\n  I know of no one who has said the Bureau of Indian Affairs is doing \neverything right, and we constantly review the actions of the Bureau in \nour committee.\n  I believe the process that governs how the United States recognizes \nIndian tribes should be transparent, timely, and afford due process to \npetitioners. I also believe fundamental fairness requires that truly \naffected communities be given an opportunity to be heard because, \nparticularly with the advent of gaming, there are many things that \nhappen when the tribes get the opportunity to game that sometimes local \ncommunities believe they are left out in the hearing process.\n  Of all affected communities, I believe the United States owes a moral \ndebt to the Native American communities to ensure they receive every \nmeasure of fairness we can provide. That, in fact, is the core tenet of \ntrust responsibility as set up originally in our Federal Government.\n  The hearing our committee held on September 17 has been very helpful \nin understanding the effects of this amendment since it contains \nseveral of the primary features of Senator Dodd's bill, S. 1392. Very \nimportant, in my view, was a statement by the administration before our \ncommittee that it was opposed to S. 1392 and opposed to this amendment, \ntoo.\n  Primary among the administration's objections is that the legislation \nand the amendment would:\n  One, authorize ``interested parties'' to request that the Secretary \nconduct formal hearings on a petition, in addition to the formal on-\nthe-record administrative factfinding proceeding, and the extensive \nadministrative hearings and appeals that are currently available. They \nare already available. ``Interested parties'' is somewhat vague.\n  Two, alter the standard of proof from a ``reasonable likelihood'' \nstandard to a ``more likely than not'' standard.\n  And, three, create conflict and confusion with the regulatory process \nby statutorily duplicating some regulations but not others, thereby \ninserting uncertainty as to which regulatory provisions are applicable.\n  Additionally, the administration informed the committee that it \ncannot support a moratorium on an already lengthy, burdensome, and slow \nprocess. Senator Dodd spoke to that. In fact, they did testify that if \neither the Dodd bill or the Dodd amendment passed, it would take over a \nyear to promulgate new rules to implement either one, the bill or the \nrule.\n  I believe the imposition of such a moratorium would be particularly \nonerous on those petitioning groups that have gone through nearly the \nentire process and are now in the stage known as the final \ndetermination phase.\n  Just as important, in my mind, as the opposition of the \nadministration is the position of already-recognized Indian tribes that \nalready have a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. \nGovernment. We have received dozens of letters and calls from across \nthe country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the tribes nationwide \nand four national associations in opposition to the Dodd amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Tribal Opposition to Dodd Amendment\n\n       (1) Tribes opposing amendment: 21;\n       (2) Tribal association opposing amendment: 5;\n       (3) Tribes or tribal associations supporting amendment: 0.\n\n\n                       tribes opposing amendment\n\n     Oneida Indian Nation\n     Ft.

Mr. President, these tribes and organizations from \nacross the United States, from Indian country, have declared their \nuniversal opposition. Indeed, they are dismayed that we would be \nconsidering making such a sea change on Federal Indian policy through \nthe appropriations process. Since tribes have been playing by the rules \nand some, indeed, have waited for years for recognition, it seems to me \na bit unfair to put this in an appropriations bill.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has held many hearings on the issue \nof recognition and recognition reform over the past several years. We \nalso heard from several Native groups that the process has taken \ngenerations and people have actually died waiting for recognition.\n  I find it somewhat ironic that descendants of Native people who have \nlived on this continent for thousands of years have to document who \nthey are to a government set up by primarily post-Columbian immigrants.\n  One thing that has become crystal clear from our hearings--and this \nhas been documented by the GAO and inspector general reports--is that \nthis agency, the Branch Acknowledgment Research, BAR, is not able to \nprovide information in a timely manner to either the Native American \npetitioners or to outside interested groups. That is where we should be \nputting our emphasis and providing more money for that process.\n  A substantial contributing factor is the flood of requests under the \nFreedom of Information Act. These FOIAs, as they are called, are \nkeeping the BAR in a state of constant churning of documents, \npreventing them from performing their core tasks.\n  Those asking for reforms must recognize the process in place is made \nworse by the avalanche of lawsuits filed by local communities, State \nattorneys general, and some suits by already-recognized tribes. I fail \nto see how providing even more opportunities for lawyers to inject \nthemselves into the process, and generate more lawsuits, is an \nimprovement over the process. If we are going to reform the \nacknowledgment process, we should make sure we are providing reforms--\ntrue reforms--that provide benefits not just for States, the attorneys \ngeneral, and the lawyers, but also for the petitioning groups \nthemselves.\n  Finally, I cannot support an appropriations rider that would so \nsubstantially impact a regulatory process that has been in place for 25 \nyears and through which so many participants are still working their \nway.\n  Placing a moratorium on the process and altering the evidentiary \nstandard is a dramatic change in policy and should not be made without \nvery careful consideration. I could only support such drastic actions \nif I were presented with credible proof of actual fraud or something \nequally bad.\n  I must add that I do support one provision of my colleague's \namendment and legislation; that is, as I mentioned, to substantially \nincrease the funds that the BAR receives to conduct its research. In \nfact, I encourage both my colleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator \nLieberman, and would join with them in efforts in obtaining the $10 \nmillion authorized in this legislation rather than a smaller amount \nthat is in his amendment.\n  Providing greater resources to the BAR would enable experienced and \ncapable people, whether genealogists, anthropologists, or \narcheologists, to do their work and provide an answer in a timely \nmanner.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to support the motion of the \nSenator from Hawaii, our chairman, Mr. Inouye, to table.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, first, may I say I am most grateful to my \ncolleague from Connecticut for his gracious remarks. He knows very well \nit is a very difficult chore to be speaking against his amendment. When \none thinks of the friendship that started since the time of his father, \nthis is not easy, but I believe most respectfully that the amendment my \ncolleague from Connecticut presents is not proper.\n  He says he is for reform. We are all for reform. As my colleague from \nConnecticut pointed out, there are tribes that have been waiting not a \nyear, not 5 years, but decades to even be recognized for consideration \nby the administration. This will further prolong it.\n  Those of us who serve on the Indian Affairs Committee have had reason \nto pay special attention to the State of Connecticut for quite a few \nyears now--in no small part because of the tensions that we read about \nin the media reports that appear to be arising out of the fact that the \ntwo Federally-recognized tribes in southeastern Connecticut--the \nMashantucket Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Tribe--are conducting gaming \nactivities on their lands under the authority of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act--as is their right to do under that Federal law.\n  Because we have been monitoring the public dialogue in the State of \nConnecticut rather closely, and because the hearing the Committee on \nIndian Affairs held last week on Senator Dodd's authorization bill, \nfrom which the elements of his amendment to the Interior appropriations \nbill are drawn, I would like to take a few moments to acquaint my \ncolleagues with the dynamics that are at play in the State of \nConnecticut as I understand them.\n  Pursuant to the compacts each of those two tribes entered into with \nthe State of Connecticut, in exchange for the exclusive authorization \nto operate certain forms of class III gaming, as defined in the Federal \nlaw, the two tribes have been making payments to the State of \nConnecticut from the revenues derived from the operation of slot \nmachines.\n  Those funds are intended, as I understand it, to defray the costs of \nany impacts that the tribes' conduct of gaming activities may have on \nthe surrounding towns and communities.\n  Unfortunately, despite the fact that together, over the past nine \nyears, the two tribes have thus far paid the State of Connecticut $2.2 \nbillion, the towns most directly affected by an increase in traffic and \nbusiness, have not received funding from the State of Connecticut that \nthey feel is adequate to address their needs.\n  This is what one of the councilmen from one of the towns nearest the \nMashantucket Pequot indicated in his testimony before the Committee on \nIndian Affairs last week. I have no doubt that his perceptions are \nsincerely-held, nor that they are shared by others in his town.\n\n  It is not my place to question the decisions of the State of \nConnecticut in allocating the funds the State has received from the \ntribes, but it seems to me that we might well not be here today, were \nthose towns in close proximity to the Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun gaming \nfacilities and hotels not experiencing impacts that were intended to be \naddressed by the substantial payments--and I think $2.2 billion is \nsubstantial by any measure--that both tribes have made to the State of \nConnecticut thus far.\n  I raise these issues that are seemingly unrelated to the matter we \naddress today, because the local Connecticut town officials have \nrepeatedly suggested that there is a direct relationship between the \nprocess by which the United States Government recognizes the inherent \nsovereignty of tribal groups and the impacts of gaming activities from \nwhich they seek financial relief from the Federal Government.\n  I have no doubt that the citizens of Connecticut would acknowledge \nthat there are Indian tribes and Native people who are also citizens of \nConnecticut, because as early as the 1600's, long before this nation \nwas formed, Connecticut established five reservations to serve as \nhomelands for the Indian people of Connecticut.\n  Thus, for over 400 years, Connecticut has, by its own action, \nrecognized that there are Indian tribes who have historically and \ntraditionally, made their homes in Connecticut--and indeed, that Indian \ntribes occupied the area that is now the State of Connecticut, long \nbefore Connecticut established Indian reservation.\n  So the arguments that give rise to my friend's amendment cannot be \nthat the State of Connecticut does not recognize the Indian tribes of \nConnecticut.\n  No, the argument advanced by the non-Indian citizens of Connecticut \nand some officials of the State of Connecticut seems to be that the \nUnited States should not recognize the Indian tribes that have \nhistorically occupied the area that is now the State of Connecticut.\n  And so, unusual activities are being initiated by State and local \nofficials, to prevent the United States from recognizing these \nConnecticut tribes.\n  These activities include litigation, of course, but they also include \nthe hiring of genealogists and anthropologists and historians, and even \nformer employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Branch of \nAcknowledgment, in an effort to develop information that could serve to \nprove that the Indian tribes that are recognized by the State of \nConnecticut either are not Indian tribes, or at least, that they are \nnot Indian tribes which should be recognized by the United States.\n  I don't suppose that I am the only one to whom this position appears \nfundamentally and inherently contradictory.\n  In any event, it is clear that there are citizens and local \ngovernments in Connecticut and even the State of Connecticut who are \nexpending substantial sums and considerable energy to oppose the \nFederal acknowledgment of Connecticut tribes, and that they believe the \nUnited States should subsidize their expenditures.\n  Indeed, Senator Dodd has a bill pending in the Committee on Indian \nAffairs that would provide grants to State and local governments so \nthat they could be better able to carry on their fight.\n  That is one set of issues.\n  Another set of issues has to do with the erroneous perception--and \nsadly I think perhaps this inaccurate portrait is drawn somewhat \ndeliberately--that acknowledgment by the United States that a tribal \ngroup is an Indian tribe, leads directly and automatically to the \nconduct of gaming.\n  In fact, the vast majority of Federally-recognized tribes in the \nUnited States are not engaged in the conduct of gaming activities under \nthe authority of Federal law, and many, like the great Navajo Nation--\nthe largest land-based Indian tribe in the United States--have \nconsistently rejected gaming as a means of economic development.\n  The acknowledgment of an Indian tribe by the Secretary of the \nInterior does not even entail the establishment of a land base that \ncould serve as the homeland for tribal members.\n  No, instead, there is a separate process to determine whether land \nshould be taken into trust for an Indian tribe--a process which \nprovides for significant involvement of State Governors, as well as \nState legislatures and local governments.\n  That process is not an easy one--there are tribes across the country \nwho will verify that it takes years--as much as 10 to 20 years--to have \nland taken into trust.\n  And that is only step one.\n  Should a tribe want to pursue gaming as a means of economic \ndevelopment, there is a separate process with even higher burdens to \nmeet--for the taking of land into trust for gaming purposes.\n  In this process, for land that is to be taken into trust for purposes \nof gaming after October 17, 1988, there is not only a prohibition in \nFederal law that has only limited exceptions, but a far greater role \nfor the Governor of each State in whether land is taken into trust for \ngaming. Some commentators have even suggested that this role that each \nGovernor is afforded under Federal law constitutes an absolute veto \npower.\n  So to conclude, it is abundantly clear to anyone who cares to conduct \neven the most superficial survey of Federal Indian law, that the \nacknowledgment of an Indian tribe by the United State is a process that \nis separate and decidedly distinct from the issue of gaming.\n  Though some may see it as being to their advantage to lump these \ndifferent processes together and make it appear that they are all one--\nas one who has\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\nserved on the Committee on Indian Affairs for 24 years now, I can \nassure my colleagues that it simply is not so.\n  As the Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Marc Racicot, \nrecently was quoted as responding to the notion that people are mixing \nFederal recognition with Indian gaming, ``Is the question really about \nthe Federal recognition process or is it about gambling? Frankly, I \nthink people should address those questions honestly.''\n  As my colleagues know, Marc Racicot is the former Governor and former \nattorney general for many years of the State of Montana.\n  In that same interview that was published ten days ago, Governor \nRacicot indicated that his experience with Federal recognition has not \nbeen mired in ``irregularities and improprieties'' as alleged by \nConnecticut officials. Instead, Governor Racicot stated ``the process \nis clear, plain and steeped in integrity''.\n  If Governor Racicot's observations were the exception to a perception \nwidely-held across the country, we might have a different set of \ncircumstances to address.\n  But the problems that are cited by the citizens of Connecticut are \nclearly different from those that have been identified by \nadministration officials, both past and present, by petitioning groups, \nby the General Accounting Office, and by those who have testified \nbefore the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Of course, like any new venture that bring more people, more traffic, \nand more revenues into a State, there have been concerns expressed \nabout the impacts of gaming--in our history as a country we saw them \nfirst in New Jersey and Nevada.\n  Today gaming, whether it is Government-sponsored or privately--owned \ngaming, whether it is tribally-operated or commercially-conducted--from \nState lotteries to horse tracks to river boats, gaming has given rise \nto controversy.\n  As we consider the amendment of my friend from Connecticut, let those \nof us who know the difference, keep gaming issues separate, and focus \non the Federal acknowledgment process.\n  Cound the Federal acknowledgment process benefit from reform?\n  I don't think there is any question that it could.\n  The committees of Congress--the Indian Affairs Committee in the \nSenate--would not have held so many hearings over the years and would \nnot have considered so many proposals to reform the process, were it \nnot in need of refinement.\n  The problem is that we do not have agreement on the nature of the \nproblem and even less agreement on the appropriate resolution.\n  If you asked tribal groups that have been through the acknowledgment \nprocess or that have petitions now pending before the Branch of \nAcknowledgment, I believe you would find unanimity in their view that \nthe process takes too long.\n  In testimony on Senator Dodd's authorizing bill that was presented to \nthe Indian Affairs Committee last week, the chairperson of the Eastern \nPequot Tribe--a tribe recognized by the State of Connecticut since the \n1600's--testified that the tribe's petition has been pending in the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, for 24 years.\n  The BIA's records clearly document that the experience of the Eastern \nPequot is not atypical.\n  Each of the Assistant Secretaries for Indian Affairs within the \nDepartment of Interior over the past several Administrations--both \nRepublican and Democrat--have stated their views that the process is \ntoo long, too cumbersome, and too expensive for the petitioning tribal \ngroups.\n  The last Assistant Secretary implemented reforms to streamline the \nprocess. The current Assistant Secretary is taking further steps to \naddress the backlog in petitions, because by most calculations, it will \ntake the Branch of Acknowledgment another 200 years to complete work on \nthe petitions that are now pending before the Department.\n  Senator Dodd's amendment does not address the seriously-problematic \nlength of the acknowledgment process nor does it seek to reduce the \nburden on petitioning groups, and so Indian tribes across the country \nhave contacted the Committee to indicate that they do not see this \namendment as effecting the kind of reform that has long been seen as \nnecessary.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Dodd's amendment will lengthen the process for \nthose tribal groups who are subject to the proposed moratorium by yet \nanother year, at a minimum, given that we cannot know how much time \nwill be entailed in the promulgation of the rules and regulations \nrequired by the amendment.\n  Experience would instruct us that this moratorium will last for much \nlonger than a year.\n  The General Accounting Office examined the acknowledgment process in \nits November 2001 report to the Congress, and found that the seven \nmandatory criteria which each petitioning group must satisfy, were not \nbeing applied in a consistent manner. The conclusions of the GAO report \ncorroborated another long-held view in Indian country.\n  The amendment before us does not address this issue either.\n  What the amendment does propose is something that, in the view of \nmany of us who have struggled with these issues for years, requires a \nmuch more thorough vetting before it is made part of the permanent body \nof Federal law.\n  That is the fundamental question of whether the acknowledgment of a \ntribal group by the United States should be an adversarial process in \nwhich other governments should participate.\n  Although the current process provides for the involvement of \n``interested parties'' in formal meetings and in the process of \nappeals, and State and local governments have made very effective use \nof the Freedom of Information Act requests to further bring the snail's \npace of the acknowledgment process to a grinding halt, there has been \nno national discussion and no nationwide consultation within Indian \ncountry on this fundamental issue.\n  Yet, the amendment before us proposes to inject a process of \nadversarial hearings--at the request of any and all interested \nparties--throughout the acknowledgment process, and it would appear, \nbefore a petition is even ready for consideration.\n  Another change that the amendment imposes is a change in the burden \nof proof that a petitioner must meet in satisfying the seven mandatory \ncriteria.\n  The impact of such a change has not been assessed--it would effect a \nchange in existing law--and there can be no doubt that tribal groups \nwho have been through the process and have not succeeded will now come \nto the Government seeking reconsideration under the new standard.\n  Even more likely is the prospect that interested parties will contest \nthe Secretary's findings in favor of acknowledgment on the grounds that \nthose groups that have been acknowledged may not have satisfied the new \nstandard.\n  Reopening every past action of acknowledgment by the Secretary to \nassess whether the new standard would have changed the outcome in each \ncase is clearly going to require years and years of effort and \nlitigation.\n  I think we would all agree that generating new lawsuits against the \ngovernment is not a direction that reform should take.\n  Last but certainly not least problematic from the vantage point of \nIndian country, petitioning groups, from the administration, the \nauthorizing committees of the Congress, and from the Indian Affairs \nCommittee is the moratorium that Senator Dodd's amendment would impose \non the acknowledgment process.\n  This moratorium affects not only the groups that have been in the \nprocess for twenty years or more, and not only the groups whose \npetitions are the subject of Federal district court orders, but also \ngroups that are already through the acknowledgment process and \ncurrently in the appeals phase.\n  Particularly in the case of this last group, there has been no \nrationale advanced as to why a moratorium should be imposed on their \npetitions in order to reform a process of which they are no longer a \npart.\n  Like many of us, I read the newspapers and media accounts from other \nStates. Over the years, I have even spent a little work time in \nConnecticut trying to be of assistance to the citizens of Connecticut. \nSo I think I have a sense of what pressures are brought to bear on the \nMembers of Congress who serve that State.\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n  Working together, I think we can address the concerns that were \nexpressed at the Indian Affairs Committee hearing last week, but I have \nto say, as chairman of the authorizing committee, that proposed changes \nin substantive law and regulations require and deserve careful \nconsideration.\n  If the provisions of Senator Dodd's authorizing measure are to become \nlaw, they should be considered in their entirety--not in piecemeal \nfashion in an appropriations bill--and they should be considered in the \ncontext of what reform is needed--as defined by a much larger base of \nour national citizenry than the citizens of one State.\n  And so I call upon my colleague from Connecticut to work with us to \neffect comprehensive reform, and in the interim, to allow the \nadministration to take the steps it has proposed to improve upon the \ncurrent process with funds appropriated for that purpose.\n  All of the tribal groups that would be immediately affected by the \nproposed moratorium filed their petitions well before the advent of \nFederally-authorized Indian gaming.\n  They couldn't have been motivated by the prospects of something that \ndid not exist when they filed their petitions and should not be \npenalized for what has since come to pass.\n  Let us keep these matters separate, addressing the impact of gaming \nas they arise, and addressing reform of the Federal acknowledgment \nprocess with the deliberative discussion that it deserves.\n  With these considerations in mind, I urge my colleagues to oppose \nSenator Dodd's amendment.\n  I will share footnotes in history that we may have forgotten over the \nyears. Our Founding Fathers felt so strongly about the importance of \nIndian nations that in the Constitution of the United States they have \nset forth, in good language, that Indians should be recognized as \nsovereign countries and as sovereign nations. We have entered into 800 \ntreaties with Indian countries, as we do with the British, the Germans, \nthe French, the Japanese, and the Chinese.\n  Indians are sovereign. I realize it is very difficult for fellow \nAmericans to look upon the Indians as sovereign people, but they are. \nThey were here before we arrived. This was their land.\n  Sadly, I must report that the Senate--of the 800 treaties we have had \nsigned by the President of the United States and by the ruling monarchy \nof the nation, 430 were ratified by our predecessors and 370 are still \nin the files. They are in the files because we found oil, gold, and \nprecious material and suddenly we felt, no, we cannot give that away.\n  Of the 430 we ratified, we violated provisions in every single one of \nthem. That is our record. I am not proud of it. I think the Indians \nhave waited a long time for justice, and I am sorry to say to my \ndearest friend of all that this does not bring justice to them.\n  When the first European landed here, he found a sophisticated and \norganized group of people. They had elected leaders. They had a \njudiciary. In fact, if one reads the writings of Jefferson and Benjamin \nFranklin, they will note reference to the Iroquois Confederacy, a \nconfederacy made up of six tribes, six nations. Each tribe elected \ntheir representatives, the judiciary, their leader. They sent a \ndelegation of representatives to the central office, and the clan \nmothers voted to select the supreme chief. In those days, long before \nwe came on the scene, the women took part in the electoral process. \nThey were a few years ahead of us. That was democracy as our \nforefathers conceived.\n  Laws were passed to further strengthen the basis of sovereignty. At \nthe time they were recognized as sovereign nations, these Indian \nnations had jurisdiction, authority, and control over 550 million acres \nof land. Since then we have had the Indian wars, and let us call it \nwhat it was, Indian extermination laws. We had what is known as an \nallotment. Let's open it up. From 550 million acres, today there are 50 \nmillion left.\n  One of the provisions in this amendment speaks of lands where they \nhistorically resided. Most of the Indians of this land do not live in \nplaces where they historically resided. The Cherokees now live in \nOklahoma. After the Indian wars, they were rounded up from the \nCarolinas, and before they landed in Oklahoma, the dumping ground, 80 \npercent were dead.\n  So where is the historic place of residence? One can say that of just \nabout every Indian tribe. This is what we are dealing with.\n  In the State of Connecticut, there are two very successful Indian \ncasinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods. In the last 9 years, they have \nprovided income to the State of $2.2 billion because that is part of \nthe agreement with the State of Connecticut. That is a lot of money.\n  We cannot intrude ourselves into the affairs of the State and say you \nshould give that money to the town next to Foxwood or next to Mohegan \nbecause the impact is greater. That is the State's decision. I would \nthink the moneys these Indians have provided for the government of \nConnecticut should be sufficient, but that is not within our \nresponsibility.\n  Another footnote in history: One would get the impression after \nlistening to this debate that most of these Indians who are seeking \nrecognition and who are seeking land are seeking such land for gambling \npurposes. Far from the truth, sir. Most of them do not want gambling. \nIn fact, the largest Indian tribe in our Nation is the Navajos. They \nwill not permit gaming within their lands. No, they do not want any \ngambling in their lands.\n  Of those treaties that were not ratified by the Congress--still in \nthe files around here--there are several that affected the Indian \nnations of California. Because the treaties were not considered, in a \nsense they are men and women without nations, without land. We decided \nto put them in a little enclave and say: You live here or you live \nthere because you look alike.\n  My first chore as chairman of this committee was to break up a tribe \nbecause we had put in Pequots and Hoopa-Huroks, historic fighters.\n  Just in case one gets the impression the Indians are ``give me, give \nme, give me, all the time,'' they have given more than any one of us \ncan expect. As one who values the service of men and women in uniform, \nmay I simply say that of all the ethnic groups in the United States, of \nall the racial groups in the United States, on the basis of per capita \nparticipation, the Indians have sent more sons and daughters in uniform \nto face harm's way than any other ethnic group--more than the Germans, \nthe Irish, the British, or what have you. Indians have fought in every \nwar in the last century, and every one now, in greater numbers. They \nhave given their lives in greater numbers, per capita. They are not \nasking for a handout. They are asking for what the Constitution calls \nfor and what the laws of this land call for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut.\n  In a little over an hour the Senate will vote on the amendment \nSenator Dodd and I have introduced which we believe will reform and \nstrengthen the Federal tribal recognition process to the benefit of the \nNative American community and everyone else concerned. It will make \nthat process more fair and give it more credibility and hopefully will \nprovide the resources to have the decisions on tribal recognition made \nby the BIA and the BAR in a much more timely fashion.\n  Some tribes have been waiting years and years and years for a \ndecision from this recognition process that is, regrettably, broken. Of \ncourse, in part it is broken because of the gambling associated with \nNative American tribal recognition and the surge of applications, the \ndramatic interest in recognition. Often, recognition leads to the \npresence of gambling in a locality and the inability of these \nregulatory authorities to keep up with that extraordinary increase in \ndemands on them.\n  In Connecticut--a relatively small State, yet we have three federally \nrecognized tribes--one recently recognized tribe is being appealed and \nnine more recognition petitions from our small State are in the \npipeline of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. We have in two of the \nfederally recognized tribes the two largest casinos in North America, I \nbelieve in the world. So there is an impact that these decisions have.\n  That is why, last year, my colleague from Connecticut and I \nintroduced S. 1392 and S. 1393, which were designed to\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nreform and improve the process by which the Federal Government \nrecognizes the sovereign status of American Indian tribes and their \ntribal governments. We certainly did not view this as antirecognition \nbecause there is a historic, a moral right to recognition by tribes \nthat can meet the requirements of this process. Nor was it, as we \nconceived of it, inherently antigambling. It was to say that the \ndecisions have taken on extraordinary importance and they ought to be \nreached by a process that is not only fair in itself and gives all \nparticipants--the tribes claiming recognition, the neighbors of the \ntribal grounds, towns, et cetera--the belief that they have been \nthrough a process that is fair and therefore that the results of the \nprocess, the decisions made, are credible.\n  We have introduced this amendment reluctantly because the problems \nwith the tribal recognition process have not gotten better, \nnotwithstanding concerns expressed by many, as has been indicated here.\n  As my colleague from Connecticut has said, this happens to be a \nproblem that has impacted Connecticut, a relatively small State, but \nthis is really a national problem affecting Native Americans seeking \ntribal recognition in the States in which they are now located.\n  Let me quote from the GAO report, which has been cited, which found \nthat ``the basis for BIA's tribal recognition decisions is not always \nclear.''\n  It went on to state:\n\n       While there are set criteria that petitioners must meet to \n     be granted recognition, there is no clear guidance that \n     explains how to interpret key aspects of the criteria. For \n     example, it is not always clear what level of evidence is \n     sufficient to demonstrate a tribe's continuous existence over \n     a period of time--one of the key aspects of the criteria. As \n     a result, there is less regulatory certainty about the basis \n     for recognition decisions.\n\n  That is from a critical report by the GAO on this recognition \nprocess. That GAO critique has been seconded by the Interior \nDepartment's inspector general and, as has been noted in this debate, \neven by the past Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs.\n  Despite these critiques, there have been no real changes in the \nrecognition process to fix the problems. Instead, the status quo has \ncontinued at the BIA, with applicants experiencing long delays and \nparties in various cases dealing with decisions that they believe have \nbeen unfairly arrived at. The amendment we will vote on at 5:30 this \nafternoon is our attempt to improve this situation. Rather than letting \nthe process continue in the current manner, we ask for it to provide \nadequate procedures to ensure its legitimacy--something that would \nbenefit both the tribes and the communities and parties that surround \nthem.\n\n  I want to stress that this amendment does nothing to affect already \nrecognized Federal tribes or to hinder their economic development \nplans; nor does it change existing Federal tribal recognition laws. It \nis our hope, in fact, and has been our hope, that the Native American \ntribes might support these procedural reforms that we are recommending \nso as to buttress the legitimacy of the ultimate recognition rulings.\n  While, as my friends and colleagues from Colorado and Hawaii have \nindicated, that is not the case and, in fact, a large number of Native \nAmerican tribes have opposed this amendment, I continue to hope the \nfact that we have brought it before the Senate may encourage them, \nunder the wise and fair leadership of the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, and the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, to see if we can't \nfind common ground.\n  It seems to me no matter what side you are on in a particular \nproceeding before the BAR or BIA, you have an interest in due process \nand you have an interest in the result of the process being as broadly \ncredible as possible.\n  What our amendments would do consistent with recognition laws is to \nensure that recognition criteria are satisfied and that all affected \nparties, including affected neighboring towns, have a chance to fairly \nparticipate in the decision process. Our amendment ensures a system of \nnotice to affected parties. It assures that relevant evidence from \npetitioners and interested parties, including neighboring towns, is \nproperly considered; that a formal hearing may be requested with an \nopportunity for witnesses to be called and with other due process \nprocedures in place; that a transcript of the hearing is kept; that the \nevidence is sufficient to show the petitioner meets the seven mandatory \ncriteria of Federal regulations; and that a complete and detailed \nexplanation of the final decisions and findings of fact are published \nin the Federal Register. There is nothing very radical here. It is \nbasic due process procedural rights, all consistent with the \nestablished recognition criteria. We have not changed the recognition \ncriteria in the amendment that we proposed.\n  Under the amendment, funding available under the Interior \nappropriations bill to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the recognition \nprocess becomes available when these fundamental due process procedures \nare implemented by the Secretary of the Interior. So insofar as this is \nconsidered a moratorium, it is a moratorium, as I know Senator Dodd has \nindicated, that could end in a week if these due process changes were \nput into effect. Our amendment dictates no outcomes in any particular \ncases. It aims to ensure a fair process.\n  So I hope my colleagues will take a look at the amendment. In some \nsense the impact of the currently broken process at the BIA has been \nfelt with a particular intensity in Connecticut. But this is a national \nproblem.\n  We may not adopt this amendment today. I hope we will, but if we do \nnot, this is a problem that is not going to go away. It is going to be \nfelt more and more around the country. Again, I say our aspiration is \nto find common ground. I thank the Chairman, Senator Inouye, and \nSenator Campbell for their characteristic courtesy and respect and \nthoughtfulness. We disagree on this one. It is a disagreement in good \nfaith on both sides. I continue to express the hope that under their \nleadership, those who are concerned about the fairness of the \nrecognition process, those who are concerned about the lack of speed in \nthe process--the terrible delays--will be able to come together and \nagree on a series of reforms, and then the funding for additional staff \nat the BAR and BIA to make the promise of due process here real for all \nconcerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Colorado has 3 minutes 53 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see the majority whip. I ask unanimous \nconsent we extend the debate an additional 10 minutes, equally divided, \nso we can make some concluding remarks.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think that would be appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have made most of my comments already. \nI don't know who else will be here on the floor to speak against the \nDodd-Lieberman amendment, but I would like to respond to just two small \npoints that were made by our friend, Senator Lieberman.\n  First, though, let me thank Senator Inouye for a very eloquent \nstatement. He really does speak from the heart. When you hear him talk \nabout basic fairness and justice that American Indians deserve and \nneed, I think Senator Inouye's own experience and background as a \nJapanese-American and what his people went through in World War II \ngives him a very special insight, and certainly a very special feeling \nfor what Indian people face.\n  Let me make two very short comments on Senator Lieberman's remarks. \nHe made reference that this would not affect existing tribes. He is \nright, I guess, in some respects. But I think we need to look at that \nin historical context.\n  First of all, when the original recognition process was done--clear \nback in the early 1800s--it was done so that the Federal Government \ncould provide rations, blankets, and so on, to the Indian tribes that \nwere deprived at that time of their hunting rights and restricted to \ncertain areas. That is why it was originally set up. They had to find \nout who qualified to get some benefits, and that is what trust \nauthority is about.\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\n  It will not surprise anyone in this Chamber to know that there were \nsome people even at that time who did not want recognition. Certainly \nsome of them hid out in the hills of the Carolinas because of the Trail \nof Tears, when their cousins and brothers and fathers were rounded up \nand driven at gunpoint clear across the Nation to Oklahoma. The ones \nwho hid out in the Southeast States--would you want to tell some \ngovernment bent on killing your people you want to be recognized? Not \nlikely; that would be a pretty dumb thing to do.\n\n  There have been Indian people in some parts of this country all along \nwho were not ``recognized'' by the U.S. Government. It didn't mean they \nwere not Indian. It didn't mean anything of the sort. They knew very \nwell what would happen to them if they were so-called recognized.\n  The second point I want to make is during the 1950s, during what was \ncalled the Termination Act, the Federal Government, in its infinite \nwisdom, decided many Indian tribes were no longer tribes. I guess that \nmeant they were no longer Indians, at least not of a group of Indians. \nThat has always rather confused me because I have always likened it to \nmaybe telling African Americans that they were no longer Black. I mean, \nyou are what God made you. That's it.\n  But through the Termination Act of the 1950s--I don't remember the \nexact number, and I don't have it in my notes--as I just offhand \nremember, there were over a hundred, if not several hundred, tribes who \nwere told by the Federal Government: You are no longer Indian tribes.\n  Many of them are still trying to be rerecognized. The ones that were \nterminated in the 1950s, they have to get recognized through a \ndifferent process. They have to do it through legislation.\n  But the point is the fact that many of them that historically had \nancestors on this continent maybe for 10,000 years were being told by a \ngovernment set up by new immigrants that they were no longer Indian \ntribes still confuses me.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, for a \nvery eloquent statement. Let me also thank my colleague from Hawaii for \na very eloquent statement he has made. I would not take issue with any \ncomment he made about the relationship between the history of the U.S. \nGovernment and its treatment of Native American tribes going back to \nthe founding days of this Republic.\n  It is a sorry history in many instances and circumstances.\n  The Senator very graciously mentioned my father. Let me mention my \nmother. My mother used to tell me all the time that two wrongs do not \nmake a right.\n  That we have done a terrible injustice to Native American people over \nthe years does not justify, in my view, continuing a process that would \nallow recognition to occur where it may not be warranted. In America, \nwhere recognition should be extended and granted, the process must be \nfair. As for the recognition process--its history--my friend from \nColorado makes a very strong statement. It is something of a historic \nanomaly in many ways; that's why recognition must even occur. The fact \nis that the current process is the law of the land.\n  I can speak very directly about my own State. It is a difficult \nprocess, which is still ongoing for that matter. There are those in my \nState and others who would like to undo the recognition extended to the \nMashantucket Pequots. Books have been written about it. Popular books \nhave been written. That garnered national attention in questioning the \nrecognition of that tribe. I have disagreed with them.\n  I also know the process that the Mohican Tribe went through in my \nState. It was a very long and elaborate process, working very closely \nwith the community leaders in the towns in which they are located--\nState, as well as the National Government.\n  Our point here is not about the history, as much as concern about the \nhistory is justified. It is not about the past, as legitimate as those \narguments are. It is about today and the future.\n  Let me quote, if I can, a letter I received from the National \nCongress of American Indians.\n  By the way, the amendment that is part of the bill was considered for \nover a year and isn't written out of whole cloth. I showed this \namendment to Native Americans around the country and asked them what \nthey thought of the amendment.\n  This letter I received from Tex Hall is dated September 12 of this \nyear. He opposes the amendment. Let me be very clear. The National \nCongress of American Indians opposes the Dodd-Lieberman amendment, but \nlisten to what he says in the letter. I am reading from the second \nparagraph.\n\n       And I believe that tribal leaders agree with you it must be \n     a rigorous process requiring the petitioner to demonstrate \n     historical and continuous American Indian identity in a \n     distinct community. We believe that the process could benefit \n     from a serious review by Congress and a codification of the \n     process and the criteria.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2002.\n     Re Opportunity to Meet and Discuss Federal Recognition \n         Process.\n\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: On behalf of the more than 250 member \n     Tribal Nations of the National Congress of American Indians, \n     I write to request an opportunity to meet with you and a \n     group of tribal leaders to discuss proposals to change the \n     process for petitioning the federal government for \n     recognition as a federally-recognized Indian tribe.\n       Both the federal government and the NCAI have a \n     longstanding position that legitimate Indian tribes whose \n     status has been historically omitted should have the right to \n     petition for formal recognition by the federal government. \n     And I believe that tribal leaders agree with you it must be a \n     rigorous process requiring the petitioner to demonstrate \n     historical and continuous American Indian identity in a \n     distinct community. We believe that the process could benefit \n     from a serious review by Congress and a codification of the \n     process and the criteria.\n       The current process is plagued by an enormous backlog, and \n     some petitioners have been waiting over two decades since \n     they submitted their initial petitions. NCAI believes that \n     the federal government should make the resources available so \n     that petitions can be processed in a timely way.\n       As you know, we do not agree with your pending amendment. \n     We believe it would create an indefinite moratorium on the \n     recognition process. Because there is no incentive for the \n     Secretary to actually create the new process, the petitioning \n     tribes would be put in limbo for additional years, adding to \n     the unjustness of the already interminable federal delays.\n       In addition, by attempting to create a moratorium on \n     federal tribal recognition through the introduction of an \n     amendment to the Interior Appropriation bill, this amendment \n     attempts to circumvent the Congress' procedures for dealing \n     with complex Indian issues like federal recognition. Such a \n     drastic change in federal Indian policy should be referred to \n     the authorizing committees for development of the record and \n     an opportunity for broader participation and deliberation. \n     While we greatly appreciate the contacts from your office, \n     two days notice is not nearly enough time to engage tribal \n     leaders in a meaningful discussion.\n       As I mentioned above, I would very much like to meet with \n     you to discuss these matters in greater detail and would be \n     willing to put together a small group of tribal leaders to \n     participate in the discussion. I believe that we should also \n     include Senators Inouye and Campbell in the discussion, so \n     that this issue can be prepared for review by the Senate \n     Committee on Indian Affairs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tex G. Hall,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleagues ought to know that in the \nconcluding paragraphs of the letter he disagrees with this amendment.\n  But his conclusion about a process that needs repair is one that is \nembraced almost by all.\n  My good friend from Colorado has legislation pending that would move \nthe present recognition process from the BIA to a new commission. I \nagree with him on that approach. I believe it will take time to get \nthat done. I presume there will be regulations and the like appended to \nit.\n  It is not a question of debate about whether or not the process is in \nneed of repair. It appears that everybody agrees with them because of \nwhat has happened and the various circumstances. We are talking about \n222\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\npetitions, and maybe more--all of which may be legitimate. But \nshouldn't we know in the end that there has been a process followed \nfairly by all and that there will be at the end of the day a conclusion \nthat is just and reasonable and will withstand the test of time? That \nis all we are suggesting.\n  The poignancy, I suppose, is because it impacts my State. I am aware \nof it because of what's going on in my State. If I had no petitions \npending in my State, I wouldn't be standing here. I wouldn't be aware \nof the issue. But we are aware of it.\n  I am worried about the future for the very same reasons that history \nsuggests--that we will find out again that there is unnecessary \ndivision, hostility, and resentment growing. That should not be the \ncase.\n  I strongly urge that this amendment not be defeated--I suspect that \nit may be--and that we do something soon to repair a process that looks \ntoo cavalier. If there is just going to be recognition of all petitions \ncoming forward, why don't we just say so straight out? If there is \ngoing to be a process to demonstrate satisfaction of some particular \ncriteria, let us make sure it works. As it is now, it is catch as catch \ncan. Sometimes the rules apply. Sometimes they don't. Of the seven \ncriteria, some we follow rigorously, and some we don't at all. Some are \napplied in some cases and not in others. Some petitioners are granted, \nsome are denied, and some are brought together. There are third choices \ninexplicably made.\n  This isn't working right. It needs to be repaired. We can do that in \na very short order because we recommend no new criteria. We just say \ncodify the existing criteria, put it in shape, and let everybody know \nwhat the process is working so they can go through it in a reasonable \nway. It is outrageous that they should have to wait two or three \ndecades for recognition.\n  The fact is that we have supported additional resources here to the \nagency to try to provide the technical staff so decisions can be made \nwithin a reasonable amount of time. With these resources, people can be \nheard and the agency can reach final conclusions that I believe all \nAmericans can support.\n  That is what this amendment tries to do--nothing more than that and \nnothing less than that, but nothing more than that.\n  Again, I suspect the amendment will be defeated, but I hope the end \nresult is that we can get a better system. My State may regrettably \nfind itself with some petitions granted that do not deserve to be, but \nmaybe that is the price you pay for doing something about broader \nreform.\n  I regret that there had to be a disagreement between people who \nsupport Native Americans. I admire them immensely. But as I look down \nthe road here, I worry that if we don't straighten this situation out \nthat we could find the situation getting worse. I don't want to see \nthat happen. For those reasons, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if the Senate should rule that the votes \nagainst the amendment prevail, may I assure my colleagues that the \ncommittee stands ready to consider any and all suggestions on how to \nreform this process. It is a scandal at this time. We realize that. It \nshould be changed.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion entered to reconsider the vote whereby cloture \nwas not invoked on amendment No. 4480 is agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider is agreed to.\n  There will now be 60 minutes for debate with respect to that cloture \nmotion, with the time equally divided and controlled by the two leaders \nor their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republicans have still 10 minutes as if \nin morning business. The time is yielded on this Dodd amendment, but \nthere are still 10 minutes of morning business to which Republicans are \nentitled. Do they intend to use that?\n  Of course, we will have time later this evening, as we always do. I \nask unanimous consent that we move forward, as the Chair announced, and \nthat the time allocated be disposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, point of information: What time will the \nvote on the Dodd amendment take place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At approximately 5:37.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are on H.R. \n5093. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate cloture \nmotion having been presented under Rule XXII, the Chair directs the \nclerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Byrd \n     amendment No. 4480, as amended, to H.R. 5093, the Department \n     of Interior Appropriations bill, 2003.\n       Debbie Stabenow, Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, Evan Bayh, \n     Mark Dayton, Jeff Bingaman, Jim Jeffords, Joseph Lieberman, \n     Bill Nelson of Florida, Blanche L.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand that between now and 5:30 we \nhave been allotted time to debate the Craig-Domenici amendment as it \nrelates to the cloture motion on the Byrd amendment on the Interior \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I will allot myself 10 minutes to debate this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for several weeks now, the Senate has been \nconsidering the Interior appropriations bill, of which the Byrd \namendment to that bill would put critical fire money back into our \nForest Service budgets that have been badly depleted by the season that \nwe are hopefully beginning to leave, which is known as the fire season, \nespecially in the Great Basin West. That money is critical.\n  But it was because of our concern about fires and the wildfires that \nhave swept through the West this summer that I and Senator Domenici and \na good many other western colleagues joined in working with the \nadministration, and for a good long while in a very bipartisan way, to \nsee if there was not some middle ground to create some flexibility to \ngo into those worst fuel-laden lands and to develop a thinning and \ncleaning process that would be environmentally sensitive and at the\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\nsame time effectively reduce the fuel loading that has gone on there \nthat has precipitated in some of these very dramatic wildfires that \nhave occurred out West this summer.\n  I recite, again, for the record, we have burned well over 6.5 million \nacres to date of wildlife habitat and watershed, possibly several \nmillion acres of old-growth forests. We have lost about 3,000 homes, \nprivate homes of our citizens. Over 25 people, I believe--26 or 27 at \nleast--have been killed in relation to these fires. It is without \nquestion a national emergency, a national crisis. I almost have the \nsense that we have fiddled a bit over the last couple of weeks while \nour forests have burned.\n  There are still fires burning in California. As we speak, acreage \nburning in a national forest outside of Los Angeles over the weekend \nhas consumed over 12,000 acres and has threatened numerous homes. Yet \nbecause of some special interests here and phenomenal allegations or \nstatements made in the media over the last several weeks, you would \nthink I and others were trying to precipitate a whole new logging \nprogram for the forests and that somehow was evil, instead of the very \nlimited, targeted thinning and cleaning that we think could and should \nbe utilized to reduce the fuel loading on these forests that has \ncreated these firestorms.\n  I have here a variety of editorials and news comments from major \npapers across the Nation. I am fascinated by words such as ``nose under \nthe tent,'' ``intent to allow logging companies to be turned loose once \nagain in our national forests.'' My reaction is, can those who write \nthe news read the news?\n  Can they not read the Craig-Domenici amendment and understand that it \nis phenomenally limited, that it would require very specific language \nby the U.S. Forest Service, that there would be the right to go to \nFederal court and block any of these actions, that we have tied no \none's hands other than to say that on these limited, targeted acres, we \nwill not allow appeals, nor will we allow a temporary court injunction \nthat has locked up tens of thousands of acres already, many of them \nthat burned this summer, from the ability to get in and thin and clean \nthem?\n  No. Those who write the news can read the news. But oftentimes those \nwho write the news choose a bias that they think is popular, and in the \nend our forests burn. Thousands of homes are lost, lives endangered, \nand we struggle here at the Federal level to attempt to make some \nslight adjustments in public policy to return a state of health to our \nnational forests.\n  Last week, our colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, came to \nthe floor and offered an alternative amendment. He did not introduce \nit. He laid it before us as something that could be viewed as an \nalternative. I began to study it to try to see if it was a reasonable \nalternative or whether in fact it would deny any activity, if it was \nsimply a Trojan horse in the reality of, would it do something similar \nto what the other Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and I had \nproposed.\n  After thorough examination of that, I must tell you I believe the \nBingaman amendment to be just that, a Trojan horse. Not only does it \nlimit dramatically what you could be able to do, it creates some \ncategorical exemptions. And then it does something else that is very \nimportant in the language of the law or the policy we are debating as \nto whether it frees the hands of the forest managers within these \nlimited areas to do what is necessary to limit this fuel loading.\n  It is a term called extraordinary circumstance; in other words, there \nwon't be any appeals based on the standards of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, or any temporary court injunctions, unless \nthere is an extraordinary circumstance.\n  That is a provision in administrative regulations that governs the \nmanagement activities of forests that is really quite clear. Let me \ncount the number of ways an extraordinary circumstance could occur. It \nis literally in the eye of the beholder, in the eye of the person who \nwants to file the appeal. It probably broadens the effective \nopportunity to bring an appeal to any of these actions on our public \nlands when, on the other hand, the Senator from New Mexico would \nsuggest he was creating greater flexibility.\n  Organizations such as the NRDC or the Earth Justice Defense League, \nthe Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and the Southwest Center for \nBiodiversity clearly could use this as the opportunity for which they \nhave already used the law, to lock up any effort or nearly all efforts \nin attempting to deal with what we would hope would be an effective way \nof thinning and cleaning.\n  You have heard me speak in the last days about the total amount of \nacreage out there that is in crisis at this moment. We have about 74.5 \nmillion acres that are at high risk, and while we have that many, \nSenator Domenici and I, and many of the colleagues who have joined with \nus--I now see the Senator from Arizona in the Chamber, who is a \ncosponsor, and the Senator from Montana--have asked that we only be \nable to deal with about 10,000,000 acres, not opening the forest wide \nopen but a limited number, for a very real reason.\n  I believe it is fundamentally important that we show the American \npeople that when we stand on the floor of the Senate and talk about not \nentering roadless areas and protecting old growth and merely thinning \nand cleaning and bringing down the fuel loads and moving them out of \nthe forest, we want to prove it, we do want the American people to see \nthat what we say is, in fact, what we mean, and that the U.S. Forest \nService will go forward in a limited way to do just exactly that.\n  Do I want to prove the editorial writers of some of America's press \nwrong? You bet I do. Because they are wrong, and they flat know it. In \nfact, it reminds me of that news reporter from NPR who e-mailed some of \nour environmental groups and said: Get me the worst case scenario so I \ncan disprove the logic or the arguments of the Senator from Idaho. And \nthe environmental group writes back and says: We can't give you any \nworst case scenarios because we have them all on appeal and we have it \nshut down so they don't exist.\n  So in other words, when we are concerned that the appeals route would \nbe used in these limited cases, the environmental groups have responded \nthat they are already using them, that they are not tolerating the \nactivities of thinning and cleaning.\n  So it is obvious why we would want to step forward and say, let us \nuse this limited opportunity to thin and clean and then show the \nAmerican people that there is a better way of conducting forest health \nand allowing our forests to once again rejuvenate themselves for \nwatershed, for wildlife habitat.\n  My colleagues are here in the Chamber to speak. Let me conclude.\n  Even if the public policy of our country allowed it, 8 to 10 million \nacres to be thinned on a 1.5- to 2-year basis, and average that out \nover the next 20 years, we would still--because of the health of our \nforests today and the fuel loading that exists and the bug kill and the \ndead and dying--lose anywhere from 5 to 6 to 7 million acres a year to \nwildfire. That is the reality of the environment in which we live, the \nreality of the environment we are now trying to change so slightly to \nreturn forest health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield myself 5 minutes. I know there are other Senators \non the floor wanting to speak. I will just speak common sense.\n  Legalese is not my expertise. I leave it to those trained in the \ndiscipline, as most of my expertise was on the farm.\n  This is a very troubling issue for one simple reason: What if anybody \nwere allowed to put in a garden and at the same time were prohibited \nfrom doing any weeding or watering or doing anything to make it \nproduce--prevented from fundamental attention?\n  I am wondering if they would enjoy the fruits of their labor when \nharvest time comes. They say history is the greatest blueprint to the \nfuture. Throughout history, all creation on this earth, in order to \nensure its internal survival, it must have some kind of economic worth.\n  Now, that sounds hard and cold, doesn't it? But it happens to be a \nvery true fact. There are those who somehow choose to look at our \nnatural resources, or a natural landscape, and put it over into the \ncolumn called ``spiritual''--not logical, not economic.\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\nOur forests cannot survive the ages with that approach. Under that \nphilosophy, what will survive longer than the forests is the pine bark \nbeetle. Fires will continue to exist--hotter--taking from the soil what \ncannot be replaced by anything but old growth.\n  So as we approach this problem, I ask for common sense. What we are \ntrying to do here is a commonsense approach to settle our disagreements \non how we manage the forests. We hire the U.S. Forest Service to do \nthat. When their management practices are questioned, the burden of \nproof falls on them to prove why that management practice will work, \nbut I see no proof offered by those making the appeal that the Forest \nService plan doesn't work. That is what we are trying to do--get it to \nan impartial environment to settle those differences. That is all we \nare asking. We are not changing any law, no environmental law, not the \nEnvironmental Protection Act, not the Clean Water Act, not the Clean \nAir Act, not the Forest Management Act. We are not changing any law. We \nare not denying anybody's right to appeal or to have their day either \non an administrative appeal or a judicial appeal. We are not changing \nthat.\n  That was changed, however, with regard to South Dakota. So we are not \ngoing that far. What we are saying is we are going to put the ball on \nthe 50-yard line, which requires the burden of proof both from the land \nmanagers and by those who would disagree with them. That is all we are \nasking. And then the third thing we are asking is that we get a vote, a \ncommonsense vote.\n  The American people, every night this summer, watched their forests \nburn--every night. Such a waste. There was not only the loss of the \nresource, but the loss of the wildlife and the habitat and the water \nquality because the rains will come and the snows will come and the mud \nwill slide. Now, I don't know any other way to put that other than it \nhas been my experience in my years of working and living in an \nenvironment of sun, water, and soil, and what it produces. So I am \nsorry that we have to educate and remind people that what we see \noutside in our natural environment does change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an editorial of the Arizona Republic this morning \nentitled ``Forest Plan Has Merits.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Forest Plan Has Merits\n\n       Interior Secretary Gale Norton may be correct about the \n     desperate conditions of America's western forests. And she \n     may be right, too, in her pitch that President Bush's Healthy \n     Forests initiative is a reasonable plan for bringing them \n     back to health.\n       But the Interior secretary--indeed, the entire Bush \n     administration--is over-optimistic in the extreme if they \n     truly believe environmentalists are going to leap on board \n     with it.\n       In Phoenix last week for a Native American economic \n     development summit, Norton detailed for the Editorial Board \n     elements of the initiative, which would treat about 10 \n     million forested acres deemed in critical shape.\n       Much of the plan is inspired by the work of such Arizona \n     forest scientists as Wally Covington of Northern Arizona \n     University and Stephen Campbell of the University of Arizona, \n     both of whom have conducted or contributed to landmark forest \n     management studies.\n       Covington has proposed thinning Arizona forests to 19th \n     century conditions; Campbell's Blue Ridge Demonstration \n     Project envisions the way to do it: By authorizing private-\n     sector ``stewards'' who would perform commercial bio-mass \n     extraction. That is, private firms that would do mostly \n     small-tree logging, cleaning the forest of fuels and putting \n     the wood they chop to innovative uses. In Phoenix, Norton \n     passed around some intriguing examples of wood products \n     produced from small-diameter trees.\n       Already, though, critics are labeling the proposal as a \n     tree grab on behalf of the timber industry.\n       At the heart of their objections is the vast territory \n     targeted by Bush for treatment and the means he proposes to \n     accomplish it: Providing 10-year contracts to the \n     ``stewards'' and placing restrictions on the burdensome \n     review process that so many thinning projects over the years \n     have had to endure.\n       Among the many Forest Service thinning projects reviewed \n     and appealed to death was the 7,000-acre Baca Ecosystem \n     Management Area in northeastern Arizona. After two years of \n     appeals and lawsuits, only 300 acres of the Baca project were \n     treated by the time the ``Rodeo-Chediski'' holocaust roared \n     through. Today, 90 percent of the Baca area is a wasteland of \n     dead, blackened stumps and sterilized soils.\n       Healthy Forests is on the right road.\n       Democrats in Congress are coalescing around a far more \n     limited plan that accepts many of Bush's premises but \n     restricts the bio-mass extraction to forests near \n     communities. That doesn't address the plague of deep-forest \n     destruction, and not just by fire. Federal wildlife officials \n     have identified 46 species of fish and birds that are \n     declining in population because of the thicketlike density of \n     the deep forests.\n       The president's ``stewardship'' proposal deserves \n     consideration. It seems tailor-made for Arizona, which today \n     has no logging industry at all. Just thick, tinder-dry \n     forests waiting to be consumed.\n       The forest need good stewards. Healthy Forests might become \n     a way to find them.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this editorial points out the plan that \nPresident Bush has proposed, as largely reflected in the proposal \nSenator Burns and Senator Craig and others have been talking about, is \nthe way to scientifically manage our forests. We are bragging a little \nbit in Arizona because one of the scientists who pioneered this \ntechnique is Dr. Wally Covington of Northern Arizona University at \nFlagstaff. He and Stephen Campbell of the University of Arizona \nconducted these landmark management studies and demonstrated that by \nreturning our forests to the conditions in which they existed 100 years \nago, we can save them from disease, insect infestation, and \ncatastrophic wildfire.\n  What that entails is going in and mechanically thinning and \nremoving--thinning the small-diameter trees that clog the forests and \nremoving that and the other debris from the forest--cleaning up the \nforests, in effect; then when that debris has largely been removed, \nintroducing fire through a prescribed burn in the wet, cooler months of \nOctober or November so the fire doesn't get out of control. There is \nnot nearly as much fuel to burn and it is cooler. Then, at that point, \nbasically we let nature take its course. Say the next summer a \nlightening strikes a tree and starts a fire. What is going to happen \nafter this debris has been cleaned out and the fuel has been removed? \nIt will move along the grass and it may burn the grass and a few pieces \nof dry limbs and debris on the floor; but since most of it has been \ncleaned up, it is not going to create a crown fire, which causes all \nthe damage.\n  Since most of the small-diameter trees have been removed, it is not \ngoing to have that ladder of trees to climb up to the canopy of the big \ntrees.\n  What you have seen on television is the preheating of these big \nponderosa pines from the forest fire. Then when the fire goes through \nthe smaller trees, it climbs up the ladder of the forest into the \ncanopy of the big trees and explodes into those giant fireballs we have \nall seen and have been sickened by. That is what happened in Arizona \nthis year, when fires devastated an area the size of the State of Rhode \nIsland. That is how much burned in Arizona. When you look at the \nmoonscape-type of environment that now exists, you are sickened by the \nreality that much of this could have been prevented.\n  It turns out there was a project that had been proposed by the Forest \nService in this area about 3 years ago, and there were about 2 years of \nlawsuits and appeals by environmental groups to stop this so-called \nBaca ecosystem management area. Well, the fire came through and only \nabout 300 acres had been permitted to be treated by the time the fire \ncame through because of the appeals that had been filed by these \nenvironmental groups, as a result of which about 90 percent of the Baca \narea has been burned. It is now nothing but sterilized soil and \nblackened tree trunks with no branches or pine needles on them \nwhatsoever.\n  So the filing of the appeal by these environmental groups resulted in \nabout 90 percent of this area burning rather than being treated. Some \nof the environmental groups will say they want to protect endangered \nspecies or old-growth trees. Well, they protected neither in this case. \nThe fire came through and wiped them all out. Why? Because we haven't \nbeen able to thin and do prescribed burning. We could not cut out that \ndog hair thicket that exists in the forests because they have not been \ntreated before. It is called dog\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nhair thicket because they say a dog cannot run through it without \nleaving half of its hair behind in the snarly little trees that are \ngrowing in the area of the forest that needs to be treated.\n  What happens when the area is treated? You have cut out a lot of the \nsmall-diameter material and taken out the debris, and you open up the \nforest to the sunlight. You create an opportunity for grasses to grow, \nand you reintroduce butterflies, birds, insects, and small and large \nanimals to the area.\n  All of a sudden, instead of a dead and dying ecosystem, you have \ncreated a very vibrant and healthy natural ecosystem.\n  What is our goal with respect to the trees? Our goal is to try to \npreserve as many of the old-growth and large-diameter trees as \npossible. That is what is done when we thin the forests the way we are \ntalking about doing.\n  So why haven't we been able to come to some compromise on the \nlegislation we are talking about to enable us to do this? The reason is \nthere are radical environmental groups that, frankly, have control of \nsome of the politics of this issue with some of our colleagues and have \npersuaded them that we are going to open it up to unfettered logging, \nwe are going to log the old-growth forests, we are going to clearcut \nthe western forests, we are going to take away any opportunity for \npeople to have input as to what is done, we are going to destroy all \nthe environment for endangered species, and so on.\n  All of that is simply wrong. It is not true. We are talking about \nlegislation that has very significant limits. These thinning projects \nhave to be approved by all of the different groups, the so-called \nstakeholders, the environmental process, the NEPA process where the \nforest plan has to have been followed.\n  The whole point of the stewardship projects, as they are called, is \nto enable us to go in and clean out the forests, leaving the large \ntrees. That is the whole point.\n  Under our legislation citizens would be permitted to file a lawsuit \nin court and appeal the plan if they want to. Nothing stops them from \ndoing that. All they have to do is point out to the judge: Look, the \nobject here was to save these big trees and cut out the underbrush. \nWell, they are not doing that in this case, if there ever were such a \nplan proposed.\n  I do not think they want to have to face up to the reality of what we \nhave proposed, which is a very reasonable way to manage our forests. In \nmany respects, they would rather cut off their nose to spite their \nface. That is a phrase I used earlier today, and one of my young staff \nsaid: What does that mean? It is a phrase my grandmother used to say. \nIt means you are basically so selfish about what you want to do that \nyou are not willing to look at the larger picture, which would enable \nyou to save yourself if you would apply management techniques.\n  We could apply this management technique to thin the forests and do \nprescribed burning and, thus, prevent the kind of disease or forest \nfires that in the past have ravaged these forests and absolutely wiped \nout the habitats. Some people would rather have the fires exist to \ncatastrophically burn the entire area and ruin the habitat for the \nendangered species and all other species because at least that did not \npermit the loggers to log big trees. That is right, it did not permit \nthe cutting of any kind of trees.\n  What was the result? It burned the entire forest. So the entire \necosystem is now dead, and it will take literally hundreds of years to \ncome back and produce those big, beautiful trees we all want to save.\n  It is a sorry state of affairs that we have not been able to achieve \na result on this issue. I hoped we would have been able to do so. I \nhope my colleagues will not vote for cloture when that vote comes in \nthe next 10 or 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I see no one else in the Chamber to yield \ntime, so I ask unanimous consent to speak an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for an additional 5 minutes.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will go on to explore this a little bit \nmore.\n  One of the techniques of the opponents of what we propose is to say--\nwe all agree with the management. I have not heard anybody say they \ndisagree with this thinning and prescribed burning management \ntechnique, but they want it done in an area called the urban/wildland \ninterface; that is to say, where the forest meets communities--summer \nhomes, small towns, so on. We will thin an area a quarter of a mile, \nmaybe half a mile, around these communities and structures and, \ntherefore, save them from catastrophic wildfire; that ought to do the \ntrick.\n  That will not do the trick. In the first place, it is a nice \nsentiment to try to save small communities and buildings, but that is \nonly part of what we are about here. We are literally about saving the \nforests themselves, the entire ecosystem, the place where all the flora \nand fauna live and survive, where the endangered species live. Most of \nthe endanger species do not live right on the edge of the communities.\n  Why would we not want to create a healthy environment for the \nendangered species and for the other flora and fauna in the forests? \nWhy would we not want to treat in the middle of the forest rather than \njust along the roads, by the homes or small communities?\n  Of course, we want to save them from catastrophic wildfires, but the \nbest way to do that is to treat the entire forest so the fires do not \nget a big momentum to roll into the communities.\n  We had the unfortunate experience with the Rodeo-Chediski fire this \nlast summer where the fire was so large and burning so rapidly with \nsuch intense heat that it was skipping right over areas that had been \ntreated. While it did not burn those areas, fortunately, because they \nhad been treated, it went on to burn other parts of the forest.\n  It is no salvation necessarily that we treat a small perimeter around \nbuildings or communities. That is not necessarily going to save them \nfrom fire. Even if it does, as I said, we still have not treated the \nrest of the forest, which is the whole object of returning health to \nthe forest. That is why you cannot just limit this thinning project to \nthe areas immediately surrounding communities. We will have done \nnothing to save the rest of the forest from insects, disease, \nmistletoe, and catastrophic wildfire that will destroy the trees and \nthe habitat for the mammals, birds, insects, and the fish that live in \nthe area we want to preserve. That is why it is no answer to say: Let's \ndo treatment in the urban interface area.\n  There were also attempts to put limits on how many board feet of \ntrees could be removed from these areas--250,000 board feet in an area, \nfor example; I think up to 1 million board feet in an area that had \nburned. The board feet of timber calculated to exist in the Rodeo-\nChediski burned area is 100 million board feet. What was offered was \nliterally a drop in the bucket.\n  If we are going to salvage the timber that was burned, as the White \nMountain Apache Tribe is permitted to do on its part of the forest that \nwas burned, then we are going to have to have special relief because \nthere is no time to do all the studies that are necessary if anybody \nfiles an appeal. If they do not file an appeal, then we can salvage \nthat timber, just as the White Mountain Apache Tribe is doing. If \nsomeone files an appeal, there is no way to get to the timber before \nthe insects get to it. That is the choice we have. That is why we were \nso anxious to get something done now instead of waiting.\n  As I said, it does not appear we have reached a consensus to do that, \nand that is too bad because as the editorial I just put in the Record \npoints out, we do not have time to waste. We have to treat these \nforests now or they will be subject to burning next year, and, in any \nevent, we will not be able to save them from the diseases that have \ninfected many of the forests today.\n  If there are others to speak, I will be happy to relinquish the floor \nto them. In that regard, I suggest the absence of a quorum, but if no \none appears thereafter for a minute or two, then I will reclaim the \nfloor and speak some more.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have checked with the Senator from West \nVirginia, who has indicated he does not wish to speak at this time, and \ntherefore I will go ahead until one of our colleagues comes.\n  I want to tell a couple of stories about what I have personally \nobserved in our forests, and it might be of interest to others who \nperhaps do not have these same kinds of trees in their States.\n  The country's largest ponderosa pine forest extends through the belt \nof Arizona that runs literally from the Grand Canyon all the way to New \nMexico and then goes on into New Mexico. These trees look a little like \nthe giant sequoias in California. They are not quite as big, but when \nthey reach 300 or 400 years of maturity, they are very large, over 30 \ninches in diameter. They have a yellow bark with beautiful big \ncanopies, much like the sequoias in California. These are the trees we \nare all trying to preserve.\n  I went to an area that was BLM land north of the Grand Canyon after \nSecretary Bruce Babbitt, then-Secretary of Interior, had authorized a \nthinning project for that area in the neighborhood of Mount Trumble. \nSecretary Babbitt was able to do this because, as Secretary of the \nInterior, he had control over the BLM land, and he basically ordered \nthat it be done, which was a good thing, too, because this is an area \nwith which he was familiar. He had gone hiking throughout the area many \ntimes. He knew how desperately the area was in need of this treatment.\n  So I went up there to see the work that was being done, and the BLM \nofficer said: I have to show you this. Come look. And we drove to an \narea where it was just as thick as could be, with tiny trees about this \nsize. There must have been thousands per acre. You could hardly wind \nyour way through the forest. None of them was more than 15 or 20 feet \nhigh, if that. They were not very pretty. They precluded any grass from \ngrowing. There were no animals, obviously, that could wind their way \nthrough it. It was a pretty sterile environment, and they were \nobviously crowding out other kinds of trees that one would have \npreferred to see grow there.\n  We came to this huge ponderosa pine, one of the biggest trees I had \never seen other than a redwood or a sequoia. The boughs literally came \nall the way down to the ground. All around this tree was this brush, \nthese little scrub trees--maybe as tall as I am, maybe a little bit \nhigher--with trunks 3 or 4 inches around. It was literally a tinder \nbox.\n  This BLM agent said: We have to clear this stuff away immediately. \nAny spark anywhere near here is going to set off a fire that is going \nto come all the way through. It is going to run right up the boughs of \nthis tree and destroy this beautiful old tree.\n  He told me there were many more in this same area, and that is why we \nhad to hurry up and get this area treated.\n  That is what we are trying to do. We are not going to cut that tree \nor any other trees that even approximate that size. The object is to \nclear out all the other stuff so these big beautiful trees can continue \nto grow in a healthy state, they will not have the competition for air \nand water and nutrients from all of these little trees, and there will \nthen be grasses reintroduced, the animals can come up, as well as the \nbirds and the butterflies.\n\n  All of the studies by Dr. Covington that I mentioned earlier have \ndemonstrated that the species come back within a year. The pitch \ncontent of the trees is enhanced significantly, so they are impervious \nto the bark beetles. The protein content of the grass is increased by \nan order of magnitude, so the elk and the deer come back. When all of \nthe little mammals come back, then the hawks and the eagles come back, \nthe butterflies begin to pollinate, and all of a sudden there are \nhundreds of more species of flowers and weeds and grasses than there \nwere before, and there is a park-like condition where there are far \nfewer trees per acre but it is to the carrying capacity of the land.\n  So there may only be 150 or 250 trees per acre at that point, but \nthey are all beautiful trees that are going to be healthy and in an \nenvironment where the rest of the forests can survive as opposed to the \nkind of thing about which I was talking.\n  Now why would people object to doing that? I had a group of \nenvironmentalists come into my office, and I asked them: Don't you \nagree that this is the right science? And they finally said: Yes.\n  I then said: Why won't you do it?\n  They said: Well, you do have to have commercial companies come in and \ndo this thinning; right?\n  I said: Yes, of course.\n  And they do have to make a profit; right?\n  And I said: Yes.\n  And they are not going to work for free. They have to make some \nmoney.\n  I said: You don't object to that, do you?\n  They said: No, but what we are worried about is that 25, 30, or 40 \nyears after all of this is done and you have treated all of the forests \nthat need to be treated this way, then they will turn their chain saws \non the big trees because they will want to save their jobs and save \ntheir mills and stay in business, and that is what we are concerned \nabout.\n  I was dumbfounded at the suggestion that that would actually happen. \nIf all of us who want to save the forests are as concerned in 40 years \nas we are now--and there is no reason to believe we will not--none of \nthat would ever be permitted to happen. This again falls into the ``cut \noff your nose to spite your face'' category. In order to achieve \nsomething good, we are going to have the potential of something bad \noccurring 40 years down the road, a potential that is so small that it \nis just unthinkable it would ever happen? But because of that little \npotential in their minds, they are going to prevent us from treating \nthe patient now?\n  It seems very illogical. It is like saying we are not going to treat \nthe patient's cancer now because the patient will live but eventually \nthe patient is going to die; therefore, there is no point in treating \nthe patient now.\n  It does not make sense to me, and that is why I think it is a shame \nwe have not been able to reach some kind of agreement on the kind of \nplan we were talking about that would have limited the amount of \nacreage that would be treated. It would have limited it to those areas \nthat are so-called class 3 areas, which are the ones most in need of \ntreatment where the danger of catastrophic wildfire is the greatest. We \nare not even talking about the class 2 or class 1 areas, just class 3.\n  Within that, it would be further limited in the legislation we have \nbeen discussing. We were even willing to limit it to areas of municipal \nwatersheds and urban interface as long as those were broadly enough \ndefined to include the kind of forests we are talking about here, the \npart of the area that needs to be treated.\n  None of that was acceptable to those groups that do not want us to \ntreat the forests. As a result, we are going to have another year pass, \npresumably, unless we are able to do something next spring, where we \nare subject to these catastrophic wildfires and the forest continues to \ndeteriorate.\n  At what point, do we finally say, it is worth it to go in and treat \nthese forests? Since there is not enough money in the world to pay \nAmeriCorps volunteers to go in and do this by one-half acre at a time, \nwe have to have commercial enterprises that are able to go in and take \nout enough product that they can stay in business. That product can be \nvery small diameter product. It can be poles for construction of \ncabins. It can be 2-by-4-sized timber. It can be the chipped product \nthat makes fiberboard. In some cases, they may get to medium-sized \ntrees that can actually produce some timber. But if so, why not? If the \ncarrying capacity of the acre is such that some of the trees should be \nremoved, even the so-called medium-sized maybe even 15 or 20 inches in \ndiameter, why wouldn't one do that if what they were leaving were still \nthe very large growth trees we are all talking about protecting?\n  Senator Craig made the offer that at least 10 of the biggest old-\ngrowth trees would have to be left. We can probably multiply that and \nsay 100. The bottom line is, those are the trees we are trying to \nleave. So if the carrying capacity of the land will carry 100, 150, or \n200 of those trees, that is how many would be left. Nobody is trying to \ncut the big beautiful trees down.\n  In the areas Senator Domenici and I represent, it is a dry enough \ncondition in Arizona and New Mexico that we cannot stand many more \nsummers of\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\ndrought before these forests are going to be all burned up. That is why \nwe have been so disappointed at not being able to get into those \nforests now and begin this process of taking out the dead and dying \ntimber and cutting out the small-diameter timber that is precluding the \nrest from growing.\n  I saw the treatment area we have been experimenting with in Arizona. \nI saw the results of this thinning, and the species that have come back \nare just amazing--the birds and the butterflies and the wildflowers. It \nis incredible what can be done if this is actually permitted to go \nforward, and so I hope there is a way to do it. I regret we have not \nbeen able to find that way yet.\n  I thank Senator Craig and Senator Domenici for their work, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl, Senator Reid, and \nSenator Craig for commenting on the Domenici-Craig amendment, on which \nthe Senator has joined from the very beginning.\n  I hope everyone will understand this is a very serious situation. We \nhonestly believe there is a compromise that would work, that would \nprove that we can clean up parts of our forest without in any way \ndamaging the so-called old forest trees, doing it in almost a manicured \nfashion so long as it is understood what was permitted to do.\n  It is imperative we send a signal to the American people, not all of \nwhom are in the West. Those in America who saw the fires from a \ndistance know something is wrong. They probably know it got in this \ncondition over many years and will not be fixed tomorrow. They probably \nconcluded we ought to try to fix it.\n  We are trying to have a year consistent with good rules and good \nsolid approach to management so we can start this process so the users \nof the forest, and those who recreate, graze cattle, have forests in \ntheir backyard, all understand we can begin this cleanup process and \nmove in the right direction so we can start a more major cleanup next \nyear when we try to put new policies into effect to save the forests \nand not see them go up in flames.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I know the vote is pending. We all want to \nsee the Interior appropriations bill move on. I have said to Senator \nReid what we normally do with a second-degree amendment is give it a \nvote. We certainly would like that vote on our amendment. We think it \nis appropriate. We think it is within the rules. It is a responsible \nway to dispose of this issue and move on. I hope we get to that vote. \nWe think it is right. It is appropriate. It is within the rules.\n  It is important for the Congress and this Senate to speak to the \nissue of forest health and do so in some form. We think the amendment \nis adequate in that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is on his way \nand wishes to speak on this matter. The Senator from West Virginia has \n22 minutes, and Senator Wellstone wishes to speak. We will see what \nhappens.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend and colleague, \nSenator Byrd, yielding time.\n  I will speak briefly about the forests and the fire-thinning \nproposals and the fire-risk reduction proposals pending in the Senate. \nOne amendment Senator Craig proposed is an amendment to the Byrd \namendment to the bill. That certainly is a worthy proposal, in many \nrespects. I don't agree with all aspects of it. I have offered an \nalternative that I think makes more sense. I am glad to go into the \ndetail. I have done that once in the Senate, and I am glad to do it \nagain.\n  Procedurally, people need to realize there is no reason we should be \nholding up action on this bill or on the Byrd amendment because of the \nissue of forest thinning. The forest-thinning proposal Senator Craig is \noffering can be offered as an amendment to the bill. My proposal can be \noffered as an amendment to the bill. We can get a good debate on those \ntwo proposals. I would hope we could come together around a single \nproposal. We have been working to do that. Either way, there is no \nreason going forward with the Byrd amendment should be in any way \nimpeded by the need to resolve this forest-thinning issue. We can \nresolve the forest thinning issue on separate amendments and have the \ndebate appropriate to that.\n  I believe on the merits what I proposed is a better way to go as an \namendment to an appropriations bill because it does not make major \nchanges in the underlying law. It does not make major changes in the \nauthority for Federal courts. For that reason, I hope when we do get to \na vote on forest-thinning proposals I will have a chance to persuade my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is also my understanding that under the procedures now \nbefore the Senate--regarding the drought assistance measure, which \npassed by 79 votes--if this vote does not go, that money that we voted \nto approve for the farms is gone for those who are desperate for the \nmoney all over the country; is that true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, I agree entirely with the \nSenator from Nevada. It is very important to Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle for the drought relief assistance to be made available in \nshort order. I hope very much we can move ahead with that.\n  We can also do this forest thinning issue. I am not suggesting we \ncomplete action on this bill absent completion on the forest thinning, \nbut we can do separate amendments. Senator Craig can offer his \namendment to the bill; I can offer my amendment to the bill. We can \nhave a good debate. Hopefully, we can persuade the Senate on a proposal \nthat makes good sense for everyone and gets the job done.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Wellstone is actually on the subway on his way \nover.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator permit me to ask Senator Bingaman a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to each Senator for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wanted to exchange a couple of points with my \ncolleague. I don't know if the Senator had a chance today to read the \nSanta Fe, NM, editorial about thinning forests.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I did not read that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In this very short time I will try to paraphrase it. \nThey were talking about what a wonderful event it will be for the Santa \nFe watershed--which the Senator and I have seen a number of times--when \nwe get around to cleaning it and then thinning it, so that if water or \nfire would fall on the upper watershed, it would not do violence to the \nwater, which is the long-term lifeblood for the city. I just wondered \nif the Senator might recognize that when we are finished tonight, if in \nfact the amendments are no longer in order, or if they are in order, \nthat we will still be left with an issue of whether watersheds are \ngoing to be included in this new approach? And, if so, how much of a \nwatershed--how much of that watershed can be done in Western States? \nIsn't that one of the issues remaining?\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to my friend and colleague from New Mexico, \nI agree with him that it is an extremely important part of the issue, \nas to the thinning debate, what additional authority we provide to the \nForest Service to accomplish thinning within watersheds. I have a \nproposal which I have shown to my colleague that I believe provides \nample authority, particularly in the Santa Fe watershed, for them to do \neverything they would like to do there. I think the earlier proposal \nSenator Craig has will do that same thing, in fact do quite a bit more.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I think it is an important issue for us to get \nresolved, but I think both proposals do the job with regard to the \nspecific issue that the Senator has raised.\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for yielding the minute. I assume I \nhave 10 seconds left.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't like to yield 10 seconds. I yield the Senator an \nadditional minute. Does this Senator wish additional time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. No, thank you.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my friend, I hope after this vote, before we \nfinalize this, we might one more time sit and look at this. I think we \nhave narrowed the issue that is most in our minds to be resolved.\n  I understand you have a proposal in good faith. We have one in good \nfaith. Somehow or another it is assumed by both sides that theirs each \nwill do what will help solve this problem. If we had a little more \ntime, if you could meet with us, it would be greatly appreciated.\n  I thank Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthis quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time does the distinguished Senator \nwish me to yield to him?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, less than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do I have 5 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is really an amendment that has \neverything in the world to do with whether or not a lot of people in \nnorthwestern Minnesota are going to go under economically or not. We \nhad 79 votes to provide this disaster assistance. For northwest \nMinnesota, this will probably be about $300 million.\n  There are some who say the administration has shown they understand \nit is a serious problem because they are going to commit $850 million \nfor drought relief. First, this is a 50 cent fix to a million dollar \nproblem. Second, I don't think taking this small amount of money out of \nthe School Lunch Program and helping people for a couple of weeks is \nthe answer to what has happened around our country--be it fire or be it \nfloods or be it drought.\n  I was up in northwest Minnesota on Friday. I do not know how I can \ncontinue to go back up there and explain to people how it can be that \nweek after week this is being blocked. As far as I am concerned, we can \nhave up-or-down votes on all these amendments. That is my own view. But \nI say to my colleagues, I implore them, I beg you, let's break this \ntraffic jam and let's have the votes and let's move this forward.\n  Really, time is not neutral for so many of the independent producers \nand the farmers in northwest Minnesota. The FEMA assistance has been \ngreat, but it is not going to help them. There has been massive damage \nto cropland. Crop insurance comes nowhere near covering it. We have had \nthis ridiculous debate about how it is going to come out of the farm \nprograms. It is not going to happen. CBO won't score it that way. But \nclose to $6 billion nationally will not be additional money we are \ngoing to spend on the farm program because prices are up. But for the \nfarmers in northwest Minnesota and the producers in northwest \nMinnesota, they have no production.\n  For me as a Senator, this is the priority. It is just impossible to \nmeet with people--without sounding melodramatic--to just look at their \neyes and know what they are going through and explain how, once again, \nthis is being blocked or filibustered. I know we are not going to win \non this vote, but I urge colleagues to please vote for cloture. It \nwould make a huge difference to a lot of really honest, hard-working, \nsalt of the Earth people in northwest Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the consent of the managers, I ask the \ntime be yielded back so we can vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield my time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n4522. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my full support \nfor the conference report on H.R. 3009, the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the President \njust prior to the August recess. I was unable to come to the floor \nduring the consideration of the conference report, but I wanted to take \nthis opportunity to express my views on this important legislation.\n  H.R. 3009 was by far the most comprehensive trade legislation to come \nbefore Congress in fourteen years. By passing this bill, we \naccomplished four key goals: granting the President Trade Promotion \nAuthority for the first time in 8 years; dramatically enhancing Trade \nAdjustment Assistance for displaced workers; renewing and expanding the \nAndean Trade Preference Act to provide legitimate export opportunities \nto Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and; extending for 5 years the \nGeneralized System of Preferences providing tariff cuts for over 100 \ndeveloping countries.\n  I support all four of these goals, and I voted enthusiastically in \nfavor of this bill. I am particularly pleased that the enhancement of \nthe Andean Trade Preference Act is the underlying bill for this \nimportant legislation. This issue has been of great personal importance \nto me.\n  When the Senate was considering its version of Andean legislation in \nMay, we heard time and again about the success of new, legitimate, \nexports from the region like cut flowers and asparagus.\n  Since December 4 of last year, when the original ATPA legislation \nexpired, these and many other legitimate exports from the region have \nbeen subjected to substantially higher tariffs. These higher tariffs \nhit the fresh cut flower sector particularly hard as higher tariffs \nimpacted peak sales periods for the Valentine's Day and Mother's Day \nholidays.\n  This legislation will return trade benefits to all of those products \npreviously covered by ATPA and, most importantly, this legislation has \nbeen made retroactive to December 4, so that any duties that were paid \nduring the lapse of ATPA will be refunded.\n  I am pleased that the conference report is not simply a renewal of \nATPA, but includes enhanced benefits for new products. Times, and our \ntrade policy in the region, have changed since 1991 when the original \nATPA legislation passed. Most notably, the passage in 2000 of the \nCaribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act provided enhanced trade benefits \nto Caribbean countries, but inadvertently disadvantaged imports from \nthe Andean region.\n  Nowhere else was this more critical than in apparel assembly where \nsome 100,000 jobs in Colombia alone were at risk of being relocated to \nCBI countries. Under the enhanced ATPA program in the conference \nreport, the Andean countries will now be competitive suppliers in the \nregion. And this new ATPA benefit will also benefit U.S. producers of \ntextile, yarn and cotton by making these U.S.-produced components more \ncompetitive with Asian goods. In fact, the U.S. apparel importers \npredict that the ATPA provisions in this bill will lead to over $1 \nbillion in new orders. The next time ATPA is debated in this chamber, I \nlook forward to hearing floor statements that show that this projection \nhas come true. I also hope to hear of new successes from increased \nexports in footwear, watches, tuna, and other new products afforded \nATPA benefits under this legislation.\n  Enhanced trade benefits in the apparel sector should, in my view, be \nthe new norm in the Western Hemisphere. I continue to be concerned \nabout the demise of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005 and the effect \nthe end of this agreement will have on U.S.-Caribbean and Andean \napparel assembly partnerships. If we want a competitive apparel \nindustry in the Western Hemisphere post-2005, we must be developing \ngreater efficiency in the region now.\n  Secretary of Commerce Don Evans has been leading this effort for the \nAdministration, and the Commerce Department has developed a Western \nHemisphere action plan to enhance post-2005 competitiveness in the \nregion. I will be writing to Mr. Evans shortly to encourage a similar \ninitiative for the Andean region.\n  I also want to say a few words about two other key parts of this \ntrade bill--Trade Promotion Authority and Trade Adjustment Assistance. \nIt has been eight long years since Trade Promotion\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nAuthority expired. In my view, that is far too long for the United \nStates to be sitting on the sidelines while other countries are \naggressively negotiating trade agreements. With Trade Promotion \nAuthority, the Congress and the President will be speaking with a \nunified voice during negotiations.\n  TPA will strengthen the United States' negotiating position in \nongoing Doha Round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization and \nwill provide much needed momentum for the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas negotiations. With TPA, USTR will be able to close \nnegotiations on bilateral agreements with Chile and Singapore with the \nconfidence that Congress will consider the agreements as negotiated.\n  I am pleased that the conference report retained a number of \nprovisions that will help to ensure that import-sensitive agriculture \nproducts, such as citrus from my state, will be given an increased \nlevel of attention during trade negotiations. I believe these provision \nare necessary to help rebuild consensus in support of trade within the \nagriculture sector. TPA can also help our citrus growers gain market \naccess in Europe and elsewhere around the world, if we achieve our \ngoals in the WTO agriculture negotiations.\n  Of course, TPA is only the first step toward trade negotiations. \nWhether or not we are successful in achieving our negotiating \nobjectives will depend on close cooperation between the Congress and \nthe administration. I look forward to working with the Administration \non this effort.\n  The final comment I will make is on Trade Adjustment Assistance. I am \npleased that Members of Congress were able to work together in a truly \nbipartisan fashion to address the health care needs of American workers \nadversely affected by foreign trade agreements. This trade legislation \nwill nearly triple the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance program by \nproviding new and more comprehensive coverage options. These new \nbenefits will provide critical assistance to the over 2,000 Floridians \nwho presently receive Trade Adjustment Assistance, particularly those \nfrom the apparel and electronics sectors where job losses have been \nmost severe.\n  For the first time, displaced workers will be eligible for a 65 \npercent advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be used to pay for \nCOBRA or other state continuation plans. Health benefits will also be \navailable to individuals who work for businesses that supply or \ncontract with firms affected by trade. This comprehensive legislation \nrepresents a critical step towards our overall goal of lowering the \nnumber of uninsured, and I applaud my colleagues who supported it.\n  I was pleased to vote for the comprehensive trade legislation \nencompassed by H.R. 3009. Passage of this bill was a major \naccomplishment of this Congress and proof that the Congress can work \ntogether in a spirit of bipartisanship. I am excited about the \nopportunities I believe this legislation brings to not only our \ncountry, but to the rest of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9027-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9027-S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE VISIT OF ASKAR AKAEV, PRESIDENT OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the visit of \nthe President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Askar Akaev, to the United States \nfrom September 19-24, 2002. President Akaev is here at the invitation \nof President Bush.\n  While in Washington, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic scheduled \nmeetings with President George W. Bush, Vice President Richard Cheney, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, and Secretary of Agriculture Ann \nVeneman. In addition, meetings at the United States Capitol with the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives Dennis Hastert, Senate \nRepublican Leader Trent Lott, and other leaders of the Senate who have \nexpressed an interest in Central Asia affairs were on his calendar.\n  During his visit to New York, President Akaev addressed the General \nAssembly of the United Nations and met with Secretary General Kofi \nAnnan. He also participated in a round table discussion with members of \nthe business community.\n  The tragic events of September 11, 2001 redefined the importance of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic's critical location in Central Asia. It has a major \nrole in the region's political and security framework. As an ally of \nthe United States in central Asia, the Kyrgyz Republic opened its \nterritory to approximately 3000 coalition troops at the height of \nUnited States operations in Afghanistan. It is significant that the \ncoalition forces were allowed to deploy military personnel in Manas \nairport in the capitol city of Bishkek. Kyrgyzstan remains a host to a \nsignificant number of troops, as well as aircraft and technical \nsupport. The new political landscape created by these deployments has \naltered the Kyrgyz Republic's relations with its regional powers, \nRussia and China.\n  At the same time, the Kyrgyz Republic is pressing ahead with economic \nreforms. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, one of \nthe international financial institutions active in the region, \nconcluded last year that Kyrgyzstan has successfully completed its \neconomic structural reform program. Kyrgyzstan was the region's first \nnation to secure membership in the World Trade Organization, in 1998, \nand the first nation of the Commonwealth of Independent States to \nreceive permanent normal trade relations with the United States.\n  Kyrgyzstan has committed itself to a free trade model and has \nimplemented many new initiatives through a dramatic reform of its \ntrade, tax, and intellectual property laws. The Kyrgyz Republic was \nalso the first country in the region to introduce a fully convertible \ncurrency, and has consistently led the way in market reforms.\n  As a result of the tragedy on the south of Kyrgyzstan, he has also \nreconstituted the government to include representatives of several \ngroups previously in opposition and has organized a Constitutional \nCouncil, also filled with opposition-minded figures, to provide further \nopportunities for power changing. The nation now faces its first \ntransition of power since independence. President Akaev and his \ngovernment are determined to see that this transition occurs through an \nelection process that builds and legitimizes democratic institutions.\n  President Askar Akaev was born on November 10, 1944 in the village of \nKyzyl-Bairak, Kemin district of Kyrgyzstan in a family of farmers. In \n1961, he finished secondary school with a Gold Medal. He graduated with \nhonors from Leningrad Fine Mechanics and Optics Institute in 1967 and \npursued his studies to become a Doctor of Science.\n  Dr. Akaev started his career in 1961 as a mechanic worker. He held \nother positions as an engineer, senior lecturer, professor, and finally \nthe Head of the Computer Sciences Department in Frunze Polytechnical \nInstitute, now Bishkek Technical University.\n  In 1984, Askar Akaev was elected a correspondent member of the \nAcademy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan, at the same year he became an \nacademician. In 1986, he was appointed Head of the Department of \nScience and Higher Academic Institutions, Kyrgyz Communist Party's \nCentral Committee. From 1987 until 1989, he served as the Vice \nPresident at the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences and later became its \nPresident. In 1989, Askar Akaev was elected as a Deputy of the Supreme \nCouncil of the USSR.\n  On October 27, 1990, the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan elected Askar Akaev \nas the President of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic. At the \nnationwide elections on October 12, 1991, he was elected as the First \nPresident of independent nation of Kyrgyzstan. The people of Kyrgyzstan \nconfirmed Akaev's powers at the national referendum on January 30, \n1994. On December 24, 1995 the President of the Kyrgyz Republic Askar \nAkaev was re-elected. President Akaev announced that he will not seek \nreelection when his term ends in 2005.\n  The President's spouse, Mairam Akeva, is a professor of Science on \nMachine Dynamics and is the head of the International Charitable \nFoundation of Childhood and Maternity Support. Established in 1993, \nthis organization assists women and children with different forms of \npulmonary and bronchial diseases.\n  The Kyrgyz Republic is situated in the middle of Central Asia, at the \ncrossroads of culture and civilizations, at the branch of the legendary \nSilk Road. In 1999, President Akaev authored a report called ``The \nDiplomacy\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\nof the Silk Road.'' His article remains timely today, given the changes \nthat have taken place in central Asia since September 11, 2001.\n  In conclusion, many commodities were traded on the Silk Road which \nstretched 5000 miles from east to west. One very important \n``commodity'' in this new century is friendship. Today, the United \nStates has a good ally and friend in that region of the world. \nKyrgyzstan is indeed a partner for peace and stability in Central Asia. \nIn this regard, I wish to congratulate President Akaev on his \nsuccessful visit to the United States and wish him well with all future \nendeavors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Diplomacy of the Silk Road\n\n                            (By Askar Akaev)\n\n\n              THE PAST AND PRESENT OF THE GREAT SILK ROAD\n\n       The Great Silk Road, which in ancient times joined East \n     with West, and to some extent North with South, by means of \n     trade and economic, cultural-humanitarian and also political \n     and diplomatic ties, has a history stretching back several \n     thousand years. At various phases of its existence the \n     content and significance, directions and scale of contacts \n     varied, but one thing remained unchanged: throughout that \n     long period, the Great Silk Road played the role of a \n     connecting bridge between countries and civilizations.\n       It served as a channel for trade, which became the catalyst \n     for the development of crafts. Travelers and explorers \n     studied the countries and peoples of the lands along the \n     entire length of the Road, thus making an enormous \n     contribution to the development of knowledge.\n       The world became acquainted with the ideas and work of the \n     greatest philosophers, scholars and statesmen. Intensive \n     mutual enrichment of cultures took place, and there was an \n     active exchange of knowledge and of spiritual and \n     philosophical concepts and views. Thanks to the Road, \n     outstanding epics and legends became the property of all \n     mankind.\n       Via the Great Silk Road, syncretic and monotheistic \n     religious ideas were disseminated. Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, \n     Judaism, Islam and Christianity all found their adherents \n     along the Great Silk Road.\n       The Great Silk Road was also of immeasurable significance \n     in the establishment and maintenance of diplomatic relations \n     among the centers of political life, the major States of \n     Europe and Asia. Many historical sources bear witness to the \n     active nature and high level of official contacts and the \n     exchange of diplomatic missions, particularly between \n     Byzantium and China, powers which played a significant role \n     in the International life of that era.\n       The intensive and multidirectional process of Inter-\n     civilizational communication on various levels went on for \n     centuries.\n       Despite a number of changes of direction, by the will of \n     historical fate the main arteries of the Great Silk Road \n     passed through the territory of Kyrgyzstan.\n       On the eve of the new third millennium, the idea of a \n     revival of the Great Silk Road has met with broad \n     international support and an extremely warm response, largely \n     as a result of the existence of two interdependent trends \n     that characterize the development of the modern world.\n       The first of these involves the steady intensification of \n     the processes of interdependence and globalization, the \n     phenomenally rapid development and introduction of the latest \n     technologies, communication systems and computer networks and \n     the acceleration on an unprecedented scale of information and \n     capital flows that ``erode'' national boundaries.\n       The second trend reflects the high level of integration at \n     the regional and subregional levels.\n       The current steady and dynamic development of political, \n     trade and economic relations would be unthinkable without the \n     strengthening of fraternal, trusting and mutually \n     advantageous relations of partnership between all States of \n     the Silk Road region.\n       The geography of the Great Silk Road has no bounds or \n     limitations. Its expansion by those countries which intend to \n     develop cooperation with the countries in the Great Silk Road \n     region is naturally and objectively determined by the entire \n     course of historical development.\n       The arms race, local conflicts, extremism and terrorism, \n     the unlawful manufacture, distribution and consumption of \n     narcotic substances, natural disasters and those brought \n     about by technology or by man, and crying social needs are \n     problems that lead to recognition of the natural and \n     objective need for a revival of the Great Silk Road on a \n     qualitatively new basis.\n       While in the past the Great Silk Road played the role of a \n     connecting bridge, now, in a situation of globalization, the \n     destiny of the Road extends far beyond the framework of this \n     dimension alone. The cosmic and the planetary appear as a \n     single whole, implying an organic combination of present-day \n     progress with the development of human civilization itself.\n       The renaissance of the Great Silk Road under the new \n     historical circumstances refutes the ideas that were current \n     in the past, which at times artificially contrasted the ways \n     in which the East and the West perceived and viewed the world \n     as totally incompatible with one another. Fortunately, ideas \n     of planet-wide significance and scale are now predominant in \n     the minds and hearts of the peoples, inhabiting the region of \n     the Road.\n       The ideas of humanism, tolerance and the revival of \n     spirituality are gaining ground in their tenacious struggle \n     against age-old prejudices and intolerance of different ways \n     of thinking.\n       Kyrgyzstan, lying at the very center of the Eurasian \n     continent, at the junction of several civilizations, having \n     taken in and absorbed a multiplicity of cultures and ways of \n     looking at the world, possesses under present circumstances \n     the necessary prerequisites for becoming a bridge of \n     friendship and cooperation between all the countries within \n     the Great Silk Road.\n\n\n  KYRGYZSTAN--AN INSEPARABLE PART OF THE GREAT SILK ROAD THE COUNTRY \n                        KNOWN AS ``KYRGYZSTAN''\n\n       After regaining its State independence, Kyrgyzstan set out \n     on, a qualitatively new road of its development, the road of \n     political and socio-economic transformations.\n       Such concepts as ``democratization'', ``civil freedoms'' \n     and ``supremacy of the law'' have become firmly embedded in \n     everyday practice. The principle of separation of powers and \n     the system of ``checks and balances'' in the interrelations \n     between them have clearly demonstrated their effectiveness.\n       Favourable conditions have been created for encouraging \n     initiatives and activity by citizens at the local level and \n     for the comprehensive development of local self-government as \n     the foundation for the life of the State.\n       The idea of ``Kyrgyzstan--our common home'' has become the \n     recognized basis for enhancing and strengthening inter-ethnic \n     harmony and creating the conditions for a life in dignity for \n     all citizens of the country. In Kyrgyzstan, which has \n     absorbed in equal measure the spiritual heritage and rich \n     traditions of the East and the West, representatives of many \n     ethnic groups and religious faiths live together in peace and \n     harmony.\n       Kyrgyzstan has created the conditions for the establishment \n     of an open society with a developed market economy, \n     successfully solved the problem of macroeconomic \n     stabilization and entered the stage of economic growth.\n       A national information structure is being created in \n     Kyrgyzstan with access to world- wide computer networks.\n       Currently, the most important goals facing society as a \n     whole are to intensify the positive trends in the economy and \n     make them stable, to encourage and support national \n     entrepreneurship, especially on the part of small and medium-\n     sized businesses, to attract direct investment and to make \n     extensive use of new technology.\n       An attractive investment climate has been created in \n     Kyrgyzstan, and a legislative base has been established which \n     affords foreign investors the necessary guarantees and \n     privileges.\n       The stable political system and the open and democratic \n     nature of Kyrgyzstan's economy create favorable conditions \n     for the development of mutually advantageous international \n     cooperation.\n       Kyrgyzstan has entered the era of democracy and renewal.\n\n\n       KYRGYZSTAN AND THE COUNTRIES OF THE GREAT SILK ROAD REGION\n\n       The conception of Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy with regard \n     to bilateral cooperation excludes in principle the use of the \n     prefix ``anti-''. This is the outcome of the entire course of \n     Kyrgyzstan's historical development as an independent State \n     and of the fact that our country pursues a peace-loving \n     foreign policy and builds its relations with the outside \n     world on the basis of the universally accepted principles and \n     norms of international law.\n       Kyrgyzstan, as a consistent advocate of broad and \n     multifaceted international cooperation for the joint solution \n     of global international problems, takes up ``anti-drug'', \n     ``anti-extremism'' and ``anti-terrorism'' positions. It is an \n     implacable opponent of unlawful arms trading and distribution \n     of arms and strives to achieve stability, progress and \n     economic stability not only in the region, but throughout the \n     world.\n       Our country is deeply convinced that along the entire \n     length of the modern-day Great Silk Road, no serious problems \n     or contradictions of an antagonistic nature are to be found \n     between the countries falling within its orbit.\n       Among the participants in international relations, \n     awareness is growing of the need to resolve chronic problems \n     by peaceful means, at the negotiating table. In this \n     connection, the example of Tajikistan, whose history is \n     inseparable from the history of the Great Silk Road, is \n     instructive. The political will and desire to seek compromise \n     and mutually acceptable solutions that have been demonstrated \n     by the leaders of the parties that were previously in \n     conflict, combined with the mediating efforts and good will \n     of neighbouring countries, including Kyrgyzstan, give grounds \n     for hoping that the processes of peace and national \n     reconciliation in that country are irreversible.\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\n       Kyrgyzstan's initiative in relation to the conduct of a \n     peace conference on Afghanistan has been widely acknowledged. \n     The joint efforts and cooperation of all the countries \n     falling within the orbit of the Great Silk Road can and must \n     lead to the long-awaited peace in that long-suffering land \n     and turn forever a somber page in the history of the region.\n       The creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia, \n     cessation of the arms race and the conversion of military \n     production, and the creation of conditions for the stable \n     development of all countries of the Great Silk Road without \n     exception afford grounds for assuming that at the beginning \n     of the third millennium the region of the Road, which \n     possesses vast potential and resources, will become one of \n     the most flourishing and prosperous in the world, in that \n     problems affecting the interests of all the countries will be \n     resolved jointly and all obstacles to the free movement of \n     goods, capital, services and manpower along the entire length \n     of the Road will be removed.\n       Kyrgyzstan is making purposeful efforts to develop \n     cooperation with all the countries of the Great Silk Road \n     region. In view of its geographical location, our country has \n     a favorable opportunity of simultaneously developing fruitful \n     relations in such directions as ``Kyrgyzstan--neighbouring \n     countries'', ``Kyrgyzstan--Europe'' and ``Kyrgyzstan---East \n     and South-East Asia''.\n       ``Kyrgyzstan--neighbouring countries''--our country is \n     working steadily to intensify various forms of cooperation \n     with neighbouring countries and to expand political, trade \n     and economic and cultural and humanitarian relations. The \n     existence of common historical, political, economic and \n     cultural and humanitarian links with countries which in the \n     past formed a single whole necessitates the maintenance and \n     development of relations through bilateral and multilateral \n     cooperation. Kyrgyzstan is attentively following the dynamics \n     of and collectively participating in the multilateral \n     integration processes in countries of the Commonwealth of \n     Independent States, and making its contribution to the \n     strengthening and intensification of regional and subregional \n     integration.\n       Acknowledging the important role of a favorable external \n     environment for subsequent development. Kyrgyzstan is working \n     consistently and fruitfully to strengthen security along the \n     State borders with all neighbouring countries. Together with \n     other countries of the region, it has signed a number of \n     important agreements aimed at strengthening confidence-\n     building measures in the military sphere and reducing the \n     armed forces in the border region, and this has made it \n     possible to settle almost completely the border disputes that \n     still remain from the past.\n       Kyrgyzstan is geographically and historically close to the \n     Muslim States of the Great Silk Road region, which possess \n     considerable investment, industrial and raw material \n     potential.\n       ``Kyrgyzstan--Europe''--The significance of this direction \n     for Kyrgyzstan is determined by the following main factors: \n     the need for and benefits of cooperation with developed \n     European countries; the desirability of further developing \n     links with the Eastern European States; and participation in \n     the European affairs of the states bordering on Kyrgyzstan. \n     In developing its relations with European countries, \n     Kyrgyzstan will, alongside efforts on the bilateral level, \n     step up its activity in the field of multilateral diplomacy, \n     taking advantage of the unique opportunity to participate in \n     the work of the European institutions dealing with issues of \n     security (including in the Central Asian region), economic \n     cooperation and the development of democratic institutions.\n       ``Kyrgyzstan--South and South-East Asia''--Kyrgyzstan's \n     cooperation with the countries of East and South-East Asia is \n     conducted both on the bilateral level and through \n     international organizations. Despite the financial and \n     economic difficulties some Asian countries have recently been \n     experiencing, their economic potential will play a growing \n     role in the international arena.\n       Taking into account the South-East Asia countries' great \n     wealth of experience of activity, Kyrgyzstan will in future \n     show great interest in participating actively in various \n     regional forums of the Association of South- East Asian \n     Nations, and also in the establishment of cooperation on a \n     regional basis.\n       States are prompted by their national interests, set in the \n     context of geostrategic and geopolitical realities. In this \n     connection, Kyrgyzstan can succeed in developing relations \n     with all the countries of the Great Silk Road region, bearing \n     in mind the following factors:\n       (a) In terms of economic indicators, Kyrgyzstan falls into \n     the category of ``developing countries'' as used in \n     international practice. This enables it to be a full \n     participant in the leading organs of multilateral diplomacy \n     of the countries of the South and defend their international \n     economic and political interests collectively;\n       (b) Kyrgyzstan, as a country with a transition economy, is \n     entitled to count on the cooperation of the developed \n     countries and international financial and economic \n     organizations in conducting its policy of reforms;\n       (c) Kyrgyzstan also forms part of the group of land-locked \n     countries. Located at the very center of East-West and North-\n     South transport and communication routes, it feels a natural \n     need to link up with modem communication systems and ensure \n     reliable access to maritime transport, and is also aware of \n     the objective need to become a transit country. It is \n     therefore working actively to develop all forms of \n     communications, in particular transport and information, in \n     the interests of all the Great Silk Road countries.\n\n\nPRINCIPLES OF COOPERATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BASIS FOR RELATIONS \n                   WITH THE GREAT SILK ROAD COUNTRIES\n\n       The conduct of the ``Great Silk Road'' policy is based on \n     the following principles:\n       Equitable partnership, friendship and cooperation with:\n       All Great Silk Road countries;\n       Interdependence;\n       Mutual advantage;\n       The long-term perspective;\n       Multifaceted development of international cooperation.\n       Equitable partnership, friendship and cooperation with all \n     Great Silk Road countries are the most important components \n     of a principle which is objective and universal in nature, \n     relating equally to the hopes and aspirations of any country \n     interested in creating a favorable environment along its \n     national borders and in the content of bilateral and \n     multilateral diplomacy. This principle is in full conformity \n     with the universally acknowledged principles and norms of \n     international law as laid down in, the Charter of the United \n     Nations, including mutual respect for sovereignty, \n     territorial integrity and inviolability of borders, non-\n     interference in internal affairs, non-use of force, \n     settlement of conflicts by peaceful means and equal and \n     mutually advantageous cooperation.\n       Interdependence has become a completely new phenomenon of \n     the end of the twentieth century. Globalization has led to an \n     awareness of the unarguable fact that no country, however \n     powerful it may be in military and economic terms, can face \n     alone the challenges that call in question the survival of \n     the whole of mankind.\n       The principle of mutual advantage is sufficiently obvious. \n     The development of mutually advantageous international \n     cooperation within the Great Silk Road region will allow all \n     countries without exception to find answers to many questions \n     and solve the problems they are at present contending with. \n     The countries of the region are actively striving to create \n     new and diversify existing transportation systems so as to \n     ensure the shortest and best means of access to world \n     communications; they are encouraging and developing \n     international trade, both within the region and outside it; \n     and they are intensifying and stepping up cultural and \n     humanitarian, scientific and educational and tourism contacts \n     between the nationals of all the countries of the region.\n       The principle of the long-term perspective is inseparably \n     interrelated with the preceding principle. The entire \n     historical experience of the development both of the Great \n     Silk Road itself and of the countries drawn into its orbit \n     over the course of many centuries, has convincingly \n     demonstrated the importance of and vital need for the \n     development of inter-State relations that address the long-\n     term perspective.\n       Multifaceted development of international cooperation is a \n     necessary condition for the creation of favorable \n     prerequisites and possibilities for the conduct of a \n     balanced, flexible and maneuverable policy on the \n     international arena; it corresponds to Kyrgyzstan's long-term \n     national interests and is determined by the entire complex of \n     problems and issues that need to be solved in the future.\n\n\nPROSPECTS FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE ``GREAT SILK ROAD'' FOREIGN POLICY \n                                CONCEPT\n\n       The application of ``Great Silk Road'' diplomacy will have \n     favorable long-term consequences for Kyrgyzstan and for all \n     the other countries located in the Great Silk Road region.\n       The revival of the Great Silk Road at this juncture will \n     make it possible to create all the necessary conditions for \n     the transformation of the region into an area of stability, \n     security, friendship, cooperation and equitable partnership.\n       The present-day Great Silk Road creates favorable \n     prerequisites for the intensification of international \n     cooperation in the joint solution of the global problems \n     facing mankind on the threshold of the third millennium.\n       The expansion of the geography of the Great Silk Road will \n     make it possible to make fuller use of the existing \n     opportunities and rich potential for intensifying \n     international trade and economic, cultural and humanitarian, \n     scientific and technical and tourist contacts between all \n     countries and peoples. There are sufficient grounds for \n     thinking that all the Great Silk Road countries will make the \n     maximum efforts to ensure that in the new millennium there \n     emerge from the Road region, which constitutes a vast space \n     crossing the entire Eurasian continent from East to West and \n     uniting a diversity of cultures, traditions and historical \n     fates, only positive impulses of solidarity, peace, progress \n     and prosperity.\n       Kyrgyzstan is ready and able to act as a binding link \n     between all the Great Silk Road countries.\n       For Kyrgyzstan, the interests and objectives of its foreign \n     policy consist in ensuring to the fullest possible extent the \n     strengthening, by political and diplomatic means, of \n     international guarantees of its independence, sovereignty, \n     economic self-sufficiency and territorial integrity.\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\n       To achieve these goals and objectives, Kyrgyzstan is full \n     of resolve and will to comprehensively encourage and develop \n     friendly, good-neighbourly relations of partnership with all \n     the countries of the Great Silk Road region and to \n     participate consistently and concretely in integration \n     processes.--Askar Akaev, President of Kyrgyzstan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9030-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DECISION ON IRAQ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to have printed in the Record an op-ed \nby columnist Charles Krauthammer discussing the United Nations and its \ndebate over how to deal with Iraq. Mr. Krauthammer makes the point that \nnations are driven by their own self-interests; thus, members of the \nU.N. Security Council--such as France, Russia, and China--all have \nvaried perspectives on a potential confrontation with Iraq.\n  He argues that it is not ``unseemly'' for the United States to \nsimilarly act in the name of its own interests. And that it is, in his \nwords, an ``absurdity'' to suggest that the U.S. is suddenly granted \n``moral legitimacy'' by U.N. Security Council approval for its actions, \nsince the Security Council itself is composed of member states acting \nin their own self interests.\n  I ask unanimous consent the op-ed by Mr. Krauthammer be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Is This the Way To Decide on Iraq?\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       There is something deeply deranged about the Iraq debate.\n       The vice president, followed by the administration A Team \n     and echoing the president, argues that we must remove from \n     power an irrational dictator who has a history of aggression \n     and mass murder, is driven by hatred of America and is \n     developing weapons of mass destruction that could kill \n     millions of Americans in a day. The Democrats respond with \n     public skepticism, a raised eyebrow and the charge that the \n     administration has yet to ``make the case.''\n       Then on Sept. 12, the president goes to the United Nations \n     and argues that this same dictator must be brought to heel to \n     vindicate some Security Council resolutions and thus rescue \n     the United Nations from irrelevance. The Democrats swoon. \n     ``Great speech,'' they say. ``Why didn't you say that in the \n     first place? Count us in.''\n       When the case for war is made purely in terms of American \n     national interest--in terms of the safety, security and very \n     lives of American citizens--chins are pulled as the Democrats \n     think it over. But when the case is the abstraction of being \n     the good international citizen and strengthening the House of \n     Kofi, the Democrats are ready to parachute into Baghdad.\n       This hierarchy of values is bizarre but not new. Liberal \n     internationalism--the foreign policy school of the modern \n     Democratic Party (and of American liberalism more \n     generally)--is deeply suspicious of actions taken for reasons \n     of naked interest. After all, this is the party that in the \n     last decade voted overwhelmingly against the Persian Gulf \n     War, where vital American interests were at stake (among \n     them, keeping the world's largest reservoir of oil out of the \n     hands of a hostile dictator), while supporting humanitarian \n     military interventions in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo, \n     places with only the remotest connection to American security \n     interests.\n       This is all sweet and nice. And highly, flatteringly moral. \n     But is this the way to decide when to risk the lives of brave \n     young Americans?\n       This fawning over the president's rescue-the-U.N. rationale \n     is not just sentimental, it is illogical. Assume--big \n     assumption--that the United Nations does act and passes a \n     resolution magnanimously allowing Americans to fight and die \n     in Iraq. How does that rescue the United Nations from \n     irrelevance? Under a feckless U.S. administration that \n     allowed things to drift, the United Nations sat on its hands \n     through the 1990s and did nothing. If not for this American \n     president who threatens to invade on his own if he has to, \n     the United Nations would still be doing nothing. The United \n     Nations is irrelevant one way or the other. It is acting now \n     only because of American pressure. It will go back to sleep \n     tomorrow when America eases that pressure.\n       And what is the moral logic underlying the Democrats' \n     demand for U.N. sanctions? The country's top Democrat, Sen. \n     Tom Daschle, said that U.N. support ``will be a central \n     factor in how quickly Congress acts. If the international \n     community supports it, if we can get the information we've \n     been seeking, then I think we can move to a [Senate] \n     resolution.''\n       Daschle's insistence on the centrality of a U.N. stamp of \n     approval is puzzling. How does this work? In what way does \n     the approval of the Security Council confer moral legitimacy \n     on this enterprise? Perhaps Daschle can explain how the \n     blessing of the butchers of Tiananmen Square, who hold the \n     Chinese seat on the Security Council, lends moral authority \n     to an invasion of Iraq. Or the support of the Kremlin, whose \n     central interest in Iraq is the $8 billion that it owes \n     Russia.\n       Or the French. There can be no Security Council approval \n     without them. Does Daschle imagine that their approval will \n     hinge on humanitarian calculations? If the French come on \n     board it will be because they see an Anglo-American train \n     headed for Baghdad and they don't want to be left at the \n     station. The last time the Middle East was carved up was \n     1916, when a couple of British and French civil servants, a \n     Mr. Sykes and a Mr. Picot, drew lines on a map of the \n     crumbling Ottoman Empire. Among other goodies, France got \n     Syria and Lebanon. Britain got Iraq. The French might not \n     relish being shut out of Iraq a second time.\n       My point is not to blame France or China or Russia for \n     acting in their national interests. That's what nations do. \n     That's what nations' leaders are supposed to do. My point is \n     to express wonder at Americans who find it unseemly to act in \n     the name of their own national interests and who cannot see \n     the logical absurdity of granting moral legitimacy to \n     American action only if it earns the approval of the Security \n     Council--approval granted or withheld on the most cynical \n     ground of self-interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9030-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the individuals, organizations, and families \nwho open their hearts to adoptive children. Children around the world, \nin Cambodia, in Romania, and in our own country wait desperately for \nfamilies to care and provide for them. The parents who adopt these \nneedy children turn their lives around and offer them a brighter future \nfilled with love and hope.\n  As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I would like \nto recognize the efforts of parents, adoption agencies, support groups \nand other individuals whose dedication to adoption makes a difference \nin the lives of children. Adoption provides countless children with \nstable homes, caring families and loving supportive parents. In \nparticular, I would like to honor Dennis and Debbie Sparrow of Saint \nLouis, Missouri. This year, I have nominated the Sparrows as ``Angels \nin Adoption'' for their hard work and dedication to adoptive children \nfrom Romania. The ``Angels in Adoption'' award is presented by the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption to recognize those who enrich the \nlives of adoptive children.\n  Dennis and Debbie Sparrow adopted their first child from Romania in \n1991. During the adoption process, the Sparrows saw firsthand how many \nof the children in orphanages are destined for a life of poverty and \nhardship. Upon their return, Dennis and Debbie started two \norganizations to benefit the children they saw in Romania. S.E.E.K., \nSave Eastern Europe's Kids, collects donations for Romanian orphans and \ntheir caregivers. S.E.E.K. International, a non-profit adoption agency, \nassists prospective parents and children through the adoption process. \nIn addition to helping over 100 children find loving homes, the \nSparrows have personally adopted five children.\n  The Sparrows' exemplary work demonstrates that individuals can make a \ngreat difference. They have provided invaluable resources and support \nto other families wishing to bring Romanian children into their lives. \nThey have raised money to assist in the care\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\nof these children. They have established two adoption placement centers \nin Romania. Moreover, they have inspired others to open their hearts \nand homes to the orphaned children of Romania.\n  I want to applaud Dennis and Debbie Sparrow for their devotion to \nhelping adoptive parents and children. These ``Angels in Adoption'' \nhave not only made a difference in hundreds of young lives, but they \nhave also raised the awareness of the benefits of adoption. The hard \nwork of these angels is an inspiration to others and a blessing to the \nchildren whose lives they have touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9031-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 95TH ANNIVERSARY OF UPS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I congratulate United Parcel \nService on the occasion of its 95th anniversary, and to ask my \ndistinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments \nof one of the Nation's most successful companies, a company that \nemploys more than 371,000 men and women worldwide.\n  UPS was founded on August 28, 1907, in a small office under a \nsidewalk in Seattle, WA, where founder Jim Casey started what has \nbecome the largest transportation company in the world. Now \nheadquartered in Atlanta, GA, UPS is considered the world leader in \npackage delivery, and has been recognized for 4 straight years as the \n``World's Most Admired Delivery Company'' by Fortune magazine.\n  Customers around the globe rely on UPS to ship nearly 13 million \npackages a day, creating a volume of 3.4 billion packages annually. \nUPS.com is one of the busiest websites on the Internet, allowing \ncustomers to enhance the customer service and efficiency of their e-\ncommerce.\n  And UPS employees are among the best in the business, a result of \nworking in an environment that enables growth and opportunity. In \nreturn, UPSers provide countless hours of volunteerism to organizations \nsuch as the United Way. In fact, last year alone, employees donated \nmore than $50 million to the United Way, more than any corporation in \nthe 115-year history of the United Way.\n  The true spirit of UPS is shown in the legacy carried out by its \nemployees over the last 95 years.

Mr. President, I would like to take this moment to \nreflect on the rich life and legacy of an exceptional Los Angeles \nleader and friend, Ira Yellin.\n  Ira died of cancer on September 10, 2002, of complications from lung \ncancer at his home in Santa Monica Canyon. He was 62 years old. This \nwas a sad day for so many people throughout California, whose lives \nwere touched by Ira's unyielding commitment to making our community a \nmore beautiful and better place to live.\n  Although a strong supporter of many civic organizations, Ira was most \nwell-known for his extraordinary dedication to restoration of several \nof Los Angeles's historic gems. While eating at Grand Central Market, \nwaiting for a train at Union Station or admiring the beautiful \nrestoration of City Hall, we have Ira to thank for helping to restore \nand maintain these wonderful places. Those who have visited Los \nAngeles' recently dedicated Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels \nmay also thank Ira, for playing a role in its design.\n  Born in 1940 near Boston, MA, and raised in Van Nuys, CA, Ira often \nvisited downtown Los Angeles with his father, who instilled in his son \nthe passion for city life and the importance of making the world a \nbetter place. Years later, Ira attended Princeton University and \nHarvard Law School, and returned to California where he received a \nmaster's degree in law from the University of California, Berkeley. \nAfter he finished his studies, he spent a year in the Marines before \nsettling in Los Angeles.\n  In 1967, Ira worked as a lawyer at a Beverly Hills firm while helping \nto run a non-profit legal advocacy organization. Then, in 1975, he left \nthe firm to work in real estate development and management, overseeing \nbuilding projects throughout California and on Los Angeles' Westside. \nHowever, Ira realized he was more drawn to downtown buildings in need \nof restoration than the state-of-the-art build on Los Angeles' affluent \nWestside. In 1985, Ira began his own real estate firm and dedicated his \nlife to the revival of buildings throughout Los Angeles.\n  Ira's passion for turning neglected buildings into treasures for the \ncommunity made him a great asset to Los Angeles. His dedication to \ncommunity service benefitted many cultural and civic organizations. Ira \nwas active with the Skirball Cultural Center, the J. Paul Getty Trust \nand served as past president of the American Jewish Committee.\n  I will miss Ira Yellin. Until the very end, he pursued his vision and \nturned dreams into realities. Although his presence will be greatly \nmissed, his wonderful work will be long remembered for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9031-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ON THE WORK OF ATF SPECIAL AGENT JOHN CARR 2002 MEDAL OF VALOR \n                               RECIPIENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

For the \npast 13 years, the FBA has presented the award to federal employees who \ndemonstrate outstanding service in their field of work.\n  Special Agent Carr earned his award for working undercover to catch \nviolent gang members staging a series of home invasion robberies. Carr \ntransformed his look, acquainted himself with the criminals, and \npretended to help them in their operation. Carr gave the criminals \nfalse information, which led them to traps planned by the ATF. Thanks \nto Carr's work, many dangerous criminals were caught and taken off our \nstreets.\n  John Carr risked his life working on this assignment. There are not \nmany people who would make such a great sacrifice for others to feel \nsafe in their homes. Through his courage, bravery and steadfast \ndedication, Carr prevailed in the face of danger. I extend my sincere \ncongratulations to John Carr on this honor, and thank him for his great \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9031-5", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9031-S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO NICK COSMA\n\n Mr. THOMAS.

Rick, turning his sights to a \n     career in international business, found a companion \n     conversant in languages, accustomed to travel, and filled \n     with the same spirit of adventure that has always animated \n     his life.\n       Before meeting Rick, Odile's consuming passion was the \n     arts.\n       The Gallic phase of her arts education took place in the \n     Left Bank of Paris, renowned as a world center of culture. \n     She attended the Ecole Alsacienne, located near the \n     Montparnasse cafes frequented by artists and writers for over \n     a century. Her talents were then nurtured at the Lycee \n     Fenelon in the Quartier Saint Germain-des-Pres, just a few \n     yards from Pablo Picasso's former atelier on Rue des Grandos \n     Augustins.\n       After receiving the Baccalaureate, she took up studies at \n     the arts-intensive Finch College in New York City, whose \n     students have ranged the artistic gamut from Grace Slick to \n     Isabella Rossellini.\n       She went on to receive an M.A. in art history from Queens \n     College and subsequently applied both her management and art \n     history skills directing visual and performing arts partron \n     programs under Phillip Morris's legendary chairman, Joseph F. \n     Cullman III. Her guidance led to innovative partnerships \n     between the company and such institutions as the Whitney \n     Museum, which opened a branch in the company's newly built \n     headquarters.\n       It was during her tenure at Phillip Morris and Odile walked \n     onto the canvas of Rick Grogan's life.\n       In Odile, he found someone at ease in every facet of \n     conversation, with views as varied and forceful as his own. \n     Whether discussing politics, cuisine, painting, or education, \n     Odile proved not just a font of opinions and facts but a \n     master of epithets and one-liners, in two tongues, no less.\n       Just out of Harvard Business School, Rick married Odile in \n     1981 and they moved to London, where Rick worked as a \n     consultant for Bain Company. Rick thought they might spend a \n     year or two in England before returning to the U.S.\n       Odile thought otherwise. As a tribute to her powers of \n     persuasion, she convinced her deal-maker husband that London \n     was just the right place for the family, conveniently located \n     between France and America.\n       Rick bought the argument if not the logic and so they \n     settled into life in England, their lives soon graced by \n     Alexandra, Nicholas, and Charlotte, wonderfully gifted \n     children who feel at home anywhere from Harvard Square to \n     Picadily Circus to Place de la Concorde.\n       In spite of all her household demands, Odile never \n     neglected to devote time and energy to her beloved arts. A \n     benefactor of the Serpentine Gallery in London's Kensington \n     Gardens, she has encouraged policies to bring a wider public \n     into museums, using the arts to uplift and liberate the human \n     spirit across broader demographics.\n       Her cultivated judgment has also been sought by the Tate \n     Museum, where she serves on the acquisition committee.\n       Several years ago, the enviable rhythms of the Grogans' \n     family life were interrupted by a cycling accident in the \n     French countryside. Rick lay near death in a coma.\n       Odile, at hits side every moment, took full charge of his \n     medical care and recovery. ``He is my husband,'' she \n     declared. ``I can take care of him.''\n       And so she did, sitting long hours by his hospital bed, \n     watching for this eyes to open and recognition to light up \n     his expression. With her help and the force of her spirit, \n     Rick did awaken and recover.\n       The mishap was an awful physical setback but one that \n     brought forth a remarkable discovery for Rick.\n       He learned that Odile was not just a caring wife and a \n     loving mother, not just a skilled hostess and devoted \n     patroness, not just a talented linguist and art history \n     scholar, but an angel of mercy.\n       All the advantages of education and career mean little \n     without love in our lives. When that love finds it greatest \n     expression in our hour of need, we can indeed count ourselves \n     among the blessed.\n       This past June, Rick brought together a wide circle of \n     their family and friends to celebrate all that Odile has \n     meant to him in their years together. The gathering at \n     Versailles Palace was an extraordinary expression of Rick's \n     love.\n       But the gilt and glitter of that magnificent setting paled \n     in comparison to what shined forth in from the hearts of all \n     there assembled in tribute to Odile.\n       In the many decades I have known Rick, he has enjoyed \n     tremendous success in academics, athletics, and business. \n     However, the triumph that counts the most is the crown of his \n     heart, his incomparable wife Odile, my good friend's own \n     angel of mercy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9032-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SCHOOL BACKPACK AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, fall has come and across the \ncountry, students are returning to school facing a public health risk \nfrom what many see as a completely benign and essential back-to-school \nsupply, the school backpack.\n  More than 40 million American students carry backpacks to and form \nschool each day. Health experts say that many of our children are \nhauling around too much weight, and that extra weight can adversely \naffect their healthy growth and development. Children carrying \nbackpacks that are overloaded or improperly worn are putting themselves \nat risk for musculoskeletal pain, including back, neck, and shoulder \npain, adverse affects on posture and the developing spine and \ncompromised breathing and fatigue.\n  The good news for parents and kids is that many of these problems can \nbe avoided by taking some very simple steps to help lighten the load. \nAnd the first step is education, raising awareness among parents, \neducators and kids about these potential risks and offering solutions \nto address them.\n  To that end, the American Occupational Therapy Association, AOTA, is \nsponsoring the first of its kind National School Backpack Awareness Day \nthis week, on Wednesday, September 25. On that day, health \nprofessionals will hold events in schools across the country to weigh-\nin backpack-wearing kids and demonstrate the risks of injury that can \nresult from carrying packs that are worn improperly, or are too heavy. \nExperts say that students should carry backpacks that weigh no more \nthan 15 percent of their total body weight. Occupational Therapists, \nthousands of whom work every day in America's schools, will offer \nsimple steps in how to properly pack, select and wear school backpacks.\n  Nashville, TN, Occupational Therapists will be at the Nashville State \nTechnical Community College helping students learn more about the \nissue. In Knoxville, there will be a backpack weigh-in and Awareness \nDay event at Pond Gap Elementary School. I am proud to see these \ncommunities taking a leadership role on this important public health \nissue and I encourage other communities to take similar action on this \nday to help prevent health care problems that can arise.\n  Surely, we can all appreciate the bottom line lesson in this \nimportant public health education campaign, an ounce of prevention is \nworth of a pound of cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9032-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9032-S9033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mrs. BOXER:\n       S. 2989.

A bill to provide for programs and activities to improve the \nhealth of Hispanic individuals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nbe jointly introduced by Representative Ciro Rodriguez tomorrow when \nthe House of Representatives comes into session entitled the ``Hispanic \nHealth Improvement Act of 2002.'' This bill builds upon legislation \nthat Representative Rodriguez introduced in the last Congress and \naddresses the tremendous health disparities that confront the Hispanic \ncommunity in our Nation.\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\n  Even if you know the statistics, they remain shocking. Over one-\nthird, or 35 percent of Hispanic adults lack health insurance. Despite \nthe passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program, 27 percent of \nLatino children remain uninsured, which is sharp comparison to 9 \npercent of white, 18 percent of black and 17 percent of Asian/Pacific \nIslander children.\n  In testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee earlier today on Hispanic health issues, Dr. Glenn Flores, \nchair of the Latino Consortium of the American Academy of Pediatrics \nCenter for Child Health Research, added:\n\n       Among uninsured poor children in the U.S., Latinos \n     outnumber all other racial/ethnic groups, including whites: \n     there are 1 million poor, uninsured Latino children, compared \n     with 766,000 white, and 533,000 African-American poor, \n     uninsured children. . . . Although 1999 marked the first time \n     in many years that the proportion of uninsured Latino \n     children actually decreased (from 30% to 27%), recent \n     national data suggest that outreach efforts to enroll Latino \n     children have largely been unsuccessful. A Kaiser Commission \n     report found that only 26% of parents of eligible uninsured \n     children said that they had ever talked to someone or \n     received information about Medicaid enrollment, and 46% of \n     Spanish-speaking parents were unsuccessful at enrolling their \n     uninsured children in Medicaid because materials were \n     unavailable in Spanish.\n\n  In order to address the lack of health care coverage, the legislation \nwould expand CHIP to cover pregnant women and parents of children \nenrolled in CHIP. The legislation provides $50 million in grants to \ncommunity-based groups to improve outreach and enrollment of children \nin Medicaid and CHIP with the grants targeted to Hispanic communities.\n  In addition, the bill eliminates a number of enrollment barriers \nwithin Medicaid.\n  And finally, it provides States the option to enroll legal immigrant \npregnant women and children in Medicaid or CHIP. This comes from \nlegislation introduced by Senator Graham earlier in this Congress.\n  In addition to poor coverage rates, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the Hispanic population has \nmorbidity and mortality rates that more often than not exceed that of \nany other ethnic groups. For example, age-adjusted mortality rates for \ndiabetes are over 50 percent higher among Hispanic persons than non-\nHispanic whites. HIV infection rates are over 3 times those of non-\nHispanic whites. Tuberculosis rates among Latino children are 13 times \nthat of whites.\n  The legislation addresses these problems in a number of ways. In the \narea of access and affordability, our bill requires an annual report to \nCongress on how federal programs are responding to improve the health \nstatus of Hispanic individuals with respect to diabetes, cancer, \nasthma, HIV infection, AIDS, substance abuse, and mental health. The \nbill provides $100 million for targeted diabetes prevention, education, \nschool-based programs, and screening activities in the Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  In addition, the legislation specifically addresses the problems \nfacing communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, a 2,000-mile stretch \nof land that contains 11 million people, 5 of the 7 poorest \nmetropolitan statistical areas in the country, and disease rates in \nsome areas that are extraordinary. If the region were a State, the \nborder would rank 1st in the number of uninsured, last in terms of per \ncapita income, and 1st in a number of diseases.\n  As Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, president of the University of Texas \nHealth Sciences Center at San Antonio, noted in testimony at today's \nearlier hearing on Hispanic health, ``Germs respect no INS regulations. \nWe truly must work with our neighbors to the South if we are to avoid a \nmajor influx of new conditions and diseases. It can be seen so clearly \non a map. Just as there are 'rivers of commerce' there are 'rivers of \ninfectious disease' and though they may start at the Border, they are \neventually seen all the way to the northern Border that we share with \nCanada.''\n  In response, the bill provides $200 million to border communities to \nimprove health services and infrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder.\n  The numbers I have cited thus far indicates what we do know. Almost \nas much of a concern is what we do not know with respect to the status \nof Hispanic health in this Nation. According to one study, only 22 \npercent of all articles published in major medical journals included \nnon-English-speaking patients.\n  The bill provides funding to do additional research and work on \nreducing health disparities in this Nation. Among the various \nprovisions include efforts to improve the recruitment and retention of \nHispanic health professionals and programs that support the training \nhealth professionals who can provide culturally competent and \nlinguistically appropriate care. With respect to training more minority \nhealth professionals, Dr. Cigarroa said at today's hearing, ``We should \ndo this because it is the smart thing to do. If we fail to take steps \nto address the gap between the health of the majority population and \nthe health of the nation's rapidly growing minority populations, we are \non a course leading to a collision. We are far too great a nation to \nallow this to happen.''\n  Representative Ciro Rodriguez, the forthcoming chairman of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, and I have worked together on this \nlegislation to respond to the challenge before us with regard to \ncoverage, access, and health disparities entitled the ``Hispanic Health \nImprovement Act of 2002.''\n  While the legislation puts forth a number of initiatives to address \nwhat are disproportionately Hispanic problems, it must be noted that \neach section of the bill, including those to reduce the number of \nuninsured and to improve access to care, would improve the overall \nhealth of our entire Nation regardless of race or ethnicity.\n  Over the coming months, I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto revise and improve upon this legislation for reintroduction in the \n108th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2990\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to submit, on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Clinton and Senator Hutchison, a concurrent resolution \nto recognize the achievements of Mary Baker Eddy and the opening of the \nMary Baker Eddy Library for the Betterment of Humanity. The Library, \nwhich officially opens to the public on September 29, will provide \npublic access to the Mary Baker Eddy papers, one of the largest \ncollections of primary source material by and about an American woman.\n  The Library will provide invaluable insight to Mary Baker Eddy's \nremarkable life and serve as an important resource for scholars, \nresearchers and the public. Its mission will sustain her powerful \nlegacy that ideas can inspire individuals, empower them and transform \ntheir lives.\n  The Mary Baker Eddy Library, a facility encompassing over 80,000 \nsquare feet, will be a dynamic meeting place for people to explore \nideas through its on-sight and on-line educational experiences, \nprograms and exhibits. So, too, its unique Mapparium will once again \navailable to visitors to the Library. The collections consist of over \n100,000 documents, artifacts, photographs and other media that \nchronicle the development of Mary baker Eddy's ideas and offer an \nunparalleled resource for scholars in women's history, spirituality and \njournalism.\n  The Library's effort to release previously unpublished materials in \nthe Mary Baker Eddy Collections to the public will enrich our \nunderstanding of her extraordinary achievements. In conjunction with \nthis facility in Boston, the Library will also establish an Institute \nfor the Rediscovery and Preservation of the History of Women in Seneca \nFalls, New York, the birthplace of the first Women's Rights Convention, \nin order to showcase research on the forgotten histories of women and \noffer a wide range of educational programs for students.\n  I am pleased to submit this resolution to recognize this outstanding \nwoman and the richness of her accomplishments. I would also like to \ncongratulate Virginia Harris for her efforts to ensure that the Mary \nBaker Eddy Library became a reality and for her tireless energy and \nvisionary leadership as Chairman of the Board of the Christian Science \nChurch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9049-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4698.

Mr. President, let me begin tonight with a quote from \nFederalist Paper No. 37, January 11, 1789, by James Madison.\n\n       It is misfortune, inseparable from human affairs, that \n     public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of \n     moderation which is essential to a just estimate of their \n     real tendency to advance or obstruct the public good.\n\n  James Madison believed then it would always be very hard to \ninvestigate events and do it in such a way, in moderation and without \npartisanship, that the public would be able to find out what really \nhappened and then determine what should be done in the future to keep \nit from happening again--to advance the good or obstruct the bad.\n  Another quote goes from an anonymous source goes something along the \nlines of: If God had created a commission to establish Heaven and \nEarth, we wouldn't be here today.\n  Mr. President, my own experiences with commissions over 30 years in \nCongress have not been good. I view Congressional commissions as an \nabdication of responsibility. What are we for? Why do we have an Armed \nServices Committee, an Intelligence Committee, a Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, or a Foreign Affairs Committee?\n  It seems to me that we in Congress should do the work of reviewing \nthe laws and overseeing the agencies and the various departments. Are \nthey serving the public the right way? In a responsible way? Or is \nthere an abdication of responsibility and duty by the various \nadministrations in charge of running our government?\n  One of the reasons I have never supported BRAC, the various base \nclosure commissions, is that when we create those commissions we are \nbasically saying: We do not have the courage to do it; do not let us \nknow what is going on; shove it off on a commission and let them do it.\n  But in the past closing excess bases had always been handled without \na commission after every previous war. However, about 20 or 25 years \nago Congress started to say: No, we cannot do that, we will not do it.\n  In the past after previous wars how was the military scaled down? \nPentagon officials and other administration officials--after World War \nI, after World War II, after the Korean war--would send recommendations \nto the Congress regarding excess capacity and bases they felt were no \nlonger needed. And unless Congress blocked it, the bases were closed. I \nbet every State in the Nation still has bases left over from World War \nII. In my own State, we had bases in Hattiesburg, in Greenville, MS, \nand Greenwood, MS. Some of the finest airport runways in our State are \nthe very sturdy concrete runways that were built during World War II \nfor air training facilities.\n  Congress simply acted and then the administration acted. Then \npowerful members of Congress started saying: No, you cannot close my \nbase; close someone else's base. That is what ultimately led to the \ncreation of commissions.\n  I have no doubt about the integrity and the good intentions of \nSenator Lieberman and Senator McCain with their proposal to create an \nindependent commission to investigate September 11, 2001. How did that \nattacks happen, where were the failures, and how can we avoid repeating \nthem. I know these two men. They are men of good faith that feel so \nstrongly about our country they want this to be a positive thing. They \nenvision some commission of grand pooh-bahs and gray eminences that \nwill assemble and give us the benefit of their great wisdom, men and \nwomen who have been in the Government, been in the intelligence \ncommunity, been in Congress, and thus could do the country a great \nservice.\n\n  Mr. President, the track record of that happening is unfortunately \nvery poor. As with all commissions, there are fundamental problems with \nthis commission. Of course, we are now in the second iteration of how \nthis commission would be set up and I presume there will be a third and \na fourth. I presume the House will have yet a different version after \nthey go through their iterations of a commission. And then the \nAdministration has concerns that will have to be addressed as well.\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\n  Let me point out where a few of the problems with this particular \ncommission are. Initially, the first draft of the Lieberman-McCain \nproposal would have had 14 Members, 5 appointed by the Democrat leaders \nin Congress, 5 by the Republican leaders in Congress and 4 by the \nPresident with the President naming the chairman.\n  Then someone figured out, wait a minute; that means there would be \nnine Republicans and five Democrats. That doesn't look bipartisan \nenough. So they said we cannot do that.\n  Now what is actually in the legislation as proposed is that five \npeople would be appointed by the Democratic leadership and five by \nRepublicans. Senator Daschle appoints three; I would appoint two; the \nSpeaker would appoint three; and Congressman Gephardt, two--for a total \nof 10 members. However, there are no Presidentially appointed members, \nand no process for selecting a chairman. The bill just says there will \nbe a chairman and a vice chairman of opposite parties. So, wonderful, \nhow are the Chairman and Vice Chairmen going to be chosen. By Heaven?\n  If the commission were constituted that way they would be meeting 3 \nmonths just to pick their chairman. Which Member is going to break \nranks and vote with the other five? I know the presumption is that \nthese will be men and women of such eminence and prominence that they \nwould meet, all 10 of them, and quickly decide on a chairman and a vice \nchairman and they would move along swiftly.\n  It ``ain't'' going to happen. I have had direct personal experience \nwith a few commissions over the past 10 years, particularly when I was \nmajority leader. I was involved in setting up a gaming commission to \nlook at gaming in America, the effects of gaming, Internet and Indian \ngaming and the problems associated with gambling. I don't know how much \nmoney they spent for that commission. And good men and women were on \nthat commission--men, women, minorities, and Native Americans \nrepresenting all the various viewpoints. It was well constituted and \nthe people who appointed the members did an exceptionally good job.\n  The commission members met, they acted seriously, they went all over \nthe country, they thought about it, and they filed a report, and closed \nup their commission. I bet not one U.S. Senator ever read the report, \never. And I am embarrassed to say I read an outline and kind of glanced \nover it. I was not an advocate of the gaming commission, but I went \nalong with it at the request of, among others, my great friend from \nIndiana, Dan Coats. Good work. Good intentions, Mr. President. Nothing \ncame of it.\n  Even more recently, we had the Breaux Commission on Medicare. That \nwas an interesting one, too. I think it was set up correctly number-\nwise, with good people: Jay Rockefeller from the Finance Committee; Bob \nKerrey, a very innovative thinker on Medicare; Dr. Bill Fritz was \nappointed on our side; Senator Phil Gramm, certainly one of the most \nknowledgeable Senators in this area who is also on the Finance \nCommittee. Even former Finance Committee Chairman Pat Moynihan was on \nit.\n\n  We also had people from the real world on the commission. I know a \nwoman on the commission who was over 70 with silver hair--I will not \nmention her name because I cannot connect it to her age. She dealt with \nMedicare on a daily basis. She benefitted from Medicare. She knew what \nshe was talking about. We had all these people who knew what Medicare \nwas suppose to do for the nation's seniors, in theory. It was a great \ncommission.\n  John Breaux was the chairman. I might note that it was interesting \nhow John got to be chairman. I remember specifically talking to \nPresident Clinton about somebody both sides could accept. We settled on \nJohn and he took it and did a good job. The commission met and their \nmeetings were on C-SPAN. They did a lot of thoughtful work, they had \ngood debate, and they made excellent recommendations. They issued a \ncommission report detailing their great recommendations.\n  What happened to their report Mr. President? Nothing. None of their \nrecommendations have been implemented or acted on. And, by the way, \nthey called for providing a prescription drug benefit. They had a plan \nto do it without bankrupting the entire Medicare system. It was the \nBreaux proposal and then the Breaux-Frist proposal. It was a tremendous \neffort. But nothing ever came of it.\n  So the track record on Commissions is not good. I don't want this to \nbe a commission that is not set up right, that spends millions of \ndollars for nothing. I am told it is just $3 million, but I bet it \nwinds up being closer to $12 million or more and that does not count \nthe cost of the assistance that the other parts of the federal \ngovernment are required to give it under the proposed bill. The \ncommission will also stretch out over 18 months. When its report is \nultimately filed, it will garner headlines and discussion on the \nweekend talk show for a week or two, but then it will be forgotten and \nnot much will come of it.\n  Mr. President, I sincerely hope that if we do create the commission \nthat I am wrong. But I don't think the prospects or the track record \nlook very good.\n  Now, again, as I have said, the actual language of the amendment \nconcerns me in many respects. For instance, it says that one of the \npurposes of the commission would be:\n\n       . . . to ascertain, evaluate, and report on the evidence \n     developed by all relevant governmental agencies regarding the \n     facts and circumstances surrounding the attacks.\n\n  However, there is no provision in this bill as to how the commission \nwill have to deal with the evidence they are given by the Department of \nJustice, U.S. Attorneys, Federal courts, and others in order to \nsafeguard it. Would the public, and our enemies, be able to get this \ninformation through the Freedom Of Information Act or not? I suppose \nthis issue can be addressed, but it is not clear in the bill as written \nand it needs to be.\n  Mr. President, the commission is also given almost total access to \nthe nation's classified information, yet again there is nothing in the \nproposal that requires or directs the commission to safeguard it. The \nSenate and House Intelligence Committees have strict rules and \nelaborate procedures--as does the CIA, DOD, the National Security \nAgency and other entities entrusted with the nation's top secret \ninformation for protecting such information. Yet, there is there is no \nexplicit requirement in this bill for this commission to protect our \nnational secrets.\n  But again, that is why I like the joint House-Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's efforts--it is equally divided among the parties, they have \nexperience dealing with classified information, and they have settled \nprocedures for handling such information.\n  Astoundingly, it appears that most of this new commission's \nproceedings would have to be public since they would be subject to the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act and that it materials available to the \npublic under the Freedom of Information Act despite that fact that the \nCommission would be dealing with some of our most important and best \nkept secrets.\n  I also have concerns about the procedures for using and the extent of \nthe subpoena authority granted the commission under this amendment. It \nappears that once elected, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or even the \nChairman of a Subcommittee created by the Commission, can issue any and \nall subpoenas he or she desires without having to go back to the rest \nof the Commission for permission, approval, or even a vote on the \nwisdom or propriety of their subpoena. We do not generally grant such \nunilateral subpoena authority to Chairman and Ranking members in \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I have been opposed to this commission thus far. \nFirst, of course, as I have said, because I oppose commissions almost \nuniversally because I do not think they produce good results and \nbecause that is what we in Congress are for. But second--and one of the \nthings I have been thinking about--is because we have already had the \njoint intelligence committee, House and Senate, looking into this \nmatter. Those members have been working through these issues. They are \nstill working on it. They have not yet completed their work. We have \nnot received a final report. We are getting a few preliminary staff \nreports. Nevertheless, it seems we are going to go ahead and have this \nvote before we even get to see what the final results of Congress' own \ninquiry are.\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\n  By the way, I do wish the Joint Committee would do their work and \ntell Congress what we need to do to protect Americans from terrorism in \nthe future. If we need to change even more about how our intelligence \ncommunity operates, let's do it. I think we can do it in a bipartisan \nway.\n\n  Mr. President, I note that the amendment as proposed also states that \nthe commission will:\n\n       . . . make a full and complete accounting of the \n     circumstances surrounding the attacks, and the extent of the \n     United States' preparedness for, and response to, the attacks \n     . . . [and] investigate and report to the President and \n     Congress on its findings, conclusions, and recommendations \n     for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent acts of \n     terrorism.\n\n  I wonder if the sponsors are aware that, since 1995, the Government \nhas produced reams of materials regarding counter-terrorism, \nintelligence activities, and aviation security. Since 1995, seven \ncommissions have dealt in this area and issued 10 separate reports \nprior to 9/11.\n  One of the past commissions was the so-called Gilmore Commission. Its \nofficial name was the ``U.S. Advisory Panel to Assess Domestic Response \nCapabilities for Terrorism Involving Weapons of Mass Destruction.'' The \nGilmore Commission submitted three reports to the President and \nCongress. The first one submitted in 1999 was titled ``Assessing the \nThreat.'' The second submitted in 2000 was titled, ``Toward a National \nStrategy for Combating Terrorism.'' The final report submitted just \nbefore the 9/11 attacks was titled ``For Ray Downey.''\n  The panel consisted of government officials and infrastructure \nspecialists who examined domestic and international threats to the \nhomeland, and made many recommendations for increased security and \nbetter coordination between federal and state agencies in combating \nterrorism.\n  Then there was the Hart-Rudman Commission led by two very respected \nSenators. Its official title was the ``U.S. Commission on National \nSecurity in the 21st Century'' and it ultimately issued reports and \nspecific recommendations in 1999, 2000, 2001.\n  The reports were titled ``New World Coming: Major Themes and \nImplications'' (1999); ``Seeking a National Strategy'' (2000); and \n``Road Map for National Security: Imperative for Change'' (2001). The \ncommission, which was chartered by then Secretary of Defense William \nCohen, had a broad mandate to study ``the anticipated security \nenvironment in the early 21st Century.'' Its recommendations in three \nreports call for a counter-terrorism policy focus on deterrence and \ndomestic preparedness capabilities. Most significantly, the Commission \nrecommended establishing a Homeland Security Agency while noting the \nneed for more human intelligence.\n  Then there was the ``IC21: The Intelligence Community In The 21st \nCentury'' Report. This was done by the House Permanent Select Committee \non Intelligence which published the report in 1996. The goal was to \n``define the type of intelligence community which would best meet the \nU.S. national security needs into the next century.''\n  There was the so-called Bremer Commission created by Public Law 105-\n277 and officially titled the ``U.S. National Commission on Terrorism \nand National Security in the 21st Century.'' The Bremer Commission \nreleased its report in 2000 and recommended a more aggressive domestic \nand foreign policy in combating terrorism.\n  Then there was the Aspin-Brown Commission, led by two more well \nrespected gray eminences of the kind we are talking about--former \nCongressman Aspin and former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. The \nCommission was created by Public Law 103-539 and charged with \n``Preparing for the 21st Century and Appraisal of U.S. Intelligence.''\n  They made three findings in 1996: That the United States needed to \nbetter integrate intelligence into the policy community, needed for \nintelligence agencies to operate as a community, and needed to create \ngreater efficiency and bring more rigor and modern management practices \nto the system. This was in 1996.\n  A really important commission was the ``U.S. White House Commission \nOn Aviation Safety and Security,'' which issued a report from its \nChairman--Vice President Gore to President Clinton in 1997. It was a \ngood report. It also had specific recommendations about how to improve \naviation security. What happened to it? Nothing was acted on. Congress \ndidn't act on it. Good work was done. This commission was tasked with \ndeveloping ``a strategy to improve aviation safety and security, both \ndomestically and internationally.''\n  Let's look at a few of the recommendations this report made in 1997--\nover four years before the 9/11 attacks took place. The very first \nparagraph in the report's 3rd Chapter--titled ``Improving Security for \nTravelers''--said the following:\n\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence sources have been \n     warning that the threat of terrorism is changing in two \n     important ways. First, it is no longer just an overseas \n     threat from foreign terrorists. People and places in the \n     United States have joined the list of targets, and Americans \n     have joined the ranks of terrorists. The bombings of the \n     World Trade Center in New York and the Federal Building in \n     Oklahoma City are clear examples of the shift, as is the \n     conviction of Ramzi Yousef for attempting to bomb twelve \n     American airliners out of the sky over the Pacific Ocean. The \n     second change is that in addition to well-known, established \n     terrorist groups, it is becoming more common to find \n     terrorists working alone or in ad-hoc groups, some of whom \n     are not afraid to die in carrying out their designs.\n\n  Mr. President, that one chapter went on to make 31 recommendations \nfor improving aviation security. Some of those recommendations given \nover four years before 9/11 tragedy were as follows:\n\n       Recommendation 3.7--The FAA should work with airlines and \n     airport consortia to ensure that all passengers are \n     positively identified and subjected to security procedures \n     before they board aircraft.\n       Recommendation 3.9--Assess the possible use of chemical and \n     biological weapons as tools of terrorism.\n       Recommendation 3.10--The FAA should work with industry to \n     develop a national program to increase the professionalism of \n     the aviation security workforce, including screening \n     personnel.\n       Recommendation 3.11--Access to airport controlled areas \n     must be secured and the physical security of aircraft must be \n     ensured.\n       Recommendation 3.14--Require criminal background checks and \n     FBI fingerprints for all screeners, and all airport and \n     airline employees with access to secure areas.\n       Recommendation 3.17--Establish an interagency task force to \n     assess the potential use of surface-to-air missiles against \n     commercial aircraft.\n       Recommendation 3.19--Complement technology with automated \n     passenger profiling.\n       Recommendation 3.20--Certify screening companies and \n     improve screener performance.\n       Recommendation 3.21--Aggressively test existing security \n     systems.\n       Recommendation 3.23--Give properly cleared airline and \n     airport security personnel access to the classified \n     information they need to know.\n       Recommendation 3.24--Begin implementation of full bag-\n     passenger match.\n       Recommendation 3.26--Improve passenger manifests.\n       Recommendation 3.27--Significantly increase the number of \n     FBI agents assigned to counter-terrorism investigations, to \n     improve intelligence and to crisis response.\n\n  Mr. President, all of this information is in the public record. It is \nthere. Why don't we make use of it?\n  The list goes on. There were over 90 GAO reports before 9/11 and now \nthere are over 50 GAO reports on Aviation and National Security and \nTerrorism since 9/11. There was a 1999 report titled ``The FBI 30-year \nRetrospective Special Report on Counter-terrorism'' that was put out by \nthe FBI's Counter-Terrorism Division and which detailed 30 years of \nterrorism. It was done after terrorists were caught in 1999 trying to \nsmuggle bomb-making materials into Jordan, and into the US from Canada \nin Washington State to disrupt celebrations of the Millennium.\n  That report gave the American public the following assurances in \n1999:\n\n       In November 1999, the FBI restructured its National \n     Security Division to create, for the first time, a division-\n     level component dedicated specifically to combating \n     terrorism.\n       In 1999 the FBI established the Counterterrorism and the \n     Investigative Services divisions to further enhance the \n     operational and analytic focus on the full range of \n     activities in which violent extremists engage.\n\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\n\n  The FBI's 30-year retrospective report concluded with the following--\nas it turned out false--assurance in 1999:\n\n       While the threat is formidable, the U.S. intelligence and \n     law enforcement community have developed an effective and \n     highly integrated response to the [counter-terrorism threat.] \n     . . . Increasingly, the FBI's efforts involve the assistance \n     and cooperation of other intelligence and law enforcement \n     agencies. The threats of the new Millennium require such an \n     integrated and aggressive response.\n  Mr. President, do you see my point? Good work has been done by good \nmen and women, experts in this field, reports on what we need to do in \norder to do a better job--in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and 2000 and \n2001. All this good work by the commissions, the GAO, the FBI, and \nothers has not resulted in us doing anything about it.\n  Now we are going to have one more commission report. These are the \ncommission reports on my desk that have been done already since 1995--a \npretty good stack. It is very interesting reading.\n  The GAO report here, just on the top, ``Combating Terrorism, FBI'S \nUse of Federal Funds for Counter-terrorism and Related Activities''--\nthere is just simply a plethora of counter-terrorism reports available \nmaking thousands of recommendations. These reports did not look at the \nspecific events that led up to 9/11 and what happened and what we have \nlearned from that, but they did look at what we should have been doing \nto prevent it.\n  I think, unfortunately, this commission amendment is probably going \nto be agreed to, but I wanted to raise my concerns about the way the \ncommission amendment is drafted, the way the commission would be \ncreated, the cost that would be involved, and the likelihood that at \nthe end of the day its findings will meet the fate of those from so \nmany commissions before it.\n  As to money, I am sure they are starting off way low. They will be \nback asking for an increase in money within 3 to 6 months. I have \nalready experienced that, too. In fact, one of the commissions I \nreferred to earlier came back wanting more money, they wanted a little \nbit more, they came back yet a second time but I said: No. Wrap it up.\n  So I just do not think this is a wise thing to do. I think we ought \nto do it, or I think the administration ought to do it, but somebody \nneeds to grab hold of this and do it the right way. Maybe the joint \nintelligence committee can still give us what we need in order to \ndecide if we need more laws or if we need more reform within the \nintelligence community. But this commission is not going to bring us a \nlot more. It may get a few big headlines. It is going to cost a lot \nmore money. Yet, I doubt if much will come out of it.\n  By the way, probably the earliest we will get anything out of it \nspecifically would be 18 months from now. Goodness gracious, if we need \nto take action on what we have learned and what we know, are we going \nto wait for 18 months to see this commission report before we act? By \nthe time this commission acts, I fervently hope that Congress will \nalready have done everything that needs to be done as a result of the \nevents of 9/11.\n  I thank the Chair for showing patience, and the staff here. I do not \nwant to keep them too long. But I was afraid I would not get an \nopportunity to raise these questions tomorrow before we go to the vote. \nMaybe there will be a stampede to just get this done, but, boy, we are \ngoing to need to do a lot of work before we enact it into law.\n  I believe we are ready to complete our work for the day. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/23/senate-section/article/S9053-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:25 A.M.
