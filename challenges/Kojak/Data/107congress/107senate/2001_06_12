The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand the proponent of the \namendment, Senator Gregg, will be here momentarily. I back up what our \nleaders have stated. We are interested in the completion of this \nlegislation. We have been making progress in the disposition of \namendments, but we have a\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nnumber of our colleagues who have said they are not ready to call up \ntheir amendments. That might have been a reasonable comment a week ago \nor 4 weeks ago or 5 weeks ago, but it certainly is not now. We are \ngoing to move ahead. Regrettably, there are ways we can ultimately \ndispose of these amendments if we are put in that position.\n  What is completely unacceptable and completely unfair to our \ncolleagues is the failure to bring these amendments up and to indicate \nto the floor managers a willingness to work through these amendments.\n  We are glad to have the votes when the votes are due. We are glad to \ndebate amendments, discuss them, and accept them when we can. We are \nglad to cooperate in every way. We have received the strong direction \nfrom our leader saying we want disposition. This bill has been before \nthe Senate for 8 weeks. Members have had an opportunity to study it, to \nread about it, to think about it, and work with their staffs. There is \nno further reason for delay. We will make every effort to dispose of \nthe amendments in a timely way. We are prepared to work long and hard \non these measures. We intend to accept the leader's challenge and \ncomplete the work this week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be charged to the \nproponent of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 536\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, is recognized to offer amendment No. 536, on \nwhich there will be 4 hours for debate.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask that the clerk report my amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Hutchinson, proposes an amendment numbered 536.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment printed in the Record of May 9, 2001, \nunder ``Amendments Submitted''.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment has popularly been referred \nto as the choice amendment or the portability amendment. It is an \namendment which is crucial to the issue of how we are going to approach \neducation as we proceed as a nation. It is crucial for a lot of \ndifferent reasons, but primarily it deals with a group of people in our \ncountry who have been left behind in our educational system. It doesn't \ndeal with the wealthy. It doesn't deal with those of moderate income. \nIt really deals with low-income people, most of them in urban schools, \nwho find the school systems their children are put into are failing and \nthat their children are being left behind.\n  The American dream, which is the essence of what makes our country \nsuch a vibrant nation, is tied to the ability to be an educated \nindividual. You cannot participate in the American dream unless you are \nwell educated, unless you can compete and participate in our society, \nand that requires a quality education.\n  So when you go through a school which does not teach, which is filled \nwith violence or filled with drugs, when you know every day a child who \ngoes to that school is falling further and further behind his or her \npeers in other schools because that school is not able to teach that \nchild, then that child cannot participate in the American dream--you \nare denying that child the opportunity to participate in the American \ndream.\n  There are many attempts in this bill to correct the problem. There \nare many initiatives in this bill to try to make failing schools work \nbetter. Regrettably, they are not going to all work. There will \ncontinue to be schools that fail.\n\n  Today, in our system of education, literally thousands of schools \nacross this country are defined as failing schools, and that means that \nthousands, tens of thousands, potentially millions of children, \nunfortunately, are in schools that are not educating them adequately.\n  So one option that should be given to the parents of those children \nis to allow them, after their children have been in a failing school \nfor a period of time and the school has not improved even though \nattempts have been made to improve it--to allow those children, and the \nparents of those children, to have other options, to go to schools \nwhere they will be able to learn, where they will be able to succeed, \nand where they will, therefore, be able to take advantage of the \nAmerican dream.\n  This bill, hopefully, will include an expansion of what is known as \npublic school choice. But there are a lot of communities in this \ncountry, regrettably, that have no public schools that are not failing \nto which kids can move. Therefore, the option of going to some other \ntype of school, a private school, should be available to them.\n  In our society, if you have a fairly decent income, you can leave the \npublic school system and go to a private school. A lot of people who \nhave the income to accomplish it choose that option. The former \nPresident of the United States, for example, chose that option. But if \nyou are a single mother, especially a single mother in an urban area, \ntrying to raise your children on a low income, you do not have that \noption; you are stuck in that failing school. Your children are \nsentenced to that school even though the school is unable to accomplish \nwhat it is supposed to do, which is to teach your children.\n  This amendment is not going to fully address the issue. I wish it \nwould, but it is not. This amendment is going to set up a demonstration \nprogram, and a very limited demonstration program, the purpose of which \nis to see if private school choice using Federal dollars can alleviate \nthe problem to some degree, can allow some children today, who are not \nin schools that are teaching them, to go to schools that will teach \nthem; to allow some children to have a chance at the American dream who \ndo not have it today. Private school choice is used in a lot of public \nsystems.\n\n  Remember, when you are talking private school choice, it sounds as if \nyou are saying the public schools are left out of the process. In the \npublic system, they use private school choices. Today, in the public \nsystem, the elected officials are responsible. They make the decision \nthat children in the school system should have a choice between a \npublic and private system. It is used in a lot of different \ncommunities. It is used in Milwaukee. It is used in Cleveland. It is \nused in Florida. It is used to some degree in Arizona.\n  The difficulty, of course, behind this is that these States and these \ncommunities have come to the conclusion that they will improve their \npublic school system by allowing some of the children in their public \nschool systems to have the option of going to a private school if the \npublic school isn't working well.\n  This demonstration program is an attempt to follow the leadership \nthat has been shown already by a lot of other public school districts \nacross this country who have chosen to put in place a private school \noption as part of their public school education system, as I\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nsaid, in a very limited proposal. In fact, I intend to modify it to \nmake it even more limited as we go down the road. But, essentially, \nunder the present structure, it will only be voluntary, and it will \nonly apply to families who make less than $32,000 a year. This is not \ngoing to be a high-income option. It will only apply to families who \nmake less than $32,000 a year and whose children are in school systems \nwhere the school has failed for 3 years. That means by definition that \nchild, if he or she is in the third grade, is already probably 3 years \nbehind their peers in the school system that is working correctly.\n  It will also be limited as to the number of groups that can \nparticipate to three States in ten school districts.\n  It is a very small demonstration program. It will be limited to $50 \nmillion, funds which come from outside the title I program.\n  It cannot be argued that the dollars to fund this demonstration \nprogram are in any way undermining the dollars available to the public \nschool system. This will be a new pool of money available to fund the \nchild who moves on to a private system because the school system isn't \nworking correctly.\n  It will also have as a component that special consideration must be \ngiven for applications of students coming from the highest number of \nlow-income families. It will really focus on those families who need it \nthe most, who, in my opinion, happen to be in primary instances single \nmoms trying to raise their kids mostly in inner-city schools.\n  Since the purpose of this amendment is a demonstration grant and a \nsmall one at that, it will have an extremely aggressive evaluation \nprocedure so that we can find out whether or not private school choice \nunder a public school system works.\n  Parents in our urban schools have been waiting for this type of \nreform for a long time. There has been a lot of rhetoric about it. \nAbout every 2 years, the superintendent of the District of Columbia \nschool system changes. While the system of the superintendent changes, \nthe school systems regrettably don't. We continue to see failure.\n  Today we have 9,000 schools across this country which are identified \nas failures--9,000 schools. Some have been identified as failures for 4 \nyears, for 6 years, and for 8 years.\n\n  It is not unheard of, for example, for an entire public school \ndistrict to be identified as failing. That is the case, for example, in \nKansas City. Clearly the parents there have no option. They cannot go \nfrom one public school to another public school because all of the \npublic schools in the districts have failed.\n  As a result of this failure, we have seen especially a debilitating \nimpact on minority kids. We know, for example, that today two out of \nevery three African-American students and Hispanic students in fourth \ngrade can barely read. Seventy percent of the children in high-poverty \nschools score below even the most basic levels of reading, and half the \nstudents from urban school districts fail to graduate on time if they \ngraduate at all.\n  We need to give the parents of these children an additional option.\n  There is, I believe, great interest in this. You don't have to \nbelieve me. You don't have to take this as just a vague statement \nbecause there have been exercises in this area that have shown this, \nespecially from low-income families.\n  The Children's Scholarship Fund, which was founded by Ted Forstmann \nand John Walton, created a private foundation to provide scholarships \nto low-income children who wanted the opportunity to go out of the \npublic school system into a private school system. They received 1.25 \nmillion applications from poor families across the country. \nUnfortunately, they could only give out 40,000 scholarships. But in New \nYork City, 29 percent of the poor families of school-age children \napplied. In the District of Columbia, 33 percent of families of poor \nchildren applied. In Baltimore, 44 percent of poor families with \nschool-aged children applied.\n  Joseph Califano, in commenting on this, said:\n\n       These parents sent a powerful message. They want out of \n     schools that cannot protect their children's safety, let \n     alone teach them. This tidal wave of applications from \n     parents desperate to give their children an opportunity to \n     receive a quality education must serve as a wake-up call . . \n     . By quarantining poor--\n\n  That is probably the best way to describe it because that is what we \ndo in our society--\n\n     mostly minority children in schools affluent families would \n     never tolerate, we do not preserve the institution of public \n     education. We dishonor its guiding ideals.\n\n  Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King, in commenting on this, \nsaid:\n\n     . . . some children receive a better education than others \n     due to their parents' abilities to pay for benefits that are \n     often missing in public schools. This inequity is a violation \n     of the civil right of the parents and children who are so \n     afflicted by lack of income and by the mismanagement endemic \n     to so many of the country's public school systems.\n\n  Some would say if you take this option, you are going to undermine \nthe public system because you are going to take kids out of the public \nsystem and put them into a private system. Of course, we really do not \nknow what will happen because we have never tried it at the Federal \nlevel. But we do have examples of what has happened in public school \nsystems in other communities that have tried to put in their State and \nlocal dollars.\n  We know, for example, that in places such as Charlotte and Milwaukee \nthe public school systems have been perceived, at least by the local \ncommunity, as improving significantly as a result of a private school \nchoice.\n  A study, in fact, which was done by Harvard economist Caroline Hoxby, \nfound the Milwaukee private school choice program pushed the city's \npublic elementary schools to improve.\n  Quoting from the leadership in the Milwaukee public school system, \nKenneth Johnson, vice president of the Milwaukee public school board of \ndirectors and an AFL-CIO member, said:\n\n       Private school choice is one of the best things that ever \n     happened to my city's public schools. . . . When choice came \n     about, the Milwaukee Public School System had to rethink \n     education. It's now a matter of seeing parents as customers.\n\n  Milwaukee public school superintendent Spence Korte said:\n\n       Between choice and the general decline of live births, \n     we're all feeling the pinch to make sure that people \n     understand what our programs offer and, certainly that we're \n     competitive.\n\n  In other words, the school systems are improving as a result of \nchoice.\n  John Gardiner, an at-large member of the Milwaukee public school \nboard of directors and a member of the NAACP and the ACLU, stated the \nfollowing about the effects of choice on public schools in Milwaukee:\n\n       My involvement in the MPS--as a member of the school board, \n     as a parent and as an active and concerned citizen--has \n     persuaded me that MPS's internal reforms require the \n     sustained challenge and competition of the Milwaukee Parental \n     Choice Program. The program puts effective pressure on MPS to \n     expand, accelerate and improve reforms long deliberated and \n     too-long postponed.\n\n  The simple fact is, we have seen in Milwaukee, which has tried public \nschool/private school choice options aggressively, a significant \nimprovement in the school system and a significant improvement in the \nquality of the education of the students, which is the basic goal.\n  In Florida the same situation can be cited. Florida has a statewide \nchoice program where they rate the schools; and if you are in a school \nthat is rated D or F, you have the opportunity to choose a private \nschool option.\n  The Urban League of Miami found that the Florida voucher plan \ninstilled in public schools a sense of urgency and zeal for reform not \nseen in the past, when a school's failure was rewarded only with more \nmoney that reinforced failure.\n  It is fairly obvious, I believe, first through just looking at the \nsituation and in reviewing it, and from intuition, that if you create \ncompetition you usually improve a product.\n  The reason somebody chooses McDonald's over Burger King is because \nthey think the product is better at one or the other. Regrettably, our \npublic school systems have not ever had the competition necessary to \nimprove the product.\n  The purpose of choice, of course, is not to undermine the public \nschool system; it is just the opposite. It is to create an incentive \nfor reform in the public school system which improves those systems. \nThat is exactly what has been seen to happen in those areas of our \ncountry where choice has been given a reasonable opportunity to be \ntested, specifically in Milwaukee and Florida.\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\n  What about student achievement, which, of course, is the bottom line? \nThe goal is to take these kids who have been locked in a failing \nschool, who are reading at two or three grade levels behind their \npeers, who are not graduating, who, therefore, cannot participate in \nthe American dream, and give them an opportunity.\n  Every major evaluation of school choice effectiveness has found \nsignificant academic gains for the students participating in those \nprograms. Test scores in Milwaukee, Dayton, and Charlotte have all been \nreviewed by scholars from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Georgetown, and \nthe University of Texas. In all those communities it has been \ndetermined that the kids who have been able to participate in the \nprivate school option have had their test scores go up. These, in all \ninstances, have been kids from low-income families, urban poor in most \ninstances, who before they had this option were left out of the \nAmerican dream.\n  We have spent $120 billion in the last 35 years on title I, directed \nat trying to help low-income kids. The result of those expenditures has \nbeen that low-income kids are reading two grade levels below their \npeers and are graduating from high school at half the rate of their \npeers. There has been absolutely no academic improvement in those kids \nover this 35-year period. In the last 10 years, when we spent the most \namount of money, the academic improvement also has not increased at \nall.\n  There has been $120 billion spent to try to help kids who have come \nfrom low-income families, and we have left them behind. It is a \ndisgrace. We have locked these children in schools where they cannot \nlearn because there is violence, because there are drugs, and because \nthe school system simply will not respond to the needs of those \nchildren.\n\n  What I am suggesting in this amendment is a small step--a two-tenths \nof 1 percent step compared to what we spend in the rest of title I in \nthis bill--to be applied to a demonstration--$50 million--to see if we \ncan determine whether or not the option of giving children a private \nschool choice is going to improve their academic achievement. It is \nhardly a big expense in the context of what we have done, but if you \nlook at it in the context of what the results have been in communities \nsuch as Milwaukee and Dayton and Charlotte and the State of Florida, \nthe returns may be overwhelming.\n  This could be the best investment we make in this entire bill in \nterms of giving kids an opportunity to learn and participate in the \nAmerican dream.\n  Are parents satisfied with this option? If you look at the States and \nthe communities that have used this approach, parents are \nextraordinarily satisfied.\n  In Charlotte, nearly twice as many choice parents gave their \nchildren's school an A rating as did those parents whose kids went to \npublic schools.\n  In Milwaukee, 72 percent of the parents with kids going to private \nschools gave their kids' school an A rating as compared to 16 percent \nfor the public schools.\n  So the impact is significant. The parents see it and, most \nimportantly, the children see it in their better chance to participate \nin America.\n  One of those images that stands out from when I was a kid watching \nTV--and I do not even remember the Governor's full name; I guess it was \nFaubus, from Arkansas--I remember the National Guard going up to the \nschool. I must have been in the first grade or so or maybe I was in the \nthird grade. The National Guard went up to the school door, and this \nelected official, who was the Governor of the State, was standing in \nthe school door saying he was not going to let this child, who seemed \nto be a little bit older than me, about the age of my brother--I think \nit was a girl--in the school. I could not understand it. Of course, we \nlearned this was wrong. And we changed our Nation because of it.\n  Today what we have are people standing in that school door not \nletting kids out, locking them in those schools which are not teaching \nthem. And why? Why are they doing that? Because the bureaucracy and the \nlabor unions fear the option of giving parents a choice. It is that \nsimple.\n  This is not about education. This is about the power of political \ngroups to influence the process. When you have lost generation after \ngeneration of kids to schools that are failing, when you have 9,000 \nschools in this country that are designated as failing, and those \nschools have failed for 4 and 5 and 6 and 8 years, and you know that \nevery child who goes through that school is not going to have a chance \nto participate in the American dream, Miss King is right, a civil right \nis being denied--absolutely being denied to those children--simply \nbecause they do not have the wherewithal to get out of that school and \nget a decent education.\n  In this bill we attempt to improve those schools that have failed. We \nmake a huge commitment in that area. But we know we are not going to be \nsuccessful everywhere. We know that. We know that in some urban areas \nthe schools simply are not going to cut it, and the kids who go to \nthose schools are going to be left behind.\n  We have an obligation, I believe, to at least find out whether or not \nthere isn't a better way, to first give that child an option to get a \ndecent education and, second, to put real pressure on that public \nschool system to improve.\n  We have seen it work in Milwaukee. We have seen it work in Charlotte. \nWe have seen it work in Florida. And for a small amount of $50 million, \nwe can see whether it can work here with the Federal Government, \ntargeted solely on the child who comes from a low-income family and who \nis stuck in a school that has failed for 3 consistent years.\n  I can't see how this amendment can be opposed, other than on the \ngrounds that it affronts the power politics of Washington, DC, which \nare structured around bureaucracies and labor unions that will at all \ncosts defend their turf, even if that cost involves a child's \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas such time as he \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, for his leadership on this issue. He has outlined \nnot only what this amendment is but what it would do and why it is so \nimportant.\n  It would enable 10 interested cities, 3 interested States, to provide \nlow-income parents with the option to send their children to the public \nor private school of their choice. The Secretary of Education would \naward grant money to these interested cities and States based on their \napplication.\n  Under the amendment, special consideration would be given to \napplications which sought to serve the highest number of children from \nlow-income families and that provided parents with a diverse range of \nschools from which to choose. No money would be taken away from public \nschools for this program. Whether it is title I or IDEA, there would be \na hold harmless. Nobody would be reduced. A pool of money of $50 \nmillion would be established in fiscal year 2002 to be used for this \nnew program.\n  Only children who are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch, \nchildren from families at 185 percent of poverty or below, and who \nattend a school that has been identified as failing for 3 successive \nyears would be eligible to receive educational certificates for tuition \nunder this amendment.\n  There is also a strong evaluation component to this program. It \nrequires the Secretary of Education to contract with an independent \nevaluating entity to conduct an ongoing evaluation of the program. For \nall the doubters out there, we would at least be able to provide the \ndata, to provide the evidence one way or another on whether choice \nreally benefits students and parents and, in fact, improves public \nschools.\n  The Center on Education Policy, an independent advocate for public \nschools, states in their report entitled ``School Vouchers: What We \nKnow and Don't Know and How We Could Learn More,'' evaluation \nrequirements are important to any public policy on school choice.\n  This little pittance of $50 million for the entire Nation could \nprovide us the kind of database we need, the kind of evidence, the kind \nof analysis to allow public policymakers of the future to know. Senator \nGregg and I may have the confidence--we may believe the\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nevidence is there--but this demonstration program will provide the kind \nof evidence needed to convince policymakers, both at the State and \nFederal level, of the value of a choice program.\n  The idea of school choice is not at all new. It has been around for \nyears. We currently have three high-profile school choice programs in \nMilwaukee, Cleveland, and Florida. There are a number of others around \nthe country. They offer a money-back guarantee to parents of children \nin failing schools.\n  Taxpayers deserve to get results from funding that goes to public \nschools. After 35 years and $120 billion in Federal funding, it is time \nwe hold schools accountable for enabling our children to reach high \nstandards.\n  In my own thinking, as I have cosponsored this amendment and thought \nabout the issue of what is the legitimate role of the Federal \nGovernment, do we have a role, I believe it must be very limited. I do \nbelieve, however, that a demonstration program that targets only low-\nincome students--and that has been the basis upon which the Federal \nGovernment has involved itself in a domain that has been historically \nleft to State and local entities; we have said the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility for disadvantaged students in trying to narrow the \nlearning gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students--fits the \nproper Federal role. This amendment targets directly those who are \ndisadvantaged. Only low-income students from low-income families would \nbe able to access these education certificates.\n\n  In my own mind, I have outlined five reasons I believe this amendment \nshould be passed. No. 1, it is totally voluntary and permissive. We are \ntalking about 10 cities in 3 States. No one would be forced. There \nwould be no compulsion. I know some of my colleagues from Western \nStates do not support the idea of choice. They don't see that as \nadvantageous in their particular situation. I understand that. I ask \nthem--not for what it might do for their rural States in which there \nare few choices and in which schools are widely diverse and separated \nby many miles--to think, as they vote on the amendment, not about their \nStates, because it will not affect them, but about those children \ntrapped in failing schools in the inner cities of our country, to think \nabout inner-city Philadelphia or inner-city Washington, DC, or Atlanta \nor Houston where the Secretary of Education understands the value of \nthis kind of a program and has endorsed this very concept.\n  No one would be forced to be involved. There is no compulsion. There \nwould be an independent entity to evaluate and determine whether or not \nthis was a worthwhile approach.\n  A report prepared by the National Research Council and commissioned \nby the Clinton administration recommends that Government conduct ``a \nlarge and ambitious research experiment to determine whether school \nchoice programs improve student performance.'' That was the \nrecommendation of a study commissioned by the Clinton administration, \nissued in 1999, that said this is exactly the kind of large-scale \nexperiment--if you can call $50 million nationwide large scale--to give \nus the answers to the questions posed concerning the value of a choice \nprogram.\n  I believe choice opponents, those who oppose the idea of allowing \nparents this kind of choice, should support this amendment. If in fact \nthey are right, this will give them the data to put the stake, finally, \nin the idea of choice programs.\n  It is totally voluntary. It is entirely permissive. I hope my \ncolleagues who have reservations about choice will support this \namendment, realizing that no school district and no State would be \nrequired to participate. It is entirely permissive. Only those who are \ninterested, only those who, on their own volition, decide they want to \nexperiment, they want to try, they want to be a part of this \ndemonstration program, will even be affected.\n  No. 2, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because in fact \nit does target and benefit those for whom we have our greatest \nconcern--low-income families. It would only be failing schools, those \nwho have failed year after year after year. The certificates would only \nbe for children who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.\n  We have a form of choice in this country right now. The choice, \nthough, is limited to your ability to move to a new neighborhood. I am \ntold that in Dallas, TX, there are about 158 local schools. Affluent \nfamilies are limited in their choice of what elementary school to go to \nonly by their ability to buy a home in that particular neighborhood.\n  Those who have the means to relocate--and it happens here in the \nWashington, DC, area. When people think about buying a home or a \ntownhouse, they will investigate the neighborhood, the schools, the \ncrime rate, and they will check out where the best schools are, which \nschools have the best teachers, which schools produce the best academic \nproduct. They will make their determination of where they want to \nlocate, buy their townhouse, or build their home based upon the quality \nof the schools. They have their choice.\n  But those who have no choice are those who are trapped by a limited \nincome and limited resources and cannot make the decision that their \nmore affluent neighbors can make to move to a better neighborhood. \nThose low-income families are trapped. They have no choice.\n  My friends, we have a choice program in this country. The choice is \nwhether we want to extend those choices to those today who are left \nout, who don't have the resources. This amendment targets only those \nwho are in the title I category, those who are low income.\n  In August of 2000, Dr. Jay Greene issued a report entitled ``The \nEffective School Choice and Evaluation of the Charlotte Children \nScholarship Fund.'' He released the results of that study on the \nCharlotte scholarship program. Among the study's findings, he found \nthat school choice improved scores, pleased parents, provided a safer \nenvironment, reduced racial conflict, operated with less money, and \noffered smaller class sizes and helped low-income parents.\n  In early 2000, John Witt, a professor of the University of Wisconsin, \nMilwaukee, the official evaluator of the Milwaukee school choice \nprogram, released the results of that latest study. His prior reports, \nwhich often had been critical of the Milwaukee choice program and \nbasically concluded they didn't work, most recently changed his \nconclusions and said the market approach to education and analysis of \nAmerica's voucher program said that ``choice is a useful tool to aid \nlow-income families.''\n  That is the reason I ask my colleagues to join in supporting this \namendment because it is targeting only the most disadvantaged. The \nargument so often raised against vouchers is this is only going to \nbenefit higher income people making the choice to go to private schools \nand this is going to make it easier for them to flee the public schools \nfor the private schools. You cannot make that case under this \namendment. It targets and it is limited only to failing schools and \nlow-income families.\n  Low-income academic improvement has been undisputed in the choice \nprograms in this country. In August of 2000, Harvard University \nprofessor Paul Peterson and his colleagues released the results of a \nstudy of a privately funded voucher program in New York, in Dayton, OH, \nand in the District of Columbia. They found that African-American \nchildren who used vouchers to attend private schools made significant \nacademic improvements. Black students in their second year at a private \nschool had improved their test scores by 6.3 percentile points--a \nstriking advance at a time when schools around the country were showing \nan inability to close the achievement gap between white and African-\nAmerican students.\n  If we are really concerned, as we insist we are, in increasing title \nI funding because of our concern about disadvantaged students, everyone \nwho says that should support this amendment because it can only benefit \nthose who are least advantaged today.\n  Another piece of evidence is that test scores of low-income children \nare consistently improving when they are placed in schools with middle-\nincome children. For example, a congressionally mandated 4-year study \nof about 27,000 title I students found that poor students who attended \nmiddle-class schools performed significantly better than those who \nattended schools where\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nat least half the children were eligible for subsidized lunch. The \ncontrast was even greater with schools in which more than 75 percent of \nstudents lived in low-income households. I think that is very \ncompelling; that this kind of a demonstration program, this kind of a \nchoice opportunity is going to be particularly beneficial academically \nfor low-income, disadvantaged students who now would be able to be \nshoulder to shoulder in a school that had higher income students--what \nwe call middle and upper middle class students. The evidence is that \nwhen put in that classroom context, academic scores go up. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment because, in fact, it targets and \nbenefits the most needy--low-income students.\n  Thirdly, it takes absolutely nothing from the public schools. No \nState will lose money. Not a State in this country would see their \nportion of Federal funding reduced because of this amendment. There \nwould be no title I reductions; there would be no IDEA impact. All of \nthe kinds of traditional arguments we hear against choice programs are \ntaken off the table by this amendment. No school would lose money; no \npublic school would be hurt. It would merely provide an opportunity--a \nsmall opportunity indeed--for $50 million statewide, 3 States, 10 \ncities--but it would begin to give us the evidence we need, and it \nwould give hope to a few who would be able to participate in this \ndemonstration program.\n  It answers the main concern that opponents have raised, and that is \nthat it is taking money away from public schools. It will not do that. \nI think that is evidenced by the fact the Washington Post endorsed the \nGregg amendment. Everybody--all my colleagues--has on their desk a copy \nof that endorsement. Their concern has been that these kinds of choice \nprograms are going to take money away from the public schools or they \nare going to only benefit higher income people. This amendment \naddresses both of those concerns. That is why the Washington Post has \nendorsed this amendment, because it targets the low income and will \nhave no negative impact on public schools.\n  Fourthly, I ask Senators to support this amendment because this whole \nconcept is, in fact, immensely popular. It is supported by the vast \nmajority of the American people--this kind of idea to give parents more \nchoices and more opportunities.\n  For example, a congressionally mandated 4-year study of about 27,000 \ntitle I students--I made reference to that, but they showed great \nacademic improvement. The popularity of this program is becoming \nincreasingly beyond dispute.\n  In March 2001, the National Education Association released their \nfindings from a recent survey in which a clear majority of the American \npeople supported the President's proposal to allow parents of children \nin chronically failing schools to use public dollars to send their \nchildren to a public, private, or charter school of choice. In fact, 63 \npercent favored giving them tuition vouchers worth $1,500 a year, as \nthe President originally proposed.\n  Frankly, I wish we had done what the President campaigned on and what \nhe proposed doing, in taking part of that title I money, the Federal \ndollars, for low-income children, and in chronically failing schools \nthat failed in 3 successive years, giving them the opportunity to take \nthat money and use it in private schools, with tutors. That has been \nwatered down, diluted, and basically removed. All that remains is \nsupplemental services, not a voucher at all. I wish we had done that. \nThe American people supported that. But we didn't and we are where we \nare. This is our opportunity to at least give it a try. It is supported \nand is very popular.\n  Senator Gregg cited the statistics during his opening comments that \nlast year the Children's Scholarship Foundation, a private scholarship \nfund, offered 40,000 scholarships nationwide and had one and a quarter \nmillion applicants. Maybe that is the best evidence. Maybe that is the \nbest evidence of the popularity of this approach. Those one and a \nquarter million applications were in spite of the fact that applicants \nhad to match the scholarship with $1,000 of their own money. Low-\nincome, poor families were willing to put up $1,000 in order to be able \nto participate, to have the choice that wealthier, higher income people \nhave every day.\n\n  This is a popular concept. It is something we as a Senate, we as a \nCongress, should give a trial opportunity--or fail. We should not \nbuckle under to the teachers unions and those who are wedded to the \nstatus quo. If we are concerned about leaving no child behind, this is \nan amendment that ought to get overwhelming support in the Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because it fosters \ncompetition and innovation. I believe competition between private \nschools and public schools benefits all children in this country.\n  I have often used the analogy of our higher education in this \ncountry. We have, indisputably, the best higher educational system in \nthe world. Travel the world; we find leaders in most of the countries \nof this world who have received part of their higher education in the \nUnited States. Foreign students flock to this country to receive the \nbest in higher education. How did we achieve that? We created a system \nof Pell grants. One can take that Pell grant and go anywhere, any \naccredited institution: public, private, parochial or otherwise. That \ncompetition has enhanced the quality and the academic standing of all \nof our institutions of higher learning. It has fostered innovation and \nmade our colleges and universities world class by all standards.\n  Then we look at elementary, look at high school, and see between 4th \ngrade and 12th grade this steep decline in our competitiveness with \nother nations. The difference is, in higher education, there is choice; \nin elementary and secondary, there is no choice unless you are wealthy \nenough to take advantage, unless you have the resources. Then you have \nchoice.\n  Why should we not give low-income parents the same opportunity, the \nsame choices, the same chance to give their children the opportunity to \nlive the American dream that their more affluent neighbors have? That \nis the heart, that is the crux of the Gregg amendment.\n  I believe, as we have seen in Milwaukee, public schools will improve \nand academic achievement for all students will improve. It is one of \nthe interesting things about the Jay Greene study on the Florida A+ \nprogram. It was not just the students who were beneficiaries but the \npublic school institutions that are the winners. He found when a public \nschool failed for the second time and they began to have the threat \nthat some of their students might depart and receive opportunity \nscholarships to go elsewhere hanging over them, suddenly those test \nscores began to increase. In fact, they increased twice as much as \nthose test score achievements in other schools. So the schools of all \nstripes are the winners under a program such as this. That competition \nis healthy.\n  America today has, whether we admit it or not, a nationwide school \nchoice system. It is a school choice system that is rationed, rationed \neducational opportunity, through the housing market--where you can \nafford to live. If you can afford to move out into the suburbs, if you \ncan afford to go and pick your neighborhood where the good schools are, \nyou have your choice.\n  We have a very class conscious choice system in this country. The \nGregg amendment says shouldn't those who stand to gain the most, those \nwho are the most disadvantaged, those who are in the lowest income \nhomes, have some choices, too? They have been locked out of those \nchoices. They have been trapped in failing schools. They don't have the \nopportunity to move away from their neighborhood. When given the \nchance, through private scholarships, limited as any are, the private \nscholarship students have taken those opportunities because they know \nwhat is at stake is the children's future.\n\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to consider this amendment--not just \nto write it off as a choice program that may or may not benefit your \nparticular State, or to write it off and say, I have always said I \noppose choice so I will vote against this without even examining what \nit does or who it targets, or to say, I don't want to take the heat I \nmight receive from the National Education Association or other groups \nthat are wedded to this system we have had for 35 years. If we believe \nour commitment and our responsibility as Federal\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\npublic policymakers is to help low-income, help disadvantaged kids, \nthen look at this amendment.\n  I remind my colleagues again, it takes nothing away from the public \nschools. It does not diminish by one dime the resources they have. It \ntargets only the low income.\n  Let's give it a chance. Look at the data: $50 million, 3 States, 10 \ncities. Let's give the most needy in our society the same choice the \nmost affluent already have.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his excellent statement and yield \nto the Senator from Tennessee 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be brief. I rise in support of the \nGregg amendment. The amendment is locally initiated, limited in scope, \nand voluntary. It is a pilot program. It takes nothing away from other \neducational funds. It involves a rigorous evaluation to monitor whether \nthe pilot program is successful.\n  The power of this amendment is in how it addresses the underlying \npremise of leaving no child behind, the premise that no child should be \nlocked in a failing school, a school that fails year after year after \nyear. It gives parents the right to do what is best for their own \nchildren, giving them opportunities, giving them alternatives if their \nchildren are locked in a failing school.\n  Imagine a married couple making $30,000 a year. Their fourth grade \ndaughter attends a school which fails to meet national standards. This \nschool is failing to adequately education their daughter. The parents \nknow their daughter's future depends on the education she receives from \nthe school she attends.\n  The daughter graduates to the fifth grade, and again, things do not \nseem quite right. At the end of the year, by national standards, they \nfind, once again, this school their daughter is attending has failed \nand has not improved. Again, they know their daughter's future depends \non the quality of the education she receives in reading, math, and \nscience. She goes on to the sixth grade.\n  At the end of the sixth grade, she is not progressing. In fact, she \nmay be one of the 30 or 40 percent of the students who are proficient \nat only a very basic educational level. These parents have sent their \ndaughter to a school which has failed to adequately education her for 3 \nyears. As things now stand, these parents have no choice to improve \ntheir daughter's education. She is trapped in a school that is failing.\n  They only make $30,000. They watch, as some of their neighbors who \nearn a middle class or higher income leave the school district. Their \nneighbors have a choice because of their personal income. By moving, \nthey say: we will not allow our children to continue in this failing \nschool year after year after year because it destroys the opportunity \nfor our children to experience the American dream we talked about this \nmorning. But the parents of this daughter don't have that option. They \ncan't afford to move. They only make $25,000 or $30,000. They have no \nchoice. They are trapped. They are trapped.\n\n  This is the focus of the amendment at hand. For the first time, low \nincome families--those who earn less than $32,000 a year--will have the \nopportunity to choose. They will be able to remove their children from \na school which has failed for one, two, three years and place them in \nanother educational facility so their children have the opportunity to \nrealize that American dream.\n  This is why I believe so strongly in this pilot program proposed in \nthe amendment put forth by the Senator from New Hampshire. This \namendment gives parents a right to do what is best for their child. We \nhave too many failing schools today. Nine thousand schools in our \ncountry have been identified as failing, and many of those schools have \nfailed for 4 years and 6 years and 8 years. These are the sorts of \nschool districts we hope to give this voluntary opportunity, this \nchoice, this option for parents to do what is best for their child.\n  There is broad support on this issue, as the Senator from Arkansas \nhas pointed out. Parents, especially low-income parents, broadly \nsupport school choice. The Children's Scholarship Fund is a nonprofit \nprivate foundation which provides K-12 scholarships for low-income \nfamilies. When they put out their call for applications, over 1.25 \nmillion applications from around the country came from poor families. \nRight here in the District of Columbia, 33 percent of the families \neligible for those scholarships applied.\n  A recent poll conducted for the National Education Association found \nthat 63 percent of Americans support choice for children who attend \nfailing schools. Support for choice is highest within the African-\nAmerican community.\n  This amendment is good for public schools. Again, as pointed out, \ncompetition is a factor that we know produces quality products and \nservices in America today. In order to improve our public schools, \ncompetition must enter the educational equation. This is one step in \nthe right direction.\n  Second, this amendment is locally initiated. The application must be \nmade at the local level. Washington must not force choice on a local \ncommunity. This amendment simply opens the door for those who wish to \nparticipate in this pilot project. It empowers State and local \neducation authorities to initiate this program.\n  Lastly, it is limited in scope. To qualify, families must meet two \ncriteria: Families must earn less than $32,000 a year and must attend a \nschool which has been failing for 3 years.\n  For these reasons, I urge support for and ultimately passage of this \nvery important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his leadership and dedication on this issue. He cares about \nchildren deeply. He cares about public education. He wants to see it \nmore successful. This is not some sort of plan to weaken public \neducation.\n  As I have listened to him discuss his vision for making sure children \nare not trapped in schools that are utterly failing and having their \nfutures damaged, I have become convinced, as much as I believe in \npublic education, that this is a project we ought to try. We ought to \nallow this opportunity for alternative ways, particularly in programs \nfor low-income children in failing schools, and let's see how it works.\n  I think it is appropriate for the Federal Government to utilize money \nunder these circumstances to help analyze, through very effective \nexamination of these programs, whether or not they are working. If it \nis clearly a benefit, maybe we ought to do more. If it is not a \nbenefit, maybe that will be the end of it.\n  I certainly think allowing 3 States that voluntarily choose to \nparticipate in this program, 10 cities that voluntarily choose to \nparticipate--not who are made to participate; it is their option if \nthey would like to participate in this program--let's try it, but let's \nmonitor it, let's watch it, let's see how it goes. I think we may find \nprogress will be made.\n  We do know one thing for sure. There are nearly 9,000 schools in \nAmerica that have been identified as failing, many of those for a \nnumber of years, some 4, 6, 8 years failing consistently. I think it is \ninconceivable--really immoral--not to take some steps to deal with that \ncircumstance.\n  These children are falling behind in those schools. Those children \nhave to be falling behind. They are not receiving the quality of \neducation other children are receiving in succeeding schools. It is \ndifficult for them. They come, many of them, from not an ideal home \nlife, and then they are sent to a school system that is failing. No \nwonder they tend to have great difficulty.\n  What can we do for them? I was a U.S. attorney for a long time. A lot \nof people haven't thought about this very clearly, but the law requires \nthem to go to that school. They do not have any choice whatsoever. If \nthey live a few blocks over this way, they may be in a school that is \nquite successful, but because they are in this school district, they \nmust, by law--all over America, that is the pattern--they must go to \nthat school. They are ordered to go to that school. Many times they are \nbeing ordered year after year, week after\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nweek, day after day, to go to a school that is not functioning and is \nnot succeeding.\n  There is something wrong about that. I know people, as the Senator \nfrom Arkansas said, who check out the school district, and they have \nthe money to decide where they want to live, and they move to a \ndistrict where they are comfortable. People know the schools that are \nworking and the ones that are not. I think we can do better.\n  This is a voluntary program for only 3 States if 3 States apply, 10 \ncities if 10 cities apply, to let them try these programs under a \nstrict evaluation process. I believe it can be helpful for America.\n  The moneys that will support this will not in any way come from \nexisting programs. It will provide new money but not a whole lot of \nmoney to make this occur. It requires families be poorer families, not \npeople who have the money themselves to perhaps take advantage of \nchoice. No title I money will be spent. Rather, an additional $50 \nmillion will be made available to the handful of cities and States that \nchoose to participate in this program. It provides additional resources \nto carry out this demonstration project that I believe will work.\n\n  The evaluation that will occur is going to be healthy. It is going to \nexamine and measure student achievement in the alternative situation. \nIt is going to measure parental involvement in education with parental \ninvolvement increased. It is going to evaluate the satisfaction of \nparents and all involved in the program. And it will evaluate the \noverall impact on the performance of the public school system. In other \nwords, if it is damaging the public school system, we will find that \nout.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will just wrap up and say the Secretary of Education, \nDr. Paige, tried it in Houston, a huge school system--I ask for 1 \nminute to wrap up--favors this idea.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have no objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. He said in Houston it made them better. In the first \nyear or two, they lost some students and people complained. He said: I \nsupported it. If people could get a better education somewhere else, it \nwas all right with me. I cared about those children. But--he said--do \nyou know what happened? We improved our school system so much in \nHouston that as years went by they were coming from private schools to \nthe public schools; the public schools grew at the expense of private \nschools because we got better. He said there is no way a private school \ncan succeed and beat a public school in the long term, if it is run \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield myself 30 minutes. I would \nlike to be reminded when I use 25.\n  H.L. Mencken said at one time that for every complex problem, there \nis a simple easy answer, and it is wrong. That is what we have here, a \nsimple, easy answer to all the problems we are facing in our troubled \nschools across this country, and it is basically and fundamentally \nwrong; it does not work.\n  I will take the time to illustrate the flawed nature of this \namendment, and those Members with further interest are welcome to \ncontact our office, and we will provide a more detailed account of the \nstate of education in each of the cities that host voucher programs. \nThese programs have not worked. Vouchers do not work. Furthermore, this \nis not really a debate about true ``choice'' because, under this \namendment, parents would not exercise a choice. Schools would exercise \na choice.\n  It is not a parent, it is not a 30-year-old mother with a single \nchild who makes a decision to go to a private school. That is malarkey. \nThat does not exist. Under this amendment, the decision is made by the \nschool.\n  I have listened to speeches time and time again state that \napproximately $130 billion has been expended on title I, but we haven't \nseen increased academic achievement among the nation's students in \nneed. Meanwhile, America spends nearly $400 billion annually on \nelementary and secondary education. Those skeptical of increasing \nfunding for education cite $130 billion over 20 years or 30 years. The \nreal reason we have poor schools and low student achievement is that we \nhave not yet stepped up to the plate. Federal dollars provide only 7 \ncents of every dollar spent on education in this country. The remainder \nof the responsibility rests with States and local communities. It is \nthe responsibility of States and local communities to provide local \nschools with the help that they need to succeed. We are trying to \naddress this issue at the federal level, but cannot do it alone. I \nthink we have a good bill that can make a difference if it is \nadequately funded.\n  With all respect to my colleagues, they have spoken about about \nleaving no children behind, yet they leave two-thirds of the children \nbehind with the funding currently provided for Title I. In the past, we \nhave shed crocodile tears all over the Senate floor about leaving \nchildren behind. They are already being left behind, and that is wrong. \nAs the allocations of current funds demonstrate, and under the current \nbudget proposed by the President, 3.7 million children will be provided \nfunding. Under the Dodd-Collins amendment, we have proposed funding for \n5.7 million children, building up to full funding. That amendment has \nnow been accepted to this bill.\n  Along with an oratory on leaving no child behind, let's also ensure \nthat we truly do not leave children behind. Let's commit to securing \nthe funds so that no children are left behind. And with that, we really \nneed to dismiss this voucher argument. If we really are interested in \nno child being left behind, then let's make sure that we aren't going \nto leave them behind.\n  My friends and colleagues again provide the same talking points on \nfailing schools. They are good talking points. But they are only good. \nThey are not terribly good. We currently have approximately 10,000 \nschools. It would cost $1.8 billion to turn these schools into high-\nperforming schools. But are those funds in the budget? Are those funds \nrequested by the President? No. If we are serious about turning those \nschools around, we know how to do it. It takes reforms and it takes \ninvestment. We are on the road to success with the reforms, but we have \nnot yet seen the investment.\n  Supporters of this amendment also claim that the $50 million to fund \nthis program will not come from Title I. If not from Title I, then from \nwhere? This investment in vouchers has been portrayed as an investment \nthat would not siphon funds in the federal budget away from education. \nWhere in the world is this magic $50 million coming from? I don't know \nwhere it is. It is out here. They keep referring to it. I think we \nought to take that magical pot with a never-ending fountain, invest it, \nand try to do something that is going to make a difference; that is, \naddress the problems of failing schools. That is what we ought to be \ndoing. But that is not the proposal here. This $50 million is, of \ncourse, money that could otherwise be spent in terms of helping and \nassisting schools. Under this amendment, schools in need of assistance \nwould lose.\n  First of all, all of us understand the importance of the public \nschool system and what a difference it has made in the hopes and dreams \nof families all over this country. I went to private school. I have a \ngrandchild going to a public school, and nieces and nephews who go to \npublic schools. Most of them are going to private schools. But I was \nable to go to a public school with good teachers. I was able to go to a \nschool that had a curriculum that was a good curriculum. I was able to \nbenefit from those.\n\n  We are trying to say let's try to do what we know works, and do that \nfor children all over this country. We know what works in education. \nBut vouchers don't. I will come to that. We know what works.\n  We have invested in what works--not completely the way I would like. \nBut it isn't completely the way that I know my friend, Senator Gregg, \nwould like, or that President Bush would like. It is a compromise. But \nit is one that we can defend, if it is funded and invested in, because \nwe are going to make sure that we are going to get better trained \nteachers and have opportunities to have smaller class sizes. And there \nare going to be evaluations on that.\n\n[[Page S6069]]\n\n  I don't know how many times I have listened to my friends and \ncolleagues over here talk about why this is different. You know why \nthis is different. It is because in the old days, we just provided the \nresources but we didn't have the accountability. In the old days, we \nprovided funds to States to use to build swimming pools and purchase \nfootball uniforms. States did not target funds to the neediest children \nwith block grants.\n  We will continue to provide funding for our neediest children, but we \nare going to have accountability. That is the President's proposal, and \nthat is our proposal. He wants annual assessments in the third grade \nand the eighth grade. Those assessments will help States measure \nprogress. If schools don't measure up with annual yearly progress, \nStates will take action. They will provide the resources to reform \nschools, and reconstitute them if necessary.\n  Hello. Not with the schools to which Mr. Gregg wants to permit these \nchildren to go. No, no. There is no guarantee in this amendment with \nthat plea about that matter. I want to talk to that matter. If that \nmatter happens to be limited English speaking, forget about going to \nthese schools. Do you understand that? Forget about it. They do not \nhave to take your child. And they don't, more often than not. If your \nchild has a disability, forget about going because they do not have to \ntake your child. IDEA doesn't apply to this. There is reference in here \nthat IDEA applies. But it doesn't apply to private schools. If they are \ndisabled, forget about going. If they have a disability, forget about \nbringing your child in. If you are a homeless or migrant student, you \nwill not be guaranteed services. You have no guarantee. Forget about \ngoing to that school.\n  Do you get the picture?\n  It is very interesting. According to a 1998 survey conducted in \nconjunction with a Department of Education study on public school \nstudents and private schools, private schools indicated that, if they \nwere required to accept public school students--look at this: Randomly \nassigned. What about saying there are a lot of children in that school, \nand all of them want to go to a particular school. Let's take randomly \nassigned students who go to a public school and later to a private \nschool. Entrants decline by one-half. And 68 percent of private schools \nindicated that they would be unwilling to accept students with learning \ndisabilities. 68 percent would be unwilling to accept students with \nlimited English proficiency.\n  Under this condition, the percentage of schools that would definitely \nbe willing to participate declines from 77 to 36 percent.\n\n  Hello. This great experiment in democracy of making sure that every \nchild is going to have this choice and not have the needy schools that \nare failing on that, basically it is going to be a decision for private \nschools to make a judgment with regard to who they want, and make a \nconscious selection.\n  The idea that this is going to open doors for parents whose children \nare in failing schools as a way out raises a false hope, and it is one \nthat should be rejected.\n  We are strongly committed to trying to do something about it. I know \nthe Senator from New Hampshire is strongly committed. We know what has \nto be done. We are going to ensure that, with real accountability, \nschools will take steps to make sure they make annual, yearly progress, \neven based upon the existing tests in the old 1994 act which States \nalready have in place. Schools will constantly have to make progress.\n  There is going to be a range of supplementary services available to \nchildren. They are going to have additional options to go to public \nschools if they need to. There will be afterschool programs available \nto them. There will be summer programs available to them.\n  As we accepted last night, there will be funding for creative summer \nprograms which we have seen work in Boston last year. In those \nprograms, they tied employment to reading. And children in that \nprogram, after 6 weeks of employment, increased their reading scores by \n1.7 years. That is real progress taking place. We are strongly \ncommitted to that. But we want to provide that for all the children.\n  That is our commitment--high achievement for all children. Of course \nall of these parents who are faced with the prospect that their \nchildren will not make progress in the schools, if someone offers them \na phony lifeline and says this is going to answer your problem, \neverybody is going to vote for that particular kind of opportunity. But \nthat isn't being true to the complete picture.\n  We are trying to say we know what works. We are going to invest in \nthese programs. We are going to move all of these children along \ntogether because we are one nation with one history and one destiny. We \nare all going to move along together.\n  That is what this commitment ought to be--not just to try to find \nsome way that perhaps that one child or two children can move on. Good \nfor them. But we want everyone to move along together. That is what our \ncommitment is.\n  Private schools are not required to have assessments in their \nprograms in the manner that the President has talked about. They are \nable to be selective about who will attend their schools. We are \nconsidering a proposal to divert scarce resources away from the \nnation's public school systems, where 90 percent of America's children \nreceive an education.\n  If we find that the children going to the private schools today would \nlike to go to the public schools, do you know what percent could \ngo? Four percent. Of all of them, 4 percent could go to private \nschools. So what are we saying out there? Are we going to have an \nexperiment that is going to be out there, and only 4 percent can go? \nThis makes no sense.\n\n  Now let's get back to the facts about whether there are any \nmeaningful, positive results from these experiments, in the first \nplace, where they have been tried.\n  The first 5 years of the Milwaukee voucher program showed no \nachievement differences between voucher students and comparable \nstudents. That is from the University of Wisconsin at Madison report, \ntheir 5-year report. It is the Witte study.\n  Followup studies found that voucher students made no gains in reading \nand only small gains in math. In fact, low-income students in Milwaukee \npublic schools that reduced class size outperformed voucher students in \nreading and did as well as voucher students in math. That is the \nPrinceton study.\n  Cecilia Rouse, 1998, a State-sponsored independent evaluation of the \nfirst year of Cleveland's voucher program, conducted by researchers in \nIndiana--not up at Harvard, not at Yale, not at Princeton; in Indiana--\nfound no significant achievement difference in all subjects between \nvoucher students and comparable public school students. In the second \nyear there were no achievement differences, except a slight advantage \nfor voucher students in languages.\n  The recent Jay Greene study on the effects of vouchers in Florida is \nalso in serious question. Many researchers found that the Florida \nvouchers did not enhance reform in public schools, other factors did. \nSome researchers did suggest that the threat of vouchers for students \nfailing public schools caused math and writing gains among Florida's \nlowest performing public schools to increase. But Greene's research \noverestimates the effect of being designated a failing school and \noffers no evidence that the higher estimate test score gains by failing \nschools should be attributed to the threat of vouchers.\n  What else? We could go down the list. I have the studies for \nvirtually all of the voucher programs here. We can take some time and \ngo through this. Later perhaps, in the afternoon, we will have an \nopportunity to go through them. I will include in the Record the \nanalysis of the cities that have been mentioned in this debate, and \nothers, in a very limited way, and ask they be printed in the Record so \nas to demonstrate that.\n  On the contrary, where have we seen the most progress made? Have we \nseen the most progress made in any State which has had vouchers? No. \nThe most progress that has been made is in the State of North Carolina. \nIn the State of North Carolina, public school reforms have been similar \nto those in Florida and have been initiated without vouchers, and \nstudent achievements have risen. The results are further reason to \ndoubt the effectiveness of vouchers in public school reform.\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\n  The achievements in North Carolina have been notable. Every review, \nevery evaluation, every examination, and every study finds \nunequivocally that North Carolina has made this significant and \ndramatic progress.\n  Here are the Rand studies. The Rand studies show that the gains in \nTexas and/or North Carolina, in both reading and math, were much higher \nthan the average State gains and close to that of the State with the \nhighest gains. If we were to average the gains across the States, North \nCarolina and Texas show the highest average gain among all the States. \nDo they have vouchers? No.\n  Here are the two States that are doing, what? In the bill we are \ninvesting in well-trained teachers, professional development, smaller \nclass sizes, safer schools, afterschool programs, working with schools \nthat are in trouble, as North Carolina does, in terms of closing down \neffectively the schools and putting them under new leadership, and \nbringing around new curriculum with new evaluations to benefit the \nchildren, having summer school programs--all of those that are out \nthere--and having early reading programs, which is one of the areas \nGovernor Hunt was so concerned with and is shown to be so important and \nsuccessful, and a program included in this legislation providing for \nearly reading programs.\n\n  I wish we could expand that. It is $75 million. That ought to be \nexpanded for a nation when we know what is happening. Why are we \ntalking, on the one hand, vouchers, for which there is virtually no \nevidence--we can stand around here all day and talk about the different \ntests, but the fact is, when you take the review of States that have \nmade meaningful progress in terms of advancing academic achievement, \nthey are not relying on vouchers, they are relying on the kinds of \nthings we have in this legislation.\n  I find this proposal enormously troublesome for other reasons as \nwell. If you look at the ``eligible entity'':\n\n       The term ``eligible entity'' means a public agency, \n     institution, or organization, such as a State--\n\n  This does not say it is going to go through the local superintendent \nof schools--\n\n     a State or local educational agency, a county or municipal \n     agency, a consortium of public agencies, or a consortium of \n     public agencies and private nonprofit organizations, that can \n     demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary. . . .\n\n  I do not quite understand this, in any event, because I wonder if in \nBoston the superintendent and the mayor say, ``We don't want it,'' and \nthen they are able to go out and the Secretary gets some other public \nagency. It appears to me they would be eligible to develop a voucher \nsystem in a community. I would have thought at least they would want \nthe superintendent of schools to say that, to give them the authority \nand the responsibility.\n  I think we ought to get back to the fundamentals. We know what works. \nAnd we know what works is investing and taking advantage of the kinds \nof things that have happened in this country over the period of these \nrecent years, and building on those. We know what a difference that can \nmake in terms of the children of this country and having well-trained \nteachers in the classroom, having the smaller class sizes, having a \nwell-thought-out curriculum, having evaluations of the progress \nchildren are making with well-thought-out examinations and tests--not \ntests that are just a mechanical rote of knowledge, but also a thinking \nprocess for these children--helping and assisting with supplementary \nservices, summer programs, afterschool programs, doing all of that.\n  There are schools that are not going to measure up. We are taking the \nkinds of items that are included in this bill, in terms of over a \nperiod of years, and putting the emphasis and stress on math and \nreading. They have the high priorities in the bill. This is what works. \nIf we adopted this amendment, we would be drawing down scarce resources \nthat would otherwise be used--make no mistake about it--to benefit all \nof the children. If we took those resources out and used them on a \nprogram that is largely discriminatory--because it does not give the \nguarantee of choice to the child or to the parent. It still makes the \nchoice in the school's interest, not the child's interest. It does not \nprovide for how that child is going to be evaluated. It completely is \nexempt from all the kinds of evaluation this President has talked \nabout. How can you have that?\n\n  He talks about having evaluations and making sure children are going \nto learn and insists they have the annual test. And on the other hand \nhe says, if you go to a private school, you don't have to do any of \nthat.\n  What is happening here? What possible sense does that make? And he \nleaves it up to the school to make the judgment and decision, and \nwithout giving the protection to many of the children whether they are \ndisabled children, limited-English children, other children with any \nkind of special needs. I think that is a failure.\n  Let us take the resources we have available and invest them in our \nchildren, invest in their future, invest in what we know can work, \ninvest in this new partnership we will have with the Federal \nGovernment, the States, and local communities; the new partnership we \nare going to have involving parents, teachers, and the local \ncommunities. I think that is what we ought to be about.\n  Finally, I think on the whole issue on the vouchers, obviously, there \nare constitutional issues. I know in the remaining time that I have--I \nwill not take the time to go through it, but there are serious \nconstitutional issues as well.\n  But I strongly oppose this amendment just on the basis of the policy \nquestions. These programs have not demonstrated effectiveness. The \npublic, by and large, has rejected these issues time and again, across \nthis country, and more than 80 percent in the District of Columbia. I \nknow there is a potential voucher amendment for the District of \nColumbia.\n  This has been rejected across the country. When people know we are \ngoing to be serious about making a difference in investing in children \nand in the kinds of educational programs that are positive and will \nresult in academic achievement and accomplishment, when we do that, the \nAmerican people understand the importance of that type of investment. \nThat is what this bill is about to do.\n  Its great failure to date is the fact that we have not received the \nkinds of assurances from the administration that they are going to make \nsure the benefits of this legislation are going to reach all of the \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague and friend from Michigan is here. I \nyield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts who has been such a stalwart in advocating for our \nchildren throughout the process as it relates to this education bill. \nThere has been give and take and working together in a bipartisan basis \nto formulate a bill that will focus on increasing accountability, goals \nfor our children, but also resources. Many of us have been saying over \nand over again how the resources have to be coupled with the \naccountability so that every child has the opportunity to learn and we \ntruly leave no child behind.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment related to private school \nvouchers and speak on behalf of the people of Michigan who voted in the \nelection last November resoundingly against a similar proposal that was \non the ballot in Michigan. There was a lot of thoughtful discussion on \nboth sides. The public resoundingly said no and focused on what I \nbelieve to be a very wise course, which is to focus on making sure that \nevery child in every school has the opportunity to learn and that we \nstrengthen our public schools.\n  I have great respect for friends and colleagues who choose to send \ntheir children to private schools. We also know that even if 10 percent \nof the children in our public schools went to private schools through \nvouchers, we would still be faced with needing 5,000 new schools in the \nnext number of years and doubling the number of schools in the 10 \nlargest school systems in America, at a cost of $40 billion. Those \ncosts don't go away. The needs don't go away. If a few children leave, \nyou still have the majority there who need to have technology in the \nclassroom, who need to have smaller class sizes so they can learn.\n  What we have found is that the voucher system pulls resources away\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\nbut, in fact, does not improve education for all children.\n\n  I remember when we were debating a few years ago--maybe 3 years ago--\nthe D.C. schools. We had, literally, roofs falling in. One fall, as \nschool was getting ready to start, there was a proposal that, as the \nroof was falling in, we ought to have vouchers for 2,000 children out \nof 78,000 children in the Washington, DC, schools--that 2,000 ought to \nbe able to have vouchers. There was a big debate about the 2,000 \nchildren and not a debate about the 78,000 children who still would be \nin schools that had broken roofs, schools that would have wastepaper \nbaskets in the corner catching the water. The resources that were being \ndebated to be pulled out for vouchers would not allow fixing of the \nroofs. It didn't make any sense.\n  In the end, we were fortunate that proposal did not pass at that \ntime.\n  What we know is that over 90 percent of our children attend schools \npotentially facing budget cuts, potentially facing challenges relating \nto resources. We also know that we want every school to increase \naccountability. We want to make sure that if a public school is not \nworking, the school system has the capacity to shut it down, to change \npersonnel, to do the things necessary to increase accountability.\n  I believe strongly that needs to be done within the context of our \npublic schools so that every child has the opportunity for people to be \nfighting for the best quality possible for them and not just diverting \na few children away from that system while the rest are in schools that \nare not up to standards.\n  This is an incredibly important issue that we need to send a strong \nmessage, through a ``no'' vote on the amendment, that we support \nstrengthening our public school system for every child. We have schools \nnow doing wonderful work. We have schools now that are in trouble. We \nneed to make sure that through what we are doing federally, we are \nrecognizing and applauding and saluting our quality public schools and \nthat we are providing the resources and the accountability which our \nchildren deserve and our families deserve, to make sure that no matter \nwhat door you walk through in what public school, in which neighborhood \nin the United States of America, you know that your child is going to \nreceive the very best quality education.\n  That is what this fight is all about. I believe this amendment takes \nus in the wrong direction. I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill vote no and we will get back to the business of strengthening our \npublic schools through this important legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for 1 minute, on North Carolina, a recent \nRand Corporation report found that between 1990 and 1996, students \nshowed the highest average annual gain in the National Assessment of \nEducation Progress, the NAEP, reading and math tests. Those are \nnational tests. SAT scores have risen 10 years in a row. The scores \nhave improved more than any other State--a 40-point gain between 1990 \nand 2000, 10 points higher than the three other States with big gains.\n  Most recently, the States average SAT moved up as well between 1999 \nand the year 2000. This is a State that is doing it right. We tried to \nbenefit from their experience.\n  The Senator from North Carolina, who is now presiding, was a \nparticular help to our committee in sharing the experiences of North \nCarolina and ensuring that many of those very important aspects that \nhave been successful in North Carolina would be available to benefit \nlocal communities in this legislation. That is the kind of thing we \nought to be investing in so that all children will benefit.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here today because I strongly \nbelieve that Senator Gregg's voucher amendment moves this country and \nour public schools in the wrong direction.\n  All of us stand for equal opportunity for all children. This \namendment might open doors to a few children, but it would shut them \nfor many others. In the Senate, we are fighting to improve our public \nschools with resources. This amendment uses public funds to send a few \nstudents to private schools rather than investing in schools that serve \nall of our children.\n  We need to think about the consequences of this voucher amendment. In \nthe bill before us, we are insisting on accountability for the use of \nFederal funds. This voucher program would funnel taxpayer dollars into \nschools that are not accountable to the public at all.\n  Beyond lack of accountability, let's remember that private schools \ndon't even have to meet the same academic standards required for all \npublic schools. Not all private schools are created equal. There are a \nlot of good ones, but there are some with lower quality and lower \nstandards, and our tax dollars would go to them as well with no \naccountability.\n  Private schools are important. I am not here to speak against private \nschools. I am here to speak against an amendment that would damage \npublic schools.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about the four simple reasons I oppose \nthis amendment. Vouchers undermine our public schools; vouchers leave \nchildren behind; vouchers mean less accountability; and vouchers are a \ndistraction from the hard but essential work of ensuring that all \npublic schools are good schools.\n  Our public schools are the cornerstone of our democracy, our \ncommunities, and our economy. They are entrusted with giving more than \n90 percent of our children the education they need to be productive \ncitizens. Vouchers would weaken public schools by diverting already \nscarce funds needed for smaller classes, afterschool programs, better \nfacilities, and teacher training, to pay for private school tuition for \na few select children--which really leads to the second reason I cannot \nsupport any voucher scheme.\n  Private schools may reject students for almost any reason, including \ndisability, limited English proficiency, behavioral challenges, or \nacademic deficiencies. Despite the rhetoric of this amendment, vouchers \ndo not offer true choice for students. While parents may remove \nchildren from public schools, no voucher system guarantees admission to \nthe school of their choice. Private schools will still choose which \nstudents they will admit.\n  While vouchers drain money from public schools to help a few \nstudents, other students are left at a public school with fewer \nresources. That will not help our kids succeed. In fact, it will \nprobably lower the quality of education for the most challenged \nstudents, effectively leaving them behind.\n  Proponents of the underlying bill, including the author of this \namendment, have said that accountability provisions are the key to not \nleaving students behind.\n  Well, Mr. President, my third objection is that this amendment would \nmake these accountability provisions meaningless for thousands of \nstudents. This bill requires that the results of new reading and math \ntesting in grades 3-8 be used to judge the quality of all public \nschools, and it sanctions schools that fail to make adequate yearly \nprogress. But those accountability provisions and testing do not apply \nto private schools that benefit from vouchers.\n  If this accountability is truly essential to ensuring a good \neducation, should it not apply to all schools that receive Federal \nfunds?\n  Under this voucher plan, participating private schools do not have to \ngive the same tests. They do not have to make adequate yearly progress. \nAnd they cannot be sanctioned. Public schools must comply with all \nFederal, State, and local civil rights, and health and safety \nrequirements.\n  This voucher proposal doesn't even require participating private \nschools to protect the civil rights of school employees, or to maintain \nthe separation of church and state.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support spending taxpayer dollars on schools \nwith no public accountability.\n  Finally, vouchers drain away the resources and attention that should \nbe focused on turning around low-performing schools. Vouchers offer an \nexcuse to those who are unwilling to make the necessary investment or \nto roll up their sleeves and get involved in the hard work of leading a \nstruggling public school into success.\n  Turning around low-performing schools is not magic. Hard-working \npeople all across the country are doing it every single day.\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator just made a comment that I think is \nparticularly pertinent to this discussion on the question of \naccountability. Here in the legislation that we have before us--as we \nhave debated over the past 7 or 8 weeks, much of that debate has been \non accountability. But could the Senator indicate what her position is \nwith regard to accountability for the schools where the children might \nbe able to gain entry if they take these vouchers--what kind of \naccountability will be in place there? Are those schools included in \nthis same kind of rigorous accountability, or will we be investing \nmoney in schools and not really know their impact on our children's \nfuture?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is very clear that as we have listened \nto this debate in the Senate, Senators on both sides of the aisle \nbelieve that the key to the success of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act is accountability, and a part of that is testing. The \nvoucher system would mean that students could take public taxpayer \ndollars to a private school that has no testing requirements similar to \nthe public schools, has no accountability, requires no accountability, \nand thus we are just sending taxpayer dollars to private schools that \ndon't live by the same rules.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, part of the very, I \nthink, strong presentation that the President has made is that he wants \nto ensure that tests are not used in a punitive way, but as instruments \nto gauge student progress and inform instruction. I think the Senator \nwas there when we listened to Secretary Paige--he emphasized the \nimportance of finding out what children don't know so there can be \nassistance provided to children to help them succeed. I have some \nenormously interesting examples. In our own State, where the teachers \nfind out the class doesn't know much about fractions, they deal with \nthat by teaching other aspects of mathematics over the course of the \nyear. They are making up for lost progress in the past, and ensuring \nthat children move along and keep up with the current material. There \nis a reason for accountability. If students are not able to make \nprogress, they receive supplementary services--the afterschool \nprograms, the summer programs, or the tutorials--to provide them with \nthe extra help they need.\n  Now what is going to happen in voucher schools? Will those programs \nbe available? How are we going to know whether these children are \nmaking progress?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator raises a key point. We won't know how they \nare progressing. As the Senator from Massachusetts knows, I was a \nschool board member before I was a Senator. I can tell you of numerous \nschool board meetings where we had citizens from our community sitting \nin big audiences before us saying: You are spending my taxpayer dollars \nand I want you to--fill in the blank. If we send our Federal taxpayer \ndollars to private schools, our citizens in our communities will not \nhave the opportunity to go before a board that governs a private school \nto demand that their taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One of the most important aspects of accountability \nprovided for in this bill is giving information to parents so that they \nwill be able to follow the development of their children. We have a \nschool in Massachusetts where part of the portfolio for school success \nis a measure of parental involvement. Very interesting. That sounds \nlike something that is way out, but, by George, that school was able to \nget their parents involved.\n\n  An essential element in this bill is the proposal to make sure that \nparents understand what is happening in their schools, and to be able \nto provide a comparison of their schools performance to other schools \nin the neighborhood. In this respect, and with school report cards, \nparents will be able to be effective, articulate spokespersons for \ntheir children's education. Will that be available under a voucher \nprogram?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts knows that it would not. \nIf our taxpayer dollars went to a private school in the form of a \nvoucher, there would be no parental involvement, no community \ninvolvement, no taxpayer involvement on how their dollars were being \nspent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for that. Is the Senator also aware \nthat opportunities for children who are limited English proficient, or \nfor children who may have a learning disability, or for migrant \nchildren or homeless children--those opportunities will not be driven \nby parents. The choice of how to serve those children, if they are \nserved, will be made by the school under a voucher program. So does the \nSenator agree with me that the idea of somehow providing millions of \nAmerican parents the opportunity for their children to be moved into a \ndifferent situation with this proposal is really a distortion? Critical \ndecisions will be made by schools that may not be inclined to reach out \nto children who have some special situation, special needs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts raises a very good point. \nI know many parents today with young children who are 2 and 3 years old \nare now trying to get their kids into private school. They are starting \nthe application process already. It is very difficult to get into some \nof our best private schools. Imagine parents out there who are \nlistening to rhetoric about a voucher program as some kind of magic \nbullet that their child will use to get into a private school, and that \nis not correct. In fact, private schools can say they will not take \nchildren with disabilities or with limited English proficiency or with \nthe difficulties that they have experienced in the past.\n  So it is an empty promise to many parents who are thinking it is some \nkind of panacea--a voucher system that all of a sudden they will \nreceive as taxpayers. The good private schools are hard to get into. We \nall know not all private schools are created equal. There are good ones \nand there are some not so good. This money would apply to all of them. \nI think we would lose for a lot of taxpayers in this country and our \npublic school systems will lose even more.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, we have listened during the presentation of \nthose who supported this amendment, that this was not really going to \ntake money away from public school children.\n\n  We would like to find out where this magical pot of money is. They \nare saying we want to give assurance to all those who are voting with \nus and against us that this money will not be taken away. If we don't \nuse this money, it still won't be available to children. I am somewhat \nmystified--I don't believe it. I don't think anybody in this body \nbelieves it.\n  Does the Senator agree these are scarce resources? We have reviewed \nthe fact we are still only reaching a third of the children under the \nPresident's program. Under the President's program, there is no \nincrease other than the cost-of-living increase for children over the \nperiod of the next 8 years.\n  Resources are scarce. I wonder if the Senator from Washington buys \nthe argument that this is not going to be money that would otherwise be \nused for professional development, or training teachers, or mentoring \nprograms, or afterschool programs, or moving teachers into smaller \nclass sizes. The Senator has been our national leader on that issue. \nDoesn't the Senator agree we could use that $50 million more \neffectively in terms of benefitting children rather than for a voucher \nprogram?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows \nwell, we only fund one-third of the students who are eligible for title \nI today. It seems to me we should be investing the money in making sure \ntitle I students have access to additional help. If we reduce class \nsize, if we provide teacher training, if we invest in public schools in \na way we have promised for many years to do, vouchers would not be an \nargument on the floor. Our children everywhere would be getting the \ngood education they should and we would not select just a few kids to \ngo on to a few schools to succeed. We would go back to the principle we \nall espouse in the Senate, to leave no child behind.\n  As a country that cares about all of our children, we are making sure \nwe invest in all of our children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  As a school board member and a teacher of elementary school, Senator \nMurray brings a special insight into\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\nthe education policy issues. I think we do well to heed her warnings \nand concerns.\n  Whatever time the Senator needs to conclude her remarks, I yield.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I urge all \ncolleagues to think about the principles of this bill and the \nunderlying concept: We want to make sure every child in this country \nsucceeds. That is not what this amendment will do. It is what we need \nto do in terms of investing in our communities, our schools, in the \nright way, so all children can succeed.\n  There is no magic bullet. The vouchers amendment is certainly not \none. I hope we are not tempted by the false promise of vouchers as that \nmagic bullet.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I take a moment or two to refer those \ninterested in this debate to this report called ``Uncommon Wisdom, \nEffective Reform Strategies,'' from Mass Insight Education, an \neducation-reform organization based in Boston, Massachusetts. \nMassachusetts is well on its way in terms of educational reform. We \nhave been making progress in recent years.\n  This report illustrates a number of schools making very important and \nsignificant progress academically with their students. They include \nelementary, middle, and high schools. They illustrate the different \ntechniques used in each of the schools. All the reforms vary somewhat, \nbut all have been implemented within the framework that this bill \nsupports: high standards; good professional development; data generated \nby meaningful, high-quality assessments; and extra support for the \nstudents in need of academic assistance.\n  This independent organization is highly regarded. They have reviewed \nvarious schools in our State, and have shared their findings so that \nother schools can make progress. Again, they identify four critical \npriorities: the development of the curriculum, the teaching, the \nassessment, and the intervention. Together, these reforms directly \nshape every student's educational experience in school. These four \ncommon elements have produced important and significant progress in \neach of the 22 Massachusetts schools included in this report.\n  In the Thompson School in Arlington, 30 percent of students receive \nfree or reduced lunches, 15 percent have special needs, and 25 percent \nare students of color. It is a mixed blue-collar, working-class, \nmiddle/low-income high school that has been able to make extraordinary \nprogress with their programs. There are countless other examples of \nschools, such as the Thompson school, that have reformed to produce \nresults.\n\n  The bottom line is that the elements included in this report are \nelements we have included in this legislation. If we provide funding \nfor these reforms, we will see these results in not only every school \nin Massachusetts but every school in the country. That is what we want \nto do.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is here and I yield 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Gregg-Hutchinson \namendment which authorizes a voucher program for private schools for 7 \nyears, encompassing 10 cities and 3 States. I don't believe this is an \nappropriate educational policy we should be pursuing. Our first and \nforemost commitment should be to strengthen and improve reform of \npublic education.\n  Frankly, as we go forward with the constrained resources, that \nprimary challenge will be difficult to achieve. Dissipating funds for \nvouchers for private schools to me is not the appropriate response to a \ncrisis in public education in the United States. For over 30 years, the \nFederal Government has made a commitment to help the students of \nAmerica throughout the public education system. Particularly, we have \ncommitted to ensuring that low-income students are given a chance to \nsucceed. We have created reforms over the last several years to help \nimprove the learning environment and ensure a vigorous public \neducation. Back in 1994 we streamlined reform of the title I program \nand other Federal programs. The thrust, the purpose, the constant theme \nis how we can help, working with the States and localities, to improve \npublic education to ensure that every family in America has an \nopportunity to send their children to excellent, free, public schools.\n\n  This amendment takes us off that track, off that purpose. It would \nnot improve public education in the United States. It would not respond \nto the need for safe schools, quality teachers, smaller classes, \nbuildings that are well repaired and well maintained, or greater \nparental involvement. It would not ensure that all students reach high \nacademic standards. It diverts scarce Federal resources from the public \nschools, our first and foremost priority. And it does so at a time when \nthe massive tax cut that has just been passed weakens our ability to \nrespond to the overwhelming needs of public education throughout this \ncountry.\n  As a result, I do not believe we should engage in this policy \nendeavor. In a world of finite resources, we have to be careful and \nconscious of our obligations to public education and our foremost \nresponsibility, to ensure that public education is well served.\n  There are proponents of this legislation who say this amendment is \nreally about giving families a choice. I do not believe this really is \nan issue of choice. Realistically, this amendment will never reach all \nthe children in all the failing schools. So we know, even if this \namendment is adopted and accepted, there will be children left behind \nin failing schools. That is not a choice for parents.\n  It seems to me, then, that we have to go back to our initial purpose, \nwhich is to try to improve every school in this country so no parent \nhas to keep their children in a public school that is not performing. \nWe need to give parents real choice, and we do not deal with the issue \nof choice by dissipating resources, by inviting some children to go to \nprivate schools and leaving others behind. We do it by confronting our \nresponsibilities to reform each and every public school in this \ncountry.\n  There are other issues that complicate this approach to choice. \nFirst, giving a voucher to a family for their child does not ensure \nthat child can go to the school the family chooses. Frankly, the nature \nof private education is they exclude students. They exclude students \nbecause they are not smart enough. They exclude students because they \njust do not fit in with their approach to education. They exclude \nstudents because, frankly, they are difficult or have discipline \nproblems. Public education cannot do that. Public education has to be \ninclusive. Public education has to reach out and embrace every child--\nthose who are difficult and those who are honor students.\n  So this approach to reform fails on one other principal ground. We \nare not giving every family the full range of choice because private \nschools will exclude again and again and again. That is the nature of \nbeing a private enterprise. That, in some respects, some might argue, \nis one of their strengths. They can ensure all the children are part of \ntheir patent, that they fit in. That is not a luxury, frankly, that \npublic education has. We have to recognize that. So this argument of \nchoice is not something I think really carries the day.\n\n  Also, there are other issues. If we do embark on a voucher program \nsuch as this, it will invariably raise issues of the rights of parents \nto demand entry to these private schools. It will raise issues of \nwhether or not it is conscionable to exclude these children, who now \nhave public funds, from these schools. So there may be many in the \nprivate education community who would like to see this development, but \nthey might, when it becomes, or if it becomes, a reality, think \notherwise.\n  There are many things we have to do to ensure the education of the \nyoung people in America is excellent. We have to raise standards. We \nhave to improve the professional development of teachers in public \neducation. We have to enhance the ability of our schools to embrace and \nbring parents into the school system. We have to ensure that the \nbuildings, the very buildings that children occupy, are places where \nthey feel comfortable in terms of security and safety, in terms of just \nthe feeling of being in a place that is esteemed enough to have the \nfloors clean, the ceilings fixed, all the facilities working. There are \ntoo many schools in America that fail that test.\n  There are too many schools that do not have the appropriate programs \nto\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\ninvolve parents. There are too many schools that are not conscious of \ndoing their best--too many public schools in this country. That is \nwhere our attention must lie. That is where our focus must lie. That is \nthe purpose for which we come here--to ensure every public school in \nthis country offers the families of America excellent, free, public \neducation.\n  To embark on this approach of vouchers for private education is a \nmistake. It dissipates our resources. It also does not truly give the \nfamilies of America choice.\n  There are today, within the public system, more and more \nopportunities for parents to choose among different schools within that \npublic school system. There is the recognition that public systems \nsimply cannot stand pat any longer, they have to improve the quality of \neducation, they have to reach out to teachers and parents and the \ncommunity at large to restore trust, to rebuild not just the physical \nstructure of the school, but also the educational scope and commitment \nto excellence of all schools. That is their job.\n  We can help, not by providing vouchers for private education, but by \nfunding and authorizing programs that will require, and insist, that \nevery public school in this country meets the standards of excellence. \nI hope we will do this.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment and get on with the business of \nthe education bill before us and make a real commitment to public \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor, but on behalf of Senator \nKennedy, at this time I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Rhode Island \nand Senator Kennedy, thank you for your magnificent leadership on this \nissue of education.\n  We all know life is complex and we all face problems every day in our \nlives. Our society has problems, not the least of which is that \nsometimes our kids go astray; they make the wrong turn and struggle and \nsometimes wind up in difficult situations. Whether it is turning to \njuvenile delinquency--and we all know that happens to some of our \nkids--whether it is not being able to handle the stresses of broken \nfamilies, we know we have problems in our society.\n  We also certainly know that there is no silver bullet. We wish there \nwere one thing we could do that would be kind of a magic wand to fix \nall the problems we face, the problems our families face, the problems \nwe face as individuals.\n  Let's say someone came up to me and said: You only have one answer. \nWhat would be the most important thing we could do to stop problems in \nour society, be it crime, be it drugs, be it alcohol use, be it sexual \nabuse? Talk about the issues; we all know they are here. What would be \nthe one thing, if you had to choose only one and that was it--you \ncouldn't pick five, or four, or three, or two--I would say it would be \na quality education for every single child starting from the earliest \ntimes.\n  Why do I say that? It is because we know now that 90 percent of our \nbrain capacity is set by age 3. So we know if we think all this starts \nlater in life, we are wrong. If we can reach those children, \nparticularly those children who may not have the support of a family \nstructure, we can make a difference.\n  Will it solve the problem? No. But I can say to you that it will \nsolve most of the problems.\n  I speak as someone who is an expert on public schools. Why? Because \nthat is where I went. From kindergarten through college, I went to \npublic schools. I am a first-generation American on my mother's side. \nMy mother never graduated from high school. Here I am in the Senate.\n  For those people who may not like my politics, they say: God, look at \nwhat the public schools did to us. But for the people who think I fight \nhard and do things, that I can go toe to toe with most people in this \ninstitution who went to the fanciest schools, they say: Hey, look. Look \nat what our public schools can do.\n  That is why I strongly oppose the Gregg amendment. I think any effort \nin this Chamber to pull money away from our public schools before we \nknow whether they are qualified, before we know that we are giving \nevery child what he or she deserves to have, anything that pulls that \nmoney away from the public school system is absolutely wrong on its \nface. Well intentioned and the rest, it doesn't work.\n  We know we can provide what our kids need if we put the resources \nbehind the rhetoric. Senator Schumer and I will have an amendment later \ntoday which will say to our colleagues, if you believe in this, vote \nfor the Schumer-Boxer amendment, which is going to say let's make sure \nthere are appropriations to fund education to match the authorization \nin this bill. We are going to have a chance to vote on that. But I have \nto say this. The amendment of Senator Gregg provides for voucher \ndemonstration programs in 10 cities and 3 States. Our teachers are \ntelling us not to pull resources out. Our voters have told us in \nCalifornia: Don't pull resources out of the public schools and put them \nin the private schools. In California, people have voted. They had a \ncouple of voucher initiatives. The last one, Proposition 38, they \ndefeated by 70.7 percent of the vote. Let me repeat that. Californians \nvoted 70 percent against a voucher experiment. I have to tell you that \nwe don't vote 70 percent for anything.\n  People always ask: How do you manage to represent a State such as \nCalifornia with 34 million people? I basically am honest in my answer. \nI say: I do my best. But on any given day, 30 percent of the people \nlove me and 30 percent of the people hate me, and a third of the people \nhave no idea who I am because there are 34 million people in that \nState. But 70 percent of them voted against vouchers.\n  It pulled everyone together--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--because it is a very simple point. If you believe in the \nrhetoric of ``leave no child behind''--and our President uses it; I \nbelieve it--and, if it is real, then you don't leave them behind by \npulling money out of the public schools and putting in these voucher \ninitiatives which have a lot of problems.\n  We have a lot of laws on the books that I think are important. We \nknow in the public schools you can't discriminate against any child for \nany reason. Every child who walks through that door is precious and \nimportant and equal to every other child, regardless if they have a \ndisability, regardless of their gender, and regardless of their \nnational origin.\n  The fact is, in this amendment we are going to have exceptions. \nPrivate schools can say they don't want any more girls; they just want \nto have boys; they can just say no, or vice versa. They can say they \ndon't want any more boys and just take girls. There can be \ndiscrimination because that is the essence, frankly, of a private \nschool. If they want to do that, fine. But just do not take the money. \nYou do what you want but don't take taxpayer money. Don't pull it away \nfrom the public schools.\n\n  I admire a lot of private schools. I have a lot of them in my State. \nThey give scholarships to needy children. They get a tax break, if they \nare a profit-making school, for doing that. I support that tax break. \nScholarships for needy kids are the way to go, if private schools want \nto make sure their student body is diverse and interesting and helps \nkids. But to pull hard-earned taxpayer dollars away and put them into \nthe private schools isn't the way to go. We know that just a few kids \nwill benefit. Even the question of how much they will benefit has been \nlooked at.\n  Let's say you are lucky enough to have enough money so a $2,000 \nvoucher can help you pay for the rest of the tuition. Sometimes the \ntuition is $8,000, $10,000, or $12,000. There is no reliable research \nthat shows voucher programs actually improve the education of our \nchildren or that voucher students outperform their public school peers. \nIn fact, the policy analysis of a California education group reported \nthat Proposition 38, the voucher initiative in our State, would cost \nmore and affect fewer students in proven education reform.\n  What do I mean by that? It has been proven that smaller class size \nreally helps student performance. Again, it is kind of a no-brainer \nthing. If a teacher can pay attention to fewer kids, she or he is going \nto do a better job. It costs much less to put that reform in place\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nthan to have a voucher initiative in our State.\n  Now we are reducing class size. We are seeing results. We are seeing \ngreat results. That is the track on which we should stay. Someday when \nwe have quality education for every public school child--where 95 \npercent of our kids go, by the way--I am willing to look at other ways \nto help other kids in private schools. I may always be biased against \nit because I believe in public schools. I think it makes our country \ndifferent from every other country. It gives every kid a chance at the \nAmerican dream. But I will look at it once I know every child has a \nquality education. We know they don't have quality education in every \nschool district in this country. The purpose of this underlying bill is \nto make sure we give every child a quality education.\n  Let's talk about Michigan. Michigan had a vote on vouchers. They \nvoted it down 68-31. What are we doing here? We are reinventing a \nvoucher plan that has already been voted down in California by more \nthan 70 percent of the vote and by 69 percent of the vote in Michigan. \nOnce again, voters are expressing their concern that we are pulling \nmoney away from public schools.\n  Let me say that one independent Princeton researcher found that when \nstudents in Milwaukee's public schools program were given extra \nresources to reduce class size, they actually outperformed those kids \nwho were on the voucher.\n  Let me reiterate. There is an independent study that showed that kids \nin Wisconsin, who had the advantage of smaller class size, outperformed \nother students who had vouchers in reading, and they did as well as \nthose students in math.\n  The drain on the public school system in Milwaukee is evident. \nAccording to the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the voucher \ninitiative took $22 million away from the public schools.\n  Why would we do that? We know vouchers don't guarantee equal access. \nIn Milwaukee, 40 percent of the kids who sought to participate in the \nvoucher program could not find schools that would take them. They could \nbe particularly harmful to a student who is not the ``cream of the \ncrop.'' Suppose the student is disabled, has limited English, or \nsuppose they are homeless. A private school is going to look twice, \nscratch its head, and say: Maybe not.\n  That goes against the American dream, which is, again, an equal \nchance for every child, regardless of their circumstance.\n  I think this amendment is an important amendment. I hope it will be \ndefeated because the underlying bill is really about reform--reform of \nour public schools. By pulling funds away, we hurt that reform effort.\n\n  I had a successful amendment that I offered to this bill, cosponsored \nby my Republican colleague, John Ensign. It was about after school. We \nwant to make sure kids after school do not get into trouble. We know, \nif we look at the charts, what happens. The FBI charts show, for sure, \nthat is when kids get in trouble.\n  This was a bipartisan amendment. It passed with a very healthy \nmajority. But I do not want to see us now turn around and take money \naway from that effort for after school and away from the effort of \nsmaller class size and all the other things we are trying to do in this \nbill. I do not want to see that happen.\n  I see my colleague from New York is in the Chamber. She has worked so \nhard on this bill and has dedicated her life to kids. I am very excited \nshe is going to be partaking of this debate this morning.\n  To sum up my argument, it is this: Our public schools are what make \nour country different from most other countries because they give us \nall a shot at the American dream. Are the public schools perfect? No, \nthey are not. Do we have to hold them accountable? Yes, we do. Do we \nneed to make improvements? Yes, we do. Do we need to invest in the \nchildren in those schools? Yes, we do. Do we need to demand results? \nYes, we do.\n  But if we pull those dollars away from the public schools and we put \nthem into the private schools, where 5 percent of the children go, we \nare making a huge mistake. My voters in California have shown that on \nseveral occasions. Voters in Michigan have shown that. They want to see \nus fix up our public schools first, make them work first. Then maybe we \nwill have the luxury to look outside the system.\n  We should demand the most from our kids, the most from our teachers, \nthe most from our principals, the most from our school districts, the \nmost from our Governors. But when we expect that, we should provide the \nresources, we should not pull them away from the public schools.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I commend and thank my good friend, \nthe Senator from California, for her usual eloquence and energy in \nputting forth a very commonsense proposal, which is that we ought to do \neverything in our power to make sure our public schools work before \nturning our backs on them. I especially note her telling all of us that \nvoters in California and Michigan, who have been given the chance to \nvote on vouchers in their own States, have not only rejected that \nproposal but have done so overwhelmingly.\n  I join my friend from California, and so many others, in opposing the \nGregg amendment which would provide $50 million for a voucher \ndemonstration program. I think it is fair to ask: Why would I and \nothers oppose a mere experiment?\n  What I would like to do is just reflect back for a minute on an \nexperience I had which really crystallized my opposition for me.\n  A few years ago I was in Northern Ireland, in Belfast, where I was \nprivileged to meet with a number of people who were crossing sectarian \nlines to try to come together to find a way to peacefully coexist after \ndecades and decades of troubles between Protestant and Catholic \ncitizens. I was so struck, after a daylong conference--where we spoke \nabout how to set up a governing assembly, how to provide economic \nopportunity, how we could get more people involved in the participation \nrequired for a democracy to work--when several people said: But the \nreal problem we face is in our schools.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  A number of them went on to tell me that from the very earliest of \nages children from the two religious traditions grew up in very \nseparate environments. There are literally barriers between Catholic \nand Protestant neighborhoods, and then they go to schools that are run \nby the respective churches into which they are born.\n  Person after person said to me: We will never live and work in peace \nif we don't go to school together. We won't have a chance to get to \nknow one another. Can't you help us have a public school system like \nyou have in America?\n  That made such an impression on me because I have been fortunate to \ntravel all over the world. I have been in many countries on every \ncontinent except Antarctica. In every country I go to, I meet very \nsmart people. I meet athletic stars, Olympic gold medal winners. I meet \nscientists, very successful business leaders, and great artists. Yet \nthere is something very different about every other society than ours \nbecause no other society has committed itself to the proposition that \nall people have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential \nand that we will provide universal public education, to offer that to \neach young boy and girl.\n  We are not perfect. We know that. We know we have schools that fail \nat this responsibility. Yet the goal we have set and the results we \nhave seen, from a commitment to public education for so many years now, \nhave been realized in the success of this country, in the uniqueness of \nour mobility, and in the opportunities we make available.\n  There are some children who, frankly, start out pretty far behind the \nstarting line. They do not have the family background. They do not have \nthe environmental enrichment. They do not have families who will help \nthem succeed in school. They are often trapped in generational poverty. \nWhen you have poor people, you often have poor services.\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\n  It is a challenge to those of us who believe in public education to \ncome up with reasons to oppose something that sounds so good. You can \nread the supporters' comments. They say: In some of our large cities, \nchildren are trapped in failing schools. They should be set free. And \nwe should, therefore, give them money to go to a private or parochial \nschool. And it sounds so good. But it has a number of serious flaws \nthat I hope will lead a majority in this Chamber to vote against it.\n  Let's take, first, the fact that the experiments that have been run--\nbecause we have already run experiments on vouchers--have demonstrated \nabsolutely no evidence that vouchers help to improve student \nachievement.\n  Secondly, we know vouchers do not help the students who need the help \nthe most.\n  Thirdly, vouchers do nothing to help improve public schools. In fact, \nresearch shows clearly that vouchers only further segregate and \nstratify our public schools.\n  That does not stop the proponents. I often have remarked since I have \nbeen in Washington that Washington operates in an evidence-free zone. \nYou can put out the evidence, and if it runs counter to the ideology, \nthen the evidence does not count.\n  But clearly there is no evidence. In fact, a 1998 study of the \nMilwaukee public school choice program, done by Cecilia Rouse of \nPrinceton University, found that students in public schools with \nsmaller class size and additional State funding experienced \nsignificantly faster reading scoring gains than students who attended \nprivate schools through the program.\n  In Cleveland, a study of the voucher program found no significant \ndifference between the achievement of voucher students and their public \nschool counterparts in reading, mathematics, social studies--the full \nbattery of tests--after controlling for background characteristics, \nincluding prior achievement.\n  So I do not think we need another experiment to tell us vouchers do \nnot work. We already have clear evidence of that fact.\n  But there are those who argue that increasing competition among \npublic schools, through vouchers, will help improve student achievement \nin failing schools. But we know that, too, is a false promise.\n\n  We know what does work--strong accountability, coupled with the extra \nattention that students who need it require, and the kinds of \nintervention we have heard about--everything from preschool to parental \ninvolvement to afterschool and summer school.\n  Scholars from the Economic Policy Institute, Duke University, and the \nCharles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas, as well as Stanford \nUniversity, have found that States with strong accountability systems \nwhich do not include vouchers were successful in improving student \nachievement in the lowest performing public schools. Researchers call \nit the scarlet-letter effect, which shows that if a school is termed \n``failing,'' the school is often motivated to improve. That is what we \nshould be focusing on now, and that is what we are focusing on in this \neducation debate.\n  I also worry that trying to provide sufficient funds to afford a \nstudent a choice that is meaningful will siphon much needed funds out \nof our public school system. A $1,500 voucher, for example, is just not \nsufficient in most large cities I am aware of, and we, therefore, know \nthat families have to add a substantial contribution themselves. In \nMilwaukee, for example, as many as 46 percent of students dropped out \nof the voucher program in the first year, and 28 percent dropped out in \nthe fifth year because the $3,600 voucher was not sufficient to cover \ncosts such as registration fees, books, uniforms, and transportation.\n  We also have to worry that if you implement vouchers, then very often \nthe motivated students and their parents will take advantage of them \nand we will see the kind of exodus from the public schools that will \nonly make it more difficult to change their futures.\n  How can we justify taking $50 million away from proven practices of \nimproving student achievement? We need to do more to lower class sizes. \nYet we were unsuccessful in continuing a proven program to do just that \nby helping to fund teachers in the classroom. Our friends on the other \nside said: That is not something the Federal Government should be \ndoing; so even though we know it works, we won't vote for it.\n  We were unsuccessful in having construction and modernization and \nrepair funding available where we know that so many schools, \nparticularly the very schools we are talking about, are literally \nfalling down around the heads of students and teachers. We were told: \nWell, modernizing our schools is not a Federal responsibility.\n  We need to recruit and retain teachers, and we know we are not going \nto do that if we don't provide competitive salaries and bonuses and \nother financial rewards. And we have a long way to go before we have \nthe teaching core, the quality teaching core we need in our country. \nInstead of investing in proven measures to raise student achievement, \nwe are being asked to divert and siphon off these dollars.\n  I started by saying that my concern is not only based on the fact \nthere isn't any evidence this works, that it siphons money out of the \npublic schools, that, in effect, it opens the door to giving up on what \nwe know makes a difference in our children's lives, but that also \npublic schools, for me, are the distinguishing characteristic that sets \nus apart from many other societies. They are the bedrock of our \ndemocracy. I don't think we would be giving up on any of our \nfundamental freedoms so easily. I don't think we would be turning our \nback on our Constitution or our Bill of Rights. Yet without a strong \npublic school system, we could, in effect, be doing just that.\n\n  At a time when we are trying to hold students and teachers to higher \nstandards, diverting scarce resources to fund an experiment that we \nalready know has weak results and could very well undermine the future \nof public education, which takes care of 95 percent of our students and \nworks well in most parts of our country, is a very tragic step in the \nwrong direction.\n  I heard the end of the remarks of my colleague from California. I \nknow she is a very strong supporter of public education, as I am. And \nlike her, I went to public schools from kindergarten through high \nschool. I believe in public schools. I was struck by what she said. If \nwe were already doing what we know works, if we had lowered class \nsizes, if we had imposed the discipline, if we had recruited and paid \nteachers in the hard-to-teach schools what they should be paid, if we \nhad modernized our schools so we didn't have chunks of plaster falling \non teachers' heads, as recently happened in a school in my State, then \nif we still didn't have results, maybe even we very strong public \nschool advocates would be willing to say: Well, we need to try \nsomething. But we are nowhere near there.\n  We have turned our backs on the children who need us the most. We \nhave basically left them in the most poorly funded schools with the \nleast qualified teachers, often not even encountering a certified \nteacher without adequate resources, without being held accountable, and \nwe say: Well, what do you know; it is failure.\n  This is similar to so many of the other proposals that would \nundermine public education. It is aimed not at solving the problem but \nat coming up with a short-term, ideologically driven answer to a \ncomplicated set of issues. It is tragic that when we know what works, \nwe are unwilling to step up and fund the resources that will give every \nchild in America, no matter who that child's parents might be, the same \nchance I was given.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe the understanding I had with \nSenator Kennedy was that Senator Kennedy and the proponents of his \nposition would have until 12:15, and then from 12:15--it was a casual \nunderstanding--we would go back to our side. I understand there are \nMembers on his side who wish to speak, and we have a Member on our \nside.\n  It is my intention at this time to yield the 15 minutes we had \nreserved on our side to Senator Ensign from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. May I ask a question of the minority side?\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, it is my understanding, then, that there \nis a prior agreement that a full 15 minutes will be used by the \nminority side, and then it will come back over here?\n  Mr. GREGG. There was no formal agreement, but there was an \nunderstanding that people presenting Senator Kennedy's position on this \namendment would go from 12 to 12:15, and we would go from 12:15 to \n12:30, and then we will be in the break for the meetings of the \ncaucuses. Then we would be coming back. I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts wanted to go into morning business; is that correct?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, that is correct. I ask the following, if \nit is possible. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada be \npermitted to proceed. Does he intend to use the full 15 minutes? Might \nthe Senator from Nevada use less?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, 10, 15 minutes, somewhere in there.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Nevada be permitted to proceed, the Senator from Minnesota then be \npermitted to speak for 5 minutes, and then I be permitted to speak as \nin morning business, at which point the Senate would recess for the \ncaucuses.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no problem with that. The time of the Senator from \nMinnesota will come off of the time of the Senator from Massachusetts. \nBoth the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Minnesota will \ncome off of the time of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask that we change that. I am not going \nto speak on the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 5 minutes of the Senator from \nMinnesota come off Senator Kennedy's time, and that the time that I use \nbe time as in morning business until we recess for the caucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no objection. I will amend it to include that the \ntime used up in this discussion be applied equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada 15 \nminutes, or such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, many colleagues will come to the floor \ntoday and state that federally funded vouchers will ruin our public \nschools. I say flatly that this is wrong.\n  This program does not take money away from any school. This amendment \ncreates a demonstration program and authorizes new funding to pay for \nit. But, even if the Gregg amendment did not provide new funding, \nvouchers would not take money away from public schools. It a student \nuses a voucher to go to a private school, a public school no longer has \nto pay the cost of educating that student. And, in most cases, a \nvoucher is given for less money than the average per pupil expenditure \nin the school district, thus saving the school money.\n  Under the Gregg amendment, the voucher program is voluntary. It \npermits 10 cities and 3 states to apply for grants to operate a low-\nincome public/private choice program for students attending failing \nschools.\n  This amendment ensures that children in our Nation's poorest \nneighborhoods, who attend our Nation's most struggling schools, have \nthe opportunity to get out and attend a better, higher-performing \nschool. These vouchers allow parents to choose the best academic \nsetting for their child.\n  In my opinion, the reason all of my colleagues should support this \namendment is because it is going to help children succeed in school. \nNone of us wants a child to be stuck in a school that has been \nidentified as failing for 3 years. Rather, we want our children to be \nin an environment where they can not only learn but excel in what they \nare learning. Vouchers have made this achievement possible for many \nstudents who otherwise would not have succeeded.\n  School choice, be it private or public, has been proven to drive \nreform in our Nation's schools. Why? Because competition breeds reform. \nHow can a school be expected to rise above mediocrity if it is not \nchallenged? In my opinion a lack of competition breeds mediocrity.\n  If you look around us today, I will bet you that everyone here has \nsought out the best schools for our children. Many of us are fortunate, \nand can afford a move to a better school district, or can send our \nchildren to private schools. I bet that most lobbyists, including those \nfor the National Education Association, in Washington, DC, send their \nchildren to private schools. However, many in our country are not as \nfortunate. How can we idly sit by and abandon children in failing \nschools?\n  This amendment will help those who cannot afford to send their \nchildren to private schools and cannot afford to move to a better \nschool district.\n  A study by Harvard researchers found that students who stayed in a \nvoucher program for 3 or 4 years registered reading scores 3 to 5 \npercentile points higher and math scores 5 to 11 percentile points \nhigher than a public school control group.\n  A study on the Milwaukee choice program found that scholarship \nrecipients experience a 1.5 to 2.3 percentile point gain over their \npeers in math for each year spent in a private school.\n  Studies of private school choice programs in both Washington, DC, and \nDayton, OH, found that black students who switched from public to \nprivate schools experienced an overall test score gain of 3.3 \npercentile points the first year, and 6.3 percentile points the second \nyear over the control group.\n  If this trend continues, the researchers contend that the achievement \ngap in reading and math between white and minority students would be \neliminated.\n  Isn't this what everyone here wants: to have all students excel? Do \nwe not want our nation's students to prove that they can do as well or \nbetter than their counterparts worldwide?\n  Test results released last year on the National Assessment for \nEducational Progress, and the International Math and Science Survey, \nshowed that children who attend private and parochial schools scored \nhigher than their counterparts in public school.\n  Students in private and parochial schools did better. It is as simple \nas that. Why then would we not allow low-income students who attend \nchronically failing schools a chance to attend schools that have proven \ntime and again that they can and do increase student achievement?\n  Parents strongly support public school choice; and yes, even \nvouchers. A recent poll done by the National Education Association \n(NEA) found that 63 percent of parents polled favored legislation that \nwould provide parents with tuition vouchers of $1,500 a year to send \ntheir children to any public, private, or charter school. I ask my \ncolleagues, what parent would not want to be given a chance to send \ntheir child to a better, higher performing school?\n  I have had conversations with public school superintendents, \nprincipals, and teachers who support vouchers. Yes, they support them. \nBut, they are afraid of stating their support publicly because of the \nteacher unions.\n  In fact, public school teachers send their own children to private \nschools at a higher rate than the general population. In Cleveland 39.7 \npercent of the public-school teachers living in the city sent at least \none child to a private school. The average rate for nonteacher families \nwas 25.2 percent. Here in Washington, DC, 28.2 percent of public school \nteachers send their children to private schools versus 19.7 percent of \nthe general population. And finally, in Boston, 44.6 percent of public \nteachers send their children to private schools, versus 28.9 percent of \nall parents.\n  It is not surprising that private organizations have initiated \nprivate school voucher programs and have had an unbelievable response. \nFor example, the Children's Scholarship Fund offered 40,000 vouchers to \nsimilar students in cities across the United States. They received 1.25 \nmillion applicants. In Baltimore alone 67 percent of the eligible \nstudent pool applied for one of these vouchers.\n  One of the reasons for this response is simple: parents are seeing \nthe results that private schools have on test results and want their \nchild to receive that same education.\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\n  However, the results from introducing vouchers in areas where public \nschools are failing our students are not only academic. Yes, test \nresults have increased, but so have high school completion rates, \ncollege attendance rates, and parental satisfaction. In addition, \nstudents in private schools are better disciplined and feel safer in \ntheir school.\n  The Federal Government already provides a type of voucher to low- to \nmiddle-income students with the Pell grant program. Pell grants are \ngiven to students to attend any college or university that they want; \nbe it public, private, or parochial. The Federal Government has \nsupported this, and as a result the American higher education system is \nthe envy of the world.\n  How is a Pell grant any different than a voucher for elementary or \nsecondary school?\n  I am not here today to attack our public schools. In most places, \nincluding my own state, our public schools are doing an outstanding \njob. But, in some places they are not. Some schools are simply failing \nto educate the children who attend them.\n  Vouchers not only help students leave these failing schools, but also \nhelp to foster change in the schools they are leaving. Principals, \nteachers and superintendents do not want to have failing schools. They \nwant their school to produce smart and productive children.\n  In fact, with the introduction of the A+ program in Florida, failing \nschools did improve. Schools given a D or F improved by implementing \nlonger school days, providing additional teacher training and \nprofessional development opportunities, and creating special programs \nto improve math and reading skills for at-risk students.\n  This is what I want to see happening nationwide. I want to see our \npublic schools improve; to prove to us that they can teach our students \njust as well, if not better, than private schools.\n  I believe that this legislation provides the assistance that many \npublic schools need to foster these changes and improvements. But I \nalso believe that this amendment is a necessary part of this \nlegislation. This amendment ensures that students in school districts \nthat are struggling to improve student achievement will be given a \nchance to attend a school that does improve achievement.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment, and support \nchildren in failing schools receive a better education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, because there are other Senators \ndesiring to speak on this, I can do this in less than 5 minutes. An \nawful lot has been said.\n  I was listening to my colleague from Nevada, and I thought I might \nsay at the beginning, in terms of my background, all of our children \nwent to public schools. My wife Sheila worked at the library of the \nhigh school. I think this reminds me of a debate I was involved in with \nSenator Hatch from Utah when I first came to the Senate, a sharp \ndebate, but done with some friendliness and a twinkle in our eye.\n  I said to Senator Hatch, if Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \ncould say to me as a Senator from Minnesota, we have lived up to our \ncommitment to leaving no child behind--I have heard so much about \nleaving no child behind: We have fully funded prekindergarten education \nso every child in America comes to kindergarten ready to learn--that is \nwhere the Federal Government could be a real player; we have fully \nfunded the title I program for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \nWe have lived up to our commitment to fund the IDEA program for \nchildren with special needs; We have voted for smaller class size and \nvoted to get more teachers, good teachers into teaching, to join many \ngood teachers who are teaching; we have voted for there to be an \ninvestment of money to rebuild crumbling schools because crumbling \nschools tell the children we don't give a damn; we have voted for \nresources for support services so there are counselors and teacher \nassistance and to help kids in reading; We have done it all, and none \nof it has worked; We have made our commitment to public education, and \nit has not worked; at that point in time, I might be the first person \nto embrace vouchers. But we have not done any of that. It is for that \nreason alone that I vigorously oppose this amendment introduced by the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Second, in my understanding in this proposal--by the way, the \nexclusive private schools cost a lot--I don't know how it is that low-\nincome children are going to be able to afford this, even with the help \nthey get here. This is fantasy land to believe that is the case.\n  There is not a requirement to accept children, for example, who have \nspecial needs. If that is the case, and I believe it is, I oppose this \namendment for that reason alone. I do not support public money that is \nnot linked to making sure that every child will be able to benefit, \nincluding children with special needs. I have made my case.\n  One other point. This bill is called BEST. This piece of legislation \nin its present form so far, beyond testing every child at every grade \nfrom grade 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and telling every school district in every \nState they have to do it, I see no guarantee anywhere in this \nlegislation that provides any resources to make sure every child will \nhave the same opportunity to learn. I don't see it in this legislation. \nI don't see it. It didn't happen last week with the trigger amendment \non title 1. I am not aware of any agreement with the administration. \nThis is putting the cart ahead of the horse, talking about vouchers, \nwithout making the commitment to public education.\n  The tragedy is we have plenty of issues in our States, huge \ndisparities of resources between children in more affluent districts \nand districts less affluent, States that could do better with \nsurpluses, and Minnesota is an example. I cannot believe we are not \nmaking more of an investment in education in our own State. But at the \nFederal level, Senators, we have not even come close to matching the \nwords we speak with the action we are taking. We have not lived up to \nour commitment to leaving no child behind, which I have said a million \ntimes, cannot be accomplished on a tin-cup education budget. That is \nall we have.\n\n  Until we make the commitment to invest in the skills and intellect \nand character of all children in our country--and it starts with \neducation, which is the foundation of opportunity--I could never \nsupport this voucher proposal. I hope it is defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6078-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6078-S6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, yesterday President Bush, in the Rose \nGarden, conducted a ceremony in which he addressed the question of \nglobal warming and our environment. There are many issues on the table, \nobviously, as the President meets in Europe. I don't want to discuss \nthose issues now because the President is abroad, and I think that \nwould not be appropriate.\n  However, it is appropriate, because the President spoke yesterday \nabout the subject of global warming, and I think it is important to \nrespond to his comments.\n  Regrettably--I say this with an enormous sense of lost opportunity--\nthe President did not offer our Nation any specific policy as to how he \nnow plans to address some of the basic fundamental, easily acceptable \nconcepts with respect to global warming. The President did accept \nscience at the beginning of his comments, but at the end of his \ncomments again he raised questions about the science, which seems to be \nthe good cop/bad cop aspect of the comments the administration is \nmaking with respect to this issue.\n  The President essentially called for more study and said his \nadministration is currently engaged in a review. Most who have been \ninvolved in this issue for 10 years or more and who have accepted the \nscience understand there are a clear set of priorities that do not \nrequire a study that effective leadership could immediately move to put \ninto place without an economic downside but with an enormous positive \nupside for our country and for the globe. More study is good. I am not \nsuggesting there are not elements of this issue where we don't have an \nenormous\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\namount of science to still develop. I will talk about that in a moment.\n  In any system as complex as global climate change, there are \nuncertainties. Obviously, we have to continue research. However, we \nwill find, I am confident, as the National Academy of Sciences warned \nlast week, that the longer we go without taking the simple, clearly \ndefinable steps that there is consensus on among most people who have \nseriously studied this issue, the more we procrastinate, then the \ndanger is even greater in the long term than we currently understand it \nto be.\n  I think it is important to note, there is no way to study yourself \nout of this problem. Second, even as the President claims what they are \ndoing is simply reviewing the bidding and making sort of a further \nanalysis of what the options are, even as they claim that, the fact is \nthe President is taking precipitous and potentially dangerous and \nclearly counterproductive steps that will have enormous long-term \nimplications for America's ability to resolve the challenge of climate \nchange.\n  To underscore this point, the National Academy of Sciences, at the \nrequest of the White House, issued a report last week assessing our \nunderstanding of climate change. In addition to reaffirming the \nscientific consensus that climate change is underway and getting worse, \nthe National Academy of Sciences made an extraordinarily relevant \nobservation:\n\n       National policy decisions made now and in the long-term \n     future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by \n     vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in this \n     century.\n\n  Indeed, since the earliest days of the administration, the President \nhas made a series of policy decisions that will profoundly impact our \nability to protect the global environment, all the while purporting to \nbe simply studying the issue.\n  So it is really clear that while the President says they are going to \nstudy it, that he has asked for his Cabinet review, and while the \nPresident says there are certain unknowns that impact the choices we \nwill make, the President is not neutral in the choices he is making \nwhich will have a long-term impact on the choices with which we are \nleft with respect to this issue.\n  Specifically, while the administration claims to be studying the \nissue, the President has repeatedly questioned the underlying science \nof climate change and attempted to reignite the debate over whether the \nthreat is real. This was done despite the fact of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, a scientific panel founded at the behest of \nhis own father; despite earlier assessments by the National Academy of \nSciences; and despite some top government and university researchers in \nthis Nation; and despite personal statements of concern from \nresearchers around the country.\n  Let me just refer to today's New York Times where there is an article \nthat says, ``Warming Threat Requires Action Now, Scientists Say.'' I \nwill just read very quickly:\n       Indeed, to many experts embroiled in the climate debate, \n     the question of how much warming is too much--which has been \n     at the center of international climate negotiations for a \n     decade--now constitutes a red herring. They say it is more \n     important to start from the point of widest agreement--that \n     rising concentrations of heat-trapping gases are warming the \n     atmosphere, and that adding a lot more is probably a bad \n     idea. The next step, they say, is to adopt policies that will \n     soon flatten the rising arc on graphs of global emissions \n     while also pursuing more research to clarify the risks.\n       Many note that recent studies suggest a fairly high risk of \n     significant ecological harm from a global temperature rise of \n     less than 1 degree Fahrenheit and of substantial coastal \n     flooding and agricultural disruption if temperatures rise \n     more than 4 or 5 degrees in the new century.\n       Global temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit in the \n     last 50 years; since the last Ice Age, they have risen about \n     9 degrees.\n       The risks are clear enough to justify some investments now \n     in emissions controls, they say.\n       They say that the general quandary is no different from the \n     kind faced by town officials who must judge how much road \n     salt to buy based on uncertain long-term winter weather \n     forecasts, or by countries deciding whether to invest in a \n     missile defense system that might not ever have to shoot down \n     a missile.\n       ``It's silly to expect that we can resolve what the future \n     is going to be,'' said Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a \n     mathematician and political scientist at the National Center \n     for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ``That's like \n     trying to do economic policy by asking competing economists \n     what level the stock market is going to be at 20 years from \n     now.''\n\n  Yesterday, I was in Boston with a number of extraordinary scientists, \namong them the Nobel laureate who helped discover the ozone hole, Dr. \nJim McCarthy, a professor of biology at Harvard University, and a \nmember of the IPCC working group. He said, imagine yourself as a parent \nand somebody says to you as a parent: Look, there is a 50-percent \nchance that your child is going to get cancer from the water he or she \nhas been drinking. But if your child takes this medicine, we know we \ncan reduce the risk. If you don't take the medicine, perhaps your child \nis going to get the cancer.\n  Most parents in this country will make the judgment immediately: I \nwant the medicine for my child.\n  That is exactly the kind of analogy we face today with respect to \nglobal warming. We are being told what the probabilities are, about \nwhat the consequences will be. We are being told if we take certain \nactions, we can mitigate it. And we know to a certainty if we do not \ntake those actions, we run the risk that we could wind up with a \ncompletely irreversible equation.\n  We are not talking about something you can suddenly jump in on at \nsome stage later and necessarily remediate--unless, of course, there \nmay be some extraordinary discovery about how you take out of the \natmosphere what we are putting into it. But as of this moment, that \nremains the most perplexing and complex of solutions at which \nscientists are looking.\n  It is far easier and far more attainable to take measures now to try \nto reduce the level of emissions that we put into the atmosphere and to \npremitigate, to take the opportunity to reduce and not even do the \ndamage we will do in the first place.\n  The reason this is particularly compelling is very simple. We know \nthe progressive possibilities, and we recognize there is sort of a law \nof safety, if you will; sort of a prudent person principle that you \nwould put in place in order to try to avoid a disaster that you may not \nhave any capacity to undo at some point in the future.\n  We may never know the exact rate of change or the specific impacts \nand precise human contribution until it is too late to do anything \nabout it. The changes we are causing in the atmosphere, raising \natmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to levels unseen in over \n400,000 years, is simply unprecedented. Those who demand that we wait \nfor absolute certainty, starting with the President, should explain how \nthey will reverse the damage that we have caused, how our environment \ncan be made whole again once we have polluted the atmosphere in such a \nsubstantial and fundamental way.\n  Rather than asking us the question, how do you know what the damage \nwill be, when you know that you will create damage, we should be asking \nthem the question, how can you guarantee us that it will not cause the \nworst scenario that is being predicted. It seems to me the \nprecautionary principle demands we take some kind of actions.\n  Furthermore, while the administration claims to be only studying the \nissue, the President has actually reversed the campaign pledge and \nannounced a newfound opposition to capping carbon pollution from power \nplants, which is the source of one-third of our greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  The idea of a four-pollutant power plant bill has been a bipartisan \neffort in the Congress. It has industry support. It remains one of our \nmost promising proposals to move ahead in climate change. But it was \nrejected out of hand by the President only weeks after entering office.\n  That is not a neutral position. That is not merely studying. That is \ntaking a proactive negative position that has an impact on global \nclimate change.\n  Further, while the administration claims to be only studying the \nissue, the President declared the Kyoto Protocol on climate change to \nbe dead, and still calls the agreement fatally flawed. That is not only \nstudying the issue; that is not a neutral action.\n  That has a profoundly negative impact on global efforts to try to \ndeal with climate change. Whatever one thinks of the substance of the \nKyoto Protocol, it is self-evident that the\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nPresident's outright rejection of the protocol so quickly with little \nexplanation and with little international consultation, and apparently \nlittle considered analysis, was a mistake.\n  Is the protocol flawed? Yes. Is it fatally flawed? That depends \nentirely on the willingness of an administration to lead and to fix it.\n  The President in his Rose Garden statement yesterday referred to the \n95-0 vote of the Senate on the Byrd-Hagel amendment as a rationale to \nsay the Senate, as a whole, doesn't believe in this treaty. I was the \nfloor manager on our side for that amendment. I know precisely what the \nintent was, at least on our side of the aisle, in adopting that \namendment. It wasn't that the treaty was so flawed that it couldn't \nultimately be made whole and become the instrument which we could \nratify with amendment, with further nurturing and with future \nleadership. We were suggesting that, indeed, it would be wrong to do it \nwithout the less developed nations also participating.\n  The Clinton administration set out over the course of the last 2 \nyears to work with these less developed nations to bring them into the \nprocess. That is the unfinished task of the Kyoto Protocol. But it \nshould not allow somebody to define the protocol as automatically dead \nas a consequence of that kind of deficiency.\n  In the 17 years I have been in the Congress, and the many years many \nothers have been here longer, there have been countless numbers of \ntreaties that have come to us that we have remedied, that we have put \namendments to, and that we have gone back and renegotiated on in order \nto guarantee they meet our concerns.\n  This protocol is the product of the work of 160 nations. It is a \ndecade of work. It deserves better than to simply be cast aside by a \nunilateral action of the United States, particularly in view of the \nfact that it represents, ultimately, the format on which we are going \nto have to agree, which is an international agreement to have a \nmandatory goal which we are going to try to reach together in order to \ndeal with this issue.\n  While the administration claims to be only studying the issue, the \nPresident has proposed a budget to us that slashes Federal support for \nclean energy technologies, which are a vital component of any plan to \nmitigate climate change.\n  The President's budget cuts funding in almost every efficiency \nprogram at the Department of Energy, including cuts to appliances, \nbuildings, instruments, and transportation. It cuts support for \nrenewable energy from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass by about 50 \npercent--a 50-percent cut. That is not a mere study.\n  That is a negative action that will have a profound negative impact \non the ability of our country to be a willing global leader in \ndeveloping the technologies and in showing the world our seriousness of \npurpose in this endeavor.\n  While the administration claims to be only studying the issue, the \nPresident issued an energy plan that by his own acknowledgment does not \nconsider the threat of global climate change. It resurrects an energy \npolicy better suited for the 1970s than the year 2000 and the new \nmillennium. It does more to set limits on America's ability to innovate \nthan it does to inspire the technological advances that can help our \neconomy and our environment.\n\n  By one estimate, the President's budget and efforts will increase our \ngreenhouse gas pollution by as much as 35 percent. That is not a \nneutral, mere study. That is a negative action that will have profound \nlong-term consequences.\n  Let me read again the crucial observation by the National Academy of \nSciences. They said:\n\n       National policy decisions made now and in the longer term \n     future will influence the extent of any damage suffered by \n     vulnerable human populations and ecosystems later in the \n     century.\n\n  With all due respect, I think the President has acted and is acting \non the issue of climate change in a counterproductive way. I urge him \nto take the time to reevaluate that budget and to assist us in setting \nthis country on a course of leadership that will help us to prove our \nbona fides with respect to this issue.\n  None of us who argue for action are going to suggest that we have all \nthe answers to what is going to happen in the long run. We recognize \nthere are complex environmental, economic, scientific, and diplomatic \nchallenges. But I do know that we need American leadership in order to \nconvince the people we have been working with for the last 10 years \nthat we are, indeed, serious about this issue.\n  One of the principal reasons we have been unable to bring the less \ndeveloped countries into this process is because they do not trust us. \nThey do not believe we are serious about this. In the meetings in \nBuenos Aires, and in the meetings in The Hague most recently, one could \nnot just hear but you could feel the growing anger at the United States \nfor the level of our emissions; and, then, of course, the lack of \naction that we have taken to try to deal with this challenge.\n  I simply remind my colleagues that all of the prophecies of a \ndamaging impact on our economy need to be measured against what a lot \nof big businesses in our country are already doing. British Petroleum \nwill reduce voluntarily its emissions to 10 percent below the 1990 \nlevels by the year 2010. Polaroid will cut its emissions to 20 percent \nbelow the 1994 levels by 2005. Johnson & Johnson will reduce its \nemissions to 7 percent below the 1990 levels by 2010. IBM will cut \nemissions by 4 percent each year until 2004 based on 1994 emissions. \nShell International, DuPont, and others, have made similar commitments. \nBut the predictions of economic calamity from entrenched polluters are \nsimply not credible when you measure them against the accomplishment of \nthese particular companies.\n  The problem is that only a small universe of these companies have \nbeen willing to adopt any kind of voluntary effort. We applaud their \nleadership. That is the kind of good corporate citizenship that makes \nan enormous difference.\n  The lesson of the last 10 years is you have to have a mandatory \nstructure and a mandatory goal. You can have all kinds of flexible \nmechanisms. You can use the marketplace in countless numbers of ways to \nencourage different kinds of behavior. Indeed, we should ask the \ncorporate community to come to the table in ways that they haven't been \ninvited previously and ask them to be part of helping us define the \nleast cost, least intrusive, most efficient ways of dealing with this \nissue. But unless we set that kind of goal, we are not going to have \nthe credibility to create the framework within which you bring the less \ndeveloped nations into our fold.\n  Our country has proven its remarkable capacity when challenged to be \nable to apply the entrepreneurial skill and the remarkable \nentrepreneurial spirit of our Nation to accomplishing almost any task. \nWe did that in the measure of World War II when we needed to pursue the \nManhattan project and developed the atom bomb itself. We have done it \nin countless other ways. It is when we unleash our technological \ncapacity that we are at our best. But many times we have to excite the \nprivate capital movement to some of those areas by creating the \nincentives or by encouraging that capital to move those ways. When you \nslash your budget significantly in ways that reduces that technological \norganization, you send a counterproductive message to the capital \nmarkets which diminish the ability of that spirit to take hold.\n\n  I believe we should summon our energy to the effort of challenging \nour country to, in a sense, view this as sort of a new mission to the \nMoon, that this should be our effort, that we are going to do the \nfollowing in the following period of time. We can achieve that by \ncutting emissions at home. We can commit to drafting an international \nagreement that is based on these mandatory caps. We can find all kinds \nof ways to excite achievement to create hybrid cars, alternative fuels, \nrenewable energy, and I think in the end that would be beneficial for \nall of us.\n  While the protocol that was created in Kyoto is incomplete, it also \nrepresents a remarkable process because it created this mandatory \nstructure. I think most of us would be willing to acknowledge that \nthere is still room for compromise; that we could find the ways through \nthe emissions trading and through the definition of the carbon sinks \nand other things to be able to come to a final solution with respect to \nit.\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\n  But we have wasted the past decade in a political impasse, and we \nhave failed to do what I think we know how to do best. If we do pursue \nwhat I just talked about--providing the economic incentives for the \ndevelopment and proliferation of solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen, and \nother clean technologies--then we can carry a new message to the rest \nof the world that takes away the regressive record of the last years \nand reasserts a kind of credibility that is important to the \nnegotiating process.\n  I might add, everyone should understand this is not just about global \nwarming. People are always talking about the confrontation between the \nenvironment and the economy. But the fact is, we can create tens of \nthousands of jobs pursuing these alternatives. In addition to that, we \nwould have wide-ranging domestic benefits, including reduced local air \nand water pollution, preventing respiratory and other illnesses. All \nyou have to do is look at the incidence of child respiratory disease in \nour country, the increase in the incidence of asthma, including in \nadults, the remarkable increase in our hospital costs as a consequence \nof air pollution- and water pollution-carried diseases and illnesses.\n  We would lessen our dependence on imported oil. We would lessen the \npressure to exploit our own natural lands. We would create markets for \nfarmers. We would grow jobs and exports in the energy sector. We would \nenhance our overall economic strength by strengthening our \ntechnological sector. And we would ultimately strengthen our national \nsecurity as a consequence of these measures.\n  Those are not small accomplishments, let alone what we would \naccomplish with respect to global warming. So we have a challenge in \nfront of us. We need to recognize we have been going backwards. We are \nat 1980 levels in automobiles because of the loophole on SUVs. There \nare countless numbers of things we could do on building efficiencies in \nAmerica, countless numbers of things we could do for various engines \nand air-conditioners, and other emitters of greenhouse gases, if we \nwere to try to apply the technological capacity of our country to that \nendeavor.\n  So my hope is this administration will recognize the energy study \ndone 2 years ago which said that if we were to try to implement what we \nknow we can do today--what IBM, Polaroid, and these other companies are \ndoing today--we could, in fact, do so in a way that is completely \nneutral to our economy. We could have the upside of gains on addressing \nglobal warming while having the upside on our economy.\n  We should begin with steps that benefit the environment and the \neconomy and are technologically achievable today. We can and should \nincrease the efficiency of automobiles, homes, buildings, appliances \nand manufacturing.\n  The efficiency of the average American passenger vehicle has been \ndeclining since 1987 and is now at its lowest since 1980. That is \nunacceptable. Our cars and trucks could and should be increasingly more \nefficient not less efficient. Despite doubling auto efficiency since \n1975, we are actually now backsliding. It is time to update national \nstandards for vehicle efficiency. It is time to get more efficient \ngasoline, diesel, natural gas, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles off the \ndrawing board and onto America's highways. We can do it. We are doing \nit. Hybrids, once considered exotic, are on the market today getting 50 \nmiles to a gallon.\n  We can improve the efficiency of resident and commercial buildings. I \nam a cosponsor of the Energy Efficient Buildings Incentives Act. It is \na bipartisan proposal to provide tax incentives for efficiency \nimprovements in new and existing buildings. Once implemented it would \ncut carbon emissions by over 50 million metric tons per year by 2010 \nand provide a direct economic savings that will exceed $40 billion.\n  We can strengthen efficiency standards for clothes washers, \nrefrigerators, heat pumps, air conditioners and other appliances. \nStandards issued in 1997 and earlier this year by the Department of \nEnergy must be fully and effectively implemented. The net energy \nsavings to the nation will be $27 billion by 2030. The environmental \nbenefits include a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions equal to \ntaking more than 14 million cars off the road.\n  We must push the deployment of domestic, reliable and renewable \nenergy from wind, solar, biomass and geothermal by creating markets and \nproviding financial incentives. Today, California gets 12 percent of \nits energy from renewable energy while the rest of the country gets \nless than 2 percent of its electricity from renewable energy. We need \nto do a better job. Our nation has great potential for wind power--not \nonly in states like North Dakota, South Dakota or Iowa but also in \ncoastal states like Massachusetts. Planning is underway for an offshore \nwind farm off the coast of Massachusetts that will be generating as \nmuch as 400 megawatts of power--enough to power 400,000 homes.\n  We have only begun to tap the potential of geothermal in Western \nstates and biomass, which can produce energy from farm crops, forest \nproducts and waste. But to seize this potential we must create the \nmarkets and financial incentives that will draw investment, invention \nand entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, America is falling behind. One of \nthe challenges in wind development is long delays in purchasing \nequipment from European suppliers who have the best technologies but \nalso long delays because of rapidly growing demand. I believe American \ncompanies should be the technological leaders supplying American \nprojects--instead it's European firms. We must create the market and \nthe incentives for these technologies and let America's entrepreneurs \nmeet the demand.\n  Finally, we must look to the long term. If we are ever to convince \nthe developing world that there is a better way, we must create that \nbetter way. To do so, we must invest in solving this problem with the \nsame urgency that we have invested in space exploration, military \ntechnology and other national priorities. For too long our investments \nhave been scatter shot and poorly coordinated--and lacked the intensity \nwe need. We need a single effort, with strong leadership, that \ninvestigates how we meet this challenge and sets a path for a \nsustainable future.\n  If we do this, if we act early and invest in the future, I am \nconfident our investment will be rewarded. It will bolster our economy, \nmake us more energy independent, protect the public health and \nstrengthen our national security. Unlike today, America will be the \nleader in clean energy technologies and we will export them to the \nworld. As America has throughout our history, we will lead in finding a \nglobal solution--and we will protect the global environment for \ngenerations to come.\n  That is the challenge. I hope the Senate and House will show \nleadership in engaging in that effort.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank everybody else in delaying a little \nbit. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6081-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire.\n  I rise this afternoon to express my support for the amendment offered \nby my colleague from New Hampshire which would create a Federal private \nschool choice demonstration project. This amendment closely tracks \nchoice proposals that I have cosponsored myself, both with Senator \nGregg and, before him, with Senator Coats of Indiana.\n  This is an experimental program. It is designed to test an idea that \ncan help some of our children get a better education. It is focused \nexclusively on\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\nlow-income families. It does not take any money that otherwise would go \nto our public schools, and it includes a strong evaluation component to \ndetermine what impact this program has both on academic achievement of \nparticipating students and on the public schools they leave behind.\n  It constructively answers a question that in too many places has gone \nunanswered for too long; namely, the question that parents have asked \nme--and I am sure others in this Chamber--parents whose children are \ntrapped in failing public schools and yet who cannot afford to send \nthem to a nonpublic school that the parents are confident would be \nbetter for their children.\n  How do we answer that question? How do we justify telling them to \nwait for their public schools to improve when their children may well \nbe grown up or certainly have moved along in the school system by then, \nand particularly when other parents who can afford to do so are taking \ntheir children out of similar public schools?\n  Those are questions policymakers and politicians and educators around \nthe country have been struggling with for some time. The struggle is a \nreal one. It is based on conflicting values, each of them strong and \ngood, and conflicting loyalties, if you will. We share a common \ndevotion to our public schools and the ideal of equal opportunity that \nthey have made real for so many tens of millions of American citizens. \nBut we also realize, as the underlying bill we are debating now \nacknowledges, that too many of our public schools, particularly in low-\nincome areas, have not been realizing the promise of equal opportunity, \nthat that promise has become effectively hollow.\n  On the one hand, we obviously cannot and will not abandon those \npublic schools and certainly not abandon public education in general \nbecause it is the great democratizing force in American history. It is \nthe great ladder up in American life. The public schools will always be \nthe primary source of learning for most of our children.\n  We also don't want to abandon those disadvantaged children trapped in \nschools that their parents conclude are not adequately educating them \nand thereby sacrifice their hopes for a better life for their children \nto our vision of an idealized world.\n  The answer ultimately is, of course, to make our public schools \nbetter. That, as I will state in a moment, is the purpose of the \nunderlying bill. I have struggled with the question and the dilemma, \nthe question that parents have asked, for a long period of time. I have \ntalked to many parents, visited many public schools in Connecticut \nwhere a lot of extraordinary good work and reform is going on. I have \nalso talked with parents of children in schools where the kids are not \nreceiving the education the parents believe they deserve and need. And \nthose parents want to take their children and put them in a nonpublic \nschool. I visited many of the nonpublic schools, particularly in \nConnecticut--those run by the Roman Catholic diocese in our State; they \nare run in some of Connecticut's poorest neighborhoods--accepting \nchildren. In many cases, most of the kids are not Catholic. The parents \nare very satisfied with the quality of education those children are \nreceiving.\n\n  After all that inquiry, I decided--this goes back years ago--that \nschool choice is a reform idea worth testing on a larger stage but not \nthe one answer to all of our educational challenges and shortcomings. \nThere is no one answer. This is an idea worth testing. That is when I \nbegan working with Senator Coats to develop a national demonstration \nproject very similar--almost exactly similar--to that proposed in the \namendment Senator Gregg has introduced today.\n  It was my belief then, and still is my belief, that we have an \nobligation to try everything we can to improve educational \nopportunities for all of our children, to never refuse to open a single \ndoor behind which there may be a constructive answer that will help us \nbetter educate all of America's children.\n  The growing national demand for choice has, I believe, helped to \nawaken us to the educational crisis that has been plaguing our poorest \nurban and rural neighborhoods. We have watched the standards movement \ntake off in States around the country and listened to Governors and \nreformers of both parties demand accountability for results, saying we \ncan no longer tolerate failure in our attempts to educate our children.\n  We have been heartened by the academic achievement gains made in \ncommunities all across America. I think of Chicago and Hartford and \ndistricts throughout America that were once declared educational \ndisaster areas and today are beacons of hope for the future of our \nchildren.\n  Now we in this body are considering the most sweeping Federal \neducation reform plan in a generation. This has taken on the challenge \nof ending what the President has called ``the soft bigotry of low \nexpectations'' and closing the achievement gap into which too many poor \nminority children are falling. Part of what makes the reform plan in \nthe underlying bill so encouraging is that it provides a series of \nstrong answers to that same tough question I am sure many of my \ncolleagues have heard from parents of children in public schools that \nthey believe are not adequately answering it.\n  This bill provides answers to that question because it will force \ndistricts to take bold steps to turn around failing schools, including \nradically reconstituting them, converting them into charter schools or, \nin the worst cases, actually closing them down and opening them as new \nschools. It will significantly expand the options for poor parents \nwithin the public school framework, guaranteeing that their children \ncan transfer to higher performing public schools and providing them \nwith transportation assistance to make that choice meaningful.\n  For those children who do not or cannot leave a failing school, this \nbill gives their parents the right to demand outside tutorial or \nsupplemental services to ensure that their children are not being left \nbehind.\n  The amendment Senator Gregg has offered would offer yet another \noption in the communities across America chosen to carry out this \ndemonstration project for parents of children in schools that are \nfailing. The fact is that all of the reforms I have described that are \nin the underlying bill before us are going to take some time to yield \nresults. I am very optimistic about them. But even at the best, we have \nto be restless and unsatisfied in our continuing pursuit of a better \neducation for our children. The truth is, the journey to a better \neducation for all of America's children has no final destination point; \nit will go on and on and on.\n\n  That is why I support the idea embodied in Senator Gregg's amendment \nwhich will test the school choice concept in a way that can benefit all \nof us who care about our children's education and at the same time \nprovide a short-term educational lifeline for children involved in this \ndemonstration program who are trapped in a school that is found to be \nfailing, according to the accountability provisions of this underlying \nESEA reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an \nadditional moment to finish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I understand there is no guarantee that \nif this amendment were adopted, the projects authorized under it would \nsucceed. But that is the very point of the amendment. It is a test. It \nis saying that we are restless and unafraid in pursuit of the best \neducation for each of America's children.\n  In fact, the research about the limited voucher programs that exist \nin cities across America today, such as in Milwaukee and Cleveland, is \nas controversial, in some ways, as the programs themselves. Some of the \nevidence is promising, suggesting that private school choice could \nimprove achievement and drive change in the local public schools. And \nthe fact that so much research is in dispute itself is an argument for \na larger experiment, a national experiment, fully evaluated and \nreported on to provide us with better facts, better information, to \nmake more informed judgments as we continue tirelessly, fearlessly, to \nexplore every avenue to a better education for each and every one of \nAmerica's children.\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will support the Gregg amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut. I agree \nwith him that it is time for this amendment to have a test. In fact, I \nthink the vote on this amendment will tell the American people whether \nwe are really serious about reforming education, which is what this \nlegislation really ought to be all about.\n  I also think it is about which special interests are most exercised. \nUntil now, with only a few exceptions, the amendments to this bill \napproved by the Senate have increased spending and authorized new \nspending programs. These are the same measures that have produced \ngenerations of less-educated Americans. ``After spending $125 billion . \n. . over 25 years, we have virtually nothing to show for it.'' That is \na quotation from Secretary Paige. It is what he said when he saw new \ndata showing that 60 percent of our poor fourth graders are still \nessentially unable to read.\n  During this debate, the Senate voted to shovel billions of dollars \nmore of taxpayers' money into this failed effort. At last count, \nmeasuring spending just on this bill, from last year, $17 billion spent \nto approximately $38 billion, it is well over a 100-percent increase. I \nthink this is the context in which we should consider the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  As pointed out by the Senator from Connecticut, this amendment simply \nestablishes a demonstration program which would allow only 10 \nlocalities in 3 States the opportunity to extend school choice to low-\nincome students in failing schools. The cost is $50 million a year.\n\n  Given the colossal spending increases added to this bill over the \nlast few weeks, it is ironic that some still argue that this amendment \nis denying needed resources to public schools.\n  No, the opposition to this amendment can only illustrate the truth of \nGeorge Will's observation that ``opposition to school choice is the \nmost purely reactionary cause in contemporary politics.''\n  This is not even a liberal versus conservative issue. Many \ndistinguished voices of American liberalism have broken with the \nreactionary special interests and embraced school choice.\n  The list includes--but is not limited to--former Labor Secretary \nRobert Reich, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist William Raspberry former \nBaltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former Congressman Floyd Flake, and the \neditors of the Washington Post.\n  Most of these thoughtful observers deviated from liberal orthodoxy \nbecause they realize that their doctrine was hurting poor children.\n  President Bush has described literacy as ``the new civil right.'' And \nhe is right. When we allow the most disadvantaged to be cheated out of \na decent education, we render the promise of equal opportunity hollow.\n  School choice keeps that promise, not just for the students who are \nable to exercise choice, but for all the students who attend schools in \na community where choice is widely exercised.\n  My home State of Arizona has been a leader in the effort to provide \nparents with additional choices in education. Under the leadership of \nrecently departed Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Graham \nKeegan, we have instituted open enrollment, enacted the most liberal \ncharter school law in the country, and restructured state education \nfinancing so that education funds follow the student to the institution \nof his or her choice.\n  One of the most interesting results is that because families are now \nempowered to exercise all these new options, the traditional schools \nare working harder to improve their performance. In response to some \nnew charter schools, one district changed the curricula and other \nprograms and took out ads in the paper to tell parents about efforts to \nimprove upon its already strong academic offerings.\n  But the competition that the new charter schools created spurred them \nto do even better. Who benefited? The kids. And after all, isn't that \nwhat this is about?\n  It shouldn't be surprising that improvements resulted when Arizona \nbegan encouraging innovation by educators and providing more choice for \nparents and students.\n  Our Nation has thrived because our leading industries and \ninstitutions have been challenged by constant pressure to improve and \ninnovate. The source of that pressure is vigorous competition among \nproducers of a service or good for the allegiance of their potential \nconsumers.\n  The alternative is monopoly, and a system that maintains a captive \nclientele by blocking all the exits, a system within which attempts to \nprovide such an exit--even one so modest as that contained in this \namendment--are considered a deadly threat.\n  We all know that any politician who crosses these reform foes can \nexpect to pay a price.\n  We all recall how our former colleague Bill Bradley was pilloried in \nthe Democrat primaries for the heresy of supporting proposals just like \nthis one.\n  Senator Bradley tried to reason with his critics:\n\n       Advocates of school choice say that . . . it will create \n     competition that will make the public schools better,\n\nhe noted, before concluding:\n\n       You don't know that unless you have a test.\n\n  The die-hard choice opponents don't want to know. Or perhaps they \nalready do know.\n  Recently, along with a number of my colleagues, I had the opportunity \nto hear from Howard Fuller, who served as superintendent of schools in \nMilwaukee and helped implement that city's path-breaking choice \nprogram.\n  Dr. Fuller is a passionate and eloquent advocate for school choice. \nHe gets to the heart of the opposition when he said:\n\n       Parents must be empowered to have their aspirations for \n     their children's education taken seriously by educators. A \n     critical step in that direction is when we give them the \n     capacity to exercise choice. I believe that [currently] our \n     educational systems are . . . organized to protect the \n     interests of those of us who work in these systems, not the \n     needs and interests of the families we are supposed to serve. \n     . . .\n\n  When we vote on this amendment, the Senate will decide: Is our \npurpose to protect the special interests or is it to protect the \ninterests of American students and their families?\n  The choice is clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope we will consider seriously this \npending amendment and the implications.\n  To clarify some of the record in terms of statistics that have been \nthrown about during this debate, there was mention on the floor early \ntoday that 63 percent of the American people support vouchers. The \nexact number is 63 percent support public school vouchers. The \nimplication that this is 63 percent supporting vouchers to private \nschools is not an accurate figure at all.\n  The national exit polls in November showed by nearly an 80-percent \nmargin Americans prefer investments in public schools to vouchers.\n  The State of California rejected its voucher referendum 71-29. \nLatinos rejected it by a higher margin, 77-23. Michigan rejected its \nvoucher referendum 69-31. African Americans rejected it by a higher \nmargin, 75-25. The notion that this is a concept that is supported by \nthe American public or that has gone on trial is not the case.\n  Normally, one might ask, what is wrong with a demonstration program, \nwith a budget of multibillions of dollars; why not take $50 million and \nput it into a demonstration program to determine whether or not \nsomething like this works?\n  First of all, I suppose, only in Washington would a person consider \n$50 million an insignificant amount of money. Particularly when we are \ntrying to get funding for title I and special education and a variety \nof other needs out there, $50 million may make a significant \ndifference.\n  Putting aside the size of the amount being asked for, this is not a \nnew idea. It is not an untested idea. Every place it has been tested it \nhas not worked. Those are the facts.\n  States, counties, cities, have tried vouchers. There is no research \nthat\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nvoucher students outperform public school students or that voucher \nprograms improve public schools at all. Instead, vouchers take scarce \nresources from public schools that desperately need them. Remember, as \nwe debate this issue, 55 million children went to school in America \ntoday; 50 million went to a public school; 5 million went to a private \nor parochial school.\n  The idea that we will take every desiring public school student and \nput them into the structures that accommodate private school students \nis ridiculous on its face.\n  Although this is a pilot program, there are those who would make this \na full-scale program if they could. This is, of course, to get $50 \nmillion in the door to demonstrate in a sense that we ought to try this \nas a national scheme and underwrite people's desires to send their \nchildren to private or parochial schools. So the 50 million kids who \nare going to schools need to know whether or not we will be doing what \nwe can to improve the quality of public education. That is where our \nprimary responsibility is when it comes to elementary and secondary \neducation needs.\n  What will help public schools, in my view, is not vouchers but better \nqualified teachers, smaller class size, safe and modern facilities, \nprograms to increase parental involvement, and more afterschool \nprograms. Even if every available space in private schools were filled \nby a transfer student from a public school in America, only 4 percent \nof the public school students would receive a voucher under the maximum \nset of circumstances. Which 4 percent will it be? Who makes that \nchoice? It will not be a kid who can be a bit of a problem. Unlike a \npublic school, a private school can cherry-pick who they want to have, \nwho they don't want to have, who they want to reject, who they like or \ndon't like. That is their right. I never fault or suggest that a \nprivate or parochial school ought to accept everyone who applies. So \nwhen you are setting up a private school program, many of which, by the \nway, cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars--the idea that somehow we \nare going to have a meaningful voucher program for some desperately \npoor black child growing up in a ghetto somewhere to go to the Taft \nSchool in Connecticut or some private institution is foolish, in my \nview. We are talking about a fraction, even if you had a national \nprogram here, a fraction of the students who would qualify.\n\n  Vouchers do not even provide a choice for many of the students who \nare eligible for them. Unlike public schools, private schools are not \nrequired to accept all students, nor is there any evidence that the few \nstudents who are able to use vouchers to attend private schools \noutperform public school peers. The most comprehensive study of the \nfirst 5 years of the Milwaukee voucher program showed no achievement \ndifferences between voucher students and public school students, not \nany after 5 years.\n  I ask for 2 additional minutes, if I could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. In fact, this is why I made the statement I did at the \noutset. This is not uncharted waters at all. Mr. President, 30 years of \nresearch suggests that when background conditions and other factors are \ntaken into account there are no significant differences in achievement \nbetween public and private school students. Supporters of vouchers also \nsuggest that competition from vouchers will improve public schools; \nthat competition will shake out the bad schools.\n  I am all for business models in a lot of areas, but education is not \nwidgets. The business model starts with a premise that there are \nwinners and losers. An educational model that starts with that premise \nis not consistent with leaving no child behind. We cannot afford for \nany school or any child to be a loser. We cannot guarantee there will \nbe winners, but we ought to be able to guarantee an equal opportunity \nto win. The idea that some are just going to fail and that's the way \nlife is is not the way we ought to be dealing with elementary and \nsecondary educational needs.\n  I do not think we can afford for any school or child to be a loser in \nAmerica. Just as there is no reliable research suggesting that voucher \nstudents outperform their peers, there is no reliable research that \nsuggests that voucher programs improve public schools either. We know \nwhat does improve them: additional resources, better teachers, smaller \nclass size, curriculum, model schools. Those are the things that make a \ndifference. We do not need a Federal demonstration program to learn \nabout voucher programs or about what is necessary to improve public \nschools. We already know that we do not improve public schools by \ndraining away desperately needed resources and undermining public \nsupport for those schools.\n  Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to look at what the record has \nbeen on this issue. It has been developed. It is not new.\n  I have great respect for what private and parochial schools do. They \nmake a significant contribution. But the idea somehow we are going to \nfund two school systems in America is unrealistic. We do not do a very \ngood job at the one we have. The idea somehow we are going to \nunderwrite two is terribly naive and detracts from the resource \nallocation we need in order to try to make those schools that are in \ntrouble receive the kind of support they ought to be getting.\n  For those reasons, I urge our colleagues to reject the Gregg \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am concerned by some of the major \ndistortions of fact that have occurred during today's debate. Some \nSenators have erroneously cited polling data to buoy their claims that \na majority of Americans support school vouchers. A closer look at some \nrecent trends show otherwise.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues cite a National Education \nAssociation poll suggesting that 63 percent of Americans favor voucher \nprograms. That is just plain wrong. In fact, that poll demonstrated \nthat 63 percent of Americans favor public school choice--not voucher \nprograms. There is a huge distinction there, and I am surprised that my \ncolleagues are not a little more cautious in discussing these two very \nseparate ideas. As we all know, public school choice allows students \nand parents the opportunity to participate in charter schools, magnet \nschools or even just another public school in the same district. Public \nschool choice does not involve private schools at all. I should also \npoint out that public school choice has been strongly endorsed in this \nbill, and I congratulate the many hands who helped shape this \nlegislation to include a provision that support public school choice \nprograms.\n  In the 2000 election, two States overwhelmingly rejected referendums \non funding voucher programs. Californians rejected vouchers by 71-29 \npercent, while Michigan voters rejected vouchers by 69-31. Since some \nof my colleagues raised race as an issue in this debate, I would also \nadd that minorities in both States rejected vouchers in numbers that \nfar exceed the aggregate State totals. Wolverine State African \nAmericans, for example, voted against the voucher referendum by a \nmargin of 3-1.\n  The much-heralded Milwaukee voucher program has also recently come \nunder scrutiny. Students participating in the public school's SAGE \nprogram--which includes smaller class sizes, rigorous curriculum and \nassessment, access to after school programs and increased professional \ndevelopment--have tested better than kids in voucher programs.\n  So with those points made, I would like to address a couple of other \narguments that have been made this morning. Even as proponents tell us \nthat vouchers improve public schools, reality tells us otherwise. The \nMilwaukee and Cleveland voucher programs--which cost $29 million and $9 \nmillion, respectively--do not cover the complete cost of private school \ntuition for the relatively few students served by the programs. Private \nschools can also reduce their budgets by not offering health services, \nbreakfast and lunch programs, counselors, or services to special needs \nstudents. For less than the cost of either voucher program, other \nprograms, such as the Success for All program, could be implemented in \ncity public schools, thereby benefiting all children in the school \ndistrict.\n  Voucher programs create the potential for discrimination. Awarding a\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nvoucher to a family does not guarantee that the student will be \naccepted into a private school. While Milwaukee schools may not \ndiscriminate against disabled students, there is no requirement that \nthey provide special education services. Likewise, private schools are \nnot required to provide needed services to low-English proficient \nstudents or chronically disruptive students.\n  Finally, I take issue with colleagues who cry for accountability in \nour public schools, then blithely support voucher programs. I believe \nthat our schools absolutely must be accountable for their students. But \nthe enduring legacies of the Cleveland voucher experiment may well be \nbad budgeting and misspent funds rather than better results for \nstudents. A 1997 independent financial audit found that $1.9 million \nhad been misspent, including $1.4 million paid to taxi companies \ntransporting students to voucher schools. Since 1997, program officials \nhave uncovered more than $400,000 in taxi fares were billed on days \nwhen the students in question were absent.\n  Worse even than the taxi fiasco, in 1998, the program ran 41 percent \nover budget, forcing the State of Ohio to take $2.9 million from public \nschool funds to cover the overruns. That is $3 million coming out of \nthe State public school coffers to fund a program that, like today's \namendment, was not supposed to ``take money out of the public \nschools.''\n  No one wants to improve schools in the poorest parts of America more \nthan I do. But voucher programs are not the way to accomplish this very \nworthwhile goal. We simply do not have the resources to spend millions \nof dollars on a few students at the expense of the 90 percent of \nAmerican children who attend public schools. So I urge my colleagues to \nreject this amendment and instead to support greater investment in our \npublic schools.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I warmly endorse the comments of the \nsenior Senator from Connecticut. As always, he is spot on with his \nanalysis, and his point with regard to the Gregg amendment, which I \nstrongly oppose, is exactly where I think we should come out.\n  Although I commend the author and supporters of the amendment for \ntheir concern about low-performing schools, I believe this amendment is \nmisguided because it would undermine the public education system that \nis the very tie that binds our society.\n  I encourage the authors to show their passion to improve our poor-\nperforming public schools by fully resourcing those proven initiatives \nthat will change failed schools.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of our children attend public schools. As \nour Nation becomes increasingly diverse--my State, in particular, is \nblessed with incredible diversity--our public schools continue their \nfundamental purpose of uniting Americans while providing every child \nwith the opportunity to succeed. That must be our mission--our passion. \nThe availability of quality public education for all is defining to \nAmerica's democracy.\n  If we adopt this vouchers measure, we would drain limited resources \nfrom our public schools and send a signal that we are prepared to erode \nthe historical purpose and position of public education in America.\n  Much of the debate around vouchers is about choice. But the choice \ninherent in any vouchers proposal is false, meaningless choice.\n  Contrary to the rhetoric, vouchers would not ensure parental choice, \nbecause private schools can and do reject applicants for private \nreasons--including disability or language skills.\n  In fact, the only real choice vouchers will create is in the hands of \nthe private schools.\n  That means that a child with limited English proficiency--let's keep \nin mind that there are over 4.1 million of such children in our \nschools--would not have a meaningful choice. That means that a child \nwith learning disabilities wouldn't really have a meaningful choice. \nThese children with unique educational needs--who most need the promise \nof a quality education--would often be left behind in schools we deem \nto be failing.\n  Vouchers are also a false choice because the amount being offered is \ntoo little to be meaningful. How many families, making $32,000 or less, \nactually have the additional funds to allow them to take advantage of \nvouchers. What is the practical reality here?\n  In addition to vouchers setting up a false choice, vouchers provide \nno accountability. Now, I have been listening to much of the debate on \nthis education bill, and one of the main themes has been about \naccountability. I support accountability. As a former businessman, I \nappreciate the importance of monitoring the success or failure of our \ninvestments.\n  But this voucher proposal provides no accountability. Under the \nproposal, we would divert critical public resources without any public \noversight. This proposal would thus undermine the progress we are \nmaking towards increased accountability.\n  The incredible fact in this debate is that the evidence does not show \nthat vouchers work. Experiments have shown that vouchers do not help \nimprove student achievement. A University of Wisconsin-Madison \nprofessor found that there were no achievement differences between \nvoucher student and comparable Milwaukee public school students.\n  Princeton University Professor Cecilia Rouse found that students in a \nspecial Milwaukee program that used extra resources to reduce class \nsizes outperformed both regular public school students as well as \nvoucher students in both reading and math.\n  The evidence also shows that vouchers do not reach the students most \nin need. Finally, they do nothing to help the public schools that are \nleft behind to educate the vast majority of our children.\n  We are unfortunately operating in a time of limited resources. More \nlimited now that we have made the choices we've taken on the recent tax \ncut.\n  We are underfunding title I, the critical engine of reform for our \nlow-income school districts. Two-thirds of the eligible kids are left \nout. Similarly, we have been shirking the Federal Government's \nresponsibility in fully funding IDEA, education for the disabled.\n  Just when we should be putting increased resources in our public \nschools--so that our reform efforts can be meaningful, and so that we \ncan ensure that the children who need our help the most, get our help--\nwe should not be siphoning critical funds to fund vouchers. If we want \nto reform schools, we need to provide those schools with real \nresources, not deprive them.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric lately about the need to ensure that \nno child is left behind, and about the need for school reform. But we \nmust put our money where our mouth is, because reform without resources \nis a charade.\n  Even though supporters will argue that this proposal would not take \naway funding from the title I program, any money spent on vouchers is \nmoney that could and should be used to bolster our public schools.\n  We know what works. A good teacher in every class is the most \nimportant single factor in the quality of a child's education. We can \ndo everything else right, but if we don't have good teachers, the \neducational system just won't work. That's why it is critically \nimportant that we provide real resources to attract and retain quality \nteachers, and to help teachers develop their skills.\n  We also know that smaller class sizes work. It's abundantly clear \nthat smaller classes are better for children, and we've started to make \nprogress in recent years. But we have not gone far enough. In my view, \nthat's a serious mistake.\n  We also know that our children must go to school in safe modern \nschool buildings, and that's why I have been fighting to modernize our \nschools.\n  In sum, there is no evidence that vouchers work. They do not provide \na meaningful choice to families who struggle to ensure that their \nchildren receive a quality education.\n  And by diverting funds we undermine our other reform efforts and put \nat risk those who remain in our public system.\n  We should not give up on our public schools. I urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania 8 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire.\n  I have listened to the remarks and to the complaints of those who are \ngoing to vote against this amendment. First, they say it is not going \nto work; that the only program out there that is in fact in place right \nnow is Milwaukee. Yet the superintendent of the Milwaukee school \ndistricts has come to Washington, DC, over the past few months and \npleaded for us to pass this proposal because he and the poor people of \nMilwaukee whose children don't have an opportunity to get a good \nquality education in the existing school system want this program. It \nis the ultimate accountability.\n  We don't have accountability. When you have the dollars and you can \ntake them to this school or to that school, that is accountability. \nThere is no accountability in the public system because there is no \nchoice in the public system. Your child is trapped in the school if you \nhave low income. The child is trapped in the school to which they are \ndesignated to go. Therefore, accountability is just simply a check \nsheet that you have to fill out for some government bureaucracy. But \nthere is no accountability to the consumer of the product. Isn't that \nwhat we are talking about? The consumer is the child.\n  We worry so much and talk so much. By the way, I know people are \nconcerned about the money. This bill under consideration, to my \nunderstanding, increases the amount of money we are going to spend on \neducation by over 100 percent. To suggest somehow or another that we \nhave been parsimonious with the money we are throwing around here for \neducation is somewhat disingenuous. Hundreds of billions of dollars are \nbeing authorized for this legislation. We are looking at $50 million \nfor a pilot program.\n  What are people afraid of? Are you afraid this program will actually \nwork? And if it does, it makes these hundreds of billions of dollars we \nare spending look as if we didn't know what we were doing. Are you \nafraid that it won't work and that there are some children right now \nwho are getting a poor education who will continue to get a poor \neducation?\n  There is no down side for these people. They are saying, if it \ndoesn't work, we are no worse off than we are today. If you as the \nmother or father of a child in a poor school district want to give your \nchild a chance, at least you are giving them hope of improving their \nsituation. Hope is a powerful motivator. What are we afraid of? What \nare we afraid of?\n  Hundreds of billions of dollars are being pumped into our educational \ninstitutions through this bill, and we are running for the hills \nbecause there is $50 million for pilot programs that only go into \neffect if the Governor and the people in the local community want it.\n  Let me underline that again. There is not a Federal mandate on any \nState. There is not a Federal mandate on any school. This says, if you \nare a Governor and you want to work with your cities--principally there \nare going to be cities that are underperforming and leaving children \nbehind--we are going to give you a chance, with some Federal dollars, \nfor you and the school district to innovate and to do something very \ndifferent that might change a child's life.\n  We talk about leaving children behind. The Senator from Connecticut \nsaid we cannot afford to have any child be a loser. You make the \nassumption that there are no losers in the current system. Let me \nassure you that we have lots of losers when it comes to having the \nopportunity to get a good education in this country. Lots of children \nare losing out on the opportunity to get a good education in this \ncountry.\n  For us to say we are not going to give caring Governors, caring \nsuperintendents, school boards, and parents the choice of doing \nsomething different for children who are right now losing out because \nof fear that it might work--let me get to the bottom line--isn't that \nwhat it is all about? Aren't we really afraid this might work? Because \nif we are afraid it is going to fail, that child who is losing under \nthe current system right now is going to be no worse off.\n  Aren't we really afraid of success here? What we have been talking \nabout--these glorious proclamations we have made about how we are going \nto improve the quality of schools and change the system and how we are \ngoing to be the savior of education--can all come down to the fact that \nwe just haven't been giving the right incentives to parents and kids to \nget the kind of education they want, that we haven't upgraded a system \nthat has ultimate accountability.\n  The ultimate accountability is that you can walk with your money. \nIsn't that what we are afraid of? I think it is. I think it is a great \nfear of giving up control.\n  The big problem is my life; I don't want to give up control. I want \ncontrol over every aspect of my life. One of the things I have found is \nthat sometimes, by giving up control, wonderful things can happen. \nWhether it is the State, whether it is the local school board, or \nwhether it is the Federal Government, we want control of every little \naspect, all the way down to making sure we have our hands in \neverything, and to make sure everything is run right. We control all of \nit. We feel good because we are doing something about it.\n  But I think all of us know in our own lives that when we try to \nmicromanage control, everything gets screwed up, particularly when you \nare doing it from Washington, DC, in every little city and school \ndistrict.\n  We are talking about a child here. We are not talking about children. \nIt is wonderful to talk about children. I am talking about a child, \nbecause you know that if you are a mother sending a child to a poor \nschool, you are worried about that child.\n  What does this have to do with my child and my child's education? I \ndon't care whether you are controlling all of this. All I want is to \ngive my child a chance. That is what this bill does. This amendment \ngives my child--mine--a chance--not children, my child.\n  We are afraid of that. We are afraid to give parents the chance to \ncare for my child. We want to care for children because we know best--\nbecause, of course, we are smarter than all the people who worry about \ntheir child. We know best. So we are going to dictate to you every step \nof the way as to where the billions of dollars go; $50 million for a \nlittle pilot project that says we are going to give you the ability to \ntake care of your child; we are going to give up control of your child; \nthey say: Oh, no, we cannot do that. It is too risky. There might be a \nloser out there somewhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the 8 minutes yielded to \nhim.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask the question finally: \nWhat are we afraid of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis strong and very effective statement in support of this amendment. I \nappreciate it.\n  I understand Senator Kennedy is going to close on his side, and I am \ngoing to close on my side, and we will be ready to vote. My closing \nwill be a little shorter than his closing because I have no more time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, I have 6 remaining \nminutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair to remind me when I have 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. President, I think we have had a good debate and discussion, and \nperhaps the best presentations of differing views on this matter during \nthe last several hours.\n  I want to summarize the reasons I am strongly opposed to this \namendment. We are talking about scarce resources. The case is made that \nthis really isn't money that is going to be used for education. That \ndoesn't really stand. I think most of us who are opposed to this \namendment believe that if we have public money, we ought to invest it \nin the areas where public school children can benefit.\n  The theme of this legislation is to try to take tried and tested \nideas and to make them available to the local communities and give \nthose ideas that\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nhave been tried and tested some additional incentives with financial \nsupport in order to enable the most challenged children and the \nneediest children in our society to make progress.\n  We are committed to it. This legislation is to use tried and tested \ntechniques in order to enhance that possibility. I think over the \nperiod of this debate we have demonstrated that these voucher programs \nthat have been tried, whether it was in Milwaukee, Cleveland, or other \ncommunities, have not really provided effective enhancement of the \nchildren's ability to learn.\n  Now, just finally, I have listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nThis isn't about a child's choice. We have to understand this. The \nvoucher issue isn't about the choice of a child. It is the choice for \nthe school. That is a major difference.\n  To try to represent to families all over this country that if this \namendment is adopted, and their child is caught in a particular school, \nthat parent will be able to take that child out and go to another \nschool is wrong. That child's school will make a determination based \nupon their own considerations whether to admit that child.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is going to modify his amendment to \nmake sure children who have some disability or special needs will be \nable to be included, and that children can be selected on the basis of \nlottery. Still, it will be up to the school, but that is certainly an \nimprovement.\n  Let me read from the Department of Education's study about the \nprivate schools and accepting students with special needs:\n\n       A policy of random assignment could mean that participating \n     schools would accept any student who was assigned, including \n     students with learning disabilities, limited English \n     proficiency, or low achievement. However, when the private \n     schools were asked specifically about a transfer program that \n     would require participating private schools to accept such \n     students, their interest in participating declined further. \n     Under this circumstance, only 15 percent of the schools said \n     they would be definitely or probably willing to participate. \n     . . .\n\n  There is the answer. Fifteen percent are willing to take children who \nhave some kind of special needs.\n  Secondly, in this report, in relation to participation in State \nassessments, 42 percent of the schools said they would be unwilling to \nparticipate.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       Permit exemptions from religious instruction or activities. \n     Very few religious schools would be willing to participate in \n     a transfer program if they were required to permit exemptions \n     from religious instruction or activities. Eighty-six percent \n     of the religious schools are unwilling to participate under \n     this condition.\n\n  There is no provision for that in the Gregg amendment, absolutely \nnone. If a child is admitted, finally, on a lottery provision and goes \nto a particular school, they are going to have to attend the religious \nceremonies in that school. At least 86 percent of the schools will \nrequire it.\n  Milwaukee did not do it. They had a provision that excused it. Not in \nthe Gregg amendment. This is not well thought through. The Senator says \nthat hard-pressed parent out there, that single mom, is going to have a \nchoice. That is baloney. That is not true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The school is going to make the decision. It is going to \nbe as true as I am standing here, that if that child has special needs, \nthere is no sense in applying; if that child has limited English, there \nis no sense in applying; if that child is a homeless child, there is no \nsense in applying. That is the record. That is why we should reject \nthis amendment.\n  Let's take scarce resources and invest them where they should be \ninvested; and that is in tried and tested programs that will enhance \nthe children's academic achievement in the public schools of this \ncountry.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 14\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Tried and tested programs, that is a fairly unique way to \ndescribe a program that has left literally hundreds of thousands of \nchildren behind. The average low-income child in this country today, in \na fourth grade class, reads at two grade levels less than their peers. \nOnly half of those kids even graduate from their high school. They have \nbeen left behind. That is the whole point. That is why parents in \ninner-city schools want to have the opportunity to have some options.\n  That is why when the Children's Scholarship Fund put up some money \nand asked if there was anybody out there who wanted to go to a \ndifferent school, you had literally thousands, actually 1.3 million \nchildren applying for those 40,000 slots which were limited to low-\nincome kids.\n  That is why the Milwaukee school system has found it to be so \nsuccessful. That is why Florida has found it to be so successful. \nBecause it is the low-income children--specifically, the children of \nparents who in many instances are single moms--who have been locked \ninto schools that have failed year after year after year, who have no \noptions because the schools will not improve. No matter how much money \nwe put into the schools, they simply will not improve. That is why \nthose parents want another opportunity.\n  Let me read from a couple of statements made by some of these \nparents. We have Carol Butts, from the Milwaukee schools:\n\n       When my daughter Evan finished fifth grade in the Milwaukee \n     public school system, she could not multiply; she couldn't \n     even write. Our family has limited income, so we didn't have \n     too many choices. When I learned about the Milwaukee Parental \n     Choice Program, I was ecstatic. In two years there, her \n     school work has really improved.\n\n  These are specific cases.\n  Tracy Richardson:\n\n       I first looked at three public school options. Classes were \n     unruly. A magnet public school was better, but there was a \n     waiting list. . . . I ended up using the A+ program to choose \n     Montessori Elementary School. It has improved my child's \n     learning immensely.\n\n  Tony Higgins:\n\n       The Milwaukee program let me choose schools that I think \n     are best for my girls. I believe both of them will have a \n     choice to go on to college because of the voucher program.\n\n  These are real people who were locked into inner-city schools who did \nnot have the option for education that those folks who have more money \nhave, who were seeing their kids left behind. All they wanted for their \nchildren was a decent education. So through choice programs, in \nMilwaukee, Ohio, and Florida, a few parents have had that opportunity.\n  This idea that choice does not work is just a lot of hokum. It is a \nstraw dog. A study by Kim Metcalf at Indiana University, the official \nevaluation of the Cleveland program in Ohio, found statistically \nsignificant gains in the test scores of students who were on vouchers. \nA study by Jay Greene and Paul Peterson found statistically significant \nmath and reading score gains in the Milwaukee school voucher system. A \nstudy by a Princeton group found quite large statistically significant \nmath gains for the Milwaukee Choice Program. Study after study has \nproven these programs work.\n  The idea that the other side has promoted, which is totally elitist, \nwhich is the problem, of course--opposition to the concept of choice is \nelitist by definition--is that we know best for parents--these parents \nwhose children are locked in these schools and want to get out, we know \nbest for them.\n  How outrageous that we stand in this Senate Chamber and do not give \nparents an option to allow their children to compete for the American \ndream.\n  The niece of Dr. Martin Luther King had it right. This is a civil \nright that we are talking about. The right to have a decent education \nis a civil right. When we year after year after year put children in \nschools that fail, we deny them that civil right.\n  This amendment is very simple. It is very small. It is very focused. \nTen school districts across the country get the opportunity to \nparticipate, if they wish. Then the only parents who can participate \nare parents of families with $32,000 of income or less who are actually \nhaving their kids attend schools where for 3 years those schools have \nbeen defined as ``failing.'' And then, in order to protect the system \nmore and assure fairness, we say the students who go to the private \nschools will be chosen by lottery. So there isn't any creaming or any \nattempt to skew the system.\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\n  In addition, we have language in this amendment that specifically \nsays there can be no discrimination. That has been a straw dog that has \nbeen put up on the other side that if anybody bothered to read the \namendment they would have seen did not apply.\n  Then we put in very tough evaluation standards to see whether or not \nthe system works, to see whether or not private school choice works.\n  So what is there to fear from the other side? What is it that they \nfear? I think the Senator from Pennsylvania had it right. They fear \nthat parents may actually choose to send their kids to a private school \nand that that may actually produce children who are actually \ncompetitive academically and who have a shot at the American dream, and \nit may--and this is what is really feared--put pressure on the public \nschool system to change. It may threaten those unions which for years \nhave told us that mediocrity works; that if we dumb down, it is \nacceptable; that we can have failed schools as long as we pay a union \nwage.\n  They fear this may actually disrupt the public school system. Should \nwe not disrupt the public school system where year after year the \nschools have failed? Of course, we should. We should improve it. The \nway you improve it is to bring competition into the system, which is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  I go back to my experience as a child when I saw that elected \nofficial, the Governor of a State in our country, standing in the \ndoorway of a school in Arkansas, I believe, unfortunately. I know my \ncolleague from Arkansas opposed that aggressively and is glad that it \nis no longer the situation there. When that Governor stood in the door \nof that school and the Army had to come to allow a child to go into the \nschool, that was an imprint on my youth. That is one of those visual \nthings one remembers. I just couldn't understand how that could happen \nin our country, how somebody could block a child from going to school.\n  What is happening today is there are people standing in the school \ndoor of failed schools, of schools filled with drugs and violence, \nschools where they do not teach, schools where children from year to \nyear shuffle from classroom to classroom and cannot learn and are not \nallowed to learn and who, therefore, cannot participate in the American \ndream. We have people in this Congress standing in the doorway, \nblocking that doorway from allowing those children to leave that school \nand go across the street and participate in a school where they will \nlearn and have the opportunity to participate in the American dream. It \nis an irony which has to disappoint us all.\n  Choice, portability, vouchers, to use the pejorative term, what is it \nall about? It is all about one thing: It is about children, giving \nAmerica's children an opportunity to learn. It is especially about low-\nincome children, locked in the inner city, whose only way out of their \nsituation is education. When we deny them this choice, we deny them the \nopportunity to participate in the American dream.\n  That is not right and it is not fair. This minor exercise, in the \nsense of funding and in the sense of scope, should not be viewed with \nsuch antipathy from the other side. Rather, it should be viewed as an \nopportunity to see whether or not the arguments they make so \naggressively are valid. If they have the courage of their position, \nthey should allow this demonstration program to go forward because they \nwill prove that it fails. In any event, they will have spent $50 \nmillion on at least improving a few children's opportunities to learn.\n  I can't understand why it is opposed, but I can understand this: If \nwe do not get on the path of correcting these failing schools, and we \ndo not get on the path of giving children in those schools options to \nlearn in an environment which is conducive to learning, then we will \nlose another generation. As a nation, we can't afford that.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will be accepted, and I look \nforward to the vote.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 536, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me begin by extending my appreciation to Senator Gregg and a \nnumber of our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, for joining \nme in offering this amendment today.\n  Over the course of the last several weeks, we have found considerable \ncommon ground as we seek to redefine the role of the Federal Government \nin education. We believe we need to invest, at the Federal level, more \nresources, but in programs that work. We agree on the need to give that \nmoney to schools and school districts from the Federal Government more \nflexibly. We agree if we are going to provide more resources, and if we \nare going to provide those dollars more flexibly, we should demand \nresults there should be accountability. Finally, we all agree on the \nneed to impart to parents the ability to make choices about the schools \ntheir children attend.\n  In the 50 States, all but one have adopted rigorous standards about \nwhat they expect their students to know and do. In more than half the \nStates of our country this past school year, tests were given to \nmeasure student progress toward their State standards in subjects such \nas math and science and English and social studies. States throughout \nAmerica have wrestled with consequences, with accountability systems. \nHow do we hold schools accountable, school districts accountable, \nparents accountable, and politicians as well? We have wrestled with \nthose questions in Delaware. I know we are wrestling with them in all \n50 States.\n  The bill we are working on, as it has been modified to date, has some \nimportant elements I want us to address with this amendment. I hope in \noffering this amendment we will make this bill better. I think there is \na need for the changes we are offering in this amendment.\n  Under the legislation that has been modified to date and that stands \nbefore us today, we call on States to set their academic standards. For \nthe most part they have done that. We call on States to prepare tests--\nsome have prepared tests to measure student progress, but in this case \nwe are calling on States to prepare tests to measure student progress \non an annual basis from the third to eighth grade. We are calling on \nStates to decide at what level they expect all of their students to \nperform roughly 10 years out.\n  In each of the next 10 years, we are asking them to spell out the \nbenchmarks, the performance levels at which they expect their students \nto be able to perform, in year 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, out to the 10th \nyear.\n  There are consequences for schools where students do not meet the \nbenchmarks, the improvement that the States themselves agreed on for \ntheir own schools. For failing schools--schools that fail to meet their \nannual progress improvement goals--the consequence is not great in the \nfirst year. They will receive technical assistance--more help. I think \nthat is appropriate.\n  The second year a school fails to meet the annual improvement goals \nfor their students, more technical assistance is provided, but there \nare some additional consequences as well.\n  By the time we get to year 4, for a school that has continued failing \n4 years in a row, meaning their students have not met the benchmarks \nset by their school, set by their State, the consequences become more \nsevere. Let me mention a few of them.\n  First of all, the school district in which that school has failed 4 \nyears in a row must offer public school choice, must provide the \ntransportation for students to go from a failing school to a school \nthat is not failing. In addition, the school district is faced with one \nof a limited number of options for addressing what to do with that \nfailing school. One of those options is to turn the school over to the \nState to run. Another option is to disband the school with respect to \nexisting faculty and administration and start all over. A third option \nwill be to turn the school over to a private sector enterprise, a \nprivate entity, to run the school. And a fourth option is to mandate \nthat the school be transformed and turned into a charter school.\n  Personally, I hope by the end of year 4 there are not any schools \nthat are failing in this country. But I think that may be the triumph \nof man's hope over experience. We have tens of thousands of schools. We \nhave thousands of school districts across America. There are going to \nbe schools that do not meet the standards, the benchmarks set by their \nown States--in some cases, 4 years in a row. What do we do within the \nFederal Government to help nurture, to foster, to ease that transition \nto public school choice in those schools that have failed 4 years in a \nrow?\n  I think Delaware was the first State to implement public school \nchoice statewide. We did so to inject market forces into our public \nschools by saying to parents that if your child's school is failing to \nmeet your expectations for your child, you have the option to go to a \nvariety of other schools, and the State will pay for the \ntransportation. It makes for wonderful change, for good change, and for \na positive change as we introduce elements of competition into public \neducation.\n  Unfortunately, if you look at what we are offering within the Federal \nGovernment to assist, to nurture, to encourage, and to help ease that \ntransition from traditional public schools to maybe statewide public \nschool choice, we do precious little.\n  The amendment I offer today with Senator Gregg and others says that \nwe ought to do a good deal more. In this amendment, we do.\n  The second question I want to ask rhetorically is, If we say in this \nlegislation before us today that after 4 years of failure we have to do \nsomething with that failing school-- one of the options is to turn it \ninto a charter school--what do we do to help make sure that folks who \nwant a charter school might have some ability to succeed in starting a \ncharter school? How do we help them?\n  Under current law, we do a couple of things. Under current law, there \nis a basic charter school planning and development grant. It does not \naddress brick and mortar, but it helps people who have an idea they \nwould like to start a charter school and are not sure how to do it. It \nsupports technical resource centers and clearinghouses that help point \nto what is working in other places to start charter schools; but with \nrespect to brick and mortar, to help with the biggest challenge \ninvolved in starting up a charter school: Where are we going to have \nthe school? How are we going to pay for building the school? How are \ngoing to take over an existing building and refurbish it for our \nschool? It is a huge challenge in my State and every other State. There \nare 36 States that now have charter schools. But current law doesn't \nhelp much in that regard. We help very little in terms of the money \nthat we appropriate. In the current fiscal year 2001 Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, there is a $25 million grant to public entities \nand private entities that are engaged in providing credit enhancement \nto help provide space for charter schools. That help might come in the \nform of loan guarantees. It might come in the form of subsidized loans. \nIt is $25 million.\n  The amendment before us today says that we ought to grow both of \nthese approaches. In the first case, instead of providing $25 million--\nthe program is currently authorized at $100 million--why don't we \nincrease the authorization to $200 million to provide the assistance \nthat charter schools really need to get started?\n  In the second case, we propose with our amendment to provide short-\nterm matching grants to States that will help these charter schools on \nthe brick and mortar side on the capital side.\n  Currently, in my State folks running a charter school and kids going \nto that charter school may receive operating money per student at that \nschool equal to the operating funds that go to students in other public \nschools. However, in those other public schools, if they want to \nrebuild the school, build a new school, or refurbish a school, the \nState of Delaware will sell tax-exempt bonds\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\nfor those public schools. The State of Delaware will pay anywhere from \n60 to 80 percent of the cost of the principal and interest on those \nbonds. If a charter school is trying to get started in my State on the \nbrick and mortar side, we don't do anything for them. We don't issue \ntax-exempt bonds, or even pay for 1 percent of their capital costs, \nmuch less 60 to 80 percent. If you look at the other 36 States, for the \nmost part, those States provide just about the same help to charter \nschools on the capital side as Delaware--does.\n\n  I don't think it is the role of the Federal Government to come in and \nmake up all of that difference. We can, as a Federal government, \nthrough loan guarantees and subsidized loans, encourage other public \nand nonpublic entities to assist in starting up charter schools and \npaying for the brick and mortar costs.\n  We can also provide incentives from my State and other States to \nprovide some capital costs and capital assistance for charter schools. \nWe will provide matching grants at the Federal level. We will not pay \nfor all of it, but we will provide matching grants to help States get \nthose charter schools started.\n  At the beginning of the debate I asked to modify the amendment. I did \nso because there are some tax consequences that are not appropriate to \nbe debated in the context of this bill because they are within the \npurview of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. I will mention them anyway. I will use my State as an \nexample because that is what I know best.\n  If the State of Delaware wants to help build public schools, we issue \ntax-exempt bonds. If a charter school wants to build a school for \nthemselves, they borrow money. The interest is not tax-free. A charter \nschool may be right alongside a traditional public school. The public \nschool gets tax-exempt bonds. Whoever loans the money to the charter \nschool has to pay taxes on the interest.\n  I don't think that is right or fair. I would like to change that. \nUnfortunately, we cannot do that today. We will try to come back and \naddress it in another venue with another vehicle.\n  For people who voted against the Gregg amendment on a demonstration \nfor vouchers, I understand it was a tough vote. But for people who \nweren't willing to experiment in that way with choice, I urge you to \nconsider this approach.\n  If you think public school choice can really help introduce market \nforces and competition into our public schools--other States are trying \nit--I urge you to vote for this amendment. If you think that we may be \nable to replicate the success of schools across America as we have done \nin Delaware--I urge you to vote for this amendment. The Presiding \nOfficer, in another role as First Lady, actually came to the very first \ncharter school we started in Delaware about 5 years ago. We were \npleased to welcome her there. We were trying to start a charter high \nschool. I say to the Presiding Officer that last year when the results \nwere counted for tests in reading, math, science, and so forth, the \nhigh school that did the best of all the public high schools in \nDelaware was the Wilmington charter school that she visited.\n  In my State, the only school out of almost 200 schools where every \nstudent who took the Delaware math test last year actually met or \nexceeded the State's math standards, believe it or not, is the school \nthat has the highest incidence of poverty in the State. Eighty-three \npercent of the kids at the East Side charter school receive free or \nreduced-price lunches. No other school in our State has an incidence of \npoverty such as that.\n  Those are only two examples of charter schools: one is a high school \nand another is K through 3. Charter schools are working well.\n  I hope we will say that the Federal Government should have an \nobligation. Under the accountability provisions of this legislation, I \nthink there is a real obligation to assist in pushing forward public \nschool choice and in making the transition from traditional public \nschools to charter schools. Maybe it is not easy, but it is something \nthat is doable.\n  I retain the balance of my time. I turn it over to my colleague, and \nagain say to Senator Gregg, thanks for joining in support of this \nlegislation and, in fact, for amending this legislation to help to make \nit better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from New Hampshire \nis recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 45 minutes, 42 \nseconds. The opposition still has 1 hour.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is not clear to me who controls the \ntime in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is entitled to \nopposition time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not claiming opposition time. I am in support of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is entitled to \ntime on the opposition side.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, would the Chair restate the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no request of the Chair.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Carper asked who was in opposition to this \namendment. Senator Kennedy was predisposed, working with his staff. \nSenator Kennedy is opposed to the amendment and would control the time.\n  I ask Senator Kennedy, is that right?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just for the purposes of this moment now.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire whatever time he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Madam President, I support the Senator from Delaware in his \namendment. I thank him for bringing it forward. The Senator, of course, \nserved as Governor of Delaware prior to coming to the Senate. He \nunderstands intimately the issues that are involved in education, as \nall Governors do, because it is the No. 1 issue with which most \nGovernors deal. Therefore, I think his amendment, which I am \nsupporting, is a reflection of a comprehensive understanding of the \nquestion of how we try to address the improvement of our school \nsystems.\n  I believe that those who have been exposed to the charter school \nmovement see in it the embryo of a way to move our school systems into \na phase of significant improvement.\n  Charter schools are being tried in a lot of States. In fact, they \nhave expanded dramatically across the country. I think we are now up to \nsome multiple thousand charter schools. They have caught on because \nthey make sense.\n  Essentially, what a charter school does is give a community which is \nunhappy with the way the public school system is working an \nopportunity, within the public school structure, to set up an \nindependent school, which is a public school but which is not subject \nto the restrictions that the public school system may put on the \ntraditional school in the community, thus creativity can and does occur \nwithin that charter school.\n  In fact, there are many instances of charter schools being cited as \nschools that have radically improved the educational services delivered \nto the communities, and to students in those communities.\n  I know, for example, that President Bush is fond of citing his \nexperience with a charter school in Houston. I have forgotten the name \nof the school, but I do recall vividly his discussion of it on the \ncampaign trail, especially when he was in New Hampshire, and his \nenthusiasm about the way this charter school had taken a low-income \nurban school district population, which basically did not have a very \ngood experience in the educational system, and turned it around so that \nit was now the leading school in the State in that age group.\n  That happens because charter schools are vibrant and exciting places. \nTo begin with, the people who start them are enthusiastic about \neducation. They want to make sure that children have an opportunity to \nlearn in a different climate. Therefore, they start these schools with \nthe energy that comes from a new expedience and desire to change and \nimprove the community, and especially the educational system.\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\n  They have a great track record. But they have run into some problems. \nWhat the Carper amendment does is essentially try to address, to the \nextent the Federal Government can participate in addressing this issue, \nsome of the concerns of these school systems. One of the biggest I \nthink--and one of the reasons I am excited about the amendment--is it \naddresses the capital needs of actually starting these schools. Even \nthough he has had to modify the amendment in order to avoid a technical \nproblem with the Ways and Means Committee on the House side--those who \nare familiar with the Ways and Means committee understand it is \nextremely territorial. I served on it and, I assure you, that is part \nof the character of the Ways and Means Committee--even with that \nadjustment, the amendment has in it initiatives which will allow \ncharter school construction costs to be alleviated, or participated in \nto some degree, through these new funds which will be available.\n\n  That is very important because one of the biggest problems you run \ninto with a charter school is not getting the talent, the people who \nwant to run it out getting the building into shape where it actually \ncan handle kids coming into the school system. So that, in my opinion, \nwill be a very positive impact of this amendment.\n  Also, I think it should be pointed out that this amendment assists in \nthe transportation activity, which is a critical part of the charter \nschool problem. A lot of parents want to send their kids to a charter \nschool, but they are low-income parents, and they do not have the \ncapacity to physically move their kids from their home to the school. \nThe school their child may be attending might be around the block, but \nit might be a school that simply isn't working and they may want their \nchild to go to a charter school. But that charter school may require a \nsignificant amount of transportation costs on a daily basis, which may \nsimply exceed the ability of a low-income parent to maintain. So this \namendment assists in that area.\n  It is also important for us to understand--at least I believe it is \nimportant for us to understand--the way you improve education is not by \na top-down approach. We in Washington do not have the answers. It is \nthat simple. The way you improve education is by allowing the creative \nminds of the educational community, and the parents, to step on to the \nplaying field of education and do what they think is best, do it with \naggressiveness and do it with imagination.\n  Charter schools are an example of that opportunity. We should not say \na charter school must be set up this way or must have this amount of \nprocedure. It is just the opposite. We should simply say: You have the \noption to take that charter school route, if you want. And if you \ndecide to go that way, we are going to help you by assisting you with \nthe dollar support which will work for your benefit, and allow the \nschool to be creative.\n  Some might argue: This is a new program or a significant increase in \na program. And with all the other new programs that have been put into \nthis bill, is it appropriate to create another program or add another \nsignificant amount of money into this bill. Obviously, I have \nreservations about that. I am concerned about the fact that this bill \nhas exploded in costs. The 10-year cost of this bill presently exceeds \nthe original cost of this bill by almost $200 billion.\n  But I think what we have to remember is that what this bill should be \ndoing is creating incentives for creative ideas and approaches. And \ncharter schools, as much as anything else that can occur in the \neducational community, will accomplish that goal.\n  In this bill money is being spent to promote programmatic activity \nthat is already in place and that maybe isn't working all that well or, \nif it is working all that well, maybe is tangential to dramatically \nincreasing the learning capacity of children.\n  Charter schools, on the other hand, are working and we know they will \nsignificantly impact the capacity of children to improve their \neducation, not only because the child who is in the charter school gets \na better education but because charter schools, by definition, put \npressure on the rest of the public school community within that city or \ntown or State to improve. So it is bringing competition into the public \nschool system using the public school system itself.\n  We just had an amendment to try to bring competition into the public \nschool system using the private school system. That was rejected. This \namendment stays within the context of the public school system and \nbrings competition into the system. As a result, in my opinion, it puts \nsignificant positive pressure on the other public schools to improve \ntheir product. And as a result, I think that is very positive.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he will yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I certainly will yield.\n  Mr. REID. I have spoken to Senator Kennedy, and Senator Kennedy is \nnot in opposition to this amendment. I want to make sure the Senator \nknows that prior to completing his remarks. So I do not know who is in \nopposition to the amendment. I guess the Senator from Delaware will \nfind out later. At this time we know of no one who is in opposition.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am sure the Senator from Delaware will be relieved to \nhear no one is in opposition to the amendment. I certainly am. That is \ngood news.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator wishes to speak on the amendment after you \nfinish.\n  Mr. GREGG. With that good news, I will curtail my statement and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might use \non the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the pending amendment addresses two \nimportant growing policy areas: Public school choice and public charter \nschools. First, the amendment provides grant support to States seeking \nintra- and inter-district public school choice plans. That is very \nimportant, given where we are in other provisions of the bill. Second, \nthe pending amendment provides specific assistance to charter schools \nstruggling with capital school construction needs. That is going to be \nvery important, given the provisions of the bill that will require \nschools to restructure and reorganize if they fail to meet certain \ngoals.\n\n  I support public school choice. Our legislation already provides \nparents of children in low-performing schools the option to transfer to \nother public schools or charter schools. But public school choice \nprograms bring added costs that come with, most significantly, added \ntransportation needs. If we are truly to support public school choice, \nwe should provide the districts aid for their increased transportation \ncosts.\n  I also support charter schools. Like public school choice which can \nencourage districtwide improvement, charter schools can provide more \noptions to parents within the public school system. I think we should \ndo more to support the charter schools in the area in which they have \nthe greatest need--school construction.\n  Charter schools do not have the same capital resources that regular \npublic schools do. Charter schools cannot float tax-exempt bonds as \npublic school districts can. Charter schools primarily have new \nbuilding construction needs. Noncharter, public schools and public \nschool districts, on the other hand, primarily have building repair \nneeds. Just as there are charter schools with unique and urgent school \nrepair and construction needs, there are also regular public schools \nwith unique and urgent school repair and construction needs. We should \nalso provide school construction assistance to both charter schools and \nregular public schools.\n  That is the difficulty I find in the logic of my friends who opposed \nthe Harkin proposal in terms of providing help to meet the construction \nneeds in our public school system, a best estimate of over $130 billion \nin needs. We recognize the importance of having a facility that is \ngoing to be safe for children and that is also going to be responsive \nto the children's needs in terms of a modern classroom. I know Senator \nHarkin has made the case, and Senator Feinstein and others, of the \nimportance of giving assistance to local communities. They are not \nrequired to take that help, but when you\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\nrealize the age of many of our school facilities, particularly in many \nof the older cities of the country, as well as in many of the rural \nareas, you know there is an extraordinary need.\n  What is so apparent is that children attending schools which are in \ndilapidated condition sends a very powerful message to the students. On \nthe one hand, they go to modern supermarkets and modern malls and they \nsee what investments in these kinds of facilities would mean. They are \nvalued by their parents or their grownups. Then on the other hand, \nparents are sending children off to schools which are dilapidated, \nwhich are in need of repair, where in many instances the electrical \nsystems aren't working or their air-conditioning is not working, the \nwindows are not repaired.\n  I am supporting this proposal, but it is important to wonder why we \nin the Senate, if we are going to provide this kind of help for the \nconstruction of charter schools, are not providing assistance to the \npublic schools. I find it difficult to understand the response in this \narea by many of our colleagues on this side of the aisle, their \ntraditional argument that this is a local responsibility. The fact is, \nwe are trying to find ways of creating a climate where children can \nlearn. If we are not going to provide the classroom situation for that \nlearning process, we are not really meeting our responsibilities.\n  I am supporting this program, but I do think the need for school \nrenovation and modernization across the board is extraordinary. The \nNational Center on Education Statistics reports that nationwide more \nthan $127 billion is needed for public school construction, repair, and \nmodernization. The American Society of Engineers reports that average \nschool repair costs per child are $3,800.\n  All of the reforms included in the BEST Act will be dramatically \nundermined if we continue to send children to dilapidated, overcrowded, \nout-of-date schools. When we send children to inadequate, crumbling \nschools, we send them the message that they don't matter. What does it \nsay to a child when their classroom is a school bathroom, when windows \nare broken and roofs are leaking?\n  We should support public school and public charter school \nconstruction needs. We need to keep in mind that 97 percent of all \npublic school children go to noncharter schools. I continue to hold out \nhope that we will provide badly needed school construction assistance \nto regular public schools and public charter schools. Construction and \nmodernization needs are great across the board.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the pending amendment and hope we can \ncontinue to work in the future to support construction and \nmodernization needs nationwide.\n  There may be those who say we are not going to support it because we \nare not meeting our responsibility to public schools. There may be some \nof our colleagues who fall in that category. I would rather see us do \nwhat is right for children in meeting our responsibility on the public \nschool choice provisions which are included and also with regard to \ncharter schools.\n  My great regret about this amendment is that it is leaving out 97 \npercent of the public schools that ought to get help. This amendment is \na very modest amendment. It is a useful amendment. But for me it sort \nof fails to hit the mark in providing the assistance which is needed in \nthe area of construction.\n  I know we have to do the best we can. There was a broader kind of \namendment that was not accepted in the Senate. The Senator from \nDelaware has come up with a proposal to at least provide some \nconstruction funding in areas where there is need. Hopefully, as this \nwhole process moves ahead, we will find some opportunity to find a way \nof helping the other public schools in this country with their \nconstruction needs as well.\n  This amendment is useful. I hope it reminds us of the fact that we \nare not meeting our responsibilities in construction and assistance to \nother public schools and that we will continue to work in that area to \nhelp the children of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, let me express my thanks to the \nchairman, the Senator from Massachusetts, for his support and for his \nwords.\n  I have said on the floor before and I say it again today: We all \nacknowledge, the role of the Federal Government is not to run our \nschools, the role of the Federal Government is to try to level the \nplaying field at least a little bit for kids who come, in some cases, \nfrom hopelessly disadvantaged backgrounds. The appropriate role of the \nFederal Government is to help identify what is working to raise student \nachievement across the country.\n  An appropriate role for the Federal Government is, when we do \nidentify those things that are working, to encourage them. We nurture \nthose ideas. We try to share those ideas with others around the \ncountry.\n  I remember when I was Governor of Delaware, about 5 years ago we were \ndebating public school choice. I had just signed, as Governor, public \nschool choice into law. I remember overhearing a conversation between a \ncouple of school administrators. They didn't know I was listening, but \nI was.\n  I heard one administrator say to the other: If we don't offer parents \nwhat they want for their children in our public schools, their children \nwill go to another school where they are offering what they want for \ntheir children. I said to myself at the time: He's got it. Because in \nDelaware and other places where we have public school choice, \nparticularly when you provide help on the transportation side so that \nit is really meaningful, if a student in school A isn't getting what \nthey want or their parents want for them, they can go to school B. The \ntransportation is provided for, and the money follows the students.\n  That is a really important concept. The money follows the student. In \nour State, the State provides anywhere from $6,000 to $7,000 per \nstudent for their education. When one child goes from school A to \nschool B, the $6,000 or $7,000 follows that student. If one student \nmoves from school A to school B, not many people are going to take \nnotice of that. If 10 students move from school A to school B, that is \n10 times $6,000 or $7,000, which is $60,000 or $70,000. Maybe somebody \nwill notice that. If 100 students move from school A to school B \nbecause they are offering something school A is not offering, somebody \nis going to notice that certainly; they are certainly going to notice \nit in school A. The question they began to ask in my State was: What \nare they offering there that we are not offering? Maybe we ought to \noffer it as well.\n  It is the very best thing to come out of competition and out of the \nmarket forces we have introduced. Let me also add that I have always \nbelieved that the role of government, and particularly the Federal \nGovernment, in education is not to row the boat. The role of the \nFederal Government is maybe to help steer the boat. The Federal \nGovernment provides less than 10 percent of the resources for the \neducation of our children. States provide much more. In Delaware, it is \n70 percent. Nationally, I think it is about 50 percent. The rest comes \nfrom local property taxes.\n  But if we in this body, in this Capitol, in our role as the Federal \nGovernment--certainly the legislative side of it--if we can help \nidentify those things that work and if we can nurture them and help \nsteer and not row the boat, our kids, in a lot of places, with \nrelatively modest investments, are going to end up with a better \neducation and be better prepared to go on and face the world with the \nskills they will need to be successful in college and in work and in \nlife.\n  Senator Kennedy said this is a modest but useful amendment. I think \nit is going to prove even more useful than we dare to hope today. If it \nis adopted and ends up in the final bill that goes to the President, we \nwill have a chance to test that premise. I sincerely hope we do.\n  Again, to Senator Gregg, and to others who joined us in cosponsoring \nthe original bill which underlies the amendment, and this amendment \nitself, I express my thanks.\n  Madam President, I yield back whatever time remains and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have to determine if there is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Delaware has yielded back his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. All time is yielded \nback.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 518), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. This \namendment is related to other very important provisions in the \nlegislation to ensure there is going to be sufficient funds available. \nAlso in the legislation, there was going to be, with the reconstruction \nof these schools, the possibility of the development of these charter \nschools, and this will give additional flexibility to local communities \nto move in that direction.\n  So I thank him for offering the amendment. I believe it reaches sort \nof the central core of what we are attempting to do. I think it is \nvaluable and helpful. I wish it had been a little broader, but I thank \nthe Senator very much for offering it and for working closely with us \nto move the process along. I am grateful to him.\n  I am also grateful to my friend from New Hampshire, as always.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank my friend.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 505, 545 as modified, 520 as modified, 583, 561 as \n      modified, and 461 as modified, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today we are again in a position to \nclear amendments by consent. I ask, therefore, unanimous consent that \nit be in order for these amendments to be considered en bloc and that \nany modifications, where applicable, be agreed to, the amendments be \nagreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table \nen bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As part of the proposed unanimous consent agreement, I ask \nunanimous consent there be no second-degree amendments prior to the \nvote, which should be shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I raised this amendment a week or so ago. \nWe spoke on it on several different occasions. It was interrupted at \nvarious times, other amendments were offered, and this amendment was \nlaid aside.\n  I say to my colleagues, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Biden, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. This is an amendment \nthat was first offered in the other body by the distinguished Member of \nthe House, Congressman Chaka Fattah of Philadelphia.\n  This amendment is strongly endorsed by the Council of Great City \nSchools, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, National Education \nAssociation, the National PTA, a coalition of 180 national \norganizations including AARP, AFL-CIO, American Veterans Committee, \nCatholic Charities, Children's Defense Fund, the Congress of National \nBlack Churches, the League of Women Voters, the National Council of \nJewish Women, the National Council of La Rasa, the YWCA and YMCA, just \nto name some.\n  Chaka Fattah made an eloquent argument in the other body about the \nvalue of this amendment. Basically what it does is the following:\n  Since 1965, for 36 years, we have written into the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act language that says that in each school district \nin America there must be a comparable educational opportunity for every \nchild. For 36 years that has worked rather well. We improved \neducation--but there are still gaps in it. Nonetheless, 36 years ago we \nsaid for those school districts we believe that all children, \nregardless of their circumstances of birth, ought to have a comparable \neducation.\n  Some school districts have student populations vastly in excess of \nwhat some States have. The school districts of Los Angeles and New York \nindividually have school populations in excess of the student \npopulations in 27 States. Those school districts are highly diverse, in \nterms of the number of children from various economic backgrounds \nwithin those school districts.\n  My amendment says we ought to apply that same standard to the States. \nWhy do I say that? This bill asks that children do a better job, be \nmore accountable, be more responsive. To do that, we are going to \nrequire a test in this bill. The underlying bill says that every third, \nfourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grader is now going to have \nto take a test.\n  Prior to the adoption of this bill, we had mandates from the Federal \nGovernment that said there would be three tests in that age group. So \nwe have mandated that there be accountability already. We are not \nbreaking new ground. We are extending it.\n  Also in this bill we say the teachers need to be more accountable and \nmore responsive. We say school districts need to be accountable and \nmore responsive. We say parents do, school boards do. We say we, at the \nFederal level, need to be more responsible and demand greater \naccountability. The one missing element in this entire chain, from the \ninfant child in school to the Federal Government, where I have named \nvirtually everybody from the child to Uncle Sam--one element is missing \nin that litany. The one element is the States. There is nothing in this \nbill that requires that the States be accountable or that the States be \nresponsible.\n  Remember, title I was written 36 years ago because we thought, at the \nnational level, not enough was being done to serve the most needy \nchildren in America. That was the rationale behind the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--to provide Federal moneys to the States, to \nhelp them serve the most needy children.\n\n  Over the years we provided a lot of money, about 6 cents on every \ndollar. Madam President, 94 cents for educating children comes from \nStates and localities.\n  If we are going to demand greater accountability, and that students \ndo better in school, that there be higher standards that are to be met, \nhow do we exclude one of the elements here responsible for at least a \npart of that 94 cents? It is certainly more than the 6 cents the \nFederal Government supplies. Is it really that radical to say: Mr. \nGovernor or State education board, will you see to it, or work towards \nachieving comparability of educational opportunity within your State?\n  I am not mandating success. I don't think you ought to do that. We \ncannot do that. But to say to a child in Connecticut or a child in the \nState of Washington or New Hampshire or wherever else they may be, that \nbecause of the accident of where you are born, being born in that State \nshould not mean you can end up with an entirely different educational \nopportunity.\n  My bill says over the next 6 years--not right away--within 6 years, \nyou will write to the Secretary of Education, under this amendment, if \nit is adopted, providing assurance that you have such a plan and that \nyou have begun to implement it. And by the way, if 6 years is not long \nenough, I will give you 2 more under this amendment. That is 8 years.\n  If you do not do it, what happens? It is left to the discretion of \nthe Secretary to withhold some of the administrative funds under title \nI--not title I funds. The idea is to urge the States to join with us. \nMany States, Madam President, as you know and I know, are working hard \nat this already, just as most school districts are working hard, just \nas most parents are working hard, and most school boards are working \nhard. We are not demanding greater accountability in this bill of every \nschool district, parent, child, and teacher because we think they are \nall failing. We do not believe that. We believe some are.\n  I believe some States are not doing enough. If I can demand \naccountability and responsibility of a child, a parent, a teacher, a \nschool board, a school district, and the Federal Government, is it too \nmuch to ask that we seek at least an effort on the part of our States \nto improve the quality of educational opportunity?\n  I do not think I need to go back and lay out all the arguments. We \nall know the days of saying this ought to be exclusively, totally a \nlocal effort are gone. That may have had great value in the 19th or \nmost of the 20th century when our economic future and success depended \nupon a child from Connecticut competing with a child from New Hampshire \nor Massachusetts, or one from Illinois competing with someone in the \nState of Washington.\n  But we have entered a global economy. We better have a national \nvision when it comes to education and national standards. Leaving no \nchild behind means just that. That is why the President has raised this \nsubject matter with the priority he has.\n  The American public wants to see our public schools do better. The \nPresident said leave no child behind and he is enforcing this bill \nbecause he believes that by testing children, testing\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\nteachers, putting real stringent requirements on school districts, on \nparents and on ourselves, we are going to raise those standards. I did \nnot hear the word ``States'' there. That 94 cents that goes to the \neducation of a child, a substantial part of it comes from the States.\n  I know my State is working hard at this. We have had court cases \npending. I know the Governor and the State legislature work at this. I \nhave no problems whatsoever with States that are trying to get this job \ndone. But unfortunately, as I said a moment ago, there are \njurisdictions in this country which have not been as responsive or have \nnot been as accountable to the desire to see to it that all children \nwill be given an equal opportunity to succeed.\n  It has been 47 years since the Supreme Court of the United States, \njust across the street here, passed Brown v. Board of Education, almost \na half century ago. When they said separate and unequal schools can no \nlonger be permissible, it was almost a half century ago. There is not \none of us in this Chamber who does not know as a matter of fact, even \nin the States that are trying harder, that Brown v. Board of Education, \nthat 9-0 decision, has yet to provide the kind of relief of the \nproblems that too many of our children are facing. They are separate \nand they are in unequal educational opportunities. I do not care what \nState you go to, that is the case. Some States are working at it and \nsome are not.\n  Madam President, almost 50 years later I do not think it is too much \nto ask that State education authorities or our Governors should also be \nasked to join in this effort. We cannot do it without them. This is not \nsome peripheral organization here. This is about as critical as it \ngets. If we are going to be looking for better results and excluding \nthe States from stepping up to the plate and becoming a part of this \nassessment, then we are missing a major part of the equation necessary \nto achieve that success.\n  I do not point an accusing finger at any Governor, State agency, or \nboard.\n  We don't tell them how to do it. We don't lay out in some \nexcruciating detail of micromanaging how each State ought to try to \nachieve it. We don't say identical at all. We say comparable.\n  I know I will hear from my friend from New Hampshire suggesting that \nI am using a cookie cutter--that every jurisdiction within a given \nState is going to have to develop an identical plan. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. We are talking about comparability. The word \nwas chosen because it is in existing law. It has been there for almost \nfour decades--comparable educational opportunity at a district level. I \nam expanding the concept to include the States. We are expanding and \ndoing a lot of things new. The Federal Government is not new to having \nmandates. We shut off all Federal funds if States don't do a better job \non school violence. We mandate that there be testing done at the \nelementary level in America. We have done that for years. We are \nmandating that districts offer comparable education. These are all \nmandates. We are not breaking new ground by insisting that States join \nin this effort.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire said this is a deal breaker. What \ndeal breaker? We deal with this bill once every 6 years. How do you \nexclude the States? How do you go home and say to people we have done a \ngreat job here? We are going to see much better results.\n  By the way, a substantial portion of that 94 cents that goes to the \neducation of a child is going to be excluded from any accountability or \nany assessment, in effect.\n  It seems to me that if you are asking some impoverished school \ndistrict to do better, or some kid growing up in a ghetto or in a rural \npart of America to do better, you ought to try to provide the resources \nto achieve those goals. And you ought to have some measurement by which \nyou can judge whether or not everybody is pulling their fair share to \nsee to it that we get the best results possible.\n  That is all this amendment is designed to do--to just add one other \nword to district student, district teacher, school board, Federal \nGovernment: add the word ``State.'' However, you want to make it \naccountable, whether it is the educational authority, or the Governor, \nor whoever it is, whatever means you choose to try to achieve \ncomparability, that is up to each State. I don't believe the Federal \nGovernment ought to be telling States how to do that. It is not \nidentical. It is comparable.\n  As I have said, there are many school districts that embrace a great \ndiversity within their boundaries. They have lived with this law for 36 \nyears. Certainly, for school districts that have student populations in \nexcess of the populations in 27 States--more than half of the States in \nthis country--asking the States to step up and provide some assurance \nand at least making themselves open to the assessments that we ought to \nbe requiring, I don't think is too much.\n  I thank Chaka Fattah, the Congressional Black Caucus. La Rasa, the \nLatino/Hispanic group, places this at a very high priority. Chaka \nFattah said the other day that this is the No. 1 priority for the \nCongressional Black Caucus in their consideration of this bill. Again, \ngroups like the YMCA, YWCA, the Children's Defense Fund, American \nVeterans Committee, AARP--I give great credit to retirees for \nsupporting this effort--the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \nNational PTA, and the National Education Association are supporting \nthis amendment. I thank them for their support.\n  Again, it is 6 years down the road. This doesn't go into effect next \nmonth, or next year, or the year after, if this bill is passed. We are \nproviding more than half a decade for States to try it and at least get \nthemselves in a position to offer these assurances, and then a 2-year \nwaiver beyond that and penalties to be imposed by the Secretary only to \nadministrative funds and not to the title I funds that go to the needy \nchildren in this country.\n  Again, I hope our colleagues will see fit to support this amendment. \nI will be happy to yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I inquire of the Senator from \nConnecticut, after I speak, does the Senator want to go to a vote at \nthat time on his amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. I am prepared to at that point.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I will not try to say anything that is \nidentical to what I said yesterday or the day before or last week on \nthis issue.\n  Let me simply point out that this amendment, in my humble opinion, is \none of the most significant ones we are going to take up in that it \nreflects and makes one of the most significant attempts to have the \nFederal Government become intrusive in the school systems of our \ncountry.\n  The practical implications of this amendment are that the Federal \nGovernment will now require that every State and all its communities \nhave comparable educational systems. We went through in some length \ndebate on this amendment over a couple of days last week. But, \nessentially, that is a role that is inappropriate for the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government should not be telling the State, \nwhatever State it happens to be--Montana, Indiana, West Virginia, New \nHampshire, or Ohio--you must have a school system structured so that \nall your school systems are comparable; so that every school system in \nthe entire State must do essentially the same thing from school \ndistrict to school district in order to meet that comparability \nstandard.\n  There are States in this country that, either through court actions \ndealing with funding, such as New Hampshire, or through court actions \nmaybe dealing with something beyond funding. I am not familiar with any \nthat have gone beyond the funding issue that have determined there \nshould be comparability within the State. There are States which may \nhave--I don't know this--State legislators that have decided it is part \nof their State organizational structure for education that they want \ncomparability.\n  But I also know that there are a lot of States in this country that \nhave decided they do not necessarily want comparability because there \nare significant differences within that State between what one school \ndistrict needs to do in order to be a good school educational system \nand what another school needs to do in order to be a good educational \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\n  Those differences are reflected in the collective bargaining \nagreements between where you might have one part of the State with \ncollective bargaining agreements where teachers have introduced \nagreements where the teacher has a different workweek than another part \nof the State; or where the number of students for a classroom is \ndifferent in another part of the State; or the responsibility of \nteachers in extracurricular activities is different in another part of \nthe State; or you might have a school district where States have \ndecided that in one part of the State kids will be educated in a \ncertain technical skill area that is unique to that part of the State--\nsay forestry or farming--and in another part of the State that \ntechnical skill is not relevant because it is an urban part of the \nState; or you might have a school district in one part of the State \nthat believes it wants to focus on foreign languages; whereas, another \npart of the State wants to focus on technology skills versus foreign \nlanguages, so they restructured their structure, or you might even have \ndifferent schooldays. One may have a longer schoolday or a shorter \nschoolday.\n  Obviously, in the end, they probably have a State law requiring so \nmany schooldays or the way buildings are configured may be \nsignificantly different.\n  States have legitimate reasons because of the weather requirements in \na State. They may not want to have a comparable school system across \nthe State and still believe that they can deliver quality education. \nBut other States may decide they want comparability.\n  But it is truly the responsibility of the State to make that decision \nand not the Federal Government.\n  With the Federal Government to come in with 6 to 7 percent of the \ndollars spent on local elementary and secondary school education and \nsay we have the right to demand statewide comparability is incredibly \nintrusive. It opens the door to all sorts of issues that I think \nsignificantly expand the role of the Federal Government in an \ninappropriate way.\n  The logic of this amendment would be that the next step is entire \nschool systems across the country have to be comparable. Why stop at \nthe State border?\n  If you are going to say that every State has to have comparable \ndistricts why would you stop there? Wouldn't the next logical step be \nthe true nationalization of the school systems, saying that every State \nhas to have comparable educational systems? That would be an excessive \nreach of the Federal Government.\n  I believe this amendment, as has been characterized, clearly \nundermines fundamentally the agreement that was reached in negotiations \nas to the core elements of this bill. It is a dramatic departure from \nthe traditional role of the Federal Government, with an excessive \namount of intrusion by the Federal Government. For that reason, I \nstrongly oppose this amendment and hope it will be defeated.\n  I understand my colleague is going to ask for the yeas and nays and \nwe can go to a vote.\n  Mr. DODD. If I could take 1 minute, I have some remarks.\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will just respond a little bit. Then we \nwill go to the vote. I have a statement from Chaka Fattah. I will not \nread all of this, but I think the Congressman from Philadelphia makes a \nvery strong point. He says:\n\n       If students do not have comparable opportunities, they will \n     not have comparable results.\n       . . . There is no one anywhere who would say that rural and \n     urban school districts receive comparable resources with our \n     wealthier suburban districts; yet, we want to have the same \n     standards. This is not logical. I am perfectly prepared to \n     support testing where we measure the aptitude of young people \n     who have the same opportunities to see if they have the same \n     results.\n       . . . The goal should be excellence for not just some, but \n     all, of our nation's children. My hope is that some of [our] \n     colleagues will understand the importance of educational \n     comparability as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Statement by Congressman Chaka Fattah on the Dodd Amendment\n\n       ``For two days this week, the most powerful lawmaking body \n     in the world has debated whether poor children have the right \n     to learn in situations comparable to our wealthier students. \n     The Dodd Amendment, No. 459, stresses the need for schools to \n     have comparable resources. However, some are attempting to \n     block this important vote.\n       Right now, the Republicans are pushing to test every child \n     in math and reading. But if poor kids do not have certified \n     teachers, if they don't have updated textbooks, if their \n     class sizes are twice as large and their school districts are \n     underfunded, then why ask for test results that are clearly \n     skewed? If students do not have comparable opportunities, \n     they will not have comparable results.\n       I wonder why some Republicans are unwilling to urge states \n     to provide comparable educational opportunities for poor \n     children as the Dodd Amendment asserts. There is no one \n     anywhere who would say that rural and urban school districts \n     receive comparable resources with our wealthier suburban \n     districts; yet, we want to have the same standards. This is \n     not logical. I am perfectly prepared to support testing where \n     we measure the aptitude of young people who have the same \n     opportunities to see if they have the same results. However, \n     if we want these children to take national tests, we should \n     also strive to provide them with comparable resources. With \n     so many state courts ruling for more equitable funding, why \n     would some Republicans threaten to filibuster an amendment \n     that would provide this very goal?\n       I have had many conversations with Senators Dodd, Biden and \n     others on why we need all our public schools to perform at \n     comparable levels. They understand this and should be \n     commended for offering this amendment. The goal should be \n     excellence for not just some, but all, of our nation's \n     children. My hope is that some of their Republican colleagues \n     will understannd the importance of educational comparability \n     as well.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. To add to my colleague's point, this is not telling the \nStates how the State system should be structured. It is not saying that \nif one district offers Japanese as a language, because there is an \ninterest, they have to offer it to everybody in the State. That is not \ncommon sense.\n  Comparability of educational services is about comparability of \neducational opportunity. I cannot see why this is a controversial \nissue. I hope, again, our colleagues can support the amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his patience and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I personally have been in \nschools where I have seen children learning in closets because the \npopulation of the school was so large, for example, elementary schools \nwith over 1,000 students, many schools with many different languages. \nYet it is very difficult for local jurisdictions to build\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\nsmaller schools because of the pressures of growing population.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk allows funds under title V, \npart B, subpart 4, the Innovative Education Program Strategies, to be \nused to reduce the size of schools. The amendment authorizes the U.S. \nDepartment of Education to award grants as a permissible use of these \nfunds to reduce the size of schools, in other words, to build small \nschools. The grants would be equally matched by the State, the local \njurisdiction, or the school district. This amendment does not add \nadditional dollars but permits use of funds under Title V that may be \navailable.\n  I am introducing the amendment because I strongly believe children \nlearn better and teachers teach better in smaller schools. Many of our \nschools are just too big. In fact, half of all American high school \nstudents go to schools with 1,500 or more students. Half of all \nAmerican high school students are in huge high schools. Studies have \nshown again and again and again that student achievement improves when \nschool and class size are reduced.\n  The U.S. Department of Education indicates these are some of the \nbenefits of small schools: Students have a greater sense of belonging; \nfewer discipline problems occur; crime, violence, and gang activity go \ndown; alcohol and tobacco use declines; dropout rates fall; graduation \nrates rise; and student attendance increases.\n  The ideal high school, according to education experts, is between 600 \nand 900 students. The National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals recommends an elementary school size of no more than 400 for \ngrades kindergarten to grade 5. That is the way it was when I went to \npublic school, and that is one of the reasons I was able to learn.\n  Studies show that students in small schools have higher academic \nachievement, fewer discipline problems, lower dropout rates, higher \nlevels of student participation, and higher graduation rates. A \nTennessee study called project STAR placed 6,500 kindergartners in 330 \nclasses of different sizes. The test scores and the behavior of \nstudents in smaller classes were better than those in larger classes.\n  We know that small class size benefits. We also know that in a \nsociety as diverse as ours, when some schools have as many as 40 \ndifferent languages, smaller schools benefit students and teachers as \nwell.\n  Under this amendment, schools receiving grants that would be equally \nmatched would have to meet the following size requirements: For \nkindergarten through fifth grade, not more than 500 students; for \ngrades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students; for grades 9 through \n12, not more than 1,500 students.\n  This amendment will provide a new funding source for school districts \nor States to build new schools with the explicit goal of reducing \nschool size. We need to build 6,000 new schools in this Nation just to \nmeet enrollment growth projections. That is not going to happen if \nthere isn't some Federal help. By amending title V and making this a \npermitted use--grants for small schools--I hope school districts will \nhave an incentive to build small.\n\n  Let me give examples of large schools. In Mapleton, UT, 832 students \nin an elementary school; Narragansett Elementary School, in Rhode \nIsland, 710 students; Coral Gables Elementary School, FL, 748 students; \nMunford, AL, Ophelia Hill Elementary, 730 students; Gosnell Elementary, \nin Arkansas, 788 students. It isn't only the big States, it is the \nsmall States, too.\n  Right nearby in Herndon, Virginia, we have a middle school of 1,285 \nstudents and Rocky Run Middle School, also in Virginia, 1,350 students. \nA combination middle school and high school in Florida, in River Ridge \nMiddle and High School, 3,260 students in one school.\n  Here are some examples of large high schools. Olympic Heights \nCommunity High School, Palm Beach, FL, 2,405 students; Camelback High \nSchool, Phoenix, AZ, 2,557 students; Georgia, in South Gwinnett High \nSchool, 2,550 students; in Lyons, IL, 3,087 students; and Waipahu High \nSchool, in Hawaii, 2,434 students.\n  California, as the Senator from Connecticut pointed out, has some of \nthe largest schools in the country. Los Angeles has some of the largest \nclasses and schools in the world. Let me give an example. In Los \nAngeles, Hawaiian Elementary--elementary--1,365 students; South Gate \nMiddle School--middle school--4,442 students; Belmont High School, \n4,874 students.\n  I have been in some of these schools.\n  If we can provide an incentive for local jurisdictions to build \nsmaller schools, educational experts now say that beginning schools, \nelementary schools, do not have to be in a special campus. We can have \na campus within a campus or have a small school as part of a commercial \nsetting, for example.\n  The important thing is ``small.'' Small is better when it comes to \neducation, particularly in the lower grades, and particularly when one \nhas a varied socioeconomic structure, one has many different languages. \nSchools I have been in--and I will tell you this--have been a cacophony \nof sound, so many students, so much noise, everything in shifts; a \nshift for the lunch, everything in track; track 1, track 2; and, again, \n40 different languages spoken.\n  I hope the Senate sees fit to pass this amendment. As I said, the \namendment does not add new funds. It would simply amend title V to make \nas a permissible use of title V funds, grants that would be equally \nmatched, Federal dollars with state or local dollars, to build small \nschools in the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 797 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel], for himself, Mr. \n     Campbell, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 797.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require that certain schools be given priority in the \n             allocation of school construction assistance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n       ``5--FEDERAL PRIORITIES FOR SCHOOL REPAIR AND RENOVATION.\n\n     ``SEC. 5351. REQUIREMENT RELATING TO SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(7) Over several decades, Bureau of Indian Affairs and \n     Impact Aid schools have suffered from neglect and disrepair, \n     which has had a direct impact on student learning and safety.\n       ``(8) As of January 2001, the repair, rehabilitation, and \n     renovation backlog for Bureau of Indian Affairs and heavily \n     impacted Impact Aid education facilities and quarters was \n     over $2,000,000,000.\n       ``(b) Requirement.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law (including the provisions of this Act), in administering \n     any Federal program to provide assistance for school \n     construction or renovation, the Secretary of Education shall \n     ensure that assistance under such program is provided to meet \n     the construction or renovation needs of schools receiving \n     Impact Aid, schools under the jurisdiction of the Department \n     of Defense, and Indian and Bureau of Indian Affairs funded \n     schools prior to making any such assistance available under \n     such program to other schools.\n       ``(c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to apply to--\n       ``(1) school construction bond programs or school \n     renovation bond programs; or\n       ``(2) amounts provided for school construction or \n     renovation under--''.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Campbell and \nKyl, in offering this amendment which reconfirms the Federal obligation \nto the Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, Department of Defense schools, \nand Impact Aid schools. While we all agree that steps need to be taken \nto modernize and improve the conditions of our schools nationwide, one \nquestion continually permeates this debate and makes consensus \ndifficult. This question revolves around what should be the appropriate \nrole of the Federal Government with respect to school construction.\n  Senator Feinstein would like to reduce class size by constructing \nmore classrooms. That is an admirable goal, one to which I think we all \nare committed. However, before the Senate authorizes funding for \ngeneral school construction, we have an existing obligation that we \nshould meet first. The\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\nFederal Government has a responsibility to educate Native American \nchildren and the children of men and women who serve the Federal \nGovernment. This obligation includes building and repairing the schools \nthese children attend.\n  The need for school repair is great. There is no dispute about this \nneed. The General Accounting Office estimated in March 2000 that it \nwill cost $112 billion to repair and modernize U.S. schools. The \nNational Education Association estimates that it will cost more than \n$300 billion to repair and modernize U.S. schools.\n  However, before we can allow Federal funds to flow to locally \nsupported schools for these purposes, as noble and worthy as these \npurposes are, we, the Federal Government, have our first obligation to \nensure the facility needs of BIA, DOD, and Impact Aid-supported schools \nare met.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs operates 185 schools across the country. \nImpact Aid reaches more than 1,600 schools serving 1.2 million \nfederally connected children. The Department of Defense operates 70 \nschools nationwide. The repair needs of these schools reach well over \n$2 billion.\n  Due to military base realignments, the Fort Hood public school \ndistrict in Texas is now using over 200 trailers to serve students.\n  The Waynesville School District in Missouri needs to replace a high \nschool that was built in the late 19th century.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, your home State, Mr. President, the \nBellevue public school district needs a new middle school, and the \nWinnebago School District has over $3 million in needed immediate \nrepairs and construction.\n  The amendment I offer today along with my colleagues from Arizona and \nColorado will assure we meet our commitment to the children attending \nBureau of Indian Affairs, Impact Aid, and Department of Defense \nschools, schools we clearly have a Federal obligation to support.\n  We must meet these clear Federal obligations first.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 370 As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Feinstein for her \namendment and urge the Senate adopt it. We have in the legislation what \nis called title V. That provides flexibility in the States and local \ncommunities--20 percent is retained to the State; 80 percent goes to \nthe local communities. Half is distributed under a somewhat different \nformula from title I, but half goes into the title I formula, the other \nbased on population. So there are funds that will be available.\n  What this amendment is saying, as described by the Senator, is the \nresources can be used for the development of new schools.\n  One of the things most of us think about when we think about new \nschools is a brand new school appearing on a bluff or on a hill or in a \nfield. But what we are finding out now is that many new schools are \nbeing built inside of old schools. We have had good hearings on the \nresults of this kind of experimentation, where they are taking schools \nthat have large student populations and breaking them down and \nliterally having two or three or four new schools in a very large \nschool context.\n  They are finding out the changing of the organization and changing of \nthe structure and the administration and running of these institutions \nhave had a very positive impact on the students themselves.\n  So this amendment will provide some flexibility in this area of new \nschools. It will not only try to meet some of the needs for additional \nconstruction, which we have talked about earlier in the debate on the \nCarper amendment and earlier than that on the Harkin amendment, but it \nwill also permit the use of these funds which otherwise would not have \nbeen permitted for the development of new schools in older school \nbuildings.\n  I think it is a useful addition. I know the initial amendment was a \ngood deal more ambitious. I was prepared to support that \nenthusiastically. But I think this is an important addition, and I \nthank the Senator for bringing this matter to our attention.\n  From my own judgment, this will be a very worthwhile utilization of \nthe title I funding that I think should be supported.\n  I notice the Senator from Nebraska asked for the yeas and nays. I \nbelieve, with my colleague, we are prepared to accept the Feinstein \namendment, if we could voice vote that amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we will have to reserve our rights. We cannot do \nthat right now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right. Then I think the Senator reserves the \nremainder of her time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his comments. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 797\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment of the Senator from California, but right \nnow I rise in support of the Hagel amendment and yield myself such time \nas I consume.\n  I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska. \nSenator Hagel has proposed an amendment which is very appropriate. He \nessentially said in his amendment, before we start doing construction \nactivities--renovation, repair--on public schools in jurisdictions \nwhere States have responsibilities or communities have \nresponsibilities, we ought to first do our job in our own areas where \nwe have responsibilities, specifically in the Indian reservation areas \nand especially at our military facilities. Many of our military \npersonnel have young children and those children are, first, under the \npressure of being children of military personnel, which is a difficult \nposition and it puts a lot of pressure on the family. And, second, a \nlot of them are in school buildings which are dilapidated and simply \nnot up to snuff as far as being a physical facility in which education \nshould be performed.\n  We, the Federal Government, have a first line of responsibility to \ntake care of those school buildings and those school construction needs \nand renovation needs on our military installations. The same can be \nsaid for our Indian reservations where we have the primary \nresponsibility through treaty agreements. There are numerous instances \nwhere the Federal Government has the responsibility of maintaining the \nphysical facilities of the schools on those reservations. We have an \nobligation to do that.\n\n  I think the Senator from Nebraska has really pointed out a very \nappropriate obligation of the Federal Government and has prioritized \nthis process of using funds, to the extent they are going to be used, \nin the renovation area out of title VI, and the use of those funds in a \nmanner which is consistent with our obligations as the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government's first responsibility should be the \nFederal facilities, and especially to children on our military bases.\n  I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska and \nhope it will be accepted. I look forward to voting on it.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I did not comment earlier on the Hagel \namendment. I join in recommending support for the amendment. As one who \nwas the chairman of the Committee on Indian Education just about 30 \nyears ago and was mindful of the particular needs of Native Americans, \nas well as those in the densely populated military districts, I think \nthe Senator has given us a good amendment to be able to express our \npriority by giving focus and attention to the heavily impacted Native \nAmericans and military districts.\n  I welcome the chance to support the amendment. I thank him for \nbringing it to our attention.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand the Senator from \nCalifornia has 4 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this amendment, offered as a perfecting \namendment, was never part of the printed list of amendments. As a \nmatter of good faith, I was under the impression that it was the \nperfection of another amendment.\n  This amendment is effectively the Enzi amendment. The effect of this \namendment, if it goes into effect, is not the $10 million of impact aid \nfor Native Americans; it effectively, under the language of the \namendment on page 3 says, ``notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nthe secretary shall ensure that assistance under such program is \nprovided to meet the construction and renovation needs of schools \nreceiving impacted aid.''\n  That takes all of the previously appropriated money and effectively \nends that kind of support for the schools that are expecting for this \nto be distributed in this month. So this is a revote on the Enzi \namendment. The Enzi amendment was defeated and this amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  Quite frankly, I really question--I hate to say this--the good will \nof our colleagues. We have been attempting to working in good-faith \nefforts here. I didn't object to the modification of the amendment. \nThis is a restatement of the Enzi amendment which effectively takes all \nof the construction funds previously appropriated and earmarked for \nStates--already now the States would have that--and says that money \nwill go to a handful of impact aid areas. I hope this amendment will be \ndefeated. It is the Enzi amendment. I ask our colleagues to review \ntheir votes at that particular time.\n  This effectively vitiates the action that was taken in the last \nCongress to help school construction across this country. With this \namendment, it effectively eliminates that kind of proposal. I think it \nis grossly both an unfair and unwise policy.\n  I have the list of the allocations now from the Department of \nEducation for each of the 50 States. I say to every one of our Members, \nyou can be assured you will not get this money that is going to go out \nto your States within the next 4 weeks. It will not go out if this \namendment is accepted and becomes law. That is the effect of it.\n  I regret that we didn't have more time to debate it. I regret that \nthe proponent of the amendment is not here. I have been asking whether \nthe floor manager of the bill understood this to be a repeat of the \nEnzi amendment. I ask him now if he knows that.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I can't yield on my time, since I have very little time \nleft. I will say it is the exact language of the Enzi amendment. They \nare identical. That is really a misrepresentation of what this \namendment is all about.\n  I repeat, since I haven't any further time--and we were charged on \nour side during the quorum call, with all of my time being charged \ninitially--even though earlier today when the Senator wasn't here, we \nasked for a fair distribution of the time. We can play it whatever way \nour friends on the other side want, but this is not the way for good \nlegislation or good faith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, possibly, could you tell us what the time \nsituation is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from California has how much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Nebraska?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Nebraska has 4 minutes, I have 4 minutes, \nand there is no time on that side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't know how the time is charged, but it seems to me \nthat time is obviously being charged fairly and equitably because we \nare down to 4 minutes on our side, and I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts probably spoke for at least 4 minutes on his time.\n  As to the equity of time charge, I think it was reasonable.\n  As to the issue which the Senator from Massachusetts has asked--did I \nknow this was the Enzi amendment--unfortunately, I didn't. But I still \nlike the Enzi amendment. So I guess I am certainly for it. However, at \nthis point I will yield to the Senator from Arizona, if the Senator \nwishes to claim time from Senator Hagel.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, as a cosponsor of the amendment, perhaps I \ncould have the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could we ask for another 20 minutes?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is fine with me if you want 20 minutes equally \ndivided. Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first let me respond to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I think he will find that this is not the Enzi \namendment. That was several pages long. This is the first 21 lines of \nthe first page of the Enzi amendment.\n  What this amendment says is that the impact aid which has \ntraditionally gone to the federally impacted areas is going to be given \na priority. The primary areas we are talking about are Indian \nreservations and military installations.\n  In my State of Arizona, we have more reservation Indians than any \nother State in the United States, and a lot of military installations.\n  My own view is that States and local school districts have always had \nthe responsibility for school construction. They are the ones primarily \nresponsible for that.\n  With respect to Federal involvement in primary and secondary \neducation, our first obligation ought to be to the our first \nresponsibilities--the Federal installations and the Indian reservations \nover which we have trust land responsibility. Both of them are sorely \nin need of these funds. Therefore, it makes sense to me that we should \nconsider, as a distinct proposition, the first 21 lines of the Enzi \namendment, which provide that the priority goes to these federally \nimpacted areas--so that they get the money first, and what is left over \ncan go to other school districts.\n  To me, that seems very logical. It seems to be the appropriate role \nfor the Federal Government. Why would we not take care of the Federal \nresponsibilities first as a priority and then, to the extent there is \nmoney left over, add that to what the States and local school districts \nspend for their schools?\n\n  Since 1967, impact aid construction has not been fully funded. The \nresult is a huge backlog of projects. In Education Week, a school board \nmember in the military impact district said that some districts \nconducted so much of their business in portable classrooms and aging \nbuildings that they ``more closely resemble prison camps than \nschools.''\n  He went on to say, ``Our troops are in Bosnia and those are the kinds \nof schools their kids are in.''\n  I might note that the Military Impact Schools Association, which is \nobviously interested in this, estimated it would take $310 million to \nmeet facility needs in their members' districts.\n  I can tell you from my experience with the many Indian reservations \nin Arizona that you have a very similar situation with federally \nimpacted schools in Indian Country. In fact, it is even more dire.\n  According to a 1996 study by the National Indian Impacted Schools \nAssociation, a typical district of this type had more than $7 million \nin facilities needs.\n  And facilities needs are even more pressing for America's 185 Indian \nschools, which educate 50,000 Indian students.\n  According to testimony from the director of the Office of Indian \nEducation, perhaps half of the schools within the jurisdiction of the \nBureau of Indian Affairs exceeded their useful\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nlives of more than 50 years, and more than 20 percent are over 50 years \nold.\n  No fewer than 96 schools need to be entirely replaced.\n  I think it is important that we put the money first where the Federal \nGovernment has the first responsibility, which is in our military \ninstallations and Indian reservations. That is all this amendment does. \nThere is nothing secret about it. That is all it does.\n  That doesn't begin to use up the entire $1.5 billion that is \navailable here. That is approximately the amount, as I understand it.\n  Again, we are simply providing the priority to the military \ninstallations and the reservations.\n  I commend the Senator from Nebraska as well as the Senator from \nColorado, Mr. Campbell, for his emphasis on getting these needs met, \nand I certainly hope we can adopt this amendment which establishes the \npriority for Federal facilities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, this is an entirely unacceptable way to do business \nin the Senate. The initial Hagel amendment that was printed for all of \nus to see applied to impact aid and Native American construction. The \namount of money that was appropriated previously was $10 million. It \nwas represented to us that this was a technical correction about how \nthat $10 million was going to be expended between impact aid and Native \nAmerican housing.\n  At the last moment, the Senator from Nebraska asked for a perfecting \namendment. We, to our fault, believed that it was a perfecting \namendment, but the perfecting amendment is an amendment that does not \ndeal with the $10 million but deals with $1.2 billion and tracks the \nEnzi amendment which says the allocations of funding that had been \nreached under the Department of Education under the Harkin amendment of \nlast year will be emasculated and instead there will be an entirely \ndifferent distribution according to impact aid, so that every one of \nthose States that was going to receive the aid now from the Department \nof Education are going to receive nothing. Somehow it will be \ndistributed to States that have impact aid and Native Americans.\n  That is a perfecting amendment. That just defies understanding, \nlogic, reason, and truthfulness. Truthfulness.\n  Madam President, I hope that amendment will be defeated. I will print \nthe exact language of the Enzi amendment and the 22 lines the Senator \nfrom Arizona says--well, it is true they had 22 lines of the Enzi \namendment. That is the operative language. What difference does it make \nif you have five other pages of it? You have 22 lines of it that say \nexactly what the Enzi amendment said. That is basically wrong. It is a \nbad way to deal with this institution.\n  I am surprised, quite frankly. I regret having to make these remarks \nwhen the Senator is not here. We are under a time limit on this, and \nthis amendment ought to be withdrawn, and we ought to deal with the \nexisting Hagel amendment. When all time expires, I am going to make \nthat request, that we withdraw the perfecting amendment and go back to \nthe original Enzi amendment that was distributed and that was \nunderstood to be the amendment on which we were going to act.\n  I yield the remaining 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in my home State of Illinois, we have an \nimpact aid district. It is near the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. \nIt needs additional Federal assistance. I supported it and asked for it \nover the years, and I will continue to support it.\n  The Hagel amendment we are considering is fundamentally inexplicable. \nHere we have $1.2 billion to be given, as I understand it, to 200 \nimpact aid school districts; $6 million per school district if you \nhappen to be in the lucky category of Senator Hagel's amendment. And \nwho will lose? Sixteen thousand school districts across America that \nhave already made application and been approved for money for \nrenovation of schools.\n  In my home State of Illinois, we are talking about $42 million they \nexpect to receive in the next few weeks, money that will be spent to \nmake schools better and safer before the new school year starts. They \nwill not receive the money under the Hagel amendment. Only one school \ndistrict in my State will receive the money, some $6 million. Quite a \nwindfall.\n  I am sure they can figure out someplace to use it, but is that fair? \nIs it fair at this point in time, after every State in the Union and \nthe school districts therein have made applications for $1.2 billion in \nschool construction money, to tell them it is over, they are not going \nto receive this assistance? The money that is being applied for in this \nconstruction grant is money to make schools safer so kids can go to \nschool and have a good learning experience.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. He really explained the \nmotive behind this amendment. It is not a matter of helping impact aid \ndistricts; it is a matter of many Senators on that side of the aisle \nobjecting to the notion that the Federal Government would give money to \nlocal school districts.\n  The Senator from Arizona was very forthcoming. He said when it comes \nto school construction, it should come from State and local funds. That \nis his philosophy. This amendment reflects it. They do not want Federal \nassistance going to school districts across the State.\n  I respect the Senator for being forthcoming in his statement, but \nlet's be very clear that this amendment will take away $1.2 billion in \nschool construction funds that school districts across America have \napplied for to make their schools better and safer for the new school \nyear. That is clearly the intent of it. It is not a question of helping \nkids in school. It is a question of ending a program which many people \non the other side of the aisle just do not agree with philosophically.\n  I happen to believe education is the highest priority in our country. \nI believe that an investment from the Federal Government in making our \nschools safer so kids do not have the ceilings falling down on top of \nthem, they are not stuck out in a trailer in the parking lot, they have \na good classroom where they can learn, is a national priority that \ndeserves a national investment.\n  Those who opposed that program in years gone by had a chance to argue \nagainst it. They lost the debate. Now they are trying with the Hagel \namendment to win again.\n  I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, this amendment is, as he \nsays, a last minute attempt to undermine a good program for school \nconstruction across America. Those school districts in every State are \ngoing to learn, if this amendment is adopted today, they have lost the \nFederal assistance they need to improve their schools. I reserve the \nremainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. How much time is on this side?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Arizona 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. That was the time remaining on the Democratic side; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. And the time remaining on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I want to respond to my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  I would like to characterize my position rather than having my friend \nfrom Illinois characterize my position. He complimented me on being \ncandid to say that I thought the first responsibility for the Federal \nGovernment in school construction is for the military installations and \nIndian reservations. That is correct.\n  That is why, in this amendment, we first apply school construction \nfunds to the needs of the military installations and the Indian \nreservations because those are the schools that get no help from the \nStates. States do not build schools on military installations of the \nFederal Government or on the Federal Indian reservations. Only the \nFederal Government has that responsibility.\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nOnly we spend the money for those facilities.\n  Those facilities are in horrible condition, far worse as a general \nrule than the average school described by my friend from Illinois.\n  What we are saying is since only the Federal Government takes care of \nthese two areas, or should, that the money we have allocated for school \nconstruction should first be applied to them as a matter of priority.\n  Do I have a bit of a parochial interest here? Yes, I do because we \nhave a lot of military installations and Indian reservations in \nArizona, and the conditions are deplorable on our Federal Indian \nreservations. Anybody in this Chamber would be embarrassed to go to \nthese facilities, and I add to that the court facilities, the jail \nfacilities, and a lot of other facilities. And who has the \nresponsibility for them? The Federal Government. Again: these are the \nschools that do not get any help from the States.\n  What are we saying as the Federal Government when we say that we are \ngoing to help the States and local governments build their schools \nbefore attending to our first obligation, our Indian reservations and \nmilitary installations? I say that is backwards. We already have \nsomebody who is supposed to have the responsibility to take care of our \nprimary and secondary education within the States. It is only the \nFederal Government that can take care of the military and Indian \nreservations. That is why I say this amendment makes all the sense in \nthe world.\n\n  Let's prioritize the Federal dollars so we take care of our own \nresponsibilities first and then the remainder of the funds can be \ndistributed to the State school needs.\n  That is the way I characterize this, rather than the way my colleague \nfrom Illinois did. It is a matter of priorities.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 3 minutes 29 seconds, and the \nminority has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Iowa is here. He was the proponent of \nthe initial amendment that provided $1.2 billion which has been \nappropriated and now allocated to 50 States. The initial amendment of \nthe Senator from Nebraska had a program that was previously funded at \n$10 million, and his amendment allocated that $10 million to Native \nAmericans. That was the initial amendment.\n  The Senator sent up a new amendment that was not even printed that \neffectively wipes out all of the money appropriated under the Harkin \namendment a year ago and will deny the 50 States the funding to which \nthey were entitled.\n  The remaining 3 minutes goes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know how this amendment all of a sudden came out \nof the clear blue sky. We heard it was noncontroversial. This amendment \nrobs States of millions of dollars they get on July 1 of this year. \nThis is money we put in the appropriations bill last year. It was \nagreed to by the Republicans, by the Democrats, by the House, by the \nWhite House. This is all signed off on. This is $1.2 billion that goes \nto States for emergencies--safety, repairs to schools, to meet fire \ncode violations.\n  This is the same amendment--this amendment that is before the \nSenate--that was defeated May 16 by a bipartisan vote of 62-37. This is \nbasically the same amendment. We have already defeated it 62-37. If \nMembers vote for this amendment, they are voting to cut already \nappropriated funds that are going to States. Members are shifting it to \nimportant but a small number of schools in a few States.\n  Before Members vote, see how much money is going into your State \nbeginning on July 1 of this year. If this amendment passes, your State \nwill not get one cent of this money for emergency repairs to meet fire \nand safety codes in their schools.\n  This amendment was defeated on May 16--check the record--by a \nbipartisan vote of 62-37. This money is already appropriated. I already \nhave the amount of money that has been allocated going to each State. \nThe money is going out on July 1. Your school districts are counting on \ngetting this money to meet fire and safety codes, to repair and \nrenovate their schools. This is not building new schools. This is \nsimply to make your schools safe.\n  I hope people will reject this amendment as we rejected it before by \na vote of 62-37 on May 16.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Hagel for offering \nan amendment to S. 1 concerning the existing obligations the Federal \nGovernment has to Bureau of Indian Affairs, DOD and impact aid school \nsystems. through numerous treaties, statutes, and court decisions, the \nFederal Government has assumed a trust responsibility to provide a \nquality education to Indian children.\n  This duty includes providing school facilities that have such basic \namenities as 4 walls, heat, and healthy air to breathe. Adequate \nfacilities and such essential necessities are not being provided to \nmany Indian children attending Bureau of Indian Affairs, (BIA), funded \nschools.\n  Unlike communities that have a tax base to fund school construction, \nmilitary reservations and Indian reservations are dependent on Federal \nresources. Nearly 4,500 facilities serve the Bureau's education \nprogram, consisting of over 20 million square feet of space, including \ndormitories, employee housing, and other buildings providing education \nopportunities to more than 50,000 students. These facilities serve more \nthan 330 federally recognized Indian tribes located in 23 States \nthrough self-determination contracts, compacts and education grants.\n  We are not dealing here with ``the unknown.'' The GAO and other \nentities have produced countless studies and surveys showing us that \nhalf of the school facilities in the inventory have exceeded their \nuseful lives of 30 years, and more than 20 percent are over 50 years \nold. Numerous deficiencies in the areas of health, safety, access for \ndisabled students, classroom size, ability to integrate computer and \ntelecommunications technology, and administrative space have been \nreported by the Bureau.\n  As a former teacher myself, I am appalled when I visit reservations \nand see first hand the many schools with leaking roofs, peeling paint, \novercrowded classrooms, and inadequate heating and cooling systems. The \nstudies have shown that such deficiencies have adverse effects on \nstudent learning. By not providing secure educational facilities, we \nare paralyzing these children and putting them at a disadvantage that \nthey may never overcome.\n  The Federal Government has responded to the problem in piecemeal \nfashion, often using temporary solutions instead of working on a \npermanent plan of action. For instance, in fiscal year 2001 President \nClinton's budget requested $2 million for ``portables'' or trailer \nclassrooms that have been used since 1993. To date, the BIA has \npurchased 472 portables and 20 percent of the BIA's total education \nbuildings are now portable classrooms. The request states these \ntrailers are needed due to overcrowding and unhealthy and unsafe \nbuildings. It states that portables are used to replace buildings or \nparts of buildings that have ``poor air quality'' that result in what \nthe BIA calls ``sick building syndrome.''\n  New funds for Indian school construction is one of the major focuses \nof President Bush's fiscal year 2002 budget request with $292.5 million \nslated for such purposes. Of the overall education construction budget, \n$127.8 million has been requested for the construction of six schools: \nWingate Elementary, NM; Polacca Day School, AZ; Holbrook Dormitory, AZ; \nSanta Fe Indian School, NM; Ojibwa Indian School, ND; and Paschal \nSherman School, WA.\n  As of January 2001, the repair and rehabilitation, and renovation \nbacklog for Indian education facilities and quarters stood at $1.1 \nbillion and is even greater today.\n  I understand the underlying notion of the Feinstein amendment, but I \nthink this body should affirm our existing obligations to this Nation's \nDOD, Indian, and impact aid schools before we undertake even greater \nobligations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 seconds \nand the Senator from New Hampshire has 6 minutes 59 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I make a point: For all the concern which \nthe other side has, I believe the\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\nother side has a right to know of the amendments that come forward. The \nconfusion about this is unfortunate. The fact is, this amendment is a \nlegitimate second degree to the underlying amendment, and therefore \nwould have been in order if we had been functioning under the \ntraditional parliamentary system. We are functioning under a system \nwhere we don't second degree; we have side-by-sides. As a second \ndegree, it would have wiped out the Feinstein amendment. That is just a \nstatement of where we are parliamentarily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask to be recognized for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I make it clear again: On May 16 an \namendment was offered by Senator Enzi of Wyoming that would have \nredistributed $240 million of the $1.2 billion that is going out for \nschool repair. That amendment was defeated by a vote of 62-37. That \nwould have only redistributed $240 million. This amendment before the \nSenate takes the whole $1.2 billion and puts it into Impact Aid.\n  If a Member was opposed to taking $240 million out of the school \nrenovation repair for fire and safety code on the Enzi amendment, that \nMember surely ought to be opposed to taking $1.2 billion and putting it \ninto Impact Aid and taking it away from our schools for meeting safety \nand fire codes in our local school districts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask to proceed for 2 minutes and give 1 minute to the \nSenator.\n  The initial Hagel amendment was 549; what was called up was No. 797 \nand was not printed. This was $10 million which we understood was going \nto be perfected in some way, as we have been perfecting amendments all \nday long on the floor and granting that permission--although it takes \nconsent to do it. We expected that perfection would be along the lines \nof the Hagel amendment, a drafting error. Instead, what was called up \nis a completely different amendment, 797, that was not even printed and \notherwise would be out of order since it was not filed in time. Instead \nof $10 million, it is $1.2 billion.\n  I think that is a gross misappropriation. I ask, therefore, that the \nperfecting amendment be withdrawn and that we vote on the initial Hagel \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts is expressing his frustration about the situation. But \nthe situation is not, as I mentioned before, so far from what a typical \nparliamentary situation would be. All the first degrees had to be \ncleared, that is correct, but no second degrees had to be cleared. So \nthere have been second degrees which are not being set up as second \ndegrees because of this side-by-side process, which has been very \nconstructive, so that everybody gets a vote on what their position is. \nThey have been relevant to the first degree but have not been filed. So \nthis is a second-degree amendment which is being held as a side-by-side \namendment.\n  That being said, simply, once again, to clear the parliamentary \nerrors from where we are from our perspective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent we stand in a quorum call for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator can suggest the \nabsence of a quorum. It will require further consent to terminate the \ncall. Without objection, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wanted to ask if it would be \nappropriate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call is in progress.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be lifted \nfor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may not reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued the call of the roll.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 797, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays on my amendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Was the \namendment withdrawn, or did the author of the amendment intend to \nwithdraw it?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, my intent is to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object-- of course I \nwill not object--I cosponsored it because I felt very strongly that it \nwas something we should do. I hope that sometime we will prioritize \nFederal funds for our responsibility to Federal military and Federal \nIndian reservation installations. I hope at some point we can get along \nwith it. But, obviously, I don't object to withdrawing the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I ask the \ndistinguished manager of the bill if there will be another opportunity \nwith appropriate notice to have a vote on the Federal priorities for \nFederal schools because I, too, am very interested in our military \nschools and our Indian schools being a first priority. That is my \ninquiry.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are amendments which are filed to \nthat effect and that are in order. I don't have the list as to that \nparticular measure in front of me.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think there is an amendment coming up \nthat would be relevant to a second degree. If the Senator wishes to \nbring it back, it would be available at that time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nNebraska that his actions tonight, because of a misunderstanding that \ncould have been on our part, only magnify my feelings about the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. This was very classic action on his behalf, and I \npersonally appreciate it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in that. The Senator has given me \na good explanation of what his plans were and what his intentions were, \nand they were completely honorable--not that they are not always \nhonorable.\n  His explanations made a great deal of sense to me when he explained \nwhat he had intended to do. So we were caught up in a difficult \nsituation. I am enormously grateful to him for this action. We are more \nthan glad to accommodate Senators as we move on. We will have another \nopportunity.\n  On the basis of the substance, if he wants to, I will certainly ask \nconsent that we be able to consider the Senator's amendment at a time, \nif he chooses to do so, later in this debate. We will all have an \nopportunity to vote on it at some time. I will take the opportunity to \ndiscuss this with the Senator and other interested Senators at a later \ntime.\n  I thank him very much.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, may I respond. I appreciate very much the \nwork of my friends and colleagues from Nevada and Massachusetts. I \nwould very much like to accept the invitation of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts to at a later date have an \nopportunity to revisit this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 370, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 370, as modified, offered by\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nthe Senator from California. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 181 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inouye\n     Murkowski\n       \n  The amendment (No. 370), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have the Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, who has an amendment. As I understand it, there will probably \nbe a side-by-side amendment that will be offered on that from the other \nside. It is the desire that both of those would be considered together \nprobably on the morrow.\n  We have the Senator from South Carolina and Senator Wellstone to \nspeak. We are prepared to take the Nelson amendment now and include \nthat. It has been cleared. Later on in the evening, we will have a \nvoice vote on the amendment of my colleague, Senator Kerry. There is \ngoing to be, as I understand it, from the other side, a side-by-side \namendment to that of the Senator from South Carolina. That is going to \nbe available tonight, and it is going to be printed tonight. I don't \nknow whether the Senator from Pennsylvania intends to speak about it \ntonight or not. We are just trying to get the general lay of the land \nso that the Members will know the way we are going to proceed. That is \nsort of what we have on track.\n  Then we have a full morning tomorrow with the Senator from \nConnecticut and his amendment. We will then dispose of these other \nmeasures.\n  I see the majority leader here. I know he wants to address the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment both managers. I thank \nespecially my colleague, Senator Kennedy. We have made a lot of good \nprogress today. Obviously, we have a full night's work tonight. With \nthat understanding, I have talked with Senator Lott, and I think we are \nprepared to say tonight there will be no more votes. We will have those \ntwo votes side by side tomorrow at 9 o'clock.\n  So we will begin again following our work tonight with the votes \ntomorrow, and we will go on to the Dodd amendment and the order that \nSenator Kennedy has suggested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Was the Senator propounding a unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, I was not propounding a consent request. I was \nstating the way the managers would like to proceed. We are trying to \nproceed in good faith. We have talked to the different Members, and \nthat seemed to be acceptable. We wanted to let the Members know.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Hollings and I were under the impression we \nwould vote tonight. Sometimes when colleagues are gone, it is like \nspitting in the wind. If we are going to do it tomorrow, could we \nhave--and this would hold true for Senator Santorum--5 minutes each to \nsummarize tomorrow?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will put forth a unanimous consent \nrequest, which we will be prepared to propound later tonight. We will \ntake that request into consideration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, so we will continue through this evening. \nIf there are other Senators with other amendments, we will try to \ncontinue the process. We have made good progress during the day, and we \nhave some remaining important amendments tonight, and particularly in \nthe morning. We thank our colleagues for their cooperation. We can move \nahead.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 630.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--and I will not--it is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from Washington is going to take about 5 \nminutes; is that right?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. About 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator proceed now, and we will \nhave a chance to look at the modification and make the request for the \nmodification perhaps later at the conclusion of her remarks? If I could \nsuggest that to the Senator.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will call up----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator wants to proceed with her presentation, \nand then we will have an opportunity for the other side to review the \nmodification. I am sure it is in order, and we can modify the amendment \nand dispose of this tomorrow.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 630 As Modified\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I will call up amendment No. 630, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 630, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no objection to the \nmodification.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To provide additional requirements)\n\n       On page 363, line 12, after ``disability.'' insert the \n     following: ``It shall be a further goal of this part to \n     encourage the effective integration of technology resources \n     and systems with teacher training and curriculum development \n     to establish research-based methods that can be widely \n     implemented into best practices by State and local \n     educational agencies.''.\n       On page 369, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       ``(2) outlines how the plan incorporates--\n       ``(A) teacher education and professional development;\n       ``(B) curricular development; and\n       ``(C) technology resources and systems for the purpose of \n     establishing best practices that can be widely implemented by \n     State and local educational agencies;''.\n       On page 375, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2309. NATIONAL EVALUATION OF TECHNOLOGY PLANS.\n\n       ``Not later than 36 months after the date of enactment of \n     this title, the Secretary, in consultation with other Federal \n     departments or agencies, State and local educational \n     practitioners, and policy makers, including teachers, \n     principals and superintendents, and experts in technology and \n     the application of technology to education, shall report to \n     Congress on best practices in implementing technology \n     effectively consistent with the provisions of section \n     2305(2). The report shall include recommendations for \n     revisions to the National Education Technology Plan for the \n     purpose of establishing best practices that can be widely \n     implemented by State and local educational agencies.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington will proceed \nfor 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act that embraces the powerful role technology can play as a \ntool in educating our Nation's children.\n  Before I proceed further, I thank Senator Kennedy for his exceptional \nwork and leadership on this bill, and I thank Senator Enzi for his work \nin helping me develop this amendment. His leadership in technology \nissues during his tenure in the Senate has been outstanding, and I look \nforward to the continued work on these and other important technology \nissues.\n  Technology has brought innovation and efficiency to our lives through \nbusinesses, and now it is time to make sure we make those same \nachievements in our educational system.\n  Across the country, we have seen the proper uses of technology can \ntransform a curriculum into a multimedia interactive experience that \nnot only helps children learn more effectively but also fosters a \nstudent's passion for learning.\n  Numerous recent studies, including some done by the Department of \nEducation, the White House Office of Science and Technology, and the \nRand Corporation, have shown that technology serves the goal of \neducation in several important ways: Supporting student performance, \nincreasing motivation and self-esteem, and preparing students for the \nfuture.\n  Last fall, a San Francisco-based independent research organization \nreleased a study showing that the integrated use of computer technology \nin schools significantly increases learning. The study focused on the \nfirst 3 years of Microsoft's Anytime, Anywhere Learning Program which \nprovides laptops for students and their teachers to integrate \ntechnology into the classroom and into their daily classwork. The study \nshowed it improved the students' writing and encouraged collaboration \nand more involvement with their school classwork.\n  So we understand that the potential of education and technology is no \nsecret. But what we are finding today, as this chart shows, is that \nmuch of the investment has been made, in fact, in equipment. The chart \nshows that unless technology is properly integrated into curriculum, \nstudents will not realize the benefits of having access. Without \nteachers who know how to use computers to teach children, they will not \nbenefit. When teachers are well trained and technology is used \neffectively to unleash children's imagination and creativity, magical \nthings happen in our educational system.\n  Take, for example, Tonasket, WA, where a teacher, Larry Alexander, \ncombined computer technology and a 500-tree apple orchard to teach his \nfifth grade class about science, math, and technology. The kids studied \na range of topics, including cell growth, life cycles, geometry, \neconomics, and hands-on learning experiences, literally becoming the \nmost favorite program in the school.\n  What the Cantwell-Enzi amendment says is that in addition to \ncomputers and access, we need to assure teacher training and curriculum \ndevelopment. The Cantwell-Enzi amendment takes the first step in \nbridging the technology and teaching divide. The amendment says the \ntechnology block grant program for State and local agencies should be \namended so that instead of just putting dollars into technology under \nthe title II program, States applying should integrate their system \nresources with teacher training and professional development and \ncurriculum development, thereby assuring a focus on teacher training \nand curriculum development and not just on equipment.\n  There are many examples of success to which this kind of legislation \ncan lead, but I want to give one example from the State of New Jersey \nwhere a neighborhood of Cuban citizens and a school in Union City have \nmade great success. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an \narticle that appeared in Business Week in the last year on this \nsubject.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Wired Schools--A Technology Revolution Is About To Sweep America's \n                               Classrooms\n\n       In 1989, the schools in Union City, N.J., an impoverished \n     Cuban enclave along the Hudson River across from Manhattan, \n     were among the nation's worst. They received failing marks in \n     44 of the 52 categories New Jersey used to assess schools, \n     and state officials warned they would seize control if Union \n     City didn't shape up. The threat prompted many changes in \n     Union City, including a technological transformation of its \n     entire educational system. Aided by Bell Atlantic Corp. \n     (BEL, officials equipped \n     the schools and students' homes with a network of computers, \n     creating ``one of the most, if not the most wired urban \n     school district in the U.S.,'' says Margaret Honey, director \n     of the Center for Children & Technology in New York City. But \n     Union City did far more than simply buy computers. The school \n     day was restructured into longer classes; teachers were given \n     40 hours of training a year, up from 8; the district's school \n     budget more than doubled; and the traditional curriculum, \n     emphasizing rote learning, was scrapped so students would \n     work on joint projects such as researching a report on \n     inventions. ``The dynamics have changed tremendously,'' says \n     Mary Ann Sakoutis, a 37-year veteran social studies teacher \n     at Union City's Emerson High School, whose U.S. history \n     students now spend much of their time on the Net researching \n     such events as the Spanish-American War. ``The kids are more \n     involved, and I am no longer force-feeding them.'' It shows. \n     Last year, Union City topped all New Jersey cities on state \n     tests. The number of graduates accepted at top institutions \n     such as Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology has jumped from 8 in 1997, the last class taught \n     the old-fashioned way, to 63 in 1999.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The article says:\n\n       But Union City did far more than simply buy computers. The \n     school day was reconstructed into longer classes; teachers \n     were given 40 hours of training a year--\n\n  And the school district doubled its budget--\n\n     and the traditional curriculum of emphasizing rote learning \n     was scrapped so students could work on joint projects such as \n     research reports and inventions.\n\n  The article further says that the kids are more involved and they are \nno longer being force fed in the educational system. The result is, the \narticle says, that Union City topped all New Jersey cities on State \ntests. The number of graduates accepted at top institutions such as \nYale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology has jumped \nfrom just 8 of their graduates from Union City in 1997, the last time a \nclass was taught the old-fashioned way, to 63 accepted graduates in \n1999.\n  I think it shows the success of our focus on technology ought to be \non curriculum development, teacher training, and on integration of the \nsystem.\n  This amendment asks that the Department of Education analyze after 3 \nyears the best practices so we can scale the use of these best \npractices into our educational system in this country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an enthusiastic cosponsor of \nthe Cantwell-Enzi amendment. For some time, we have been working \ntogether to make sure there is not a digital divide in the United \nStates of America. Both in the budget and in other amendments in this \nbill, we have passed legislation to provide access to technology, but \nwe also have to be sure our children have access to people who know how \nto teach technology.\n  Bill Gates said that if you have access to technology and know how to \nuse technology, whether you are a person, a county, or a country, your \nfuture is bright, but if you do not have that access, your future is \ndismal.\n  As we are working on our legislation, we want to make sure we have \naccess to technology, but it is not only about gadgets, it is not about \ngear, it is about opportunity and empowerment.\n  We need to make sure the children do have technology, but the single \nmost important thing is teacher training--that the teachers themselves \nknow how to use technology and then also, through creativity and new \ningenious software, get our children ready for the future.\n  We do not have a worker shortage in this country, but we do have a \nskill shortage. K-12 is the farm team for the future. Just as we have \nlittle leagues for baseball, we have to make sure our teachers are big \nleague and ready to teach technology.\n  I am pleased to continue to support the legislation that ensures \nthere is no digital divide. The amendment offered\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\nby the Senator from the State of Washington is just what we need to \nmake highest and best use of the technology we are going to provide. I \ncongratulate her on her research, creativity, and the practicality of \nher amendment. I look forward to voting for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was under the impression this amendment \nwas going to take a couple minutes, that the other side accepted it. \nNow I understand they are going to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. To Wellstone.\n  Mr. REID. To Wellstone, not to this.\n  Does the Senator from New Jersey wish to speak for 5 minutes on this \namendment? I ask unanimous consent that be the case. If I may, while I \nam proceeding, I ask the Republican manager, is there going to be a \nsecond-degree amendment offered to this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. May we vote on them in the morning?\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding we will be voting on these in the \nmorning. If they are acceptable, there will be less time needed to \ndebate them in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. They both may be accepted; is that right?\n  Mr. GREGG. If they are going to be accepted. I do not know if your \nside has reviewed the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. My only question is, we have Senators Hollings and \nWellstone waiting, and we know they are going to be second-degreed. \nSenator Santorum already spoke to Senator Hollings. I wonder how much \nmore time the Senator from Virginia wants on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Again, we have Senators Hollings and Wellstone waiting. \nThey thought they be would next.\n  Mr. ALLEN. We thought we were going to be introducing this amendment \ntomorrow morning. Copies are being made now. I believe I can give my \nremarks in 15 minutes this evening and it would be perfectly fine to \nvote. I understand people want to move forward.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from New Hampshire has the floor, maybe the \nSenator from Virginia could offer his amendment tonight, we could look \nat it, and he could speak on it sometime tomorrow and we could dispose \nof these two amendments.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is an excellent suggestion. Perhaps those folks who \nwish to speak on the amendment of the Senator from Washington could \nalso speak tomorrow prior to the vote on both.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Corzine only wishes to speak for 5 minutes. We have \nSenator Hollings waiting.\n  Mr. GREGG. We will plan to do it that way.\n  Mr. REID. We vote on Senator Hollings in the morning and Senator \nSantorum in the morning.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. Senator Santorum may need some time, \nunless it is accepted.\n  Mr. REID. He has whatever time he needs tonight. Senator Hollings and \nWellstone wanted 5 minutes. Does he need more than that?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Pennsylvania is in the Chamber and can \nadvise how much time he believes he needs in the morning.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We will prepare something in writing.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you.\n  Mr. ENZI. I wanted to speak on the Helms amendment, as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I rise in strong support of the amendment that develops \nbest practices for teaching technology education, the integration. This \namendment ensures that our kids benefit from new technologies that are \nrapidly changing the face of our country.\n  Before I discuss the amendment, I extend my compliments to the \nSenator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, for her outstanding leadership \non this issue. Given her State and her own personal background, it is \nfitting she has taken the lead in this area. I think her expertise and \nher commitment to the application of technology in our society is a \nterrific addition to the Senate.\n  I am particularly pleased the Senator from Washington cited Union \nCity, NJ, as one of those places that has effectively integrated \ncomputer technology into the educational system, making a real \ndifference in the lives of children in their learning experience. We \nheard the statistics.\n  It is clear the Internet and the proliferation of computers have \ncreated a revolutionary change in our society. Yet when it comes to \nusing the Internet to improve our schools, we have only scratched the \nsurface. As the Senator suggested, we have done a lot regarding \ninvesting in hardware, but not a lot on the software, particularly \namong the teachers that have to bring the technology to our students.\n  We need to move beyond word processing and e-mails and get to the \nreal heart and soul of learning in a fundamental way and make it more \ninteresting, more effective. The same kind of productivity gains we \nhave had in our economy we can have in education. To do that we need to \ndo a better job of training teachers and showing them how computers can \nchange, not just what we teach but how we teach, integrating the \ntechnology and educational experience together.\n\n  A few years ago, it would have been difficult for a fifth grader in a \nNew Jersey school to share their experiences with a similar class in \nAustralia or anywhere else in the world. Now they can. A few years ago \nit would have been difficult for students to chat real time with real \nexperts around the country about questions discussed in class. Now they \ncan. A few years ago it would have been unrealistic for a teacher to \ninvolve students with interactive software that uses exciting games to \nteach math and science. Now they can.\n  However, they cannot do any of these things if teachers do not have \nthe ability or the background to deliver those experiences. Today, many \nclassrooms are equipped with computers, but their teachers are not \nequipped to integrate the computers into a learning experience. That is \nwhy this amendment is vital. Truly, it will make a difference. It will \nrequire States and local education officials to develop strategies for \nimproving teacher training and curriculum development in order to \nassure that schools take full advantage of the Internet and other new \ntechnologies. There is tremendous potential and this amendment will \nmake that possible.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cantwell for her leadership on this issue. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important amendment, bringing the \nadvances we have had in the rest of our society to our classrooms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the present business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Cantwell amendment, as modified, is \npending.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the amendment, and I \nsend an amendment to the desk and ask it be reported on behalf of \nSenator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, the Senator sent the amendment which \nwill be offered as a side-by-side, the Santorum amendment, for \ntomorrow. I hope the amendment is printed and that interested Members \nand their staffs have a chance to take a look. We have copies available \nfor the staff.\n  There is no objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw my unanimous consent to set aside the Cantwell \namendment so this can be a second degree. Is that correct procedure?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, we are going to follow the precedent \nfrom earlier of voting side by side. We had the opportunity to vote \nfirst on the Cantwell amendment and then the other amendment, with \nback-to-back votes. I think that is what is intended. I think the \nSenator from New Hampshire agrees with me.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the cleanest way to do this is, if I may \ninquire of the Chair, to offer this as a first degree and have the \nCantwell amendment also be a first degree. Would that be the most \nappropriate way to proceed?\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this moment I ask to withhold further \naction on the amendment I sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to conform to the unanimous \nconsent agreement. Accordingly, I ask my amendment at the desk be \ncalled and reported. I take it it is an amendment in the first degree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment as drafted is a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be considered \nas a first degree.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 798 and 799 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time the \nSantorum amendment, which I had sent to the desk, be reported and that \nit be considered as a first degree in a side-by-side status with the \nHollings amendment which is now a first degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 798.\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 799.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 798\n\n   (Purpose: To permit States to waive certain testing requirements)\n\n         On page 47, after line 12, insert the following:\n       ``(i)(I) a State may elect, in accordance with this clause, \n     to waive the application of the requirements of this \n     subparagraph if--\n\n       ``(aa) the State determines that alternative public \n     elementary and secondary educational investments will produce \n     a greater increase in student achievement; or\n       ``(bb) the State can demonstrate the presence of a \n     comparable assessment system;\n\n       ``(II) a waiver under subclause (I) shall be for a period \n     of 1 year;\n       ``(III) a State with a waiver in effect under this clause \n     may utilize Federal funds appropriated to carry out \n     activities in schools that fail to make yearly progress, as \n     defined in the plan of the State under section 1111(b)(2)(B), \n     to--\n\n       ``(aa) increase teacher pay;\n       ``(bb) implement teacher recruitment and retention \n     programs;\n       ``(cc) reduce class size;\n       ``(dd) hire additional teachers to reduce class sizes;\n       ``(ee) improve school facilities;\n       ``(ff) provide afterschool programs;\n       ``(gg) tutor students;\n       ``(hh) increase the access of students to technology;\n       ``(ii) improve school safety; or\n       ``(jj) carry out any other activity that the State \n     educational agency determines necessary to improve the \n     education of public elementary and secondary school students; \n     and\n\n       ``(IV) a State shall ensure that funds to which this clause \n     applies will not be used to pay the cost of tuition, room, or \n     board at a private school or a charter school;''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 799\n\n    (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding science \n                               education)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. __.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, following the debate here for the last 7 \nweeks, one would think the public school system of this Nation is in \nterrible, terrible disrepair. In fact, you'd think it should be closed \ndown, a good bit of it. That is the thrust of the so-called testing \napproach given here, whereby for $7 billion over a 7-year period, all \nwho have not done so will do so immediately. In other words, third to \neighth grade pupils will be tested and then found inadequate and the \ntrustees found unresponsive. Thereby, what we have is a closing down of \nthe public school system.\n  So we are going to show them from Washington. It is all out of whole \ncloth. The fact is, at the Federal level, we only provide some 7 cents \nof every education dollar. So we are not closing down the schools. And \nwe ought to understand, at the outset, the public school system is one \nof the geniuses of the Founding Fathers.\n  It was James Madison:\n\n       A popular government without popular information or the \n     means of acquiring it is about a prologue to a farce or a \n     tragedy.\n\n  In the earliest days, there was Madison.\n  John Adams:\n\n       The whole people must take upon themselves the education of \n     the whole people and be willing to bear the expense of it.\n\n  The reason I start in this vein, to make these quotes, is because I \nhave observed the 20-year effort to close down public schools: put in \ntuition tax credits, put in vouchers, put in charter schools--anything \nbut give to the public schools and the pupils of America what they \nneed.\n  Thank heavens for the wonderful Senator from Minnesota, Senator Paul \nWellstone. I had not been in on the early parts of this 7-week debate. \nBut watching his zeal, his brilliance, and the way he has approached \nthis particular problem, he has really been an education to all of us \nin the Senate.\n  Let's look, for example, at the Land Ordinance of 1785, whereby 4 \nyears before the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. \nThey divided up in the western lands of Minnesota, 6 miles by 6 miles \nsquare, 36 squares, with the provision that square 36, in the middle, \nbe reserved for public education. And Horace Mann, the father of public \nschools in America, said that this law laid the foundation of the \npresent system of free schools:\n\n       The idea of an educational system that was at once both \n     universal, free, and available to all the people, rich and \n     poor alike, was revolutionary. This is the great thing about \n     America. No other nation ever had such an institution. Three \n     centuries later it is a stranger to the bulk of the people of \n     the world. The free public school system which the Puritans \n     conceived, has been, in large measure, the secret of \n     America's success. In these classrooms, children of all ages, \n     nationalities, and tongues, learned a common language and \n     became imbued with one central idea: The American conception \n     that all men are created equal, that opportunities are open \n     to all, that every minority, whether respected or despised, \n     has the same guaranteed rights as the majority. Parents who \n     landed here often brought with them the antagonisms, the \n     rivalries, the suspicions of other continents, but their \n     children became one and united in the pursuit of a \n     democratic ideal.\n  Mr. President, what Mann said and persists today is what he calls the \nlarge measure of the secret of America's success--not failure, success.\n  I emphasize that because in the hinterlands 70 years ago, I was \ntested. We have been having tests, tests. The fact of the matter is I \nlooked it up. This past school year, they spent $422 million on \ntesting.\n  Let's go to the little State of South Carolina where we have been \nhaving tests for the third through eighth grades, complete, at the cost \nof some $7.8 million.\n  The superintendent of education in South Carolina, Ms. Inez \nTenenbaum, said students under her testing system made significant and, \nin some cases, dramatic improvements in the latest round of tests. \nSouth Carolina increased greatly, met or exceeded the international \naverage in the Third International Math and Science Study.\n  The national report card, Quality Counts 2001, published by the \nrespected national magazine, Education Week, recognized South \nCarolina's efforts to improve teacher quality and raise academic \nstandards. South Carolina was ranked among the top six States in the \nNation in both categories.\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\n  My little State is not affluent with a low per capita income, and \nwith a large minority population who, for 200 years, did not have \npublic schools.\n  The first thing I did the week I was elected back in 1948 was to \nattend the Freedom School across the Cooper River in my county in \nNovember. It was one big square building with a potbelly stove in the \nmiddle, with classes in each of the four corners, and one teacher. That \nis what the minorities had in 1948. We didn't start providing adequate \neducational opportunities for minorities until 1954 with Brown vs. \nBoard of Education, and we are still playing catchup. It is not because \nwe haven't made the effort or we do not know what is going on.\n  I really get annoyed when I hear the Senator, not to be identified, \nsay what we want to do is find out what works. Come on, Washington, ha-\nha. We are going to find out what works.\n  Mr. President, I have a school that has been taken over by this \ndistinguished superintendent. It has almost a totally black population. \nThey have the zeal. They have the interest. They don't have the \nwherewithal. Now, we are helping at the State level. But to find out \nwhat works, they only have to go up to the junior high school in \nColumbia, SC, which was extolled in last week's issue of Time magazine, \nor to the Spartanburg High School in Spartanburg, SC, which was the \nfirst 4-time Blue Ribbon School.\n  We know what works. We are working on what works. What really gets \nthis Senator is potentially spending $3 to $7 billion on testing, \naccording to the National Association of State Boards of Education. I \nask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    ESTIMATED COST OF FEDERAL TESTING MANDATE FOR READING AND MATH (DOES NOT INCLUDE SCIENCE ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT)\n     (Calculations on the attached chart were made using the accepted cost scale of developing and administering (scoring, reporting results, etc.)\n  assessments. Developing state tests aligned to standards range from $25-$125 per student. Administering tests is an annual expense that usually runs\n  from $25-$50 per student. The number of students was derived from the 1999-2000 school year enrollment statistics in grades 3-8 in each state. Since\n administration is an ongoing expense, it was calculated based on being implemented in the 2004-05 school year as called for in the President's proposal\n  and detailed in H.R. 1 and running through the remainder of the seven year reauthorization term of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).\n                                 The estimates do not include the cost of the science assessments required in 2007-08.)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

Mr. President, it shows the cost of this particular \napproach.\n  Then we hear Senator after Senator saying curriculum, and the other \none is class size. The other one is better teacher pay. The other one \nis more reading after school, and on down the list of particular needs. \nBut this Washington, one-size-fits-all, unfunded mandate says do as we \nsay do, and go through our $7 billion exercise in futility. And come up \nwith what? Let's assume it works. Let's assume that 30 or 40 schools in \nmy State are closed. You can't go from one county to the other. You \ncan't just waltz from Allendale over to Hampton. You would have to \nchange the laws in South Carolina. We act like we know what is going \non. We are the ones who do not know what is going on. We are the ones \nwho ought to be tested. Come on.\n  Then, of all things, as the distinguished Senator from Minnesota has \nbeen going over and over again, we have given them the test without \ngiving them the course.\n  Sure, I believe in testing. We all believe in testing. But give them \nthe course, and test them on the course. But if you give them the \nwomen, infants, and children nutritional program, they would come into \nthis world with strong minds. If you do not give them Head Start, which \nis only 30 percent covered right now, they aren't prepared to learn \nwhen they enter school. If you do not give them Title I for the \ndisadvantaged--which we only fund at 33 percent of its authorized \nlevel--they haven't had the course. If you do not give them a prepared \nteacher, they don't receive quality instruction. I have had tutors go \ninto some of the schools, and say they were rather embarrassed because \nthe teacher spoke English poorly.\n  So the student hasn't had the course. But in Washington, we know what \nto do. We are going to mandate as much as $7 billion in standardized \ntests before they have had the course. Can't we spend $7 billion giving \nthem the course, giving them good teachers, giving them the small \nclassrooms, curriculum, remedial reading and math, afterschool \nprograms, and give them a good building?\n  Let's take the money and assume we have had the test in effect over \nthe past 4 years. Let's assume it proves schools are failing. So we \nhave schools that are closed down. Let's take the closed-down or about-\nto-be-closed-down schools, because they are not going to do it. Let's \nassume they are the poor schools. We need revenue sharing. I put that \nfirst bill in on February 1, 1967. It worked well until the Senators \nfound out that the Governors were using it to distribute money around \nthe States to run against Senators. Senator Howard Baker and some \nothers repealed it. But it worked.\n  My distinguished colleague from California, Senator Boxer, says there \nis no silver bullet. But there is silver money.\n  What they need is revenue sharing and financial assistance for all \nthese particular endeavors that everybody has. The side-by-side \namendment is curriculum. I tend to support Senator Santorum on that \ncurriculum, and all the other Senators around. But let's not try to \ndignify this flawed approach to public education. It is just downright \npollster politics. They haven't been able to do away with the \nDepartment. They have haven't been able to get tuition tax credits, \nvouchers, or charter schools, or any way to divert money to the private \nsector.\n  Incidentally, I have had children that have gone to both private and \npublic schools. I have a daughter who graduated from Woodrow Wilson \nHigh, and another one who went to Cathedral right here in the District. \nI know the value of both of them.\n  But the duty of the Congress, the United States Senators and the \nUnited States Government is to provide, as John Adams and James Madison \nand Horace Mann said, public education, not private. That isn't how to \ndo it.\n  We cannot oversee the private schools. We cannot dictate to the \nprivate schools. We should not dictate to the private schools. But we \nhave a duty. Do not give me this ``private approach'' like somehow we \ndon't know what works or what works better. We know.\n  Right to the point, if we use this money, we can get something done \nrather than go through an exercise in futility. We are already testing \nin all 50 States. You can't show me a State in the United States that \ndoes not have testing. You can't do it.\n  What we really need to do--and I will yield to my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota in a moment--is fund what works. But now that \nhas to really be upgraded with respect to globalization, the technology \nthat is needed in these classrooms, the good teachers and everything \nelse of that kind. That is what we need to do.\n  Let's not waste money. In the last campaign in 1998, my challenger \ntook me on before all the principals and talked about the bureaucracy \nin Washington--the Washington nanny, the Washington approach. That is \nexactly what this is. This is not helping the local schools at all. \nThis is saying, we are putting you on trial, and you are going to have \nto pay for a good part of it. That is an unfunded mandate. Can you \nimagine such a thing really being signed by the President or suggested \nby a mature body such as the Senate?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit on this debate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe I interrupted the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I will take a couple minutes because the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has said it better than I can.\n  Listening to the Senator from South Carolina, I want to say a couple \nthings. First of all, I want to say one thing personally, which is \nunusual to say, but I hope people were able to listen carefully to the \nhistory behind the remarks.\n  There are some people in our country--I am sorry, but the Senator was \nso kind and gracious, I just sound like a politician engaged in \nflattery--there are few people I have met who I so admire. I cannot \nbelieve the people that were at the heart of the struggle in the South \nwho took on a system of apartheid. And this Senator from South Carolina \nis one of them. There are very few of us who have this history--very \nfew of us. It doesn't mean Senators have to agree with his position on \nthis amendment. But I just wanted to say that. There are some people \nwho showed unbelievable courage and were prophetic. And I feel that way \nabout Senator Hollings from South Carolina.\n  When I was listening to the Senator from South Carolina, I was \nthinking to myself that actually there are a couple different issues \nhere. On one of them, I spent so many hours I felt as if I was giving \nenough speeches to deafen the gods. And maybe that is what happened \nbecause I did not get a lot of votes on\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\nthe amendment that meant the most to me.\n  There were some amendments we did on testing, I say to my colleague, \nthat make this bill better, much, much better if, in fact, it ensures \nthat assessments do not just become standardized, multiple choice \ntests, and rather include multiple, high quality measures.\n\n  Then there was the question of whether or not, if we are going to \nmandate--my colleague talks about unfunded mandates--that every child \nwill be tested in every State, in every school district, in every \ngrade, then I was praying for a Federal mandate or mission that would \nsay that we would also have equality of opportunity for every child in \nour country to be able to do well in these tests, to be able to \nachieve.\n  I think part of what the Senator from South Carolina is saying is \nthat in some ways this is utterly ridiculous. We already know the \nschools where kids have two and three and four teachers during a year. \nWe already know the schools where I would argue housing is becoming a \nmajor educational issue. In some of our towns kids, little kids are \nmoving--little children that are my grandchildren's age--two or three \nor four times during the year.\n  We already know the difference between a beautiful building, that is \ninviting, that tells children that we care about them versus a \ndilapidated, crumbling building that tells children that we don't care \nabout them.\n  We also know of the schools where there are toilets that work and \ncomputer technology and buildings that were warm this winter and are \nnot stifling hot in the summer. We know that that works. As a matter of \nfact, most Senators can look at where their children have gone to \nschool, and they know what works.\n  We already know that the smaller class sizes are good. We already \nknow that support services for teachers are really important, whether \nit be more counselors, whether it be additional teaching assistants to \nhelp children read or to do better in reading or to do better in math. \nWe already know it all. I think that is part of what the Senator is \nsaying.\n  So this amendment says, if a State chooses, in its wisdom, to say, we \ndon't really need to do this, but we would certainly make use of this \nmoney to help the children, to help our kids, to help our schools, to \nhelp our teachers, we leave it up to the States to do so.\n  Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I only have two more points to make, \none point I have not made in this Senate Chamber but I have been \nthinking about this and thinking about this and thinking about this to \nthe point where I just don't even know how to decide how to vote. A \nlarge part of me wants to vote against this bill. On the other hand \nthere are strong improvements in the bill--most particularly mandatory \nfunding for the IDEA program. That is really important. That will help \na lot of our schools, I say to Senator Hollings. It really will.\n  But the other side of the coin is clear. I have asked a question of \nsome of my friends who are more conservative than I. There are a number \nof Senators who may be more conservative than I. But I have asked them: \nHow do we get to this point where the Federal Government is now going \nto mandate--first of all, the NAEP test every year. Despite NAEP's high \nquality these are still new tests that every State is going to have to \ndo.\n  Seven years ago we started some testing under Title I, but we have \nnot even gotten the results on that testing authorized in 1994. We have \nnot begun to evaluate whether or not that testing has had a positive \nimpact on student learning. But now we are going to move ahead and test \nevery child every year.\n\n  We have the Federal Government now telling school districts--which I \nalways thought was the heart of the grassroots political culture in \nAmerica--that it doesn't matter what you have decided you need to do. \nIt doesn't matter how you think you can be most accountable. We, the \nFederal Government, are telling every school district in every State, \nyou will test every child in the third grade, the fourth grade, the \nfifth grade, the sixth grade, the seventh grade, and the eighth grade. \nI do not know whether the Federal Government has any business doing \nthat.\n  I am amazed, frankly, that there is not more opposition. It would \nseem to me a good conservative principle would be that this is an \noverreach.\n  Now people could turn around and say to me: Well, you, of all people, \nSenator Wellstone but, for me, when it comes to civil rights or when it \ncomes to human rights or when it comes to the first amendment or when \nit comes to a floor beneath which no poor child should fall or when it \ncomes to basic educational needs of children or that children should \nnot go hungry, I do not think that is up to a State to decide. To me, \nwe, as a national community, should say, no, we all live by these \nrules, these values.\n  But the other part of me is a decentrist. I do not know whether I \nreally believe the Federal Government has any business telling every \nschool district in every State they have to do this. I think we can \nvery well rue the day that we voted for this.\n  On that philosophical point, as well as on the question of how we are \nsetting a lot of kids and teachers in schools up for failure because we \nhave not committed the resources to make sure they will all have the \nopportunity to learn, it seems to me this amendment speaks of that. \nThat is why I rise to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am obviously very grateful for the \nmore than laudatory, exaggerated remarks. We are good friends. We are \nworking the same side of the street.\n  Let me emphasize, with respect to our minority schools, endeavors \nhave been made there. In 1950-51 in South Carolina, we passed a 3-\npercent sales tax that I authored. We were trying to play catchup ball. \nWhen we increased the sales tax, under Governor Riley, to 5 percent, we \nwere supported by the Black Caucus. I want to emphasize that we were \nopposed at the time by the Chamber of Commerce, the South Carolina \nAssociation of Textile Manufacturers, and the other business groups.\n  Minorities know there is one way to really try to catch up and get a \npiece of this American dream. That is public schools, public education. \nWherever you can give them the support and the means to really \nimplement it, they support public education. I did not want to infer, \nwhen I talked about my Allendale school, that they were not for it. In \nfact, I have other reports in here, with which I will not belabor the \nSenate, on the tremendous improvements already made in the takeover of \nthat particular school. We have worked year in and year out, and we \nstill are trying our best.\n  One of the things that goes into the calculation is the quality of \nthe teacher. If you go to the institutions of higher learning in this \ncountry, public and private, the education degree, in large measure, is \nto take care of the football team. If you have a big, old, hefty 280-\npounder who is not too quick upstairs but very quick with his legs and \neverything else downstairs, then you put him in education. Let him get \ninto an education major. I have discussed this with college presidents. \nWe have been into every facet of this thing.\n  The one big waste is this bill. It is a tremendous waste of time and \nmoney. It should not be. Yes, I agree on the disabilities provisions in \nthere. All of us are frustrated because we all know about the needs. We \nhave been pointing out different needs.

Tenenbaum)\n\n       The end of a school year is always an exciting time. We \n     take time to review the year behind us and immediately begin \n     to plan for the one ahead. The school year just ending has \n     been marked by the most significant student test score \n     improvements in the history of South Carolina's public school \n     system. Indeed, we are well on our way to forever putting to \n     rest the misguided perception that our students and schools \n     cannot succeed. Clearly, they can.\n       South Carolinians should take pride in the progress we are \n     making. Consider these successes from the past year:\n       Students made significant and in some cases dramatic \n     improvements in the latest round of PACT testing, with gains \n     reported across all grade levels, subjects and demographic \n     groups.\n       Scores of South Carolina High School Exit Exam rose nearly \n     three points , the largest gain in a decade.\n       South Carolina high school seniors raised their average SAT \n     score by 12 points, the largest gain in the country and four \n     times the national increase. In addition, South Carolina high \n     school juniors improved their performance on the Preliminary \n     SAT by 5.2 points, nearly four times the national increase of \n     1.4 points.\n       Scores of South Carolina high school seniors taking the ACT \n     college entrance exam rose from the previously year while \n     sophomores who took PLAN--the preliminary ACT--scored one-\n     tenth of a point higher than the national average.\n       Our fifth-, eighth- and 11th -graders scored above the \n     national average in reading, language and math on TerraNova, \n     a nationally standardized test of reading, language and math \n     skills.\n       South Carolina eighth-graders met or exceeded the \n     international average in the Third International Math and \n     Science Study, which compared test sores from students in 38 \n     nations.\n       An analysis by the nonprofit RAND organization of \n     improvements in student reading and math test scores ranked \n     south Carolina 17th among the states.\n       For the fifth consecutive year, the number of South \n     Carolina first-graders scoring ``ready'' for school set a new \n     record. More than 43,000 first-graders--a record 85.2 \n     percent--met the state's readiness standard. That was a 13 \n     percentage-point improvement from 1995, the year before the \n     state began a three-year phase-in of full day kindergarten. \n     The biggest improvement were by minority students and \n     students from low-income families.\n       In the midst of these test score improvements, the national \n     report card ``Quality Counts 2001,'' published by the \n     respected national magazine Education Week, recognized South \n     Carolina's efforts to improve teacher quality and raise \n     academic standards, South Carolina was ranked among the top \n     six states in the nation in both categories.\n       This report was especially significant, because I believe \n     that a major reason for South Carolina's success has been our \n     dramatic raising of academic standards. By setting the bar so \n     high, and by creating the extremely rigorous PACT tests to \n     measure our progress, we have challenged our students and \n     schools--and they have responded.\n       I do not mean to suggest that the struggle to build a \n     world-class school system in South Carolina has been won. \n     Although it's true that we have schools in our state that are \n     as excellent as any in the nation, we also have schools that \n     struggle to provide their students with even the most basic \n     education.\n       This November, South Carolina's first school report cards \n     will be published under the mandate of the Education \n     Accountability Act of 1998. Many schools will have their \n     excellence confirmed, and others will be identified as \n     needing extensive assistance. As State Superintendent of \n     Education, I can assure you that these schools will get that \n     assistance.\n       But as we await November's report cards, let's remember the \n     amazing accomplishments of the school year that's now ending. \n     Our progress is real, and it is undeniable. South Carolina \n     educators, students, parents, businesses, and communities are \n     proving every day that focus and hard work pay off.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article \nin today's Washington Post, ``From Teachers to Drill Sergeants,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 12, 2001]\n\n                    From Teachers to Drill Sergeants\n\n                            (By Jay Mathews)\n\n       I have watched hundreds of teachers over the last two \n     decades and am sure of one thing: I couldn't last two days in \n     their jobs. After the first day, my throat would be sore, my \n     legs wobbly and my energy level needle pointing below empty. \n     That night I would fall asleep trying to make a new lesson \n     plan.\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\n     The next morning I would call in sick, making it clear I had \n     an incurable, terminal illness.\n       So it is unbelievably presumptuous of me to write columns \n     and give speeches on how to make schools better. I regularly \n     remind myself, and anyone who might be listening, that when \n     it comes to talking about education, I am just a balding, 5-\n     foot-6-inch playback machine. The thoughts are not mine, but \n     those of the many educators, as well as students and parents, \n     who have patiently explained to me over the years what is \n     going on, and why.\n       I am always amazed that such smart and busy people have \n     time for me. That is especially true these last few weeks. \n     Scores of readers have responded to the request in my May 22 \n     column for a precise accounting of how the new state \n     achievement tests affect teaching. I now have a much deeper \n     appreciation of what the tests--and administrators' ill-\n     considered reaction to them--have done to many schools.\n       Only about half of the teachers who wrote me said they had \n     been forced to change their teaching, but that is because in \n     many cases they refused to alter what was working for their \n     students. ``My philosophy has long been, continues to be, and \n     . . . will continue to be largely the test,'' said Al Dieste, \n     who teaches at-risk middle schoolers at Springfield Community \n     Day School, a public school in Columbia, Calif. ``I teach; \n     the test be damned.''\n       Lisa Donmoyer, a kindergarten to eighth grade science \n     specialist in Easton, Md., said ``a rich, interesting \n     classroom is more likely to produce students who do well on \n     the test than a classroom where the teacher employs the \n     `drill and kill' method.''\n       But in many cases, teachers said, administrators made it \n     very difficult to do the right thing.\n       At one Fairfax County high school, non-honors students were \n     dropped from in-class National History Day essay writing \n     activities so they would have more time to study for the \n     Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL) tests, even though some \n     non-honors students had won previous district competitions.\n       Hewitt, Tex., high school teacher Donna Garner resigned in \n     protest when her popular program for teaching the lost art of \n     grammar was banned because it conflicted with the step-by-\n     step schedule for preparing for the Texas Assessment of \n     Academic Skills (TAAS) tests.\n       A third-grade teacher in Fort Worth, said her principal \n     asked her if she had designated as many students as possible \n     for special education classes so they would be exempt from \n     the tests and make the school average higher.\n       Raymond Larrabee was told his son's eighth-grade honors \n     English class would not have time to read all of Charles \n     Dickens' ``David Copperfield'' because there were too many \n     topics to cover for the Massachusetts Comprehensive \n     Assessment System (MACAS) test.\n       A Florida principal told a novice teacher that her wide-\n     ranging discussions of the possible answers to sample test \n     questions was a waste of time. Just tell them which answers \n     are correct, she was told.\n       Doug Graney, a history teacher at Herndon High School in \n     Fairfax, and a recently retired Arlington teacher who asked \n     not to be identified, dropped their engaging approach to U.S. \n     history because of the SOLs. They had been starting with post \n     World War II history, stimulating family discussions about \n     events their students' parents and grandparents had \n     witnessed. Then they went back to colonial days to show how \n     it had all started.\n       The e-mails illuminated two problems that I think all sides \n     in the testing debate would acknowledge. First, some states \n     may be demanding that teachers cover too much, ensuring once-\n     over-lightly instruction. Second, many principals, moved by \n     blind panic or cross-town rivalry, are demanding more test \n     prep--taking practice tests, learning testing strategies, \n     memorizing key essay words--than is necessary or useful.\n       Problem one is something for state school boards and \n     superintendents to ponder. Problem two is, at least in part, \n     something that teachers can do something about.\n       Okay. I know. I am the coward who lacks the fortitude to \n     even try teaching. But I think many educators are right when \n     they say that too many of their colleagues are obeying their \n     principals rather than their principles.\n       Even pointy-headed, fire-breathing managers will back off \n     if key employees tell them results will only come if they \n     butt out. That takes gumption, but it is worth a try.\n       Gerald Gontarz, a sixth-grade science and social studies \n     teacher in Plymouth, NH., drops raw chicken eggs from \n     airplanes and sends up hot air balloons to involve kids in \n     his lessons. ``Much of the time I spend on this stuff will \n     not help my students take the test.'' he said. But ``it \n     really turns them on, and honestly, there is no state test \n     that measures' students' motivation.''\n       Kenneth Bernstein, a ninth-grade social studies teacher in \n     Prince George's County, stated what should be the teacher's \n     creed: ``I will not object to testing if you will allow me to \n     get my kids ready the best way I can, and not also mandate \n     the specific steps of instruction, for then I cannot teach \n     the individual child.''\n       I sensed some teachers are having second thoughts about \n     groveling before the testing gods. Graney, for instance, told \n     me in a follow-up e-mail that he plans to return to his \n     reverse approach to U.S. history.\n       The results are still important. A teacher should be able \n     to raise his class's overall achievement level a significant \n     amount from September to April or May. Some students will \n     falter because of unhappy home lives or test anxiety or other \n     factors beyond a teacher's control, but on average there \n     should be progress. If there isn't, I don't think the teacher \n     can blame the test.\n       Many educators will object to this. They say the tests are \n     too narrow and their own assessments of each child should be \n     enough. In many cases, they are right, but parents cannot \n     stay in the classroom all year making certain of this. I \n     don't think I will ever be comfortable without an independent \n     measure of how my child and her school are doing, and I think \n     the vast majority of parents feel the same way.\n       I think we can agree on one thing: Principals and \n     superintendents should not force good teachers to turn \n     themselves into drill sergeants if there are better ways to \n     teach the material. Administrators should set the goals and \n     let their teachers decide how to meet them, then find ways to \n     help those teachers who do not measure up.\n       Most principals already do that, but since so many of them \n     are portrayed as clumsyvillains by my e-mail correspondents, \n     they deserve a chance to defend themselves. My e-mail address \n     is mathewsj@washpost.com. How many of you administrators are \n     telling your teachers to fill their class time with practice \n     tests? Are you sure that is the best way to go?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is a piece Jay Mathews wrote. I want to give some \nexamples from this article. There is one thing he mentions that is \nreally important:\n\n       I have watched hundreds of teachers over the last two \n     decades and am sure of one thing: I couldn't last two days in \n     their jobs. After the first day, my throat would be sore, my \n     legs wobbly and my energy level needle pointing below empty. \n     That night I would fall asleep trying to make a new lesson \n     plan. The next morning I would call in sick, making it clear \n     that I had an incurable, terminal disease.\n\n  Then the article gets much more serious. Part of the insulting \nassumption of this legislation is that the teachers in this country \ndon't want to be held accountable, that we now have to do the tests to \nshow that they really are not doing their job.\n  There are, of course, teachers you will find who subtract from \nchildren, but many of them are saints. And I doubt that there is one \nSenator who condemns these teachers who could last an hour in the \nclassrooms they condemn. If you go and visit schools, teachers are \ntalking about other issues: What happens to children before they get to \nschool; the whole question of kids who come to kindergarten way behind. \nThey are talking about the lack of affordable housing, children who are \ncoming to school hungry today in America, class size and all of the \nrest of it. That is what they are talking about. But our response is to \ngo to these tests and to assume that somehow, once children are tested, \neverything will become better.\n  I want to give some examples Jay Mathews gives today, about the \neffect that an over-reliance on testing can have on the classroom. He \nwrites:\n\n       Lisa Donmoyer, a kindergarten to eighth grade science \n     specialist in Easton, Md., said ``a rich, interesting \n     classroom is more likely to produce students who do well on \n     the test than a classroom where the teacher employs the \n     `drill and kill' method.''\n       But in many cases, teachers said, administrators make it \n     difficult to do the right thing.\n       Hewitt, Tex., high school teacher Donna Garner resigned in \n     protest when her popular program for teaching the lost art of \n     grammar was banned because it conflicted with the step-by-\n     step schedule for preparing for the Texas Assessment of \n     Academic Skill (TAAS) tests.\n       A third grade teacher in Fort Worth said her principal \n     asked her if she had designated as many students as possible \n     for special education classes so they would be exempt from \n     the tests and make the school average higher.\n       Raymond Larrabee was told his son's eighth grade honors \n     English class would not have the time to read all of Charles \n     Dickens' ``David Copperfield'' because there were too many \n     topics to cover for the Massachusetts Comprehensive \n     Assessment System (MCAS) test.\n       A Florida principal told a novice teacher that her wide-\n     ranging discussion of the possible answers to sample test \n     questions was a waste of time. Just tell them which answers \n     are correct, she was told.\n       Doug Graney, a history teacher at Herndon High School in \n     Fairfax, and a recently retired Arlington teacher who asked \n     not to be identified, dropped their engaging approach to U.S. \n     history because of the [Virginia standard of learning test]. \n     They had been starting with post World War II history, \n     stimulating family discussions about events their \n     students' parents and grandparents had witnessed. Then \n     they went back to colonial days to show how it all \n     started.\n\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n\n  So I just want to issue this warning, about where I am afraid we are \nheading: I think in the absence of the resources and with the \noverreliance on tests that is emerging, what we are going to have is, \nas one teacher put it so well to Jonathan Kozol, you are going to have \ngreat teachers living in ``examination hell.'' A lot of the really good \nteachers are going to get out. In fact, they are now. Some of the \nreally great teachers are just refusing to be drill instructors, \nteaching to tests, tests, tests. They are leaving. This is the opposite \ndirection from where we should be going.\n  It is very much the case that the best teachers are the ones who are \nnot going to want to be teaching to these tests. And frankly, some of \nthe worst teachers can do it.\n  When I am in schools, and I have been in a school about every 2 weeks \nfor the last 10 and a half years I ask the students, when we get into a \ndiscussion of education: What do you think makes for a good education? \nYou are the experts. Before class size, before technology, before \nanything else, they say: Good teachers.\n  Then I say: What makes for a good teacher? I never hear students say: \nWell, the really good teachers are the teachers who teach to \nworksheets. The really good teachers are the teachers who basically \nhave us memorizing all the time and then regurgitating that back on \ntests. They talk about teachers who spend time with them, teachers who \nfire their imagination, teachers who don't just transmit knowledge but \nbasically empower them to figure out how to live their lives. They talk \nabout teachers who get the students to connect personally to the books \nthat are being discussed, to the ideas that are being discussed, to how \nthose ideas affect their lives. That is what they talk about.\n  That is not the direction we are going, not with what we are bringing \ndown from the Federal Government, top-down to school districts all \nacross our land. Again, that is why this amendment is so important.\n  I thank my colleague for the amendment. I am proud to support him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 1 on Wednesday, June 13, at 9 a.m. with 40 \nminutes for closing debate on the Santorum amendment No. 799 and the \nHollings amendment No. 798 concurrently, with 20 minutes each prior to \nvotes in relation to the amendments, with no second-degree amendments \nin order prior to the votes, and that the Santorum amendment be voted \non first. Further, I ask that following disposition of the Santorum and \nHollings amendments, Senator Landrieu be recognized to call up her \namendment No. 474, with 30 minutes for debate in the usual form prior \nto a vote in relation to her amendment, with no second-degree \namendments in order; further, following disposition of the Landrieu \namendment, Senator Dodd be recognized to call up his amendment No. 382 \nregarding 21st century afterschool programs, with 2 hours for debate \nprior to a vote on a motion to table the amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would first like to express my \nappreciation to the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate's \nHealth, Education Labor and Pensions Committee for accepting this \nimportant amendment to S. 1, the Better Education for Students and \nTeachers Act.\n  Simply put, the amendment that I have offered will help protect the \nability of school counselors, social workers, psychologists and others \nto receive professional development and training as determined by local \nschool districts.\n  Each of us in this body wants what's best for our Nation's children, \nand when it comes to their education, we want our schools and our \neducators to find ways to provide a first-class education for our \nchildren, to ensure their safety, and to help them develop their God-\ngiven talents so they may become upstanding, contributing members of \nour society.\n  Nearly everyone agrees our schools need help, but not everyone agrees \non which way is best. That is why we in the Senate have tried to put \ntogether this Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization \nbill that gives our states and localities the flexibility to do what is \nnecessary to improve their schools.\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n  Part of educating, protecting, and preparing our students is seeing \nto it that they get the help they need to succeed in the classroom. \nThat is why I offered this amendment to make pupil services personnel \neligible to be recipients of title II professional development funds.\n  Pupil services personnel, the men and women who are our school \ncounselors, school psychologists, school social workers, and other \nschool-based personnel, are essential components in our effort to \nguarantee that no child is left behind. These educators help ensure \nstudent achievement by securing a safe learning environment, helping to \nsolve problems students experience that extend far beyond the \nschoolyard, and crafting a challenging, personalized, college-oriented \ncurriculum so that all students have a chance to succeed.\n  To maximize State and local flexibility, it is important that pupil \nservices personnel be included under title II programs. For example, if \na school district wants to engage a team of teachers, principals, and \npupil services personnel in a comprehensive curriculum reform planning \nprogram, Federal law should not exclude part of that team from taking \npart in those activities if they use title II funds. Nothing in my \namendment would mandate that title II funds have to be spent on these \neducators, only that we not rule out their participation, which I \nbelieve would limit state and local flexibility. Further, adding pupil \nservices personnel under title II ``allowable uses'' does not add any \nadditional funds on top of those already authorized in this ESEA \nreauthorization legislation.\n  Pupil service organizations represent more than one million people \nwho work and teach in our schools. Allowing these educators access to \ntitle II professional development opportunities could unlock innovative \napproaches to reduce barriers to classroom learning and integrate \nfuture planning-like professional or college preparation-into classroom \npractice. In Ohio, it leaves options open to include an estimated \n40,000 school-based educators in professional development activities. \nFor the students and parents served by these educators, the benefits of \nhaving highly-trained, integrated pupil services staff are potentially \nshared by tens of thousands of additional stakeholders each year.\n  Achieving school reform and improving student achievement requires \nthe support and active participation of all educators in each school. I \nhope my colleagues will agree that, using our limited role in educating \nour children, we will provide the flexibility to promote innovative, \ncoordinated professional development opportunities that may help \ngenerate solutions to the problems that face our schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6120-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  McGOVERN-DOLE INTERNATIONAL FOOD ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly in support \nof the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child \nNutrition Act of 2001. I am proud to join Senators Harkin, Durbin, and \nLeahy, who were instrumental in the introduction of this bill, as well \nas my other colleagues who are co-sponsors. Additionally, I would like \nto acknowledge the efforts of two former members of this body, Senators \nGeorge McGovern and Bob Dole, who worked tirelessly to initiate this \nprogram decades ago.\n  As many of my colleagues well know, almost 300 million children in \nthis world go hungry on a daily basis. Can you imagine that--300 \nmillion children? The number is staggering--almost five percent of the \nworld's population; more than the population of our entire country. \nThink of it--if everyone, every person that we know, every man, woman \nand child in the United States, did not get enough to eat. If that were \nthe case, I would imagine that we in this chamber would not hesitate to \ntake action and remedy the situation. That is what this bill attempts \nto do; it is merely a first step, an important step for these hundreds \nof millions of children who are going hungry around the world.\n  We must ensure that every child, no matter where they live, no matter \nwhat their income level, receives at least one nutritious meal per day. \nOne meal per day, for every child in the world. As little as that may \nseem to those of us here, it could mean the difference between life and \ndeath for many of these children. I make sure that my son and daughter \nget three nutritious meals a day; I am sure that all of my colleagues \ndo the same for their children. It is not too much to ask that we \nprovide just one meal for these hungry children all over the world.\n  But this is not just about meals; as noble a goal as that is, this is \nalso about education. Of these 300 million children, almost half are \nnot in school. What we are trying to do is encourage these children to \nattend school by helping their schools feed them when they are there. \nAs George McGovern himself said, ``The school lunch brings children to \nschool; education lowers the birthrate, increases personal income, and \nprovides a market for surplus farm commodities.''; So it not just a \nmeal we are helping to provide for these children; it is an education.\n  Finally, for some who may say this is a handout, it is not. This \nprogram is designed to help developing countries set up their own \nschool lunch programs, so that one day they can take full \nresponsibility for feeding their students. In other words, this is not \na handout, but a hand up. There is an old saying that if you give a man \na fish, he eats for a day; if you teach him to fish, he eats for a \nlifetime. We are trying to teach these countries how to fish, by \nproviding them the means to do so.

It is only \ntoo appropriate that Senator Thurmond lead the charge for designating \none day annually on which we recognize the contributions of our \nairborne divisions in the military.\n  The greatest amphibious invasion in military history was at Normandy. \nOn June 6, 1944, under the leadership of General Eisenhower, an \ninvasion force of over 2.8 million military members, including \n1,627,000 Americans gathered in Southern England. These forty-five \ndivisions included Americans, Brits, Canadians, French and Poles \nfighting alongside one another.\n  Among those forty-five divisions were 13,000 paratroopers from the \n82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. These paratroopers and glider troops \nbegan their assault at 1:00 a.m. on June 6. They were spread out over \n50 miles between the Cotentin Peninsula and the Orne River. Met with \nferocious and lethal German resistance, by the end of the day the 101st \nhad suffered 1,240 casualties, and the 82nd lost 1,259 men. Then 41-\nyear-old Strom Thurmond survived and went on to win five battle stars.\n  We suffered heavy casualties in those first hours of fighting on the \ncoasts of Northern France. U.S. casualties alone totaled 6,603 men. \nHowever, D Day marked the first step in our push toward victory in \nEurope. Not only does D Day mark the beginning of the end of the \ntyrannical forces unleashed on the Western European continent in the \n1930s, it represents the beginning of many decades of struggle to \nreconstruct democratic and free Nations from the rubble of World War \nII.\n  This week we celebrate the 57th Anniversary of D-Day. I stand to \nrecognize the valor of that greatest generation who persevered to \nprotect our freedom. Undeniably, the airborne forces played a vital \nrole in achieving victory. The Airborne divisions that fought on D-Day \nare still represented in today's Army, with the 82nd in Fort Bragg, NC, \nand the 101st in Fort Campbell, KY.\n  In the last sixty years, our airborne forces have performed in \nimportant military and peace-keeping operations in World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, Lebanon, Sinai, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Somalia, \nHaiti, and Bosnia. On August 16, 2001, the 61st anniversary of the \nfirst official parachute jump by the Parachute Test Platoon, we will \nrecognize the role of part and current patriots in our airborne forces.\n  I thank Senator Thurmond for his unyielding courage as a paratrooper \nand his vision as a leader. I strongly support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6120-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6120-S6121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nlegislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The Local law \nEnforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlegislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society.\n  I would like to describe a horrific crime that occurred February 19, \n1999 in Sylacauga, AL. Billy Jack Gaither, 39, was abducted and \nbrutally murdered in a remote area. Two men, who later claimed to be \nangry over an alleged sexual advance by Gaither, went to a secluded \nboat ramp to find him. They beat Gaither and threw him in the trunk of \nhis own car. Gaither was then taken to the banks of Peckerwood Creek, \nwhere many area churches used to hold baptisms. The two men then beat \nthe 39-year-old man to death with an ax handle, and later burned his \nbody on a pyre of old tires.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6121-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

This award is based on a study conducted \nby Solucient Leadership Institute, the Nation's largest healthcare \nclearinghouse.\n  In deciding which hospitals received this outstanding award, \nSolucient compared intensive care units throughout the country on four \nmeasures: death rates; complications; how long patients stayed in \nunits; and cost of care. By being named one of the Nation's Top 100 \nICUs, Bristol Regional Medical Center has proven that it can be \nconsidered among the best in its field in providing top quality care in \nits ICU, with shorter stays, lower costs, and fewer deaths and \ncomplications. We can truly realize how fortunate we are in this region \nto have such a wonderful hospital providing top-notch care for \nVirginians in the Commonwealth.\n  To the doctors, nurses, administrators, and all the other employees \nat the Medical Center, I want to extend the highest commendation and \ncongratulations for receiving this award, and I salute you on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. I commend you all for your efforts and for \nproviding the highest quality of care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6121-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO DR. KENNETH MORTIMER, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII PRESIDENT\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Kenneth P. \nMortimer, the 11th President of the University of Hawaii. He served \nHawaii's premier institution of higher learning for 8 years with \nintegrity and distinction.\n  Dr. Mortimer has led the University of Hawaii forward during one of \nthe longest and most severe economic downturns in our State's history. \nWith massive cutbacks to the University's budget, President Mortimer \ninstituted difficult, oftentimes painful cost-saving measures, to allow \nthe University to provide a quality education for all students with a \nrenewed focus on its core mission.\n  In addition, during this difficult economic period, President \nMortimer launched an ambitious 4-year $100 million capital campaign to \nraise private funds for endowments, improvements, and scholarships. The \ncampaign concluded ahead of schedule on May 31, 2001, having exceeded \ntheir goal by $16 million. The campaign raised needed funds during a \ncritical period in the school's history. It also established a strong \nfoundation for continued large giving.\n  But, most importantly I believe the capital campaign demonstrated to \none and all--students, alumni, community--that the University of Hawaii \nis good enough, worthy enough, to request and secure such large giving. \nI was proud to serve as an honorary co-chair of the campaign. It took \nleadership and guts to launch such a campaign. It took perseverance and \ncommitment to ensure its success. President Mortimer can be proud of \nthis legacy he leaves behind.\n  There is another very important mark Dr. Mortimer will leave behind \nfor the university. It is carved into Hawaii's most sacred legal \ndocument--our State Constitution. No president had ever tried to do \nwhat President Mortimer set out to do, namely to secure constitutional \nautonomy for the University of Hawaii, giving the institution a greater \nsay in its own affairs, fiscal, legal and otherwise. First, landmark \nlegislation was passed by the Hawaii State Legislature to allow the \nissue of constitutional autonomy to be placed on the Hawaii ballot in \nNovember of 2000. Second, Dr. Mortimer mounted an aggressive ``vote \nyes'' campaign which received a resounding approval of the people. \nAnother milestone achieved, another foundation laid to help assure the \nUniversity's future success.\n  There are many more accomplishments, too many to name, that can be \nattributed to Dr. Mortimer. He led my alma mater forward during a most \ndifficult time in our State's history. He did so with a quiet dignity \nand a steadfast resolve. He listened and then acted.\n  The University of Hawaii is stronger as a direct result of his \nleadership. He never lost sight of what I have known all along--the \nUniversity of Hawaii is a great institution of higher learning, not \njust a good institution, but a great one. Dr. Mortimer believed it in \nhis heart and represented us as such to all he came in contact with. He \ngave of himself--with his time, skill and aloha--and the University is \nricher and wiser for it.\n  On behalf of the people of Hawaii, I would like to express my \npersonal appreciation to Ken and Lorie for their years of service and \ncommitment to academic excellence. My heartfelt wishes are with them as \nthey embark on a new journey together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6121-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6121-S6122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES P. LEDDY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJames P. Leddy, an outstanding Vermonter and humanitarian. In \nrecognition of his retirement as Executive Director of The Howard \nCenter for Human Services in Burlington, VT, it is important to reflect \non how much one person can accomplish in serving others.\n  From the beginning of his career, Jim was drawn to serving the most \nneedy, most isolated, and often the most misunderstood and underserved \npeople in our society. His work took him to individuals who were \nincarcerated, living with illness or disability, and to those \nrecovering from addiction.\n  Jim began his 30-year history of compassionate service to Vermonters \nas a direct-service provider and quickly rose to leadership positions. \nHis vision for improving the lives of individuals with disabilities put \nhim at the helm of The Howard Center for Human Services. Under his \ndirection ``community inclusion'' and ``self-determination''\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nbecame the guiding principles for serving individuals and their \nfamilies. Those who had historically been sheltered from society began \nto live, work and recreate in their communities.\n  Not only has The Howard Center for Human Services been recognized for \ndeveloping new and innovative programs, but Vermont also gained \nrecognition for showing the way to other States in the country. Jim is \nto be commended for the part he played in national movement to provide \ncommunity-based services to people with disabilities.\n  Under Jim's leadership, The Howard Center grew from a budget of $1.6 \nmillion with a staff of 55 to a budget of $30 million and a staff of \nover 550 individuals. While Jim was growing a mental health service, he \nalso advocated for relationships and wrap-around services with other \nproviders. In this, as in every other capacity, his mark has been felt \nfar beyond the boundaries of Chittenden County, VT.\n  Vermont has much to be grateful for, in view of Jim's steadfast \ncommitment to improving the quality of life in our State. He was a \nfounding member of programs such as the Champlain Valley Crime Stoppers \nand Dismas House, a residential program for ex-offenders. He has served \non boards, such as the Mayor's Council on Human Services for the City \nof Burlington, the Governor's Council on Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nProblems, and the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nDirectors, to name a few. Jim is a true public servant, and in 1999, he \nbecame a member of the Vermont State Legislature and brought his \nknowledge, experience and deep commitment to Vermont to all its \ncitizens. It is reassuring to know that his legacy will lead The Howard \nCenter for Human Services and the greater community of Vermont itself \nfor years to come.\n  Jim's unwavering commitment toward improving the status of Vermont \nand its citizens serves as a testament to us all. Vermont is truly \nindebted to him. His deep commitment to the citizens of the Green \nMountain State has endeared him to us. He has our sincerest good wishes \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6122-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING ANNE M.

However, her \ninvolvement with the Temple did not end there.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State of the State of \n     Minnesota is directed to prepare copies of this memorial and \n     transmit them to the President of the United States, the \n     President and Secretary of the Senate, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the House of Representatives, and Minnesota's Senators and \n     Representatives in Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-102. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Minnesota relative to funding for the improvement \n     and rehabilitation of waterways; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                            Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, waterway transportation is the most efficient \n     means of transporting bulk commodities, transports more tons \n     per gallon of fuel than either rail or truck while causing \n     fewer accidents, less noise pollution, and fewer fatalities \n     and traffic delays, provides a positive quality of life to \n     the citizens of Minnesota, and is the most environmentally \n     sound mode of transportation available; and\n       Whereas, because of its geographic location, Minnesota is \n     disadvantaged by the distance commodities must travel when \n     transported between Minnesota and domestic and international \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, farm products, petroleum, coal, aggregates, \n     fertilizer, salt, iron ore, metal products, and other bulk \n     commodities needed by agriculture, industry, and the public \n     sector are essential components of commerce and vital to the \n     continued health of our national, local, and state economies; \n     and\n       Whereas, the inland waterway lock and dam system provides \n     recreational and eco-tourism opportunities to Minnesota, a \n     reliable water source of 25 billion gallons per year for \n     residential and industrial use in the Twin Cities area, and a \n     cooling source for power plants which provide over 4,800 \n     Minnesota jobs; and\n       Whereas, our transportation infrastructure enables \n     agricultural products and other exported commodities to \n     compete successfully in international markets and leads \n     toward a favorable balance of trade for our national economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, our waterway transportation infrastructure shares \n     the public waters with the natural environment; and\n       Whereas, the natural environment provides public benefits \n     such as recreation, tourism, domestic and industrial water \n     supply, and scientific and educational opportunities which \n     are also important elements to Minnesota's economy; and\n       Whereas, the Upper Mississippi River is a natural resource \n     of statewide, regional, national, and international \n     importance due to its status as one of the largest floodplain \n     areas in the world, its importance as a migratory corridor \n     for 40 percent of all North American Waterfowl and the \n     sanctuary it provides to more than 200 species of threatened, \n     endangered, or rare plants and animals; and\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes Seaway serves Minnesota by moving \n     its bulk products to domestic and foreign destinations, \n     amounting to over 65 million tons annually, including 43 \n     million tons of Minnesota iron ore to steel mills in \n     Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, although dredging and maintenance of the seaway \n     system is financed by the users, financing of the new Sault \n     Ste. Marie Lock (owned and operated by United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers) will be shared by the federal government \n     and the eight seaway states on a prorated tonnage basis, \n     requiring an estimated $18 million from the state to be paid \n     over a 50-year period; and\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n       Whereas, the inland waterway system moves 17 million tons \n     of bulk commodities annually between Minnesota and the \n     eastern seaboard and Gulf states, including approximately 10 \n     million tons of agricultural products exported through gulf \n     ports; and\n       Whereas, dredging and maintenance costs of the inland \n     waterway are paid out of federal funds, and financing of \n     capital improvements to the inland waterway system is 50 \n     percent from federal funds and 50 percent from the Inland \n     Waterways Trust Fund, funded by a 20 cent per gallon fuel tax \n     paid by waterway shippers; and\n       Whereas, the river industry has been taxed on fuel since \n     1980, and since the Inland Waterways Trust Fund was \n     instituted in 1986, the Upper Mississippi River basin has \n     contributed 40 percent of the funds and received only 15 \n     percent return for capital improvements, making the Upper \n     Midwest a tax donor region to the Ohio River valley and \n     others; and\n       Whereas, the Port Development Assistance Program is the \n     vehicle to rehabilitate Minnesota's public ports on the \n     Mississippi River and Lake Superior; and\n       Whereas, this program updates and improves the operation \n     and efficiency of the ports to keep them viable and \n     competitive; and\n       Whereas, the 1996, 1998, and 2000 Minnesota legislatures \n     appropriated funds for this program, and the 2001 legislature \n     will be requested to appropriate an additional $3 million to \n     this program; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved that the Minnesota Legislature, Supports \n     Minnesota's pro rata participation in financing new \n     construction at the Sault Ste. Marie Lock, Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature formally recognizes the \n     Upper Mississippi River as a river of statewide significance \n     for natural, navigational, and recreational benefits. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes the critical \n     habitat restoration and rehabilitation needs on the Upper \n     Mississippi River. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes the importance or \n     inland waterway transportation to Minnesota agriculture and \n     to the economy of the state, the region, and the nation and \n     urges Congress to authorize funding to improve transportation \n     efficiency and restore the ecological values of the Upper \n     Mississippi River System. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports the continued \n     funding of the Port Development Assistance Program in \n     recognition of the essential and fundamental contribution the \n     Great Lakes and inland waterway transportation systems make \n     to Minnesota's economy and to sustainable environmental \n     programs.

The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to enact into law as soon as possible the \n     ``Great Falls Historic District Study Act of 2001'' (S. 386/\n     H.R. 146).\n       2.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance privacy \nprotections for individuals, to prevent fraudulent misuse of the Social \nSecurity account number, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce legislation \nthat is designed to protect the privacy of all Americans from identity \ntheft caused by theft or abuse of an individual's Social Security \nnumber, SSN.\n  Identity theft is the fastest growing financial crime in the Nation, \naffecting an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 people annually. Allegations \nof fraudulent Social Security number use for identity theft increased \nfrom 62,000 in 1999 to over 90,000 in 2000--this is a 50 percent \nincrease in just one year.\n  It's no wonder why, in Wall Street Journal poll last year, \nrespondents ranked privacy as their number one concern in the 21st \ncentury, ahead of wars, terrorism, and environmental disasters.\n  All to often, the first clue someone has that their identity has been \nstolen comes when retail stores, banks, or credit card companies send \nletters wanting payment on bad checks or overdue bills that the \nindividual hadn't written or knew nothing about.\n  More than 75 percent of the time identity theft cases that take place \nare ``true name'' fraud. That is when someone uses your social security \nnumber to open new accounts in your name. The common criminal can apply \nfor credit cards, buy a car, obtain personal, business, auto, or real \nestate loans, do just about anything in your name and you may not even \nknow about it for months or even years. Across the country there are \npeople who can tell you about losing their life savings or having their \ncredit history damaged, simply because someone had obtained their \nSocial Security number and fraudulently assumed their identity.\n  This bill prohibits the sale of Social Security numbers by the \nprivate sector, Federal, State and local government agencies. This bill \nstrengthens existing criminal penalties for enforcement of Social \nSecurity number violations to include those by government employees. It \namends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to include Social Security number \nas part of the information protected under the law, enhances law \nenforcement authority of the Office of Inspector General, and allows \nFederal courts to order defendants to make restitution to the Social \nSecurity trust funds.\n  This bill would also prohibit the display of Social Security numbers \non drivers licenses, motor vehicles registration, and other related \nidentification records, like the official Senate ID Card.\n  This new legislation reflects a small number of fair and appropriate \nmodifications, including the following: Since the Federal Trade \nCommission does not have jurisdiction over financial institutions, our \nbill would now authorize the U.S. Attorney General to issue regulations \nrestricting the sale and purchase of Social Security numbers in the \nprivate sector; similar to our provisions affecting the public sector, \nwe make explicit our intent that the prohibition of sale, purchase, or \ndisplay of Social Security numbers in the private sector would not \napply if Social Security numbers are needed to enforce child support \nobligations; to help prevent other individuals from suffering the same \ntragic fate as Amy Boyer, we include a new provision that prohibits a \nperson from obtaining or using another person's Social Security number \nin order to locate that individual with the intent to physically injure \nor harm the individual or use their identity for an illegal purpose; \nand we have clarified the provision that would prohibit businesses from \ndenying services to individuals an exception for those businesses that \nare required by Federal law to submit the individual's Social Security \nnumber to the Federal Government.\n  I think that it is high time that we get back to the original purpose \nof the social security number. Social Security numbers were designed to \nbe used to track workers and their earnings so that their benefits \ncould be accurately calculated when a worker retires--nothing else.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1015. A bill to require the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations to address safety concerns and to minimize delays for \nmotorists at railroad grade crossings; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nRailroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act with Senator Stabenow and Senator \nDurbin. This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation to \nissue regulations within one year to address the safety concerns that \narise when trains block traffic at railroad crossings.\n  Sixteen States and many more municipalities have passed statutes and \nordinances limiting the amount of time a train is allowed to stop at \nand thus block a railroad grade crossing. There are specific safety \nreasons for limiting the time roadways can be blocked by trains. \nHowever, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan \nstruck down a Michigan statute regulating the length of time that a \ntrain may block a roadway, opening up the safety issues that my bill \nwill address. The ordinance in question prohibited trains from \nobstructing free passage of any street for longer than five minutes in \norder to minimize safety problems within communities.\n  The court concluded that the ordinance was preempted by the Federal \nRailway Safety Act, FRSA. Unfortunately, there is no Federal regulation\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\naddressing the length of time a train may block a grade crossing. That \nmeans the State of Michigan and all of its political subdivisions are \nnow without the authority to provide this regulation and have no other \nremedy. They are urging the passage of Federal legislation to regulate \nthe length of time a train may block a roadway in the interest of \npublic health and safety. They are calling for Federal action to give \nthem relief from the 45 minutes or more that trains are currently \nsitting in railway crossings and blocking their roadways.\n  Believe it or not, trains actually stop in the middle of \nintersections for 45 minutes or longer at a time. I have been given \nexamples of trains in Michigan that have sat for hours at crossings. \nYou can imagine the ramifications of major intersections being \ncompletely blocked for so long.\n  This nationwide problem is amplified in Southeast Michigan because of \nthe number of rail lines in the region. For example, this lack of \nregulation is causing a lot of problems for some of the older \nmunicipalities in Michigan as train tracks literally cris-cross their \ncities. For instance, in Trenton, MI, there is an entire neighborhood \nthat is bordered on one side by water on two sides by train tracks, \nforming a triangle. If two trains block the tracks at the same time, \nwhich has happened, the residents are literally trapped. Worse than the \nresidents being trapped is the fact that ambulances, police and fire \ntrucks are trapped out of town, or delayed in getting to their \nemergency destinations.\n  Unless we take action and require the FRA to act, communities with \nrail crossings are vulnerable. The problems range from the problem of \ntraffic congestion and delays to the literal inability of emergency \nvehicles to get in or out of a community. Many Michigan cities have \nrailroad crossings at a number of important intersections that, when \nclosed by trains, severely limits their ability to provide emergency \nservice to its residents. Medical emergency crews in Michigan have \nspecifically complained to me that they face the daily problem of \ntrains blocking road traffic. They tell me this has the potential to \nput in jeopardy their patients best chance of recovery. As we all \nunderstand, time is of the essence in emergency situations.\n  Trains blocking railroad crossings also pose a threat for pedestrians \nand children who may be tempted to crawl under or between rail cars \nduring long waits in order get to or from school. Vehicles may also be \ntempted to speed around a train before it gets to the crossing in order \nto avoid long delays. Both situations unnecessarily put lives in \ndanger.\n  Michigan businesses have also complained to me that trains have \nblocked important roads for extensive periods of time during plant \nshift changes. This has resulted in unnecessary lost wages and lost \nproduction when employees cannot get to work.\n  Dozens of Michigan's towns and cities have pleaded for Federal action \nto resolve this intolerable situation and have even passed resolutions \nin support of this legislation. They include: Charter Township of \nHuron, City of Lincoln Park, City of Plymouth, City of Riverview, City \nof Rockwood, City of Southgate, City of Trenton, City of Westland, to \nname only a few. Our community leaders believe it is essential to the \npublic health, safety and welfare of the residents of their cities that \nblocked crossings be kept to a reasonable minimum, so that emergency \nvehicles may have ready access to their citizens.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will give the Federal Railroad \nAdministration the push it needs to enact much needed regulations to \naddress this safety problem.\n  My bill would simply require the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations addressing these safety concerns. It is a reasonable \napproach with nothing controversial or complicated about it. \nCongressman Dingell has sponsored an identical bill in the House.\n  We need to stop the delays and remove potentially dangerous \nsituations by minimizing how long trains can stop at grade crossings. \nIts time to address this lingering safety concern and reduce the risk \nto motorists, pedestrians, and citizens at large. This is a very simple \nbill that aims to stop the abuse of trains unnecessarily blocking \nrailroad crossings. It simply directs the FRA, the agency tasked with \noverseeing railroad safety, to take action in this area. I hope this \nlegislation will be enacted quickly.\n  The Railroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act has the support of local \nmayors, fire and police departments and emergency organizations. There \nis currently no Federal limit to how long trains can sit and block \nrailroad crossings. This bill would require that one be instituted, in \nthe name of the public's safety.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Crossing Delay \n     Reduction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall issue regulations \n     regarding trains that block traffic at railroad grade \n     crossings to address safety concerns and to minimize delays \n     encountered by motorists that are caused by such trains.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, in introducing the ``Railroad Crossing Delay \nReduction Act of 2001.''\n  Trains needlessly blocking traffic at railroad grade crossings is a \nlongstanding nationwide problem, that puts lives and property at grave \nrisk. When trains unnecessarily block vital intersections, it can cost \npolice, firefighters and emergency medical workers, critical minutes \nwhen responding to an emergency situation. They also increase train-\nautomobile accidents, because many motorists dangerously speed through \nrailroad crossing intersections, in an attempt to avoid being delayed \nfor an extended period by an oncoming train. Train blockage also \nprevents pedestrians, often young children on the way to and from \nneighborhood schools, from crossing a railroad intersection resulting \nin pedestrians climbing through trains to reach the other side.\n  Across the country, there are reports that fire trucks, ambulances, \nand police vehicles have been unnecessarily delayed at train crossings. \nThe loss of a few minutes in an emergency situation can mean the \ndifference between life and death. A fire in a home or business can \ndouble in size every 20 seconds, and a person suffering from a heart \nattack can die after only six minutes without oxygen. In my home State \nof Michigan, fire and EMS units in Delta Township were blocked by a \ntrain for a few extra minutes as a boy burned to death on the other \nside of the railroad crossing.\n  Last year, a Federal judge in Michigan struck down a State law \nlimiting the amount of time a train can block a crossing on the grounds \nthat it was a Federal issue and involved interstate commerce under the \nCommerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Over 30 communities in \nMichigan alone have passed resolutions asking for Congress to act on \nthis important safety issue.\n  The ``Railroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act of 2001'' addresses this \nimportant national problem by requiring the Department of \nTransportation to issue regulations to address these serious safety \nconcerns with respect to trains blocking traffic at railroad grade \ncrossings, and to minimize delays to automobile traffic resulting from \nthese blockages. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this \nlegislation and help address this critical railroad safety issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. Corzine, \n        and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1016. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to improve the health benefits coverage of infants and children \nunder the medicaid and State children's health insurance program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with Senators Lugar, McCain, Corzine, and Lincoln. This \nlegislation is entitled the ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of \n2001.'' The purpose of the legislation is to significantly reduce the \nnumber of uninsured children\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\nand pregnant women by improving outreach to and enrollment of children \nand by expanding coverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and CHIP.\n  An estimated 11 million children under age 19 were without health \ninsurance in 1999, including 129,000 in New Mexico, representing 15 \npercent of all children in the United States and 22 percent of children \nin New Mexico. Unfortunately, due to variety of factors, including the \nlack of knowledge by families about CHIP and bureaucratic barriers to \ncoverage such as lengthy and complex applications, an estimated 6.7 \nmillion of our Nation's uninsured children are eligible for but \nunenrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP.\n  In addition, an estimated 4.3 million, or 32 percent, of mothers \nbelow 200 percent of poverty are uninsured. According to the March of \nDimes, ``Over 95 percent of all uninsured pregnant women could be \ncovered through a combination of aggressive Medicaid outreach, \nmaximizing coverage for young women through [CHIP], and expanding CHIP \nto cover income-eligible pregnant women regardless of age.''\n  It is a travesty that our Nation ranks 25th in infant mortality and \n21st in maternal mortality in the world, which is the worst among \ndeveloped nations. Our legislation would address the problems related \nto these issues.\n  Giving children a healthy start: The legislation provides States with \nan enhanced Medicaid matching rate to ensure that children eligible for \nMedicaid or CHIP leave the hospital insured and remain so through the \nfirst year of life. The legislation provides States with the option to \nfurther extend coverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and CHIP to \nreduce infant and maternal mortality and low birthweight babies.\n  Helping children stay healthy: The legislation provides States with \nan enhanced Medicaid matching rate to reduce the barriers to care for \nchildren to keep them healthy throughout their childhood. And, the \nlegislation provides States with the option to increase CHIP \neligibility from 200 percent of federal poverty level to 250 percent \nand to extend coverage to children through age 20.\n  As an example of an imposed barrier to health coverage, as of March \nof this year, eight States continued to impose an asset test on \nchildren and their families prior to receiving Medicaid coverage. This \nresults in a rather burdensome and complicated application in each of \nthese States. For example, in Colorado, the Denver Department of Human \nServices received 15,330 application for Medicaid and 3,700 were denied \nfor having an asset, such as a car, in 1999. As the Denver Post pointed \nout, ``Acquire an asset more than $1,500, such as a car, and you've \ntraded in health insurance for your children.''\n  In addition to creating a high percentage of denials, the imposition \nof an assets test significantly complicates the Medicaid or CHIP \nenrollment applications. For example, some States require reporting on \neverything from whether anyone in the household has any resource such \nas a checking account, life insurance, burial insurance, a saving \naccount, or any personal items above a certain amount to documenting \nthings such as work income, alimony, child support, interest from \nsavings, CD's, etc. over a period of time, including several months in \nthe past.\n  This can be a nightmare for some families. In Colorado, of the \nfamilies that do attempt to fill out the Medicaid or CHIP application, \nit is estimated that 37 percent of all families are denied coverage \nbecause the application is incomplete. In Texas, Medicaid applicants \ncan face a 17-page application, up to 14 forms and up to 20 \nverifications of those forms.\n  As a story in last Friday's Washington Post entitled ``Health \nCoverage for Kids Low-Cost but Little Used,'' it was noted that about \n100 students from Yale Medical School, likely some of our Nation's best \nand brightest, filled out applications forms as part of their training \nto enroll families and that not one was able to complete the form \nadequately. If Yale Medical School students cannot fill out the forms \nproperly, is it any wonder that families across the country are having \na difficult time with the bureaucratic paperwork?\n  Fortunately, New Mexico eliminated its assets test a few years ago in \nan effort to simplify its Medicaid application and make it easier for \nfamilies to apply. According to a recent report by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation, States that have eliminated the asset test from Medicaid \nhave been able to streamline the eligibility determination process, \nadopt automated eligibility determination systems, improve the \nproductivity of eligibility workers, establish Medicaid's identity as a \nhealth insurance program distinct from welfare, make the enrollment \nprocess for families friendlier and more accessible, and achieve \nMedicaid administrative cost savings.\n  In addition, the State of Texas has enacted legislation in recent \ndays that seeks to simplify its enrollment process.\n  And yet, there are also reports from other States such as Kentucky \nand Idaho that are moving to impose additional bureaucratic barriers to \ncoverage.\n  As the Denver Rocky Mountain News writes, ``The logic of erecting \nsuch paperwork obstacles escapes us. Government doesn't have to offer \ninsurance to the children of the working poor, but having made the \ndecision to do so, it's hardly fair then to smother the program beneath \nlayers of red tape.''\n  There are also problems related to the poor coordination between \ngovernment agencies that are supposed to serve low-income families.\n  My good friend, Senator Lugar, recognized this very point and \nsuccessfully passed language in the ``Agricultural Risk Protection Act \nof 2000'' to improve the coordination between the school lunch program \nand both Medicaid and CHIP. His language makes it easier to disclose \ninformation from the school lunch program application to Medicaid and \nCHIP agencies. Since children that qualify for the school lunch program \nare almost certainly eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP, this simple \nbut important language is already having an important impact on the \nenrollment of children into Medicaid or CHIP.\n  According to a report by Covering Kids, the Albuquerque Public \nSchools have successfully worked to improve coordination between \nMedicaid and the school lunch program. As the report reads, ``The \nteam's record of success shows that a well-designed process and \ndedicated staff can make [Medicaid enrollment] work. In August and \nSeptember of 2000, Albuquerque Public Schools determined 386 children \nto be presumptively eligible for health coverage. Of these, 371 were \nenrolled and only 15 were denied. That's a 96 percent acceptance rate. \nAnd the numbers are growing.''\n  This coordination between Medicaid and the school lunch program is \nbeing replicated across the country as a result of Senator Lugar's \nlanguage. However, we still have a number of problems with regard to \ncoordination between Medicaid and CHIP across the states that this bill \nseeks to address.\n  Why is this important? Why should we make additional efforts to \nreduce the number of uninsured children? According to the American \nCollege of Physicians--American Society of Internal Medicine, uninsured \nchildren, compared to the insured, are: up to 6 times more likely to \nhave gone without needed medical, dental or other health care; 2 times \nmore likely to have gone without a physician visit during the previous \nyear; up to 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical care; \nup to 10 times less likely to have a regular source of medical care; \n1.7 times less likely to receive medical treatment for asthma; and, up \nto 30 percent less likely to receive medical attention for any injury.\n  This is equally true of expanded coverage to children and pregnant \nwomen in government health programs. In fact, one study has ``estimated \nthat the 15 percent rise in the number of children eligible for \nMedicaid between 1984 and 1992 decreased child mortality by 5 \npercent.'' This expansion of coverage for children occurred, I would \nadd, during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, so this is clearly a \nbipartisan issue that deserves further bipartisan action.\n  We, as a Nation, should be doing much better by our children. It \nshould be unacceptable to all of us that the United States ranks 25th \nin infant mortality and 21st in maternal mortality in the world.\n  Therefore, in addition to seeking to improve health insurance \ncoverage\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\namong children, the bill builds off legislation sponsored in the last \nCongress by Senator Lincoln entitled the ``Improved Maternal and \nChildren's Health Coverage Act'' and makes an important change to CHIP \nto allow pregnant women to be covered. Thus, the first two words of our \nbill, ``Start Healthy.''\n  Throughout our Nation's history, there has been long-standing Federal \npolicy linking programs for pregnant women and infants, including \nMedicaid, WIC, and the Maternal Child Health Block Grant. CHIP, \nunfortunately, failed to provide coverage to pregnant women beyond the \nage of 18. As a result, it is more likely that children eligible for \nCHIP are not covered from the moment of birth, and therefore, miss \nthose first critical months of life until their CHIP application is \nprocessed. They are also more likely not to have had prenatal care.\n  By expanding coverage to pregnant women in the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, this legislation recognizes the importance of \nprenatal care to the health and development of a child. As Dr. Alan \nWaxman of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine notes, \n``Prenatal care is an important factor in the prevention of birth \ndefects and the prevention of prematurity, the most common causes of \ninfant death and disability. Babies born to women with no prenatal care \nor late prenatal care are nearly twice as likely to [be] low \nbirthweight or very low birthweight as infants born to women who \nreceived early prenatal care.''\n  Unfortunately, according to a recent report by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, New Mexico ranked worst in the nation \nin the percentage of mothers receiving late or no prenatal care last \nyear. The result is often quite costly, both in terms of the health of \nthe mother and child but also in terms of long-term expenses since the \nresult can be chronic, lifelong health problems.\n  In fact, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, \n``four of the top 10 most expensive conditions in the hospital are \nrelated to care of infants with complications (respiratory distress, \nprematurity, heart defects, and lack of oxygen).'' As a result, in \naddition to reduced infant mortality and morbidity, the provision to \nexpand coverage of pregnant women and prenatal care can be cost \neffective.\n  The Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act also eliminates the unintended \nFederal incentives through CHIP that covers pregnant women only through \nthe age of 18 and cut off that coverage once the women turn 19 years of \nage. Should the government tell women that they are more likely to \nreceive prenatal care coverage only if they become pregnant as a \nteenager?\n  I certainly think not, and certainly it is unlikely there is a single \nSenator that would think it wise to send such a message. This \nlegislation corrects this unfortunate and unintentional policy \nby allowing pregnant women to be covered through CHIP regardless of \nage.\n\n  And finally, this legislation imposes no Federal mandates on States \nto achieve these goals. Rather, through financial incentives, States \nthat adopt ``best practices'' and less cumbersome enrollment processes \nfor children would be rewarded.\n  The budget resolution contains $28 billion over 10 years to reduce \nthe number of uninsured in this country. Although the Congress passed \nCHIP in 1997, 11 million children remain uninsured. It is time we \nfinish the job of ensuring that we, as the President says, ``leave no \nchild behind.''\n  This bipartisan legislation has already received the endorsement of \nthe following organizations: the March of Dimes, the American Academy \nof Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, \nthe American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of \nPediatric Dentistry, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry, the National Association of Community Health Centers, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, the National Association of Children's \nHospitals, the Federation of American Health Systems, the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, Catholic Health \nAssociation, Premier, Family Voices, the Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs, the National Health Law Program, the National \nAssociation of Social Workers, Every Child By Two, and the United \nCerebral Palsy Associations.

Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Richard Lugar (R-IN), John \n     McCain (R-AZ), Jon Corzine (D-NJ), and Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) \n     introduced the ``Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2001'' on \n     June 12, 2001. The legislation would significantly reduce the \n     number of uninsured children and pregnant women by improving \n     outreach to and enrollment of children and by expanding \n     coverage to pregnant women through Medicaid and the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n       An estimated 11 million children under age 19 were without \n     health insurance in 1999, representing 15% of all children in \n     the United States. Due to a variety of factors, including \n     governmental barriers to coverage, such as bureaucratic ``red \n     tape,'' and the lack of knowledge of families about CHIP, an \n     estimated 6.7 million of our nation's uninsured children are \n     eligible for but are unenrolled in either Medicaid or CHIP.\n       In addition, an estimated 4.3 million, or 32%, of mothers \n     below 200% of poverty are uninsured. According to the March \n     of Dimes, ``Over 95 percent of all uninsured pregnant women \n     could be covered through a combination of aggressive Medicaid \n     outreach, maximizing coverage for young women through [CHIP], \n     and expanding CHIP to cover income-eligible pregnant women \n     regardless of age.''\n       The legislation would reduce the number of uninsured \n     children and pregnant women by:\n     Start healthy\n       Providing states with an enhanced Medicaid matching rate to \n     ensure that children eligible for Medicaid or CHIP leave the \n     hospital insured and remain so through the first year of \n     life.\n       Providing states with the option to further extend coverage \n     to pregnant women through Medicaid and CHIP to reduce infant \n     and maternal mortality and low birthweight babies.\n     Stay healthy\n       Providing states with an enhanced Medicaid matching rate to \n     reduce the barriers to care for children to keep them healthy \n     throughout their childhood.\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n       Providing states with the option to increase CHIP \n     eligibility from 200% of federal poverty level to 250% and to \n     extend coverage to children through age 20.\n       As a result of these provisions, the legislation would \n     achieve the following additional objectives:\n       Reduces Infant and Maternal Mortality: The United States \n     ranks 25th in infant mortality and 21st in maternal \n     mortality, the worst among developed nations. Studies with \n     respect to the previous expansions of Medicaid coverage to \n     pregnant women and children during the Reagan and Bush \n     Administrations indicate those expansions reduced infant \n     mortality and improved child health (GAO, ``Insurance and \n     Health Care Access,'' November 1997). By reducing the number \n     of uninsured children and pregnant women in this country, the \n     legislation would also reduce infant and maternal mortality \n     as well.\n       Eliminates Bureaucratic Barriers to Coverage and Promotes \n     Best Practices by States: Building on the successful \n     enactment of Senator Lugar's amendment to the ``Agricultural \n     Risk Protection Act of 2000'' to make it easier to disclose \n     information from the school lunch program application to \n     Medicaid and CHIP agencies, this legislation seeks to further \n     improve coordination between Medicaid, CHIP, and the Maternal \n     and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant in order to expand health \n     insurance coverage to eligible but unenrolled children. The \n     bill also provides states financial incentives to remove \n     bureaucratic barriers to health insurance coverage in \n     Medicaid and CHIP for children. These provisions reward \n     states for ``best practices'' and also eliminates the \n     negative incentive for states to enroll children improperly \n     in CHIP (with the higher matching rate, higher cost sharing, \n     and reduced benefits) rather than Medicaid (with a lower \n     matching rate, reduced cost sharing, and increased benefits).\n       Addresses the ``CHIP Dip'': There is a ``dip'' in federal \n     funding, known as the ``CHIP dip'' in fiscal years 2002 \n     through 2006 that states have complained will cause them to \n     limit their CHIP programs out of fear of not having enough \n     funding in those years. The bill addresses that problem by \n     raising CHIP funding levels in fiscal years FY 2002 through \n     2006.\n       Eliminates Unintended Federal Incentives Regarding Teenage \n     Pregnant Women: Current federal law allows pregnant women to \n     receive coverage through CHIP through age 18--creating a \n     perverse federal incentive of covering only teenage pregnant \n     women and cutting off that coverage once they turn 19 years \n     of age. This legislation would eliminate this problem by \n     allowing states to cover pregnant women through CHIP, \n     regardless of age. This also eliminates the unfortunate \n     separation between pregnant women and infants that has been \n     created through CHIP, which has been contrary to long-\n     standing federal policy through programs such as Medicaid, \n     WIC, MCH, etc.\n       Imposes No Mandates on States: This legislation imposes no \n     mandates on states. However, states would, just as we have \n     done in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), \n     be provided financial incentives and accountability for the \n     additional money this legislation provides in return for \n     reducing governmental barriers to coverage for children and \n     pregnant women.\n       Remains Within the Budget Framework: The budget provides \n     for $28 billion over 10 yeas for the purpose of reducing the \n     number of uninsured. This proposal will meet those budgetary \n     limits.\n       This bipartisan legislation has received the endorsement of \n     the following organizations: the March of Dimes, the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists, the American Academy of the Family \n     Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, the \n     American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the \n     National Association of Community Health Centers, the \n     American Hospital Association, the National Association of \n     Children's Hospitals, the Federation of American Health \n     Systems, the National Association of Public Hospitals and \n     Health Systems, Catholic Health Association, Premier, Family \n     Voices, the Association of Maternal and Child Health \n     Programs, the National Health Law Program, the National \n     Association of Social Workers, Every Child by Two, and the \n     United Cerebral Palsy Associations.\n\n\n                          legislative summary\n\n       This legislation is split into two titles:\n     Title I: Start healthy\n       Provides states through Medicaid with the CHIP enhanced \n     matching rate if they choose the option to continuously \n     enroll infants from birth through the first year of life, as \n     allowed under current law, regardless of the woman's status \n     during that year.\n       Provides states with an option to further cover pregnant \n     women through Medicaid and CHIP (above 185% of poverty up to \n     the full CHIP eligibility levels) in order to reduce infant \n     mortality and the delivery of low birthweight babies.\n     Title II: Stay healthy\n       Provides states through Medicaid with the CHIP enhanced \n     matching rate for children above a certain base expenditure \n     level such as a state's spending on children in 1996) if they \n     choose to meet the following conditions: States must expand \n     coverage to children up to the full extent that is allowed \n     under CHIP (to 200% of poverty or 50 percentage points above \n     where the coverage levels were prior to passage of Title \n     XXI); adoption of a simplified, joint mail-in application; \n     adoption of application procedures (e.g., verification and \n     face-to-face interview requirements) that are no more \n     extensive, onerous, or burdensome in Medicaid than in CHIP, \n     elimination of assets test; adoption of 12-month continuous \n     enrollment; adoption of procedures that simplify the \n     redetermination/coverage renewal process by allowing families \n     to establish their child's continuing eligibility by mail \n     and, in states with separate CHIP programs, by establishing \n     effective procedures that allow children to be transferred \n     between Medicaid and the separate program without a new \n     application a gap in coverage when a child's eligibility \n     status changes; compliance with the OBRA-89 outstationed \n     workers requirement, which provide for outstationed \n     eligibility workers in Medicaid DSH hospitals and community \n     health centers, impose waiting periods no longer than 6 \n     months for children seeking to enroll in CHIP (ensure \n     flexibility for states to impose shorter periods, if at all); \n     and demonstrate that the State has adopted payments rates \n     sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and \n     pediatric, obstetrical/gynecologic and dental services are \n     available at least to the extent such care and services are \n     available to the general population in the geographic area.\n       States meeting these conditions would receive the full \n     enhanced CHIP matching rate. If a state meets 8 of these \n     conditions, it would receive 75% of the difference between \n     the regular Medicaid matching rate and the CHIP enhanced \n     matching rate. If a state meets 7 of the conditions, it would \n     receive 50% of the difference.\n       Expand CHIP eligibility to 250% of poverty for children and \n     pregnant women.\n       Expand CHIP eligibility up to age 21 (adding 19 and 20 \n     year-olds).\n       The legislation also increases the CHIP allotments in FY \n     2002 to $3.5 billion, in FY 2003 to $4 billion, in FY 2004 to \n     $4.3 billion in FY 2005 to $4.5 billion, and in FY 2006 to \n     $4.5 billion.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Durbin and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1017. A bill to provide the people of Cuba with access to food and \nmedicines from the United States, to ease restrictions on travel to \nCuba, to provide scholarships for certain Cuban nationals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last year 26 Senators cosponsored \nlegislation to help the Cuban people and American farmers and \nbusinesses by allowing sales of food and medicine to Cuba. Later, with \npassage of the FY2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, the 106th \nCongress approved the issuance one year licenses for the sale of food \nand medicine to Cuba, but placed restrictions on the financing of these \nsales. This was a beginning, and now we need to expand on this small \nsuccess by continuing to move forward in constructing bridges to the \nCuban people.\n  Toward that end, I am today joined by a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues in introducing the Bridges to the Cuban People Act, an \nexpanded version of the legislation that was passed last year. Among \nthose joining as original cosponsors are Senators Chafee, Leahy, Lugar, \nRoberts, Baucus, Levin, Boxer, Jeffords, Kennedy, Akaka, Wellstone, \nDorgan, Bingaman, and Durbin. This bill comprehensively updates U.S. \npolicy toward Cuba by increasing humanitarian trade between Cuba and \nthe United States, increasing our people-to-people contacts, and \nenhancing the flexibility of the President with respect to our foreign \npolicy towards Cuba. I would like to take a few moments to outline the \nvarious sections of this bill, and to explain to my colleagues the \nreasons why enactment of this legislation is so vital.\n  First, let me be clear. This new legislation will not end the embargo \non Cuba. Rather, this bill creates specific exceptions to the embargo \nthat will allow American farmers and businesses to sell food, medicine, \nand agricultural equipment to Cuba without the burden of securing \nannual licenses and will allow our farmers and businesses to use \nAmerican banks and American financing to conduct these sales. Both of \nthese changes, along with the lifting of shipping restrictions, are \ndesigned to allow sales to move forward in a way that is less \nburdensome to American farmers and businesses. Additionally, this bill \nwould mandate that the President submit a report to Congress each year \ndescribing the number and types of sales to Cuba so that we will have \nsome official record of these sales.\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\n  The Building Bridges to the Cuban People Act would also lift the \nembargo on the exports of goods or services intended for the exclusive \nuse of children. No embargo should include children as its victims, and \nthis provision would allow us to give special attention to children in \nCuba.\n  This bill also modernizes our approach to Cuba's medical exports. \nCuba is currently involved in the development of some medicines that \nare not available in the United States, such as the Meningitis B \nvaccine, but that could save American lives. This legislation would \nallow Cuba, with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, to export to the United States medicines for which there is a \nmedical need in the United States, provided the medicine is not \ncurrently being manufactured in our country. In this way we can build \non the strong tradition of medical research in Cuba and encourage the \nfree exchange of ideas and experiments between scholars.\n  In addition, this bill will lift restrictions on travel to Cuba. Cuba \ndoes not now pose a threat to individual Americans, and it is time to \npermit our citizens to exercise their constitutional right to travel to \nCuba. Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety \nof Americans who might visit the island Nation. Today Americans are \nfree to travel to Iran, the Sudan, Burma, Yugoslavia, and North Korea, \nbut not to Cuba. This is a mistake. American influence, through person-\nto-person and cultural exchanges, was one of the prime factors in the \nevolution of our hemisphere from a hemisphere ruled predominantly by \nauthoritarian and military regimes to one where democracy is the rule. \nOur current policy toward Cuba limits the United States from using our \nmost potent weapon in our effort to combat totalitarianism, and that is \nour own people. They are some of the best ambassadors we have ever sent \nanywhere, and the free exchange of ideas between Americans and the \nCuban people is one of the best ways to encourage democracy and build \nbridges between the American and Cuban people.\n  Another provision in this new legislation would allow us to reach out \nto Cuban students. Under this legislation, scholarships would be \nprovided for Cubans who would like to pursue graduate study in the \nUnited States in the areas of public health, public policy, economics, \nlaw, or other fields of social science. Throughout our history, \neducational and cultural exchanges have proven to be valuable tools \nthat lead to understanding and friendship. This scholarship program is \na concrete example of the true people-to-people dialogue we should be \ntrying to foster with Cuba.\n  Nor does this legislation ignore the struggle of the Cuban-American \npopulation in the United States. Cuban-Americans here have always had \nthe ability to send money to their families in Cuba, but the government \nimposes restrictions on the total amount of money that can be sent. \nThis legislation would lift these limitations so that Americans would \nbe free to provide whatever assistance they wished to their loved ones.\n  And, finally, this bill would modernize the way our policies toward \nCuba are codified. At the present time, the President has the authority \nto waive Title III of the Helms/Burton Act. This legislation would \nextend the President's authority so that he could also waive Title I, \nTitle II, and Title IV of the Helms/Burton Act, at his discretion. When \nHelms/Burton was enacted it contained a provision that codified all \nexisting Cuban embargo Executive Orders and regulations, but did not \nprovide for presidential waivers. This lack of waivers severely ties \nthe hands of the Administration if a decision is made to make changes \nin our policy towards Cuba. The President should have the tools he \nneeds to conduct and modify our foreign policy, and this legislation \nwould give the President the flexibility to shape our relationship with \nCuba in a more positive way.\n  In conclusion, I believe that this bill will streamline our Cuban \npolicy so that it deals with the realities of the modern age, addresses \nthe needs of our American farmers, patients, and children, while \nimposing the fewest restrictions on American citizens who wish to have \ncontact with the people of Cuba. The people of Cuba are not our enemy. \nOur government's quarrel is with Fidel Castro, and our policies should \nreflect that reality. Without doubt, the Castro regime has denied \nrights to its citizens, but in our efforts to isolate him, we have \nbuilt walls that are hampering our goal of bringing democracy to the \nCuban people. As a measure that tears down those walls and replaces \nthem with bridges, this legislation is a good starting point for a \nserious debate about how we can change U.S. policy in order to foster a \npeaceful transition to democracy on the island of Cuba while \nalleviating the hardship that our current policy has caused for the 11 \nmillion people who reside there. I hope to hold hearings in the near \nfuture and will be discussing with the committee leadership dates for \nthe markup of this important legislation. Congressmen Serrano, Leach \nand more than eighty of their House colleagues have introduced a \ncompanion bill in the House today as well. I urge the rest of my \ncolleagues to join us in this endeavor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bridges \nto Cuban People Act of 2001. As many of my colleagues know, I have been \nvocal in my support of legislation that removes sanctions against the \nCuban people. I have supported such legislation for several reasons. \nFirst, sanctions ultimately hurt the very people we proclaim we are \ntrying to help. It is obvious by now that barriers that either hinder \nor prohibit the flow of food and medicine to Cuba do not impact the \nCastro regime, but rather harms innocent men, women, and children. \nSecond, sanctions are counterproductive to our goal of bringing about \nchange in Cuba. There is no empirical evidence whatsoever that our \ncontinued efforts to isolate Cuba has brought about any transformation \nin the way the Castro regime sees or reacts to the world. Finally, \nsanctions prevent U.S. firms from exporting to Cuba, allow their \ncounterparts in other countries to make sales our firms cannot, and \nthus harm the U.S. economic interest.\n  I am convinced engagement on all fronts--social, economic, and \npolitical--will make a substantial difference in Cuba, and it is way \npast time that we begin that process. The bill today represents another \ndramatic step forward in our policy in this regard. After considerable \ndebate over the years, we are now seeing consensus emerge among my \ncolleagues on this issue, as indicated by the bi-partisan support for \nthis bill. The components of this legislation--the unrestricted sales \nof food, farm equipment, agricultural commodities and medicine, the \nremoval of restrictions on travel, the authorization of scholarships \nfor Cuban students to study in the United States, among others--are in \nfact the humanitarian, responsible, and appropriate way to approach \nCuba at this time.\n  Let me emphasize today, as I have in the past, that the elimination \nof sanctions on Cuba and the creation of new opportunities for the \nCuban people does not imply that I, or the Senate as a whole, agree \nwith the policies and politics of the Castro regime. Quite the \ncontrary. I believe the Castro regime to be distinctly out of touch \nwith current trends in the international system and their own people. I \npersonally deplore the Castro regime's oppressive tactics. The lack of \nfreedom and opportunity in that country stands in direct contrast to \nmost of the countries in the Western Hemisphere and throughout the \nworld. Cuba now stands alone in its inability to allow the growth of \ndemocracy, to establish the protection of individual rights, and create \na semblance of economic security. It is a political system that should \nbe condemned at every opportunity.\n  But as a practical matter this legislation suggests that we cannot \neffectively punish authoritarian regimes through their own people. Cuba \nis ripe for change, and the best way to achieve positive change is to \nallow Americans to communicate and associate with the Cuban people on \nan intensive and ongoing basis, to re-establish cultural activities, \nand to rebuild economic relations. To allow the Cuban system to remain \nclosed does little to assert United States influence over policy in \nthat country and it does absolutely nothing in terms of creating the \nfoundation for much-needed political economic transformation. The \nspread of democracy comes from interaction, not isolation.\n  So, I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do so \nas well.\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, \n        Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1018. A bill to provide market loss assistance for apple \nproducers; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill that seeks to \nprovide much needed assistance to our Nation's apple farmers. In the \npast four years, due to weather related disasters, disease and the \ndumping of Chinese apple juice concentrate, our Nation's apple \nproducers have lost over $1.4 billion dollars in revenue. This has left \nmany growers on the brink of financial disaster.\n  In the past three years, Congress has assisted America's farmers by \nproviding substantial assistance to agricultural producers. The U.S. \napple industry boasts a long history of self-sufficiency and has long \noperated without relying upon federally funded farm programs. Last \nyear, Congress, recognized the problems facing apple growers and for \nthe first time ever, provided direct market loss assistance to apple \ngrowers.\n  Even with this aid, a significant percentage of apply growers are \nexpected to go out of the business this year. Without some type of \nfinancial relief, the numbers could indeed be staggering. Studies by \neconomists at Michigan State University estimated U.S. apple growers \nwill lose nearly $500 million this year alone. Such losses threaten to \ndevastate the entire U.S. apple industry. The Michigan Farm Bureau \nstates that the number of those leaving the business in some States is \nrunning as high as 30 percent. Assistance is desperately needed to help \nstabilize not only the production sector but entire communities and \nsubsidiary businesses that are dependent on the apple industry, not \nonly in Michigan, but nationwide.\n  The $250 million in assistance we are proposing will help those who \ndepend on the apple industry for their livelihood, and ensure that \nAmerican apple growers will be able to provide the United States and \nthe world with a quality product that is second to none.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor legislation to provide $250 million in emergency payments to apple \ngrowers. I would like to thank Senators Levin and Snowe for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  Rural communities and agricultural producers have not enjoyed \nAmerica's recent economic prosperity. Around the Nation, nearly all \ncommodity producers are enduring low prices and trade challenges. In \nWashington State, these problems are compounded by a severe drought, an \nenergy crisis, and fish listings under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The combined impact is devastating. Apple growers in my State, from \nOkanogan County to Walla Walla County, are going bankrupt. Many family \nfarmers have given up hope. On land that has produced high quality \nfruit for generations, farmers are tearing out orchards. Farmer \ncooperatives and other businesses that have been a part of rural \ncommunities for decades have closed up shop. Local governments have \nseen tax revenue decline. And non-farm businesses have struggled as \nconsumers no longer have the cash to buy their goods and services.\n  In the 106th Congress, we responded. Last year, I worked with my \ncolleagues to pass a $100 million emergency package for apple growers. \nIn 1999, I worked with the Clinton Administration to end the dumping by \nChinese companies of non-frozen apple juice concentrate. And on a host \nof smaller issues, from fighting pests in abandoned orchards, to \nsecuring research funding, to breaking down trade barriers, I worked \nwith the industry and other stakeholders to build a stronger foundation \nfor the future.\n  We can be proud of what we accomplished. But we still have more to do \nin the 107th Congress.\n  If signed into law, this new legislation will provide $250 million in \nemergency payments to apple growers nation-wide. This emergency \nlegislation will not save every producer. It will give the industry the \nfinancial support it needs to get through another year of disastrous \nprices. It will also give us the time we need to develop long-term \nsolutions as part of the next farm bill for apple and other specialty \ncrop growers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. And I urge the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee to \nwork with the sponsors of this bill to provide meaningful assistance to \nall apple growers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1019. A bill to provide for monitoring of aircraft air quality, to \nrequire air carriers to produce certain mechanical and maintenance \nrecords, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nAircraft Clean Air Act of 2001. The bill is designed to encourage \nairlines to keep records of airplane cabin air quality complaints, as \nwell as complaints of illnesses that may be a result of poor air \nquality.\n  Airlines are not required to maintain records of passenger and \ncrewmember complaints regarding cabin air quality, even if the \npassenger or crewmember reports an illness as a result of poor air \nquality.\n  As a result, potentially valuable information is lost to researchers \nstudying cabin air quality.\n  The Aircraft Clean Air Act allows passengers and crewmembers to \nsubmit their complaints directly to the Federal Aviation Administration \nand requires that the Administration record the complaint and pass it \non to the appropriate airline.\n  The bill requires airlines to maintain records of complaints for ten \nyears.\n  If a passenger or crewmember requests mechanical or maintenance \nrecords with regard to their complaint, and the passenger or crewmember \nhas had a health care professional verify their symptoms, this \nlegislation requires that the airline provide the requested information \nwithin 15 days. If the airline does not comply with the request, it is \nsubject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each day it does not produce \nthe records.\n  Airlines must be ready to provide maintenance records of all \nchemicals used in or on the plan, from cleaning solvents to hydraulic \nfluids.\n  The traveling public should have access to any chemicals to which \nthey may be exposed.\n  The Aircraft Clean Air Act addresses another issue, as well: aircraft \npressurization.\n  Planes are currently pressurized to 8,000 feet while in the air. That \nmeans that even though the plane is flying at 30,000 feet, the cabin \nhas the same air pressure as it would at 8,000 feet.\n  Airplane manufacturers arrived at the 8,000 figure in the 1960s when \ncommercial air travel was booming. They agreed on the figure after \ntesting the effects of different pressurizations on young, healthy \npilots.\n  Because oxygen is absorbed into the blood at a much lower rate in \nhigh altitudes, there is speculation that some illnesses experienced \nduring flight are a result of the 8,000 feet pressurization. Commonly \nreported symptoms such as shortness of breath and numbness in the limbs \nmay be a direct result of the high altitude.\n  The Aircraft Clean Air Act directs the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to sponsor an aeromedical research project to determine \nwhat cabin altitude limit should provide enough oxygen to passengers \nand crew.\n  The bill allows universities to compete to conduct the study, and the \nNational Academy of Sciences' Committee on Air Quality in Passenger \nCabins of Commercial Aircraft to select the winner.\n  Researchers will examine the oxygen saturation in people of different \nages, weights, and body types at 5,000 feet through 8,000 feet. The \nbill directs researchers to determine which altitude provides enough \noxygen to ensure that individuals' health is not adversely affected \neither in the short-term or long-term.\n  It is unacceptable that airlines do not maintain records of air \nquality complaints on their commercial flights. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in this effort to protect the traveling public and the \nhardworking men and women who make air travel possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs.\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\n        Murray, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1020. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the provision of items and services provided to Medicare \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senator Craig, Senator Bingaman, Senator Murray, Senator \nFeingold, and Senator Kohl to introduce the Medicare Fairness in \nReimbursement Act of 2001. This legislation addresses the terrible \nunfairness that exists today in Medicare payment policy.\n  According to the latest Medicare figures, Medicare payments per \nbeneficiary by State of residence ranged from slightly less than $3,000 \nto well in excess of $7,000. For example, in Iowa, the average Medicare \npayment was $2,985, nearly 45 percent less than the national average of \n$5,364. In Idaho, the average payment is $3,592, only 66 percent of the \nnational average.\n  This payment inequity is unfair to seniors in Iowa and Idaho, and it \nis unfair to rural beneficiaries everywhere. The citizens of my home \nState pay the same Medicare payroll taxes required of every American \ntaxpayer. Yet they get dramatically less in return.\n  Ironically, rural citizens are not penalized by the Medicare program \nbecause they practice inefficient, high cost medicine. The opposite is \ntrue. The low payment rates received in rural areas are in large part a \nresult of their historic conservative practice of health care. In the \nearly 1980's rural States' lower-than-average cost were used to justify \nlower payment rate, and Medicare's payment policies since that time \nhave only widened the gap between low- and high-cost States.\n  Two years ago I wrote to the Health Care Financing Administration \n(HCFA) and I asked them a simple question. I asked their actuaries to \nestimate for me the impact on Medicare's Trust Funds, which at that \ntime were scheduled to go bankrupt in 2015, if average Medicare \npayments to all states were the same as Iowa's.\n  I've always thought Iowa's reimbursement level was low. But HCFA's \nanswer surprised even me. The actuaries found that if all States were \nreimbursed at the same rate as Iowa, Medicare would be solvent for at \nleast 75 years, 60 years beyond their projections.\n  I'm not suggesting that all States should be brought down to Iowa's \nlevel. But there is no question that the long-term solvency of the \nMedicare program is of serious national concern. And as Congress \nconsiders ways to strengthen and modernize the Medicare program, the \nissue of unfair payment rates needs to be on the table.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Medicare Fairness in \nReimbursement Act of 2001 sends a clear signal. These historic wrongs \nmust be righted. Before any Medicare reform bill passes Congress, I \nintend to make sure that rural beneficiaries are guaranteed access to \nthe same quality health care services of their urban counterparts.\n  Our legislation does the following: requires HCFA to improve the \nfairness of payments under the original Medicare fee-for-services \nsystem by adjusting payments for items and services so that no State is \ngreater than 105 percent above the national average, and no State is \nbelow 95 percent of the national average. An estimated 31 States would \nbenefit under these adjustments, based on the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's projections of the 1999 payment data.\n\n  Requires HCFA to improve the fairness of payments to rural \npractitioners who bill under Medicare Part B by narrowing the range of \nthe Geographic Payment Classification Indices, GPCIs. Currently, there \nare dramatic geographic differences in payments for physician services \nwith little scientific data to support the disparity. Providers in \nrural areas are under-compensated. This act would restrict the range \nfor each GPCI so that no GPCI is greater than 1.05 or less than .95 of \nthe standard index of 1.00. Practitioners who work in rural areas will \nbenefit from this change in geographic adjusters.\n  It ensures that beneficiaries are held harmless in both payments and \nservices, ensures budget neutrality, and automatically results in \nadjustment of Medicare managed care payments to reflect increased \nequity between rural and urban areas.\n  This legislation simply ensures basic fairness in our Medicare \npayment policy. I urge my Senate colleagues, no matter what State \nyou're from, to consider our bill and join us in supporting this \ncommonsense Medicare reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Reed, and \n        Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 1021. A bill to reauthorize the Tropical Forest Conservation Act \nof 1998 through fiscal year 2004; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Senator Biden and I are today introducing a \nbill to reauthorize appropriations for the Tropical Forest Conservation \nAct of 1998 for the Fiscal Years 2002, 2003 and 2004. We are joined in \nthis effort by Senators Chafee, Craig, Kerry, Leahy, Lieberman, \nMurkowski, Reed and Roberts.\n  The United States has a significant national interest in protecting \ntropical forests in developing countries. Tropical forests regulate the \nhydrological cycle on which world agriculture depends. The genetic \ndiversity contained in tropical forests is important for plant \nbreeding. Twenty-five percent of prescription drugs come from tropical \nforests. Tropical forests also serve as carbon sinks, storing carbon to \nmitigate the potential effects of the increase in greenhouse gases on \nthe world's climate. Avoiding tropical deforestation is essential to \nmitigating the threat of climate change.\n  Worldwide, there is a net loss of thirty million acres of forests \nevery year. The heavy debt burden of many developing countries \nencourages them to engage in unsustainable exploitation of natural \nresources in order to generate revenue to service external debt. At the \nsame time, these poor governments tend to have few resources available \nto set aside and protect key areas.\n  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act addresses the economic pressures \non developing countries through ``debt for nature'' mechanisms that \nreduce foreign debt while leveraging scarce funds available for \ninternational conservation. Specifically, the Act authorizes the \nPresident to reduce certain bilateral government debt owed to the \nUnited States through three distinct mechanisms: debt buybacks; debt \nrestructuring and reduction; or debt swaps. In return, eligible \ndeveloping countries with significant tropical forests must establish \nand place local currencies in tropical forest funds. These funds are \nmanaged primarily by local, non-governmental organizations and make \ngrants for projects that are designed to protect or restore tropical \nforests or to promote their sustainable economic use.\n  The debt for nature mechanisms in the Act effectively leverage the \nlimited funds available for international conservation. Under the \nTropical Forest Conservation Act, the host country places currencies in \nits tropical forest fund, the value of which typically exceeds the cost \nto the U.S. Treasury of the debt reduction agreement. Furthermore, \nbecause these tropical forest funds have integrity and are broadly \nsupported within the host country, conservation organizations are \ninterested in contributing their own money to them, producing an \nadditional leverage of federal conservation dollars.\n  Our bill would reauthorize appropriations for the Act for three \nyears, with funding levels of $50 million in Fiscal Year 2002, $75 \nmillion in Fiscal year 2003 and $100 million in Fiscal Year 2002.\n  President Bush has indicated his strong support for the Tropical \nForest Conservation Act, which is modeled upon President George Herbert \nWalker Bush's Enterprise for the Americas program as well as upon the \nBiden-Lugar Global Environmental Protection Assistance Act of 1989. \nThese programs have helped to foster the development of responsible, \ncommunity-based conservation organizations that are capable of \naddressing environmental problems at the local level and ensuring \nsuccessful program implementation.\n  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act encourages the repayment of debt \nowed to the United States government, addresses the cash flow problems \nof poorer nations, promotes cooperation\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\nbetween governmental and local conservation organizations and helps to \nsave the world's outstanding tropical forests, which are disappearing \nat an alarming rate.\n  It is my understanding that Congressmen Rob Portman and Tom Lantos \nare introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. \nSenator Biden and I plan to work with our colleagues in the House and \nSenate toward speedy passage of this three year reauthorization bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS TO SUPPORT \n                   REDUCTION OF DEBT UNDER THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE \n                   ACT OF 1961 AND TITLE I OF THE AGRICULTURAL \n                   TRADE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1954.\n\n       (a) Reauthorization.--Section 806 of the Tropical Forest \n     Conservation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 2431d) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) Authorization of Appropriations for Fiscal Years \n     After Fiscal Year 2001.--For the cost (as defined in section \n     502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990) for the \n     reduction of any debt pursuant to this section or section \n     807, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President \n     the following:\n       ``(1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       ``(2) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2003.\n       ``(3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 808(a)(1)(D) of the \n     Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. \n     2431f(a)(1)(D)) is amended by striking ``to appropriated \n     under sections 806(a)(2) and 807(a)(2)'' and inserting ``to \n     be appropriated under sections 806(a)(2), 807(a)(2), and \n     806(d)''.\n\n            Summary of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act\n\n       The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 (Public Law \n     105-214) helps to protect the world's dwindling tropical \n     forests through ``debt for nature swaps.''\n       The TFCA focuses on tropical forest conservation, using the \n     same principles as the 1989 Global Environmental Protection \n     Act, Biden-Lugar, and former President Bush's Enterprise for \n     the Americas Initiative (EAI). The bill extends eligibility \n     for ``Debt for Nature'' swaps under the EAI to lower and \n     middle income countries in Africa and Asia with globally or \n     regionally outstanding tropical forests. It authorizes \n     appropriations to compensate the Treasury Department for \n     revenues foregone when debts with poorer developing nations \n     are restructured at less than their asset value.\n       The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 authorizes the \n     President to reduce certain bilateral government debt owed to \n     the United States under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1981 or \n     Title 1 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance \n     Act of 1954. In exchange, the eligible developing country \n     would place local currencies in a tropical forest fund, which \n     would be used for projects to preserve, restore or maintain \n     its tropical forests. In some instances, debt swaps would \n     occur at no cost to the Federal Treasury since sovereign debt \n     would simply be reduced to its asset value under the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990. In other instances, poorer nations \n     will be allowed to restructure their debt at an amount \n     somewhat lower than its asset value and Federal \n     appropriations would have to be used to compensate the \n     Treasury for reductions in its anticipated revenue stream. \n     The law also allows private organizations to contribute their \n     funds to help facilitate a debt swap under the terms of the \n     bill.\n       To qualify for assistance, eligible countries must meet the \n     criteria established by Congress under EAI: the government \n     must be democratically elected, must not support acts of \n     international terrorism, must cooperate on international \n     narcotics control matters, must not violate internationally \n     recognized human rights, and must institute any needed \n     investment reforms.\n       To ensure accountability, an administrative body is \n     established in the beneficiary country. This body will \n     consist of one or more U.S. Government officials, one or more \n     individuals appointed by the recipient country's government, \n     and representatives of environmental, community development, \n     scientific, academic and forestry organizations of the \n     beneficiary country. It is authorized to make grants for \n     projects which would conserve its outstanding tropical \n     forests. Additionally, the existing Enterprise for Americas \n     Initiative Board is expanded by four new members and oversees \n     both the EAI and the Tropical Forest Conservation Act.\n       The authorization of appropriations for the 1998 Tropical \n     Forest Conservation Act expires at the end of fiscal year \n     2002. Legislation will be introduced to extend the \n     authorization of appropriations through fiscal years 2002 at \n     a level of $50,000,000 in FY 2002, $75,000,000 in FY 2003 and \n     $100,000,000 in FY 2004.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join my \ndistinguished colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, in introducing \nlegislation to protect the world's significant tropical forests through \n``debt-for-nature'' mechanisms. We have shared a long and fruitful \nbipartisan relationship on this important issue. I am gratified that we \nhave the bipartisan support of our original cosponsors noted by Senator \nLugar.\n  Tropical forests are a cornerstone of the global environment. \nFiguratively speaking, they are the ``lungs'' of our planet, and they \ncan help to regulate and mitigate the process of climate change. They \nguide global patterns of rainfall on which agriculture and fisheries \ndepend. They harbor pharmaceutical treasures that we are just beginning \nto explore. They are home our planet's widest diversity of plants and \nanimals.\n  We have a responsibility, a duty, to be good stewards of these \nessential resources, and it is in our direct economic interest to see \nthat they flourish.\n  In 1989, Senator Lugar and I coauthored the Global Environmental \nProtection Assistance Act, which was enacted into law as title VII A of \nthe International Finance and Development Act of 1989 (Public Law 101-\n240, December 19, 1989). That Act authorized US AID to use its funds \nfor Debt for Nature swaps. Under the authority of this Act, US AID has \nused $95 million of its funds to establish environmental endowments \ntotaling $146 million in Costa Rica, Honduras, Indonesia, Jamaica, \nMadagascar, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines.\n  President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI), \ncarried forward this linkage between debt reduction and the generation \nof local funds to protect the environment. The EAI provided $876 \nmillion in debt relief and $154 million in local endowments at a \nfederal cost of $90 million in seven countries in Latin America and the \nCaribbean: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, El Salvador, Jamaica \nand Uruguay.\n  The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 extended the debt for \nnature mechanism of the EAI to the protection of significant tropical \nforests in lower and middle income developing countries throughout the \nworld, not just those in Latin America and the Caribbean. Furthermore, \nthe Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA), authorizes the use of two \nnew, no cost ``debt-for-nature'' models, the Buy Back option and Debt \nSwap option.\n  The basic premise behind this series of programs has not changed over \nthe years. Many of the world's important tropical forests are found in \ncountries that do not have the resources to protect them. Their own \npatterns of economic development and their participation in the \ninternational economy place irresistible pressures on them to turn \nthese irreplaceable global resources into quick local cash. One of the \nimportant contributors to those pressures is too often the debt those \ncountries owe to us. That is one thing we can do something about.\n  The mechanisms in this bill will allow us to multiply the small \ndollar cost of writing the debt of those countries off of our books, \nleveraging substantially more resources to the cause of preserving \ntropical forests around the world.\n  I look forward to taking this bill up in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee as soon as possible, and I fully expect it will continue to \nenjoy the strong support it has had in the past. I also look forward to \nworking with the Administration to provide the funding that the \nPresident has called for to implement this program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1022. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nFederal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums \non a pretax basis and to allow a deduction for TRICARE supplemental \npremiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Tom Davis, in introducing \nlegislation that will enable Federal and military retirees to take \nadvantage of premium conversion. Premium conversion allows individuals \nto pay their health insurance premiums with pre-tax dollars.\n  This tax benefit was extended last year under a Presidential \ndirective to\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\ncurrent Federal employees who participate in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program, saving an average of over $400 per year on \ntheir Federal income taxes. It is a benefit already available to many \nprivate sector employees, and State and local government employees.\n  Although extending this benefit to Federal annuitants has broad \nsupport, it requires a legislative change in the tax laws. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will do just that.\n  The Federal Employees Health Insurance Premium Conversion Act will \nprovide that the same health insurance premium conversion arrangement \nafforded to employees in the Executive and Judicial branches of the \nFederal government, be made available to Federal annuitants.\n  This year, retirees under the Civil Service Retirement System \nreceived a 3.5 percent cost of living adjustment, and those who receive \nan annuity under the Federal Employees Retirement System received a 2.5 \npercent adjustment.\n  This increase in benefits is nearly offset by severe increases in \nFEHB premiums. In 2000, health premiums increased by an average of 9.3 \npercent. The Office of Personnel Management reports that a similar \nincrease is expected again this year.\n  I am deeply concerned about increases in Federal Employee Health \nBenefit premiums in recent years. Health care coverage is provided to \nover 9 million Federal employees, retirees and their families under \nFEHBP. Ensuring affordable health care coverage for all Federal \nemployees and their dependents must remain a priority for Congress.\n  In addition, I am pleased that this bill will also allow uniformed \nservices retiree beneficiaries, their family members and survivors to \npay their TRICARE Prime enrollment fees and TRICARE Standard \nsupplemental insurance premiums with pre-tax dollars. TRICARE Standard \nsupplemental insurance premiums paid by active duty personnel are also \ncovered by the legislation which allows for an above the line deduction \nto benefit active duty personnel and their families.\n  This is a critical issue to many retirees, especially those living on \na fixed income. Extending premium conversion will provide much needed \nrelief from the increasing cost of health care insurance. It will help \nto ensure that more Federal retirees are able to afford continued \ncoverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this critical legislation and \nshow their support of these Federal civilian and military retirees for \ntheir dedicated service. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 109\n\n       Whereas approximately 80,000 infants, children, teenagers, \n     and young adults of families living throughout the United \n     States die each year from myriad causes;\n       Whereas the death of an infant, child, teenager, or young \n     adult of a family is considered to be 1 of the greatest \n     tragedies that a parent or family will ever endure during a \n     lifetime;\n       Whereas a supportive environment, empathy, and \n     understanding are considered critical factors in the healing \n     process of a family that is coping with and recovering from \n     the loss of a loved one; and\n       Whereas April is National Child Abuse Prevention month: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL DAY \n                   AND CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL FLAG DAY.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) designates the second Sunday in the month of December \n     as ``National Children's Memorial Day'' and the last Friday \n     in the month of April as ``Children's Memorial Flag Day''; \n     and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe ``National Children's Memorial Day'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities in remembrance of the \n     many infants, children, teenagers, and young adults of \n     families in the United States who have died; and\n       (B) fly the Children's Memorial Flag on ``Children's \n     Memorial Flag Day''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which \nwould designate the second Sunday in December as ``National Children's \nMemorial Day.'' The resolution would set aside this day to remember all \nthe children who die in the United States each year. While I realize \nthe families of these children deal with the grief of their loss every \nday, I would like to commemorate the lives of these children with a \nspecial day as well.\n  The Senate has passed a resolution for each of the past three years \nto designate the second Sunday in December as ``National Children's \nMemorial Day.'' This year, the resolution I am introducing would \nestablish this day as an annual observance. The parents and family \nmembers of the children who have died deserve the comfort of knowing \nthat they will always have a special day set aside to honor the memory \nof their loved ones.\n  The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a \nfamily. I have had many constituents share\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\ntheir heart-wrenching stories with me about the death of their son or \ndaughter. I have heard heroic stories of kids battling cancer or \ndiabetes, and tragic stories of car accidents and drownings. Each of \nthese families has had their own experience, but they must all continue \nwith their lives and deal with the incredible pain of losing a child. \nBy establishing a day to remember children that have passed away, \nbereaved families from all over the country will be encouraged and \nsupported in working through their grief. It is important to families \nwho have suffered such loss to know that they are not alone.\n  In addition, this year, I have added a provision to designate the \nfourth Friday in April as ``National Children's Memorial Flag Day'' in \nrecognition of children who have died as a result of violence. April \nhas been designated as National Child Abuse Prevention Month, an annual \ntradition started by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Many State and \nlocal governmental agencies and private organizations already fly the \nChildren's Memorial Flag on the fourth Friday in April to remember \nchildren lost to violence. Recognizing this day is another way we can \ncommemorate the lives of children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/12/senate-section/article/S6141-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 797.
