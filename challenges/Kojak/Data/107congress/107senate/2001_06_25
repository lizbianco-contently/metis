The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we come back today to resume debate on a \nvery important bill to the people of this country, the Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act, which we spent the better part of last week \ndebating. It is an issue about which we have talked a great deal over \nthe course of the last few years in the Senate. Let me discuss what the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill does and the reason it is important.\n  Fundamentally, the reason we need this bill is that the law needs to \nbe taken from being on the side of the\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nHMOs and put on the side of patients and doctors so health care \ndecisions in this country are, in fact, being made by people who are \ntrained and have the experience to make them, those being the doctors, \nthe health care providers, for the families who are so dramatically \naffected by those decisions.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to provide certain substantive and \nenforceable rights to families and to children who need quality health \ncare. For example, we provide specifically that if a member of a family \nor child needs to see a specialist, particularly outside the HMO plan, \nthey can have access to that specialist.\n  Second, we ensure that patients who need access to clinical trials \nwill have access to those clinical trials. Clinical trials are often \nthe places of last resort, places where the cutting edge of medicine is \nbeing researched, and we want to be sure patients who have exhausted \nalternatives and need access to clinical trials--all federally approved \nclinical trials, including FDA clinical trials--will have access. We \nspecifically provide that benefit in this bill.\n  Third, women should have access to an OB/GYN as their primary care \nprovider. Many women rely on OB/GYNs as their primary care providers. \nWe provide that right in our legislation.\n  Fourth, we want to make sure patients have access to emergency room \ncare. If a family suffers an emergency crisis and needs to go directly \nto the hospital, the nearest hospital, we don't want people to first \nhave to call the HMO, call the 1-800 number and get permission to go to \nthe nearest emergency room. There have been many horror stories of \nfamilies that could not go to the nearest emergency room because they \ncouldn't afford it and the HMO would not pay for it. We want to be sure \nfamilies have that right.\n  With this group of rights we wish to provide for patients and \nfamilies across the country, we want to make sure every individual and \nfamily who is covered by health insurance, covered by HMO coverage, is \nin fact covered by this legislation. Our bill does that.\n  These rights do not mean anything unless they are enforceable, unless \nthey have the force of law behind them. Without the force of law behind \nthem, they are not a Patients' Bill of Rights; they are a patients' \nbill of suggestions. We want to provide a meaningful way for patients \nto receive the rights we are giving.\n  We provide several stages. If the HMO overrules the doctor and says, \nwhatever your doctor says, I don't believe that treatment, that care, \nis needed, the first step is that the patient can then go through an \ninternal review within the HMO to try to get that decision reversed, \nhopefully finding a group of people within the HMO who are willing to \nbe more objective and support the decision the doctor has provided. If \nthat is unsuccessful, the second stage is an independent review \nprocess, a panel of physicians with expertise who can look at the \nmedical situation and decide whether or not that care should have been \nprovided in the first instance. Last, if the patient has been injured \nand if these other areas have been tried, including the appeals \nprocess, the patient can take the HMO to court.\n  There are several stages: First, the HMO hopefully will make the \nright decision, in which case none of this will be necessary; second, \nif they don't, an internal review within the HMO to reverse the \ndecision that has already been made; third, if that is unsuccessful, to \ngo to an independent group of doctors who can reverse the decision of \nthe HMO. That is independent, meaning not connected to the patient, not \nconnected to the treating doctor, not connected to the HMO. So you have \nan impartial group that can reverse the decision. All of that occurs \nbefore a case goes to court.\n  If in fact it becomes necessary for the case to go to court, we \nsimply want the HMOs--that for many years now have been privileged \ncitizens that, like diplomats, get a kind of immunity in this country--\nwe want the HMOs treated just as everybody else.\n  If they are going to reverse or overrule decisions that are being \nmade by doctors, we want them to be treated exactly the way the doctors \nare treated; that is, if they make a medical judgment, reverse the \ndecision of a doctor, their case will go to the same court as the \ndoctor's case. Their case would be subject to the same State court \nlimitations on recoveries as is the doctor's. So we leave that issue to \nState law.\n  But the bottom line principle is, No. 1, HMOs should not continue to \nbe privileged citizens. They ought to be treated as all the rest of us. \nThere is no reason in the world that they are entitled to be treated \nbetter than everybody else.\n  No. 2, if they are going to be in the business of reversing doctors, \noverruling doctors, making health care decisions, then they ought to be \ntreated exactly the same way the doctors are treated.\n  Our legislation providing real and meaningful rights, providing a way \nto enforce those rights, and as a matter of last resort providing for \npatients to go to court if in fact they have been hurt and they have no \nother choice, is supported, we believe, by a majority of this body, we \nbelieve a majority of the House of Representatives, and importantly, by \nthe American Medical Association, and virtually every health care group \nin America.\n  There is a reason for that. It is because the people who have been \nfighting for patient protection, the people who have been fighting for \nHMO reform to change this system we have in this country and to give \npatients more power to put the law on their side, are supporting our \nbill because we have real rights that are enforceable. It is a bill \nwhere the patient, along with the patient's doctor, gets to make most \nhealth care decisions. They have more control over their health care \ndecisions. If the HMO does not do the right thing in the beginning, \nthey have a way to do something about it to get those decisions \noverruled or changed.\n  There has been some discussion over the course of the last 2 days on \nthe pending amendment, the issue of employer liability. We start, I \nthink, in principle, in agreement with the President of the United \nStates. The President said in his written principles that he did not \nwant employers to be held responsible in litigation--I am paraphrasing \nnow--unless they actually made individual health care decisions. That \nis what our bill does.\n  The reason for that is very simple. No. 1, we want to protect \nemployers. In principle, we agree about that. No. 2, if an employer, in \nfact, overrules an HMO and stands in its shoes, or overrules a doctor, \nthen and only then under our bill can they be held responsible, or if \nthey overrule the HMO with respect to how the plan applies. Basically, \nwhat we have done is we have put a wall around employers unless they \nstep into the shoes of HMOs and start making health care decisions.\n  Issues have been raised. They have been raised in this debate by \nSenator Gramm with his amendment. Issues have been raised by employers \naround the country with whom we have been talking and with whom we will \ncontinue to talk. As a result of those discussions, consistent with the \nprinciple that both the President of the United States and we have \nestablished, we have worked and we have had meetings, I will tell my \ncolleagues, over the last few days. On Friday, for example, I met with \na number of Senators from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and \nRepublican, to try to address the language, to try to craft language \nthat will deal with concerns that people have about this issue--a \nbipartisan compromise on this issue. We are continuing to work on that \ncompromise. There are a number of Senators involved. We will continue \nto work on it.\n\n  But the amendment that is pending is at the extreme. It is \ninconsistent with the principles established by the President of the \nUnited States; it is inconsistent with our legislation, which is \nsupported by virtually every health care group and consumer group in \nAmerica. It is more extreme than the Norwood-Dingell bill that passed \nthe House of Representatives last year. It is out there at an extreme.\n  We believe there is a better, more reasonable middle-of-the-road \napproach that will provide maximum protection to employers and at the \nsame time not completely eliminate patients' rights. That is what we \nare working on. We are working on crafting language.\n  This is one of the issues on which we agree in principle with the \nPresident; that is, we start with the idea we would like to see \nemployers protected unless they are overruling doctors and making \nindividual health care decisions. Of\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\ncourse, the vast majority of employers in this country never do that. \nThey turn over the handling of the day-to-day operation of their health \ncare plan to the people they are paying and leave it in their hands. \nWhen they do that, they will not be exposed to responsibility.\n  The bottom line is, what we have done in our legislation is \nconsistent with what the President's principle provides. Even with \nthat, since additional concerns have been raised about employers, since \nit is an issue about which we agree as a matter of principle, we are \ncontinuing to work with both Republican and Democratic Senators to \ncraft a compromise which we hope a vast majority of the Members of this \nSenate will be able to support when we propose it.\n  That issue, the issue of employer liability, as I indicated, is an \nissue on which I think we have substantial agreement. It is an issue I \nthink we can resolve to the satisfaction of a majority of the Senate. \nWe believe our bill as presently constructed does that. But in the \nspirit of trying to have strong bipartisan support for this bill, we \nhave continued to work on it, and we will continue to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina has \noutlined and characterized the situation. I would like to speak to some \nof the points he made and then specifically speak to a variety of \nissues.\n  To begin with, much of what the Senator said we agree with, I agree \nwith, and I think everybody agrees. There is no issue over access to \nemergency rooms. There is no issue over access to OB/GYNs. All those \nissues have been agreed to. They were agreed to last year. They were \nagreed to this year.\n  There is no issue about the need to make sure that when someone is \ninjured by their HMO or their provider or their insurer, they have \nrecourse. There is no issue about that. Everybody is in agreement.\n  The issues come down in the classic way, in the classic line, to \n``The devil is in the details.'' The bill as brought forth by Senator \nMcCain, Senator Edwards, and Senator Kennedy is essentially a ``let's \ngo to court'' bill. It is not a Patients' Bill of Rights bill. I have \nreferred to it as a ``lawyers who want to be millionaires bill,'' and I \nhave referred to it in other terms, but essentially it is a lawyers' \nrights bill. It creates an incredible number of new opportunities to \nbring lawsuits.\n  We just happened to go through and outline some of these and this \nchart shows them. First, you can sue your employer. Under this proposal \nas it is structured. That should not be our goal. Our goal should not \nbe to create lawsuits against the employers in the country. I noticed \nmy colleague always used the term ``health maintenance'' organization, \nHMO. It is a pejorative--or it has become pejorative. I never heard him \nuse the word ``employer.'' Yet for the 56 million people who are \ncovered by self-insured plans--plans where the employer is the one who \ngets sued--the fact is, you can sue the employer. What is the practical \neffect of that? We know the practical effect is a lot of employers are \ngoing to drop their insurance so the people who have insurance today \nwill not have it tomorrow if this bill is passed because the employers \nare going to say: Hey, I am not in the business of being sued for \nhealth care problems. If a doctor makes a mistake, I don't want to be \nsued. If I make a product and make a mistake, I understand I will be \nsued, but I don't want to be sued if a doctor or nurse or pharmacist or \nhospital makes a mistake. I don't want to be put out of business for \nthat.\n  We are talking about mom-and-pop employers. We are talking about \nemployers who have 10, 15, 20 employees.\n  The average cost of a malpractice suit is $77,000. So you have a \nsituation where their whole profit for the year may be wiped out. Maybe \nyou are running a small grocery store or a restaurant or a gas station. \nYou will be wiped out because you will have to defend the suit even \nthough you had nothing to do with it as an employer.\n  This bill as structured has massive liability for employers. They can \nbe sued in the Federal court or in the State court, which is really \nironic.\n  Brand new causes of action: There are almost 200 new causes of action \nunder this bill for ministerial activities under which an employer may \nmake a mistake. The damages are unlimited under those causes of action. \nIt is not $100 or $200. It is not a fine from the Labor Department as \nit is under present law or a fine from HHS as is under present law. \nThere is a new private cause of action that accrues against the \nemployer for not sending the proper forms or for not informing you or \nfor not sending you the right magazine. For anything that is under \nHIPAA or anything under COBRA or anything that is under ERISA, they are \nsuddenly liable as the employer under this bill. They are brought in \nunder this bill, and they are liable. There are 200 new causes of \naction.\n  The damages under this bill are unbelievable. Obviously, it is a bill \nwritten by the trial lawyers because there are no limitations on \neconomic, noneconomic, or punitive damages. By putting on a new title, \nthey are trying to go around with this classy, misty, ``special \nassessment'' In Federal court, there is a limit of $100 million in \npunitive damages. Of course, they do not tell you that you can go to \nState courts, and in most States there is no limit on damages. This new \n``special assessment'' is just window dressing.\n  Punitive damages are uncapped, economic damages are uncapped, and \nnoneconomic damages are uncapped.\n  This is a lawyer's fantasy world. It is similar to a lawyer walking \ninto Disney World to pick their forum, their most interesting forum, \nState or Federal. They can pick hundreds of suits. They can pick \nunlimited damages--economic, noneconomic.\n  You are going to see employers dropping their health insurance like \nhotcakes as a result of this; you can go straight to court.\n  I heard the Senator from North Carolina say: Internal appeal process, \nyou have an external appeal process. Then, under very similar certain \ncircumstances you can go to court. Hey, with this bill you can go \nstraight to court.\n  There isn't a good lawyer in this country who would not skip the \nexternal appeals process the way this bill is structured. This is \nprobably the single biggest problem this bill has because it is the \nexternal appeals that will settle most of the differences a patient has \nwith their employer--whether it is an employer or an HMO--because, if \nyou have a good external appeals process with medical expertise and \nindependent resources, and if you require the two parties to pursue \nthat external appeal, then at the end of the external appeal the odds \nare very good that the resolution is going to be fair, the parties are \ngoing to accept it, and you won't have a court action. I suspect court \nactions would be rare with a good external appeals process.\n  A good external appeals process is one such as in the Nickles bill \nlast year or such as is in the Frist-Jeffords bipartisan bill. It is a \ntripartisan bill. It is tripartisan because there is an independent, a \nRepublican, and a Democrat on the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, which \nessentially says you can skip the external appeals and go to court. But \nall you get when you do that is an opportunity to get your problem \ntaken care of. You don't get awards. You don't get awards for going to \ncourt. You essentially get taken care of, which is appropriate if you \nhave a situation where the injury is immediate and the harm is \ncontinuing. You should be able to go to court during the external \nappeals process and get that taken care of, if it is necessary. That is \nthe way the Frist-Breaux bill is written.\n\n  The way their bill is structured, you go to court, period. You don't \neven bother with external appeals. You allege your harm. They claim it \nis not alleged anymore. But, essentially, it is alleged, and you are in \ncourt. You get your damage claim going; you start suing like crazy. You \npick the forum that is best, the jury that is the best, the courts that \nare best, and the best States, and you are off and running in the court \nsystem.\n  That is the way this bill is intentionally structured. It is not an \nunintentional event. This bill is intentionally structured in order to \nget more lawsuits, and in order to get more opportunities to create \nlawsuits. It couldn't be done for any other reason.\n  When you look at this list, ``statute of limitation''--what statute \nof limitation? For all intents and purposes, they\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nhave no statute of limitation under this bill because you can \nessentially bring a cause of action after 180 days. The external \nappeals process is eliminated. All you have to do is claim that you \nhave just found the injury and you are off and running again. Ten years \nafter the event, the statute of limitation is almost irrelevant under \nthis bill.\n  As I mentioned, forum shopping, picking your forum, is a classic \nlove-fest for plaintiff's lawyers.\n  The first thing you are taught in the trial practice courses when you \ngo to law school is forum shopping. That is black letter education in \nlaw school. I was there. I know. I even passed that course. I think I \nput down ``forum shopping'' on every answer.\n  This bill puts it right at the top of the list, as you might expect. \nTwo bites at the apple: You can sue in both courts. They are not happy \nenough with forum shopping.\n  The avarice of the trial bar in designing this bill is almost \nhumorous it is so aggressive. They weren't happy to just put in forum \nshopping, which doesn't exist today. They had to go with simultaneous \nforums. You can bring the lawsuit in both courts. You can go to State \nand Federal at the same time. It is lawsuit Disney World.\n  Of course, you can bring multiple lawsuits. I sue, you sue, and \neverybody sues under this bill.\n  You can have class action suits, which is something you can't have \nunder present law. There is a very good reason for that under federal \nlaw.\n  What is the practical effect? This is the bottom line. With all of \nthese lawsuits, you end up with a bill that, if it were to pass, \naccording to OMB's estimates, would cause 4 million to 5 million people \nto become uninsured. According to the CBO estimate, it is 1.3 million. \nEither way, it is a huge number of people.\n  They don't get patients' rights under this bill. They get no \ninsurance under this bill because their employers are not going to be \nable to afford or justify giving that benefit in exchange for all the \nlawsuits to which they would be subjected.\n\n  What is going to happen in the real world? The bigger employers will \nsay: All right, I know you need health insurance, but we can't manage \nit anymore because we just can't take the adverse risk of all of these \nlawsuits. So we are going to give you some money as one of your \ncompensation functions, and you can take that money and go into the \nmarket and buy your insurance.\n  The only problem is that the employer's insurance plan is inevitably \ngoing to have been much better--much better for the employees than what \nthey can go out and buy with the dollars or the voucher they are given \nby the employer because the employees will be out there with one \nvoucher trying to buy their insurance in an open market, and they won't \nhave a whole lot of market force behind them. But an employer that \nmaybe employs 50, 100, or even 15,000, 20,000, or maybe even 50,000 \npeople, has huge market clout. They can get better rates, and therefore \nthey can get better options. They can maybe get eyeglass options or \ndrug options or a variety of other options that the employees can't get \nwith the voucher they are going to be given by large employers.\n  A lot of people may not lose their insurance altogether, but the \nquality of their insurance under this bill is going to drop radically.\n  Then there are the other people who do not use employers. They are \nself-insurers who do not have a lot of employees. There are 100, 50, \n35, or 20 people. These employers are going to say to their employees: \nWe are sorry; we can't afford it at all. We can't afford it at all.\n  You are going to have a lot of people without any insurance, period.\n  That is the practical effect of this. There are negotiations going \non. There are ways to fix this. They are not radical. They are not \nreactionary. They are reasonable. In fact, they are so reasonable that \nthey have been put forward by Senators Frist, Breaux, and Jeffords. As \nI said, it is a tripartisan bill. They have a liability section which \nmakes sense. It is not just limited to designated decisionmakers. It is \na much broader term than that. It goes to this whole issue of external \nappeal. It goes to the issue of punitive damages and to the issue of \nforum shopping. It goes to the issue of bringing in all these causative \ncauses of actions under COBRA, ERISA, and HIPAA which are not \nappropriate in this bill.\n\n  So if you want to fix this bill--I hear the other side saying that on \noccasion; I am not sure if they really mean it. But if they want to \nreally fix the bill, just take the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords language en \nbloc in the area of liability and put it in the bill. The bill would be \nfixed in the area of liability and external appeals. Do we see them \ndoing that? No.\n  There was some discussion in this Chamber earlier about this pending \namendment by the Senator from Texas, who I see is in the Chamber. The \ndiscussion from the other side essentially was: OK, you say you don't \nwant employers to be liable. Texas law does not allow employers to be \nliable, so let's adopt the Texas law.\n  Why was that amendment offered? Because the other side of the aisle \nspecifically said they wanted to have a bill that was almost identical \nto Texas law. In fact, the Senator from North Carolina used those \nterms. He said: This bill, as structured, is almost identical to the \nTexas law. So the Senator from Texas said: If it is almost identical to \nTexas law, let's just put the Texas law language in, which is what his \namendment does; it puts the Texas law language in. And it is pretty \nreasonable. It is the Texas language. So now the bill would not be \nalmost identical; it would be identical.\n  Since a number of the Members on the other side of the aisle said: We \nwant the Texas law, we want what President Bush had in Texas, the Texas \nlaw is acceptable and what President Bush had in Texas, the Senator \nfrom Texas said: OK, we will put the Texas law in as an amendment. If \nthe two are the same--and the two are the same--everybody will vote for \nthis. We will not have to have a rollcall vote on it; we can have a \nvoice vote.\n  I think you will find it is opposed by Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle. The simple fact is, their law does not exempt employers, as \ndoes the Texas law. Their law does not exempt the lawyers. Theirs makes \nthe employers, carte blanche, liable and opens up all kinds of \nopportunities to sue them, without caps, with punitive damages, and in \nwhatever form they want to choose. The Texas law does not allow that to \nhappen. The Texas law does protect the employer and does limit damages.\n  So I look forward to the vote on this amendment. I think it will test \nwhether or not the statements coming from the other side of the aisle--\nthat they want the Texas law--are backed up by a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me respond briefly to some of the comments made by \nmy colleague from New Hampshire.\n  This is the same tired old rhetoric the HMOs have been trotting out \nfor years now to keep any kind of reform from occurring. They are now, \nby the way, spending many millions of dollars on lobbyists and public \nrelations campaigns, and on television, to try to defeat any kind of \nreform.\n  These are the same arguments we have heard before. We need to get \npast that. We need to get to talking about providing real protections \nand real rights for patients. That is what Senator McCain and I did. We \nworked for many months on this legislation to address many of the \nissues about which my colleague has just talked but nothing ever \nchanges. No matter what we bring to this Chamber by way of patient \nprotection, we hear these same arguments made. Let me speak to just a \ncouple of those arguments briefly.\n  First, on the issue of forum shopping, cases going to State court, I \nsay to my colleague from New Hampshire, he should see what the Chief \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court, by way of the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States, which the Chief Justice heads, said about this \nissue. He specifically said in a written letter dated March 3, 2000:\n\n       The Judicial Conference urges Congress to provide that, in \n     any managed care legislation agreed upon, the state courts be \n     the primary forum for the resolution of personal injury \n     claims arising from the denial of health care benefits. . . .\n\n  What we have done in our bill is exactly what the Judicial Conference \nof\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nthe United States has said should be done. We have done what the \nAmerican Bar Association says should be done; we have done what the \nAttorneys General of the United States say should be done; and we have \ndone what the U.S. Supreme Court said, in the Pegram decision, should \nbe done.\n  I know it is a wild idea that Senator McCain and I have decided to \nadopt the consensus of every objective group in America on this \nsubject, including the U.S. Supreme Court. I am telling you, they would \ncomplain no matter what we did, because this is the rhetoric of \nantireform. That is what this argument is about.\n  Ultimately, this debate evolves into a very simple question: Are we \ngoing to do something about this problem or are we going to continue to \nkill reform legislation? We have to make a decision about whether we \nare going to make progress or whether we are going to obstruct \nprogress.\n  Another issue my colleague raises is the issue of caps and whether \nthere are limitations on recovery. He had his chart, which is not here \nanymore, that had lots of information about unlimited lawsuits and that \nthere were to limitations. I sy to my colleague, what we have done, \nthat he does not like, is we have treated HMOs exactly the same way as \nevery doctor, every hospital, and everybody else in America is treated.\n  All of the rest of us, everyone listening to this debate, whether on \ntelevision or in person, is treated exactly the way we treat HMOs in \nthis bill. They do not like that. HMOs, I am sure, would like to \nmaintain their privileged status. That is why they are spending \nmillions of dollars to try to defeat our legislation with respect to \nthe specific issue of employers.\n  I say to my colleague, the President of the United States--the \nRepublican President of the United States--and I am reading from his \nwritten principle--says:\n\n       Only employers who retain responsibility for and make final \n     medical decisions should be subject to suit.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator entertain a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Having had some modest comparison to my distinguished \ncolleague in the trial courtroom, I know that is a key phrase. I am not \nsure just how it is going to end up, or not end up, in the legislation, \ndepending on the amendments, but I think it would be helpful to have \nsome legislative history on what the meaning is of an employer \nparticipating in the medical decisions of an employee.\n  Let's take the example of a small employer. Most often, that employer \nhas a great deal of personal contact with his employees, has a great \ndeal of empathy for the employee or his family stricken with some type \nof problem.\n  Suppose I were an employer, and my longtime secretary appears to be \nill, and I say: I think we had better go to the hospital. So I drive \nher to the hospital. Maybe some other employee in the firm drives her. \nThen, while in the hospital, I went to call on her, and somehow I am \ninvolved in the discussion as to whether or not an operation should be \nperformed.\n  What are the circumstances by which the employer could be drawn into \nthis type of litigation? Depending on how the bill is finally written \nand the law is enacted, it could well be that an employer henceforth \njust almost has to sever all personal relationships with employees for \nfear of getting drawn into a legal case.\n  I say to the Senator, it would be helpful, based on his experience, \nif he would elaborate on that issue and, indeed, point to other \nreferences in the debate or elsewhere so that we might have a \nlegislative history to guide those who are going to follow this law in \nthe future.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his question. I think the \nSenator is concerned about some of the same issues others have raised \nand on which we have been working. I think it is a legitimate question.\n  I say to the Senator, what we did in our bill is have language that \nwas intended to protect employers unless they stepped into the shoes of \nthe HMO and actually made a medical decision essentially overruling the \nHMO. That was conceptually what we did in our bill, and that is \nconceptually what the President says in his principle.\n  But the practical question which the Senator asked is a legitimate \nquestion. That is the reason, I say to the Senator, we are working with \nour colleagues across the aisle--Republicans and Democrats--to try to \ncraft appropriate language, because we do not want to create a \ndisincentive. We want to protect employers, particularly the small \nbusiness employers about which the Senator is talking. But I say to the \nSenator, it is not just the small employers.\n  Although they are a very small part of the population of employers in \nthis country, we also have self-insured, self-administered plans where \nbasically the employer is the only entity managing the health care of \nits employees.\n  What we want to do is try to find a way to provide some protection \nalso for those employers. Those are the kinds of issues--the question \nthe Senator asked, which is a very fair question, and the issue I just \nraised of the self-employed, self administered plan--those are the \nkinds of issues we are trying to address without leaving the patient or \nthe employee completely out in the cold.\n  I do believe there is a way to do that. It requires some work and \ncreativity, but it can be done. Our goal in this process is the same. \nWe want employers to be protected; we want to provide maximum \nprotection actually for the employers without completely leaving the \nemployee out, for example.\n  The problem with completely carving out the employer, as this \namendment does, is that in some cases you may have an employer, a large \nemployer, where they are a self-insured and a self-administered plan. \nLet's say a bookkeeper says, we are not paying for the test for the \nchild of an employee; that child suffers some serious consequence from \nthat. Under this carve-out, there is nowhere that child could go \nbecause there is no HMO. It is a self-insured, self-administered plan. \nUnder the President's language, which says ``only employers who retain \nresponsibility for and make final medical decisions should be subject \nto suit,'' there would be somewhere for that child of that employee to \ngo.\n  What we are trying to do--and I think it can be done--is to fashion \nlanguage that provides maximum protection for the employer but at the \nsame time doesn't leave that small group of employees that would be \nimpacted by it completely out in the cold.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague\n  Let's talk about a large employer. I am simply the manager of a \nsection with maybe seven or eight employees, but they are good friends. \nThey have worked with me for a very long time. One suddenly becomes \nill. Were I to drive that person to the hospital and in any other way \nparticipate in trying to alleviate the pain and suffering of the \nmoment, would that then subject my overall firm to liability by virtue \nof my actions, say, as a good Samaritan?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That kind of unintended consequence is exactly what we \nwant to avoid. The issues the Senator from Virginia is discussing in \nthis colloquy are the same kinds of issues that have been addressed by \nemployers to us and my colleagues who are working to try to fashion \nlanguage to solve the problem the Senator raises and the problem raised \nin the earlier example and to make sure, for an employer that has \nimproperly been brought into a case--if they have been brought into a \ncase and they don't belong in the case, we provide a mechanism, a \nprocedural mechanism that they can get out of the case so they don't \nget dragged through a court proceeding when they don't belong there.\n  Those are the kinds of issues that need to be addressed, that we are \nattempting to address, and I believe we will find a solution to, \nconsistent with the principle the President has laid out and the \nprinciple in which we believe.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, what we have done in the McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy bill is structured a system that, unlike my colleague \ndescribes, is actually intended to avoid cases going to court. If we \ndidn't want to avoid cases going to court, we would not first have an \ninternal appeal and then have an independent external appeal. What we \nhave learned from experience is the majority of cases get resolved. In \nTexas, California, and in Georgia, for\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nthe three examples, when that system is in place, most cases get \ndecided by that system. I think in Georgia and California there \nactually hasn't been a single lawsuit filed. That is good because the \npurpose is to get treatment to patients.\n\n  But there will be rare cases where the HMO does something \ninappropriate, wrongful, and, as a result, somebody gets hurt. It is \nnot right, under our system of justice, for a family to be responsible \nfor the rest of their lives to pay for that. If the HMO is responsible, \nthey should be held accountable, just as all the rest of us. That is \nthe reason we have set up this system the way it is.\n  What we have ultimately is real rights that are enforceable through \nan internal review, then an external review, and then, if necessary, if \nsomeone gets hurt, the case can go to court. And the cases that go to \nState court, where the HMO is treated just as everybody else, are \nsubject to whatever State laws and caps apply to those kinds of cases. \nSo there are, in fact, limitations. The rhetoric that there are no \nlimitations is, in fact, not true.\n  The majority of States in this country have limitations on \nrecoveries. And as the judicial conference suggested, as the American \nBar Association suggested, as the State attorneys general suggested, we \nhave sent those cases to State court, to a place where there are \nlimitations on recovery but where we treat the HMOs not as privileged \ncitizens anymore but just as all the rest of us. To Senator McCain and \nme, as we worked on this, it seemed the fair, right, and just thing to \ndo--that HMOs get treated the same as everybody else. If they are going \nto make medical decisions, they ought to be treated as the doctors whom \nthey are overruling. That is exactly what the structure of this bill \nis.\n  My colleague said something that was incorrect a few minutes ago. He \nsaid that all you had to do to avoid the appeals process and go \nstraight to court was to allege that you had irreparable harm. That is \nnot the case. That word does not appear in our legislation. But if, in \nfact, someone has died as a result of what an HMO has done to them, we \nthought it was a little unreasonable to make the family of someone who \nhas already died go through an appeal before they could go to court. \nThere is not much reason for them to be exhausting administrative \nremedies. We think we have a commonsense approach, one that works.\n  The model of California, Georgia, and Texas, and other States shows \nthat these laws work. They give patients rights. They don't result in a \nlot of litigation. In fact, in those three States, in spite of the \nrhetorical arguments being made that people will lose their health \ninsurance, in those three States, while those laws have been in place \nwith real patient protection, the number of uninsured has gone down, \nnot up. So at least the evidence, according to the three models we have \nused, is that people think this system works. Lawsuits are not created \nby it. In fact, they are avoided.\n  Third, the number of uninsured, at least in those three \njurisdictions, has not gone up. In fact, it has gone down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to say that when I listen to the \nSenator from North Carolina, I almost always agree with what he says, \nbut when I read his bill, A, I never find it does what he says, and, B, \nI never agree with it.\n  First of all, when the Senator chastised some for saying his bill \nsimply required that there be an allegation in order to escape the \nexternal review process, that was not a figment of the imagination of \ncritics or paid lobbyists or special interest groups, as if special \ninterest groups and the trial lawyers don't also support the Senator's \nbill, as if only special interests oppose it and none supports it. But \nno one made that up. That is a word on page 149 of the previous version \nof their bill.\n  In fact, I raised this very issue over and over again, and the \nSenator and his cosponsors changed their bill to drop the word. This \nwas not a word made up by anybody. This was a word that appeared in the \noriginal bill.\n  Now as for treating HMOs like everybody else, I find it a strange \nassertion that they are treated like doctors and hospitals. Let me \nexplain why. First of all, I refer to the bill that is before us, the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and specifically to the section related to \nsuing employers: ``Cause of action against employers.''\n  I begin with the assertion that this bill treats doctors and \nhospitals exactly the way it does HMOs.\n  In fact, the Senator says, by putting these cases back in State \ncourt, they are treated the same. Surely, the Senator must be aware \nthat under State law, for example, in Texas and in California there are \nlimits on liability for doctors and for hospitals, but there are no \nlimited liabilities for health plans or employers under State law \neither in Texas or in California.\n  So to assert that by putting these cases that arise under Federal \nlaw--ERISA is a Federal law--by putting them back into the States they \nare being treated exactly the same as doctors and hospitals is \nfactually inaccurate, because State laws often do impose liability \nlimits on doctors and hospitals, but almost never do they impose \nliability limits on employers, or insurance companies, or HMOs.\n  Finally, so I can get on to my point, let me say that when the \nSenator says his bill treats doctors and hospitals exactly the same as \nit treats HMOs, I find that an interesting assertion. I turn to page \n148 of his bill and I see an exclusion. In fact, on line 12, 148, it \nsays: ``Exclusion of Physicians and Other Health Care Professionals.'' \nThis is in the section on liability for employers. I will go into that \nin some detail.\n  I want to make this point. At the end of this section on liability \nfor employers, it has two specific carve-outs where entities are \ntreated very differently from employers. The first entity on line 12 is \nphysicians: ``No treating physician or other treating health care \nprofessional of the participant or beneficiary, and no person acting \nunder the direction of such a physician or health care professional, \nshall be liable under paragraph (1),'' which is the paragraph related \nto employer liability.\n  And then on page 149, there is an exclusion for hospitals. It says: \n``No treating hospital of the participant or beneficiary shall be \nliable under paragraph (1).''\n  So on page 148 it exempts the treating physician. On page 149, it \nexempts the hospital from the same liability section for the employer. \nBut then, to just be absolutely certain that no one is confused, let's \ncome down to the bottom of page 149 and see if employers are treated \nthe same and HMOs are treated the same as doctors and hospitals. It \nsays: ``Nothing in paragraph (6),'' which is the exclusion for \nphysicians, ``or (7),'' which is the exclusion for hospitals, ``shall \nbe construed to limit the liability . . . of the plan, the plan \nsponsor, or any health insurance issuer,'' and the plan sponsor, of \ncourse, is the employer.\n  So to say that this bill treats doctors and hospitals the same way it \ndoes insurance companies, HMOs, and employers, sounds very good and \nreassuring. The problem is that it is not true.\n  Now let me begin and make the point I want to make. First of all, I \nsend three letters to the desk and ask they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the 600,000 small-business \n     owners who are members of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), I am writing to express our \n     strong support for your amendment to provide an employer \n     liability exemption modeled after the Texas managed care \n     legislation. As you are well aware, groups on both sides of \n     the issue agree that under Texas law, employers are \n     explicitly exempt from liability. We will work diligently to \n     ensure that members on both sides of the aisle support your \n     amendment--especially those who specifically stated that they \n     do not want employers to be held liable for voluntarily \n     offering health care to their employees.\n       Small-business owners are already being forced to drop \n     health-care as a result of the high cost of premiums; of the \n     43 million uninsured Americans, 26 million (61%) are small \n     business owners and their employees. The most recent Kennedy/\n     McCain/Edwards proposal actually increases the likelihood \n     that more small employers and their families will join the \n     ranks of the uninsured. For\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\n     the first time, it would authorize several new bases for \n     lawsuits that could be initiated under federal law for \n     unlimited damages. Employers could be sued in both state and \n     federal courts. Their proposal does not preclude any employer \n     from being named as a defendant in the growing number of \n     cases that are now being filed as class action lawsuits.\n       If Congress enacts any legislation that exposes employers \n     to unfair lawsuits, many small-business owners would stop \n     offering health insurance altogether for fear that one \n     lawsuit could wipe out their business. Even if employers are \n     shielded from lawsuits, imposing liability on health plans \n     would lead to higher premiums, which would then be passed on \n     to employers and their families. Small-business owners and \n     their employees simply cannot afford to supplement the income \n     of wealthy trial attorneys. Fifty-seven percent of small \n     businesses said in a recent poll that they would drop \n     coverage rather than risk a suit that will undoubtedly \n     threaten the livelihood of their business. It's easy to see \n     why, given the fact that the average cost for a business to \n     defend itself from a lawsuit is $100,000.\n       Again, I commend you for your continued support on behalf \n     of small-business owners and their employees. We look forward \n     to working with you to ensure that employers are not \n     penalized for voluntarily offering health-care benefits to \n     their employees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Dan Danner,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         U.S. Chamber of Commerce,\n\n\n                               Congressional & Public Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2001.\n     To the Members of the U.S. Senate:\n       As the world's largest business federation representing \n     more than three million employers and organizations of every \n     size, sector and region, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is \n     greatly concerned about the liability provisions of S. 1052, \n     the Kennedy-McCain ``Patient Protection Act of 2001'', that \n     expose employers to lawsuits and unlimited damage awards.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the \n     amendment offered by Senators Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison to S. 1052 that would exclude employers from \n     lawsuits for the actions of the health plans they sponsor. It \n     should be noted, however, that this amendment, on its own, \n     does not address other fundamental flaws in the underlying \n     legislation, nor will it protect employers from the huge \n     liability costs imposed on health plans by this proposal.\n       Employers voluntarily provide health coverage to 172 \n     million Americans, at an average cost of $6,351 per working \n     family. While this amendment exempts employers from being \n     party to a lawsuit, the cost of open-ended liability on \n     health plans will ultimately be borne by businesses and \n     working families. Furthermore, self-insured health plans \n     directly pay the cost of damages and litigation out of their \n     bottom line, even if they use a third-party administrator to \n     make claims decisions.\n       Given our sluggish economy, employers will not be able to \n     bear the passed-on costs of litigation and unlimited damage \n     awards. Much of those costs will also be borne by employees, \n     who, studies show, are increasingly turning down their \n     employers' offer of coverage because they cannot afford the \n     higher monthly premiums and out-of-pocket deductibles, \n     coinsurance and copayments. Our health care system does not \n     need any more litigation. In addition to supporting the \n     Gramm-Hutchison amendment, we urge you to remedy the onerous \n     liability provisions of S. 1052 so that employers can fully \n     benefit from the protection offered them by the Gramm-\n     Hutchison amendment.\n       Because of the importance of this issue to working \n     families, the small business community and the American \n     economy, we urge you to support the Gramm-Hutchison amendment \n     to S. 1052. The Chamber will consider using votes on or in \n     relation to Gramm-Hutchison for inclusion in our annual ``How \n     They Voted'' ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Benefits Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Senate will soon vote on your \n     amendment to limit the liability of employers under the \n     Kennedy-McCain version of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n       We strongly share your view that the Kennedy-McCain bill is \n     fundamentally flawed and should not be enacted. It is certain \n     to drive up health costs well beyond the double-digit \n     increases that employers are already facing, increase the \n     numbers of uninsured Americans and place all employer-\n     sponsored group health plans under the constant threat of \n     unlimited liability and inconsistent decisions made by \n     separate state courts.\n       The Gramm amendment responds directly to one of the primary \n     concerns raised by both large and small employers throughout \n     the long debate over this legislation. there can be no doubt \n     that many employers who voluntarily offer this highly \n     valuable benefits to employees will be unwilling or unable to \n     do so in the future if the Kennedy-McCain bill is enacted. \n     There is no subtle way to express how profound and \n     destructive the threat of constant litigation and unlimited \n     damages would be to our nation's employer-sponsored health \n     benefits. systems.\n       Support for the Gramm amendment would be a vote in favor of \n     preserving health benefits sponsored today by employers and a \n     vote in favor of the millions of Americans who rely on health \n     benefits through their employer today. However, it should \n     also be clear that even if an amendment is approved to shield \n     employers from direct liability, our position on the bill \n     itself remains firm and unchanged. The Kennedy-McCain bill is \n     an extreme measure that should not be enacted and the bill \n     would still impose unacceptably high burdens on the health \n     plans and others involved in administering employer-sponsored \n     health benefits for which employers themselves would \n     ultimately shoulder the higher costs.\n       We commend you and your supporters for offering this \n     amendment to protect employers from the excessive liability \n     that would result from the Kennedy-McCain bill. We urge the \n     Senate to move next to comprehensively cure the problem that \n     this bill poses by rejecting the Kennedy-McCain proposal and \n     enacting a sound Patients' Bill of Rights that meets the \n     President's principles and can be signed into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Klein,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. The first letter is from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business on behalf of 600,000 small businessowners in \nAmerica. They have endorsed the amendment I have offered that will be \nvoted on tomorrow, which exempts employers from being sued under this \nbill.\n  The second letter is from the Chamber of Commerce of the United \nStates, the world's largest business federation, representing over 3 \nmillion employers, making this vote a key vote for the Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  Finally, the third letter is from the American Benefits Council, \nwhich is in support of this amendment.\n  Let me try to explain briefly what this is all about. These are \ncomplicated issues and they are very easy issues to get confused. Let \nme start with the Federal bill, since there has been so much talk about \nit. Let me be sure that everybody knows exactly what we are talking \nabout. This is S. 1052, which is the pending bill that was originally \nauthored by Senator McCain, for himself, Senator Edwards, Senator \nKennedy, and others.\n  I will start on page 144 of the bill. A lot has been said about suing \nemployers. Almost everything that has been said has been that you can't \nsue employers. I want to just go through the bill very briefly, lest \nthere be any doubt about the fact of whether or not you can sue \nemployers, and try to explain the concern that I have that the National \nFederation of Independent Business has, and that the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has about this bill, and the fact that it would expose \nemployers to liability.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that employers are not required by law to \nprovide health insurance to their employees. There is no Federal or \nState statute anywhere that requires that employer benefits be \nprovided. Employers provide benefits because they choose to, because \nthey care about their employees, or if they believe that in order to be \ncompetitive in getting good employees and holding them they have to \nprovide benefits, they decide to do it on a voluntary basis. So the \ncause of not just concern, but alarm, in the business community is that \nunder this bill it will be possible to sue not the insurance company, \nnot the HMO, not the people who are practicing, such as doctors and \nhospitals, but you will be able to sue the employers.\n  Let me start with the language of the bill. This bill has in this \nsection, as it does in many other sections, language that is very \nconfusing and misleading. I want to give a simple example. Look on page \n144, on line 5, it says: ``Exclusion of Employers and Other Plan \nSponsors,'' which implies that they are excluded, that you can't sue \nemployers. And then in section (A), line 7, it says: ``Causes of Action \nAgainst Employers and Plan Sponsors Precluded.'' Read that sentence. \nYou say you can't have a cause of action against employers and plan \nsponsors; they are specifically precluded. That is exactly what the \nheadline says.\n  And then it says: ``Subject to subparagraph (B),'' and that is where \nyou become concerned because up here it says you can't sue them. The \nnext line is ``Subject to subparagraph (B)''--I will come back to \nthat--``paragraph (1)(A) does not authorize a cause of action against \nan employer''--just as\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nclear as the rising Sun. You can't sue employers. But when you get down \nto subparagraph (B), it says: ``Certain Causes of Action Permitted,'' \nand then it says: ``Notwithstanding subparagraph (A),'' which is what I \njust read, ``a cause of action may arise against an employer or other \nplan sponsor.''\n  In other words, paragraph (A) says you can't sue them and paragraph \n(B) says you can sue them. And then you have seven pages of ifs, ands, \nand buts about whether you can or cannot sue employers, and under what \ncircumstances you can sue them.\n  And then, obviously, it gets pretty complicated. The question comes \ndown to, what would a judge say? What would a jury say? What would some \nvery smart plaintiff's attorney be able to do with this language?\n  Then the problem gets even greater because you get down to the use of \nterms that don't jump out at you as triggering other things. But when \nyou understand how they fit into Federal law, they say you can sue \nemployers. I will give you an example. On line 18 of page 145, it says \nyou can't sue the employer except when the employer directly \nparticipates--and let me read the whole paragraph:\n\n       Direct Participation in Decisions.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (B), the term ``direct participation'' means, in \n     connection with a decision described in clause (i) of \n     paragraph (1)(A) or a failure described in clause (ii) of \n     such paragraph. The actual making of such decision or the \n     actual exercise of control . . .\n\n  It does not jump out at you that ``exercise of control'' means \nanything. It does not unless you know that under ERISA, which governs \nall employer benefits under Federal law, the employer is always deemed \nto exercise control over employee benefits.\n  There are 7\\1/2\\ pages of ifs, ands, and buts, but there is a lot of \nlanguage that when it is brought into the context of existing Federal \nlaw it creates the strong potential that employers could be sued and \ncould be sued for nothing other than simply having tried to join with \ntheir employees in buying health insurance and conducting activity that \nhad to do with operating their business, appointing employees to \ninterface with their health plan, their insurance company, their HMO.\n  Then, as if anybody would doubt the intention of this bill, it has \nthis extraordinary section on page 148 and 149, having created this \nliability for employers, and then in 7\\1/2\\ pages talking about when \nyou can sue them and when you cannot sue them, it then comes down and \nexcludes physicians, excludes hospitals, and then it says:\n\n       But nothing in excluding physicians or excluding hospitals \n     can be construed as excluding employers.\n\n  If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle wonder why it is \nthat employers are alarmed, all they have to do is to look at the \nlanguage of their bill in the context of ERISA to understand that we \nhave a very real potential for employers to be sued.\n  The Texas Legislature, which has been held out to be a standard for \npatients' rights--in fact, if I am not wrong, Senator Edwards said on \nABC ``This Week'':\n\n       The President, during his campaign, looked the American \n     people in the eye in the third debate and said: ``I will \n     fight for Patients' Bill of Rights,'' referencing the Texas \n     law. Our bill is almost identical.\n\n  Identical to what? The Texas law. Let me make it clear it is not \nidentical. Under the bill before us, it clearly says employers can be \nsued. It has 7\\1/2\\ pages of circumstances under which they can be \nsued. It uses language that ties in to ERISA that suggests they might \nbe sued, and then it excludes doctors and hospitals but specifically \ndoes not exclude employers from being sued.\n  That is what the bill before us does. What does the Texas law do? The \nTexas Legislature, when it debated and passed the Patients' Bill of \nRights, did not believe that all employers were good people. It did not \nbelieve there would never be an incident where employers would do the \nwrong thing. It did not believe that. They debated this extensively, \nbut they did believe they had put together a system of checks and \nbalances.\n  In fact, this bill, the Republican alternative, the Breaux-Frist \nbill, every HMO bill, every Patients' Bill of Rights bill that has been \nintroduced, is really modeled after State plans. One of the most \nprominent of those plans is the Texas plan.\n  In Texas they concluded there was no way they could write it that \nwould not guarantee that employers would not be subject to being sued \nother than to simply exempt employers from being sued.\n  What they said was, in very simple terms:\n\n       This chapter--\n\n  Which relates to liability in their bill--\n\n     does not create any liability on the part of an employer.\n\n  There are no 7\\1/2\\ pages of ifs, ands, or buts after this clause. \nThere is no paragraph below it that says notwithstanding this provision \nthey can be sued. This is the language of the Texas law. It does not \ncreate any liability on the part of an employer.\n\n  Let me review some of the points that have been made where people say \nyou need to be able to sue the employer. Let me remind my colleagues \nthat the Texas Legislature did not believe that for a minute that there \nwould not be some employers who would be bad actors, but they concluded \nthat the benefits of letting people sue the employer were much smaller \nthan the potential cost because of the fear that employers might drop \nhealth insurance. In fact, I think the success of the Texas law bears \nout their belief that, under the Texas law, they would be better off \nnot to allow the suits to be filed against the employer.\n  Some people have said: What if somebody showed up at the emergency \nroom and the employer called up and said don't let them in? Under the \nbill before us and every bill that has been introduced, we have a \nprudent layperson standard. The emergency room is going to get paid if \nthe person, as a prudent layperson, believes they were in danger of \nbeing harmed or dying.\n  What would the attending physician in an emergency room in Omaha, NE, \ndo if some employer called up and said, my employee, Joe Brown, is \ncoming in there, he thinks he is sick, I don't want him treated? The \nphysician would say: Thank you, and hang up because he has no control \nover who is admitted to the emergency room and the HMO is required to \npay.\n  What about the case where the employer actually tries to intervene in \nthe decision being made by the HMO? It has been suggested that perhaps \nyou could have it so the employer is not the final decisionmaker and \nwould be exempt. I remind my colleagues, who is the final decisionmaker \nunder S. 1052? Who is the final decisionmaker under Breaux-Frist? Who \nis the final decisionmaker under the Nickles bill? Who is the final \ndecisionmaker under the original Kennedy bill? The final decisionmaker \nis an independent review panel made up of health care professionals who \nare independent of the health plan. How is the employer supposed to \naffect them? The employer can have no effect over them. By definition, \nunder every one of these bills, the employer is not, cannot be the \nfinal decisionmaker.\n  I am not saying, and the Texas Legislature did not say, there were no \nbad employers, but what they said is what little benefit you might get \nby discouraging an employer from trying to interfere in a health care \nplan for which they are at least partially paying; whatever benefits \nyou might get from that, you already have protections with internal and \nexternal review, but the cost of making the employer liable is so high \nthat it is not worth it.\n  Let me conclude because I see my dear colleague from West Virginia is \nhere. I know a lot of other people want to speak. I want to make this \npoint. It is not hard for me to envision--I hope it is not hard for my \ncolleagues to envision--that there are a lot of little businesses all \nover America that scrimp and sacrifice to cover their employees with \nhealth insurance.\n  I often talk about a printer from Mexia, Dicky Flatt, a friend of \nmine, an old supporter of mine from a little town in Mexia, TX. He is \nan old-fashioned printer. He never quite gets that blue ink off the end \nof his fingers.\n  He has about 10 employees, including his wife, including his baby \nson, and he probably has 8 or so other employees at any one time.\n  They work hard to try to provide health insurance. But there is no \nway, shape, form, or fashion, Dicky Flatt is\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\ngoing to hire a lawyer to go through this bill. Once he hears from NFIB \nthat he might be sued, he is going to be forced to call his 10 \nemployees together and say: Look, I love you guys. You helped me build \nthis business. But my father and my mother worked a lifetime to build \nthis business. I have worked in it. My wife has worked in it. My \nbrother worked in it. His brother's wife worked in it. My son works in \nit. And I am not going to put it all at risk in some courtroom because \nI might be sued because I helped you buy health insurance.\n  Our colleagues assure us, we are not after Dicky Flatt. But the \nproblem is, they have 7\\1/2\\ pages of language under which Dicky Flatt \ncould be sued. A lot of this language is pretty confusing. I am not a \nplaintiff's attorney, but it is pretty confusing to me and I have to \nfigure it is very confusing to Dicky Flatt, a printer in Mexia.\n  Everybody talks about how good the Texas law is and how similar this \nbill is. I thought with all of the imperfections, I would offer an \namendment that does exactly what the Texas law did. One of our \ncolleagues pointed out that under Texas law health insurance coverage \nhas gone up, not down. In Texas they did not believe that all 1 million \nemployers were good, well intending people. They decided, whatever you \nget by allowing a person to try to sue the few who are bad, when people \nalready have checks and balances against bad employers with internal \nand external review--an external review where the employer could have \nno impact, that whatever the benefits are of suing the employer, the \ncost in terms of inducing good employers to drop health coverage was \nmore.\n  I am sure everybody understands unintended consequences. I don't \nbelieve for a minute the authors of this bill are trying to sue Dicky \nFlatt. I don't believe it. I don't believe they have evil intent. I \nhave never thought that, never said it, and I don't believe it.\n  The point is, could the law produce the unintended consequence? It is \ncomplicated enough, it is contradictory enough, that I believe it might \nforce good people such as Dicky Flatt, who might call the emergency \nroom if one of his employees were taken to the emergency room, but it \nwould be to say: He is coming; do everything you can to help him. Would \nthat be intervening? If he called up and said: ``I want to tell you \nthat Sarah Brown got her finger caught in this machine and it pulled \nher hand in, and, my God, she is on the way there and she is bleeding \nsomething awful. Get ready. And I want you to do everything you can. \nDon't worry about cost, I will do whatever I can to help,'' is that \nintervening? I don't know. And he won't know. Therefore, he might \ncancel his health insurance.\n  I believe this is the safe way to do it. I am not saying I will not \nlook at alternatives or we might not be able to work something out, but \nI am asking my colleagues, don't believe that perfection has been \nachieved, that there is no way the current bill can be improved. If we \ncould change 5 or 6 things in this bill, we would get 80 Members, maybe \n90 Members to vote for it. This is something that needs to be changed. \nThis is something that needs to be fixed.\n  I know there are a lot of clever people who think we can still do it \nand still sue and protect Dicky Flatt. I am not sure. All I know is the \nTexas Legislature, after debating this, decided they were not sure and \nthe safest thing to do was to not allow him to be sued.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the Pastore rule run its course for the \nday?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it has not. It will expire at 5:04.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to speak out of order, \nnotwithstanding the Pastore rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Michigan \nwishes to speak. If I may be recognized, I would like to speak for not \nto exceed 20 minutes, but I yield to the Senator from Michigan for not \nto exceed 5 minutes, and not have that 5 minutes charged against my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague for \nyielding to me for a moment to bring this discussion back to what this \nis really all about.\n  First, I say to my friend from Texas, I am happy to share with his \nconstituent of whom he spoke, on page 146 of the legislation, \nspecifically what is meant by employers being exempted from lawsuit. It \nis very specific. I think we could satisfy his concerns if he were to \nread the bill and have an opportunity to discuss it with us. I welcome \nan opportunity to do that.\n  I will take a moment and share what happened in Michigan a few hours \nago. I went back to the great State of Michigan to be with a large \nnumber of constituents who were very concerned about this legislation, \npeople who have been involved in the health care system, doctors and \nnurses, and family members who have had situations occur in their own \nfamily with themselves or their children or their parents that have \ncaused them to support this legislation, the underlying bill that is \nbefore the Senate. They believe this is critically needed because of \nthe need to guarantee the health insurance is paying for results in \nhealth care for their families.\n  I will comment as I did on Friday about a situation about which my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle talked, small business \nowners. There is a small business owner with whom I have worked very \nclosely, a man named Sam Yamin, who, in fact, had a situation where he \nhad to go to an emergency room himself.\n  He owned a tree trimming business and had a severe accident with a \nchain saw and was rushed to an emergency room. The physicians were \nready to operate, to save his leg, to save the nerves in his leg. They \ncalled the HMO and the HMO said, we are sorry; you are at the wrong \nemergency room. They packed him up, him and his wife, and moved him \nacross town. He spent 9 hours on a gurney in the other emergency room \nand did not receive treatment until he literally pulled a telephone out \nof the wall because he was in such great pain. He ended up getting the \nmost limited treatment. They simply sewed up his leg.\n  Why do I mention that? I mention that because Sam Yamin lost his \nbusiness. He is a business owner who lost his business. He is a \nbusiness owner who is now not only permanently disabled but, I found \nout today, is terminally ill. Sam Yamin did not deserve that. He paid \nfor insurance. He was a business owner who had insurance and assumed in \nan emergency he could go to the nearest emergency room.\n  Now what happens? He and his wife Susan are flooded with bills. Does \nhe have any recourse to go back to the HMO to hold them accountable for \nwhat happened for him and his family? No, he does not.\n  That is not right. That is what this bill is about. We want better \nmedical decisions. Sam Yamin does not want the right to sue just to \nsue. He wanted emergency health care. He wanted an operation on his \nleg. He wanted to be able to go back to work in his business. That is \nwhat he wanted. I truly believe that unless we hold HMOs and insurance \ncompanies accountable for the decisions they are making, we will not \nget that kind of guarantee of health care. We want better medical \ndecisions. That is what we want. We know the States that have enacted \nthese kinds of protections don't have the lawsuits being talked about. \nThey have better medical decisions. That is what we are looking for. We \nwant to make sure decisionmakers know they better pay attention; they \nbetter get it right; they better give people the health care they are \npaying for; otherwise, they will be held accountable.\n\n  That is what this is about. That is why it is so important and that \nis why I am going to come to the floor every day and speak on behalf of \nSusan and Sam Yamin and all the other families in Michigan who are \ncounting on us to get this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I also thank \nthe majority whip for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking on a subject that is not germane to the \ndebate this afternoon.\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6844-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6844-S6845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the President has recently concluded his \ntrip to Europe, where he attempted to convince European leaders of the \nneed for the United States to deploy a national missile defense system. \nIt seems that our friends in Europe still have the same reservations \nabout this apparent rush to a missile shield, and I can understand why. \nWhile I support the deployment of an effective missile defense system, \nthere are a number of reasons why I believe it is not as easy to build \nsuch a system as it is to declare the intent to build it.\n  One cannot underestimate the scientific challenge of deploying an \neffective national missile defense system. The last two anti-missile \ntests, performed in January and July of 2000, were failures. In \nresponse to these failures, the Department of Defense did the right \nthing. The Department of Defense took a time-out to assess what went \nwrong, and to explore how it can be fixed. The next test, scheduled for \nJuly of this year of our Lord 2001, will be a crucial milestone for the \nnational missile defense program. All eyes will be watching to see if \nthe technological and engineering problems can be addressed, or if we \nhave to go back to the drawing board once more.\n  It must also be recognized that no matter how robust missile defense \ntechnology might become, it will always--now and forever--be of limited \nuse. I fear that in the minds of some, a national missile defense \nsystem is the sine qua non of a safe and secure United States. But the \nmost sophisticated radars or space-based sensors will never be able to \ndetect the sabotage of our drinking water supplies by the use of a few \nvials--just a few vials--of a biological weapon, and no amount of anti-\nmissile missiles will prevent the use of a nuclear bomb neatly packaged \nin a suitcase and carried to one of our major cities. We should not let \nthe flashy idea of missile defense distract us from other, and perhaps \nmore serious, threats to our national security.\n  If deployment of a missile defense system were to be expedited, there \nis the question of how effective it could possibly be. Military \nofficers involved in the project have called a 2004 deployment date \n``high risk.'' That means that if we were to station a handful of \ninterceptors in Alaska in 2004, there is no guarantee--none, no \nguarantee that they would provide any useful defense at all. Secretary \nof Defense Donald Rumsfeld has downplayed this problem, saying that an \nearly system does not have to be 100 percent effective. I believe that \nif we are going to pursue a robust missile shield, that is what we \nshould pursue. I do not support the deployment of a multi-billion \ndollar scarecrow that will not be an effective defense if a missile is \nactually launched at the United States.\n  The New York Times has printed an article that drives this point \nhome. The newspaper reports on a study by the Pentagon's Office of \nOperational Test and Evaluation that details some of the problems that \na National Missile Defense system must overcome before it can be \nconsidered effective. According to the New York Times, the authors of \nthis internal Department of Defense report believe that the missile \ndefense program has ``suffered too many failures to justify deploying \nthe system in 2005, a year after the Bush administration is considering \ndeploying one.''\n  The article goes on to state that system now being tested has \nbenefitted from unrealistic tests, and that the computer system could \nattempt to shoot down inbound missiles that don't even exist. If the \nDepartment of Defense's own scientists and engineers don't trust the \nsystem that could be deployed in the next few years, this system might \nnot even be a very good scarecrow. Let the scientists and engineers \nfind the most effective system possible, and then go forward with its \ndeployment.\n  Let us also consider our international obligations under the Anti-\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972. The President has begun \ndiscussions with Russia, China, our European allies, and others on \nrevising the ABM Treaty, but so far the responses have been mixed. I \nsuggest that it is because our message is mixed. On one hand, there is \nthe stated intent to consult with our allies before doing away with the \nABM Treaty. On the other, the Administration has made clear its \nposition that a missile defense system will be deployed as soon as \npossible.\n  It is no wonder that Russia and our European allies are confused as \nto whether we are consulting with them on the future of the ABM Treaty, \nor we are simply informing them as to what the future of the ABM Treaty \nwill be. We must listen to our allies, and take their comments \nseriously. The end result of the discussions with Russia, China, and \nour European allies should be an understanding of how to preserve our \nnational security, not a scheme to gain acceptance from those countries \nof our plan to rush forward with the deployment of an anti-missile \nsystem at the earliest possible date.\n  What's more, Secretary of State Colin Powell said this past weekend \nthat the President may unilaterally abandon the ABM Treaty as soon as \nit conflicts with our testing activities. According to the recently \nreleased Pentagon report on missile defense, however, the currently \nscheduled tests on anti-missile systems will not conflict with the ABM \nTreaty in 2002, and there is no conflict anticipated in 2003. Why, \ntherefore, is there a rush to amend or do away with the ABM Treaty? Who \nis to say that there will not be additional test failures in the next \ntwo and a half years that will further push back the test schedule, as \nwell as potential conflicts with the ABM Treaty?\n  There is also the issue of the high cost of building a national \nmissile defense system. This year, the United States will spend $4.3 \nbillion on all the various programs related to missile defense. From \n1962 to today, the Brookings Institution estimated that we have spent \n$99 billion, and I do not believe that for all that money, our national \nsecurity has been increased one bit.\n  The Congressional Budget Office in an April 2000 report concluded \nthat the most limited national missile defense system would cost $30 \nbillion. This system could only hope to defend against a small number \nof unsophisticated missiles, such as a single missile launched from a \nrogue nation. If we hope to defend against the accidental launch of \nnumerous, highly sophisticated missiles of the type that are now in \nRussia's arsenal, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the \ncost will almost double, to $60 billion.\n  We have seen how these estimates work. They have only one way to go. \nThat is always up.\n  However, that number may even be too low. This is what the \nCongressional Budget Office had to say in March 2001: ``Those estimates \nfrom April 2000 may now be too low, however. A combination of delays in \ntesting and efforts by the Clinton administration to reduce the \nprogram's technical risk (including a more challenging testing program) \nmay have increased the funding requirements well beyond the levels \nincluded in this option [for national missile defense systems].'' Is it \nany wonder that some critics believe that a workable national missile \ndefense system will cost more than $120 billion?\n  Tell me. How does the Administration expect to finance this missile \ndefense system? The $1.35 trillion tax cut that the President signed \ninto law last month is projected to consume 72 percent of the non-\nSocial Security, non-Medicare surpluses over the next five years. In \nfact, under the budget resolution that was passed earlier this year, \nthe Senate Budget Committee shows that the Federal Government is \nalready projected to dip into the Medicare trust fund in fiscal years \n2003 and 2004. The missile defense system envisioned by the \nAdministration would likely have us dipping into the Social Security \ntrust funds as well--further jeopardizing the long-term solvency of \nboth Federal retirement programs. This is no way to provide for our \nnation's defense.\n  I must admit that I am also leery about committing additional vast \nsums to the Pentagon. I was the last man out of Vietnam--the last one. \nI mean to tell you, I supported President Johnson. I supported \nPresident Nixon to the hilt.\n  I have spoken before about the serious management problems in the \nDepartment of Defense. I am a strong supporter of the Department of \nDefense. When it came to Vietnam, I was a hawk--not just a Byrd but a \nhawk. I\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nam not a Johnny-come-lately when it comes to our national defense.\n  As Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I find it profoundly \ndisturbing that the Department of Defense cannot account for the money \nthat it spends, and does not know with any certainty what is in its \ninventory. These problems have been exposed in detail by the \nDepartment's own Inspector General, as well as the General Accounting \nOffice. Ten years after Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers \nAct of 1990, the Department of Defense has still not been able to pass \nan audit of its books. The Pentagon's books are in such disarray that \noutside experts cannot even begin an audit, much less reach a \nconclusion on one!\n  Although it does not directly relate to this issue of national \nmissile defense, I was shocked by a report issued by the General \nAccounting Office last week on the Department of Defense's use of \nemergency funds intended to buy spare parts in 1999. Out of $1.1 \nbillion appropriated in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1999 to buy urgently needed spare parts, the GAO \nreported that the Pentagon could not provide the financial information \nto show that 92 percent of those funds were used as intended. This is \nincredible. This Senate passed that legislation to provide that money \nfor spare parts. That is what they said they needed it for. That is \nwhat we appropriated it for. Congress gave the Department of Defense \nover a billion dollars to buy spare parts, which we were told were \nurgently needed, and we cannot even see the receipt!\n  If the Department of Defense cannot track $1 billion that it spent on \nan urgent need, I don't know how it could spend tens of billions of \ndollars on a missile defense system with any confidence that it is \nbeing spent wisely.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and the Administrative \nCo-Chairman of the National Security Working Group, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Cochran, who was the author of the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999, I understand that ballistic missiles are a threat \nto the United States. I voted for the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999, which stated that it is the policy of the United States to deploy \na national missile defense system as soon as it is technologically \npossible. Now, I still support that act. But I also understand that an \neffective national missile defense system cannot be established through \nintent alone. Someone has said that the road to Sheol is paved with \ngood intentions. Good intentions are not enough. I think there might be \na way toward an effective missile defense system, and it is based on \ncommon sense. Engage our friends, and listen to our critics. Learn from \nthe past, and invest wisely. Test carefully, and assess constantly. But \nmost of all, avoid haste. We cannot afford to embark on a folly that \ncould, if improperly managed, damage our national security, while \ncosting billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from West Virginia withhold \nhis request for a quorum?\n  Mr. BYRD. I withhold my suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6845-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BIPARTISAN PATIENT PROTECTION ACT--Continued\n\n\n                           amendment No. 810\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my good friend and colleague from West Virginia and \nthank the Chair. I also thank my good friend from Iowa who has agreed \nto let me speak for a few minutes and who is also helping with the \neasel. He is what you would call a full service Finance Committee \nranking member.\n  I am here today to talk about the Gramm amendment to the McCain-\nKennedy patient protection bill. I have been in this Chamber before to \ntalk about this issue as it affects small businesses.\n  In my role as ranking member, and formerly as chairman, of the Small \nBusiness Committee, I have had the opportunity to hear from lots of \nsmall businesspeople, men and women from around the country. There are \nan awful lot of them from Missouri who have called me to express their \nconcerns. Let me tell you they have some very real concerns about this \nMcCain-Kennedy bill.\n  The particular issue before us today deals with whether or not \nemployers should be able to be sued through new lawsuits permitted by \nthe McCain-Kennedy patient protection bill which is supposed to be \ntargeted against HMOs.\n  We keep hearing how they want to sue the HMOs. Our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle seem to be of two minds on this issue. Some \nadamantly refuse to admit that their bill actually permits litigation \nagainst employers at all. They claim that only HMOs can be targeted. \nThat is simply flat wrong. This has been pointed out numerous times in \nthis Chamber by me and by my colleagues who have actually read the \nlanguage from the McCain-Kennedy bill, which I have before me.\n  I encourage any American who has been confused by the claims and \ncounterclaims on whether the McCain-Kennedy bill allows any suits \nagainst employers to get a copy of the legislation. Go to the bottom \nhalf of page 144 and read the truth for yourself. Page 144 has the good \nnews that:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     authorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan \n     sponsor maintaining the plan. . . .\n\n  That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that part (B) says: ``Notwithstanding subparagraph \n(A), a cause of action may arise against an employer or other plan \nsponsor'' under certain clauses and pages and exceptions; and it goes \nfrom the bottom of page 144 to pages 145, 146, 147, and 148. That is \nhow you can be sued if you are an employer.\n  There are some on the other side of the aisle who admit their \nlegislation allows trial attorneys to go after employers but claim \nthese lawsuits are only permitted in narrow circumstances. I give those \ncolleagues and friends credit for greater honesty, but I fault them, \nnevertheless, for bad analysis because the fact is, the so-called \nemployer exemption from lawsuits in the McCain-Kennedy bill is an \nextremely complicated and confusing piece of legislative language that \nwill inevitably subject large and small employers to lawsuits and the \nhigh cost of defending them.\n  Before I came to this body, I practiced law. I know what a gold mine \nof opportunity rests in this language. Oh, boy, if I were on the \noutside and this were the law, and I wanted to sue an employer, this \nwould be an interesting but not difficult challenge.\n  We all know you really cannot protect anyone 100 percent from being \nsued. For better or for worse, any American, with just a little help \nfrom a clever attorney, or just an average attorney, can file a lawsuit \nagainst any person or any business. The case may be dismissed almost \nimmediately, but they can still file it.\n\n  What this means is, if we want to protect employers from frivolous \nlitigation--and this is what everybody says they want to do--we need to \ngive employers protection that will help them get the frivolous \nlawsuits dismissed immediately, before the lawyers' fees really start \nto build up. To get these immediate dismissals, you really need clear, \ndistinctive language that makes 100 percent clear what types of \nlawsuits are and are not allowed.\n  How does the Gramm amendment make that clear distinction? By saying \nthat you cannot sue your employer, period.\n  How does the McCain-Kennedy bill try to make a clear distinction on \nwhich they say employers can rely? They have a basic guideline that \nsays employers can't be sued, but then they have four entire pages of \nexceptions, definitions, and clarifications that substantially weaken \nand confuse that protection. In those four pages there are enough \nambiguous words, phrases, and concepts to keep trial attorneys in \nbusiness for years.\n  If a plaintiff's lawyer is clever enough--and whatever else I think \nabout them, I know my friends in the trial bar are clever--they are \ngoing to find ways to bring lawsuits against employers. In their zeal \nto get at deep-pocket employers, trial lawyers are going to poke and \nprod at every word of these four pages looking for weaknesses. Many, or \nmost, will be able to find something to convince a judge not to dismiss \na case. The result: A raft of new lawsuits against employers, added \nexpenses, and an enhanced fear of being sued.\n  That scares the devil out of employers all across the country, as it \nshould,\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nbecause if there is one thing our legal system has shown employers, it \nis that their fear is justified; they are not paranoid; they really are \ncoming after them.\n  The cost to defend a single lawsuit can easily extend into the tens \nor hundreds of thousands of dollars. Particularly for these small \nemployers, these expenses are difficult, if not impossible, to bear and \ncould put them out of business. Even if the employer has some type of \ninsurance to cover this legal exposure, the cost of insurance can be a \nscary prospect in and of itself.\n  I mentioned before in this Chamber I have received hundreds of \nletters from small businesses in Missouri. The first issue that almost \nall of them bring up is whether they can be sued under the McCain-\nKennedy bill. Let me read just a few points from a few of them. Simply \nput, this issue is their No. 1 concern when it comes to patient \nprotection legislation.\n  Here is one from a lumber company:\n\n       We are currently extending health insurance coverage to our \n     25 employees. We pay two-thirds of the premium; employees pay \n     one-third. At our last renewal, we were faced with an 18-\n     percent increase, some years in the past being even greater. \n     Future increases will force us to continue to offer less \n     coverage. If Senator Kennedy's bill passes, this may just be \n     the nail in the coffin. We are willing to suffer with higher \n     prices to an extent, as long as they are fair and justified, \n     but we are not willing to open ourselves up to the liability \n     that this bill may subject us to.\n\n  Here is another one, a small business, a fabricator:\n\n       We are a small company with less than 25 enrollees in our \n     health plan. With the increase in health care costs, \n     utilities, and supplies, we are not making much of a profit. \n     And if this continues, we may not be able to stay in \n     business. We employ between 50 and 75 employees. We also do \n     not see how an employer can be held legally responsible for \n     medical court cases. We will eventually be forced, by Mr. \n     Kennedy's bill, to cancel our health plans because of the \n     liability and cost.\n\n  In fact, the National Federation of Independent Businesses--one of \nthe strong voices for America's small businesses--believes so strongly \nabout this amendment that they are going to list it as a key vote: Are \nyou with us or are you against us? Small businesses are going to know \nby how our colleagues vote on this amendment.\n  For those folks fortunate enough not to be familiar with the ways of \nWashington, that means that they believe the vote on this amendment \nwill be one of the most important votes cast during the entire year. \nThey intend to use it in their evaluation of Senators' voting records.\n  All this begs the question: If employers are so well protected by the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill, why are they so scared? Why is NFIB placing such a \nlevel of importance on this vote? Why are small businesses in Missouri \nsending me these letters? Is it because they are not protected? The \nanswer is, they are not well protected.\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill made a halfhearted try and failed. I related \nlast week several times what the running score was of small businesses \nthat said that they would be forced by this measure to get rid of \nhealth care coverage for their employees. Here is today's total: 1,751. \nThat is just a small sample nationwide. These are the number of \nemployees whose employers have written us since they saw the details of \nthe McCain-Kennedy legislation to say they don't want to be involved in \ntort reform roulette on health care costs. If McCain-Kennedy passes \nunamended, if their exposure is as written in this compendium of \nexceptions, exclusions and qualifications, they will terminate their \nhealth care plans. Total number of employees covered to date: 1,751.\n  I suggest that is just a microcosm of small businesses across the \ncountry. I have talked to others who have not written in. In our \ncountry, most employers voluntarily offer health care coverage, and \nthey are the source of health insurance for the majority of Americans. \nOverwhelmingly, Americans are employed and get their health care \ncoverage from their employer. The quickest way to destroy the system we \nnow have is to create an atmosphere where employers stop their \nvoluntary willingness to offer coverage. Sure, it is an important \nbenefit, but who wants to be hauled into court if one of their \nemployees has a medical or health care complaint?\n  Right now we have 43 million Americans who are not covered by health \ninsurance. We have debated many measures in the Senate to find out how \nto cover those employees. I was terribly disappointed that on a party-\nline vote last week, this body voted to reject my effort to give 100-\npercent deductibility for self-employed people. We have been fighting \nto get that done for a long time. This is a tax bill. It is going to be \na tax bill. There is no question about that. That tax provision to get \nmore people covered should have been included.\n  What we are talking about now is expanding significantly the number \nof uninsured Americans. Sixty percent of the 43 million who are not \ncovered now are employees of small business. We don't want to add to \nthat number and add to the 43 million. Given the lottery nature of our \ncurrent legal system, I can't think of anything that would make the \nemployers more fearful and more likely to drop coverage than to say: \nHey, you are not authorized to file suit against your employer but \nnotwithstanding subparagraph (A), cause of action may arise against an \nemployer or other plan sponsor, et cetera, et cetera, page after page.\n  If we want to avoid American businesses dropping coverage on a \nwholesale basis, employers need to be protected from lawsuits. That is \nquite simply what the Gramm amendment does. We need to get good health \ncare coverage for all Americans. Yes, we need to give them internal and \nexternal appeals. We need to make sure they do not get shortchanged. If \nthey get denied coverage, they need to go to another doctor who is \nindependent, who could order their HMO or their health plan to provide \nthem coverage. What they don't need is to start suing their employers \nbecause employers will drop health care coverage like a bad habit, if \nthey think they are going to be subjected to a whole range of lawsuits \nas a result of the dissatisfaction of an employee with health care \ncoverage.\n  I hope our colleagues will take a look at the impact of this on small \nbusinesses and their employees and accept the Gramm amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could enter into a colloquy with my \nfriend from North Carolina, the manager of the bill, I have been on the \nfloor now for a week relative to this legislation. It is interesting to \nsee how the scapegoats come and go.\n  Does the Senator from North Carolina remember last week that the big \nboogeyman was the fact that this was a disguise to get socialized \nmedicine, that what the intent really was was to have this onerous bill \npass and everyone would drop their insurance and we would have \nsocialized medicine? Does the Senator remember that?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I do remember that.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator remember that they were talking about a \nStates rights issue; that it was none of the business of the Congress; \nthat all of these States were doing a good thing; let them do what they \nwant with how they handle patients and doctors. Does the Senator \nremember that debate?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I do remember it.\n  Mr. REID. There was a significant period of time last week when there \nwas some discussion about this legislation allowing HMOs to be sued, as \nif that were some novel approach to the law, to the world. Does my \ncolleague remember that, when it was a surprise that they read the bill \nand, lo and behold, HMOs could be sued? Does the Senator remember that \ndiscussion?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I do.\n  Mr. REID. The assertion regarding socialized medicine is, for lack of \na better description, kind of foolish. Regarding States rights, they \nlearned very quickly that wasn't much of a winner. Then the fact that \nthey were surprised about the lawsuits, of course, that was a surprise \nthat they were surprised.\n  I also was here, as the Senator from North Carolina was, when they \nspent a great deal of time talking about this novel concept they came \nup with, that you should be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of \nan employer's health insurance. What they failed to tell us is that is \nsomething we have been pushing for a long time. In fact, it was put in \nthe tax bill of the former chairman of the committee who is now \npresent. That was put in the tax bill. Of course, it was taken out in \nconference. My colleague remembers that. As a result of\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nthe games being played, that amendment was defeated.\n  Today, starting the second week of this debate, I now see a new ploy; \nthat is, they suddenly are saying that now you can file lawsuits--and \nwe are OK with that--but what you are doing is, all the employers in \nAmerica are going to be sued as a result of having health insurance for \ntheir employees, and they are going to drop all their insurance.\n  With this as a background, I want the Senator from North Carolina to \ncomment about the latest direction; that is, that employers will be \nsued to death.\n  Prior to addressing that, I want the Senator to recognize that I have \nbeen here longer than the Senator from North Carolina. I have heard \nthis NFIB argument for almost 20 years. If you do this, the NFIB is \ngoing to send out a note that you are a bad legislator and they should \nnot vote for you.\n  In my approximately 20 years in the Congress--I could be mistaken \nbecause I am sure once in a while they do it just to look good--I have \nnever known the NFIB to support a Democrat. So all these threats about \n``you do this and we are not going to support your candidacy,'' the \nvast majority of the time, the NFIB is a front for the Republicans. I \nam saying that; the Senator does not have to agree with me. To this \nSenator, the threats we have heard today that ``the NFIB is not going \nto support you'' is no threat to me. They have never supported me, no \nmatter what I did or didn't do.\n  I would like the Senator to respond to the several questions I have \nasked. But prior to responding, I have the greatest respect for the \nsenior Senator from Texas. He is a fine man, a good legislator. He has \na Ph.D. in economics. He taught economics. If he were here--he knows me \nwell enough and I know him well enough--I would say that with his being \nin the Chamber. As to his reference to his friend Dicky Flatt, which he \nuses all the time, I think Dicky Flatt and others better be very \ncareful of people such as my friend, the senior Senator from Texas, \ngiving legal advice. He can stand here and give some good economic \nadvice, but the legal advice we should look at very closely. I think \nDicky Flatt should look at that.\n  I ask my friend from North Carolina, to whom I can't give sufficient \nsuperlatives as being more than renowned in the law, a person who has \nmade a reputation around the country as being a good lawyer, to give \nsome comment to the Senate and to those within the sound of our voices \nas to what he thinks about these continual statements made today--in \nfact, people are reading the same information. The same person wrote \nthe same speech for several people. I would like the Senator to tell me \nand the rest of the Senate the fear that an employer who has health \ninsurance for his employee should have as a result of this legislation.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will respond to the Senator's question. I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa, who has been waiting for some time, that I will be \nbrief and I will yield the floor to my friend because he has been \nwaiting to speak.\n  First of all, the arguments being used serially, one after another, \nare all arguments that have been trotted out by the HMOs for years now. \nThey are the arguments they make to avoid any kind of reform. They like \nit just the way it is now. They are different than every other business \nentity or individual in America, and they want to maintain the status \nquo. The Senator knows very well that they are spending millions of \ndollars on lobbyists, public relations, and on television to defeat any \nkind of HMO reform. So these arguments go to a really fundamental \nquestion: Are we going to move forward or are we going to stay where we \nare?\n  There is a consensus in this country among the American people, among \nthe Members of this body, among the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, and among virtually every health care group and \nconsumer group in America, that this needs to be done--``this'' being \nThe Bipartisan Patient Protection Act.\n  There is a reason for that consensus--because we need to do something \nabout this issue that has lingered for so long. For every day that \npasses, while we engage in what sometimes is high rhetorical debate on \nthe floor of the Senate, there are thousands of American citizens, \nchildren and families, who are being denied the care for which they \nhave paid.\n  Now, it is all well and good for us to have an academic discussion in \nthe Senate about this issue. But there are families and kids all over \nthis country who are not getting the tests they need, not getting the \ntreatment they need, not getting the medical care they need because \nthis legislation has not been passed.\n  Now, having said that, let me respond specifically to the Senator's \nquestion. First, as to the employer liability issue, the Senator knows \nthat John McCain and I worked for months on it. There was a bill in the \nHouse of Representatives--the Norwood-Dingell bill--which passed and \nprovided somewhat broader exposure of employers to liability. Senator \nMcCain and I worked, because we are concerned about this issue and we \nwant employers to be protected, to draft our bill with that goal in \nmind.\n  President Bush has issued a written principle which is almost \nidentical to our bill. He says, as we say, that unless an employer \nactually makes a medical decision on an individual patient, they should \nbe exempted from liability. We believe that is what our bill does. The \nBreaux-Frist bill--the other bill--has another model, what is called a \n``designated decisionmaker.'' But it also holds employers, through the \ndesignated decisionmaker, responsible where they make individual \nmedical decisions.\n  So what we have is our bill, the Norwood-Dingell bill that already \npassed the House, President Bush's principle, and the Breaux-Frist \nbill, all of which start with a very simple concept; that is, employers \nought to be protected unless they step into the shoes of the HMO and \nmake medical decisions.\n\n  The only different position is that of Senator Gramm in his \namendment. His position is inconsistent with all those positions, \nincluding the President's, inconsistent with the legislation that \npassed the House, inconsistent with the Breaux-Frist bill. His position \nis the extreme position. What we are working on as I speak--and we \nworked on it this past week and over the weekend, Republican and \nDemocratic Senators both--is language that we believe will be \nappropriate and will help provide more protection for employers.\n  But what can't be left out of this discussion is the patients; you \ncan't forget the patients. I listened to my friend from Missouri speak \na few minutes ago. I didn't hear the words ``patient,'' ``employees,'' \nor ``families'' spoken by him. I think his concern about employers is \nto be respected, and that is the reason we want to work together on \nthis issue. We have to always keep in mind, when we are trying to \nprotect employers, that we also have the rights of employees and \npatients to take into account.\n  So the right approach is an approach that allows us to provide \nmaximum protection for the employers, without completely ignoring the \ninterests and, in fact, protecting the interests of the patients at the \nsame time. We believe that is what we do. We believe that is what the \nPresident has suggested.\n  There are issues in this debate about which there is great \ndisagreement, but this is not one of them. This is one where regarding \nthe President in his principle, us, and the Breaux-Frist proposal, \nthere are minor differences between them. The bottom line is that all \nof those start with a simple concept and principle. It is a matter of \nmaking sure the language works in an effective day-to-day way.\n  Mr. REID. I heard the Senator say right now the legislation, in his \nestimation, protects employers, but if there can be more refinement to \nthat, he will be happy to work with whoever can give him that language; \nis that true?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is true. We will continue to work on it, going \nforward. We are continuing to work on it as we speak. If we can find a \nway to maximize protection for employers with appropriate language and, \nat the same time, not ignore the interests of the patients, we will do \nthat. I believe that can be done. So do Senators on both sides of the \naisle who are talking about this particular issue.\n  Mr. REID. If, however, we didn't change it in any manner, you could \nstill rest well at night that you and Senator McCain had worked very \nhard\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nto take care of this issue on employer liability.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We have. We worked long and hard. I believe we have \nprotected employers from many of the concerns that those across the \naisle and on both sides of the aisle have raised. But I am the first to \nsay this is an issue on which we should work together to make sure we \nhave language that works to protect America's employers.\n  I yield to my friend from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hollings). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has graciously \nagreed to let me hold forth here for just a few minutes. If no one has \nan objection, I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized immediately \nafter me. I don't expect to take more than 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I could not hear the \nSenator.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will speak about 5 minutes and then the Senator from \nIowa will speak for himself on how long he wants.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I intended to speak as long as I wanted to speak just \nas everybody else has been doing all afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate, and \nit sounds to me as if we are making progress with regard to this \nemployer issue. We started out without a recognition that this bill \nprovided substantial exposure to employers. The statements that were \nmade by the sponsors of the bill were that they really didn't intend to \nhold employers liable, except under very limited circumstances. Now, \napparently, they agree that perhaps there was more exposure there than \nwas originally intended.\n  So, as I understand it, some discussions are taking place now to, \nhopefully, bridge the difference and provide additional protection for \nemployers because what we are doing--what I understand the purpose of \nthe legislation is--is to provide some judicial access, judicial relief \nagainst health care plans and against HMOs, and that the thrust of this \nlegislation was not to hold employers liable because employers don't \neven have to provide these plans if they don't want to.\n  While it is all well and good to suggest that we give people new \nremedies and rights, we have to balance that out with the realization \nthat it is going to have some repercussions.\n  If we go too far and do too much to penalize employers, they are \ngoing to walk away from health care coverage. Instead, as pitiful as \nsome of these stories are that we have heard over the last several days \nabout what has been done to individual patients, I hope we do not come \nback in a couple of years and have to listen to people who have no \ninsurance at all because of legislation we passed driving employers--\nand small employers--out of the health care business. That is a real \npossibility, and nobody wants that. We need to be careful.\n  I suggest that if we really want to carve employers out of the \nlawsuit business, if we did not mean to cover employers, all we need to \ndo is say so. All we need to do is provide an exemption for employers \nthe same way we provide exemptions for doctors and the same way we \nprovide exemptions for treating hospitals. We provide blanket \nexemptions for them, but we have to go through all these various pages \nof rigmarole and definition to try to figure out when an employer who \nis providing this health care coverage can be sued and when he cannot \nbe sued.\n  The law of Texas has been upheld. The President's name has been \ninvoked. The law of Texas has been used as an example. The law of Texas \nexempts employers from their plan.\n  The concern is there is a group of employers who are basically self-\ninsured who handle these claims on the front end themselves. They do \nnot hire this out. They do it themselves. I believe if you talk to \nprofessionals in the industry, they will say that some of the best \nplans with some of the most comprehensive coverage of any of the plans \nout there are these self-insured plans. One of the reasons may be that \nthey cut out the middleman. They do not have an HMO to deal with at \nthat stage of the game, and they provide good, comprehensive coverage \nfor their employees.\n  By definition, they are making decisions on the front end. By \ndefinition, under this bill, from the day it is passed, they will have \nexposure. One might argue that is a good thing or one might argue that \nis not a good thing, but there is no question with regard to those \nplans, some of the better plans out there--because employers decided to \nprovide these plans, they wanted to cover their employees, they wanted \nto do it themselves--that they will be exposed.\n  One has to ask oneself, what are they going to do the day after this \nlegislation is passed? Are they going to continue to hold themselves \nfor this kind of additional liability? Are they going to contract it \nout to a third person and pay the additional freight to get them to \nassume the liability, driving up costs all along the way? I do not know \nwhat they will do. I know what they will not do. They will not stand \npat.\n  The things we do in this Congress have an effect on the lives of the \nAmerican people, whether it be raising taxes, lowering taxes, or \nwhatever. There will be some repercussions in terms of the behavior of \nthese employers. I hope it is not to wind up with less coverage and \nfewer of these good plans.\n  One says: They are not going to have anybody to sue if you do not \nhave HMOs and the employers are involved on the front end of it. This \nbill has set up an elaborate external review entity.\n  My colleagues say we do not talk enough about patients. This \nlegislation sets up a review entity that allows an independent \nqualified individual or group of individuals to make decisions with \nregard to whether or not that employee is being treated fairly. That is \na strong move in the direction for patient protections. If we stopped \nright there and did not do anything else, that would be a major move in \nthis legislation, away from the simple ERISA coverage we have right \nnow.\n\n  This bill spends 10, 12 pages setting up this external review process \nand the external review entity on how they have to be qualified, how \nthey have to be independent, how we have the Secretary looking over \ntheir shoulder, all of which is designed to protect the patient.\n  Under this system, if the entity rules against coverage, then they \ncan go to court and sue, or if he rules for coverage, it goes to \nanother independent individual who is the independent medical reviewer. \nSo there is another level of independent protection for the employee.\n  It is not as if they are out there hopeless and helpless and totally \nat the mercy of the employer. The employer may have had some discretion \non the front end for sure and made some decisions for sure, but then he \ngoes through this independent appeals process where people who have no \nrelationship with the employer make the decisions as to whether or not \nthere is coverage.\n  We have exempted doctors. We have exempted hospitals. HMOs are not \ndifferent in this country from many other entities and entities that \nhave been created in this bill. We exempt States from certain lawsuits. \nWe exempt the Federal Government from certain lawsuits.\n  The Senator from North Carolina and I are exempted from the things we \nsay in this Chamber. We are protected because there are tradeoffs. \nEverybody knows that. We make decisions because of public policy \nreasons to make tradeoffs. If we want to encourage certain conduct, we \nare willing to make tradeoffs the other way.\n  It is unfair, when we are in the context of a particular area, \nlegislation dealing with health care, to pick and choose as to among \nwhom we are going to make those tradeoffs, especially if we are giving \nexemptions to the people who are providing health care--doctors and \nhospitals--and we do not give exemptions for the people who are \nproviding the health coverage, the employers.\n  That is the gist of what we are dealing with, and hopefully we can \nwork out some agreement.\n  My bottom line is, if you do not want to cover employers, and if you \nbelieve we may be in danger of causing some good folks to say it is not \nworth the additional headache, it is not worth the additional exposure, \nit is not worth the\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\nadditional expense to set up different entities to protect ourselves, \nif we are concerned about that, we need to take that into consideration \nwith any resolution, not to mention the exposure this bill has under \nother provisions of ERISA.\n  We have not even talked about that. At least I have not. I have not \nheard any discussion about that. Employers have exposure under COBRA, \nunder HIPAA, under other areas of ERISA that have nothing to do with \nhealth coverage. They have employer exposure if they make any mistakes \nin dealing with that.\n  Remember we debated Kennedy-Kassebaum, and we decided people needed \nto have more portability with their insurance. We decided the fair \nthing to do was to give them more portability for their insurance and \nincluded a penalty of $100 a day plus injunctive relief for an employer \nwho did not behave himself. We debated this liability issue then, and \nwe decided not to do it.\n\n  Now what we are doing parenthetically in this HMO bill is bringing \nback Kennedy-Kassebaum and bringing back COBRA and saying in addition \nto these penalties we put on the employers when we considered that, we \nare now going to open that up to litigation and lawsuits. That is a \nmajor step, and it should be done only with maximum consideration, and \nit must be considered in the context of any treatment of employer \nliability in any compromise we might fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nwhat he just said. It was very good for me to let him respond to the \nother people who have spoken. I particularly suggest to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee that there is probably not as much concern on the part \nof the proponents of this legislation as to whether or not some of the \nself-employed plans will be abandoned if this bill passes because the \nWashington bureaucrat has an answer to that problem.\n  That problem is, we will do what President Clinton suggested in 1993 \nin his health care plan. We will mandate that every employer has to \nhave insurance for their employee. Just mandate, don't worry about \nwhether or not they can afford to do it. Just pass a Washington mandate \nthat you have to offer this type of insurance.\n  However, 42 million people in America today do not have health \ninsurance. That number will increase if this bill passes as it \ncurrently reads. There will be things done in this bill that will not \ncause that to happen, if people on the other side of the aisle are \nwilling to compromise. However, if they don't compromise, for these 56 \nmillion people who are in self-insured plans, if some of those are \nabandoned by employers because they don't want the threat of a lawsuit \nhanging over their head, that number will be increased.\n  That was suggested in 1993. That was not well received.\n  It has been suggested after Senator Bond spoke that he never \nmentioned the word ``patient,'' as if he has no concern about patients \nbeing treated fairly and right. That is what Senator Bond's speech was \nall about. He was concerned that if this legislation passes as it is \nwritten, that employers that have self-insured plans--that don't have \nto offer those plans if they don't want to, but they do offer them \nbecause they want to have a good fringe benefit package for their \nemployees--if they drop those for their employees, there are employees \nwho will become patients some day who will not have coverage.\n  This bill is all about concern for patients. It is not about concern \nfor employers. It is concern for employers that want to offer plans in \na self-insured fashion, that they will be encouraged to do it as they \nhave already done for 50-some million employees, and continue, and keep \nthe plans viable.\n  Why would a family-owned ma-and-pa's plastic corporation, or a ma-\nand-pa's family-owned machine shop providing self-employed plans for \nemployees, why would they jeopardize the continued existence of the \nfamily-owned business if they could be sued under this legislation? \nWhat they are going to do is protect what they worked hard for: \nbuilding up a business, employing people, being the backbone of their \nlocal community. That is what the ma-and-pa plastic shop and the ma-\nand-pa machine shop is all about. They have created this business. \nMaybe it was created by a grandma and grandpa or mom and dad. It could \nbe in its third generation. This is a family-held business that \nprovides jobs, perhaps for dozens or hundreds of people. They want to \nprovide fringe benefits for their employees, of which health insurance \nis the most important fringe benefit. They offer it in a self-insured \nfashion because that is the best way for them to do it. Why would we \nwant to jeopardize it?\n  Senator Bond was followed by the remarks of the Senator from \nTennessee, that this is what this legislation is all about, making sure \nemployees have the fringe benefits of health insurance, with all \nMembers imploring we want to do something for the 42 million people in \nAmerica who don't have it. If we want to do something for the 42 \nmillion people who do not have insurance, and pass legislation as we \ndid with tax credits to incentivize them to buy health insurance, why \nwould we want to put in jeopardy the 50-some million people who already \nhave it through self-insured plans?\n  It is talking out of both sides of Congress's mouth. On the one hand, \nwe are concerned about 52 million people. We have legislation \nintroduced to do something else about it; on the other hand, we are \ndealing with a piece of legislation that could put in jeopardy the \nhealth care plans of 50-some million people who already have what we \nthink the other 42 million people ought to be encouraged to have.\n\n  It is concern over employees having health insurance, and giving \nthose people, if they become patients, the treatment they deserve.\n  I don't hear concern about patients getting treatment. I hear concern \nabout lawyers getting tribute. We should be concerned about the patient \nand protecting the self-employed health insurance plans that 50-some \nmillion people have as part of that process.\n  I hope we will consider the speeches by the Senator from Missouri, \nthe Senator from Tennessee, to be speeches concerned about the \nemployees and concerned about those people who become patients getting \ntreatment. That is exactly to what they are speaking. I don't know how \nanybody could miss that point.\n  I didn't come to the floor to speak about that aspect of this bill. I \ncame to the floor to speak about a motion filed by my friend, Senator \nFrist, on Friday, to commit the bill before the Senate, the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill, to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on \none hand and the Finance Committee on the other hand, and to do it with \nspecific instructions from the entire Senate that this bill be reported \nback to the Senate within 14 days. I come to this conclusion because I \nam troubled that the Kennedy-McCain bill has bypassed these relevant \ncommittees and has been brought directly to the floor without one \nhearing, without one markup, and most importantly, without the public \ninput into this particular bill that every bill ought to have.\n  First, I strongly believe patients' protections are critical to every \nhard-working American who relies on the managed care system. We need a \nstrong and reliable patients' rights bill, and I am supportive of this \neffort 100 percent. What we don't need is a bill such as the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill that exposes employers to unlimited liability and either \neliminates that insurance or dramatically drives up the cost of that \nhealth insurance or perhaps being cut back or eliminated. Instead, I \nbelieve we should protect patients by ensuring access to needed \ntreatment and specialists, by making sure each patient gets a review of \ninsurance claims that may be denied, and above all, by ensuring that \nAmericans who rely on their employers for health care can still get \nthis covered. I am confident we can reach these goals. However, the \nvery fact that our leadership brought the Kennedy-McCain legislation \ndirectly to the floor, without proper committee action, violates the \ncore of the Senate process.\n\n  I know my colleagues on the other side will waste no time in accusing \nme of delaying this bill. But the truth is, had the relevant committees \nbeen given the opportunity to consider Kennedy-McCain legislation in \nthe first place, I would not be raising these objections. By bringing \nthis bill directly\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nto the floor, the message seems to be very loud and clear that the new \nchairmen--meaning the people who just have become chairmen because of \nthe Democrat majority in the Senate, and under new leadership--are \nsomehow merely speed bumps on the road to the floor.\n  During my tenure as Finance chairman, Senator after Senator urged the \ncommittee process be upheld regarding tax legislation. I listened and I \nacted. I resisted strong pressures to bypass the Finance Committee as \nwe considered the greatest tax relief bill in a generation. I forged a \nbipartisan coalition and a consensus, which I believe made it a much \nbetter bill. Ultimately, we were able to craft a bill that benefitted \nfrom the support of a dozen Members from the Democrat side.\n  The Finance Committee has proven it can operate in a bipartisan \nfashion and craft good legislation in a timely manner. We are committed \nunder this motion to report legislation out of the Finance Committee in \n14 days. The fact that the chairmanship of the committee has changed I \ndo not believe will in any way affect our ability to work in a good, \nbipartisan manner. So I stand before the Senate as someone who has seen \nthe importance of the committee process.\n  The Kennedy-McCain legislation treads on the Finance Committee \njurisdiction in ways that are by no means trivial, so I will explain. \nThe Kennedy-McCain bill reduces Federal revenues by $22.6 billion, \nsomething that should only be done if that motion comes from the Senate \nFinance Committee. Nearly one-third of this revenue loss is offset by \nchanges in programs within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. \nSection 502 of the bill before us extends customs user fees generating \n$7 billion in revenue over 8 years.\n  You may recall when Congress first authorized these customs user \nfees, the avowed purpose was to help finance the cost of customs \ncommercial operations and improvements. If these fees are to be \nextended--and I emphasize ``if''--it should be done in the context of a \ncustoms reauthorization bill. This is clearly an issue under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  Most of my colleagues know firsthand the financial pressures put on \nthe Customs Service. From Montana to Delaware to Massachusetts, Texas \nand California, there is a dire need for funds to modernize the Customs \nService. Yet the Kennedy-McCain legislation diverts money intended for \ncustoms and uses it to pay for this bill. This is not what Congress \nintended when these customs fees were increased.\n  Before authorizing the collection of $7 billion in customs user fees, \nit seems to me the full Finance Committee should have an opportunity to \ncarefully review, carefully analyze, and of course debate the \nimplications of this move on the future of the Customs Service and \ncustoms modernization.\n  Anybody who has been through customs knows how much time is wasted \nthere, how much gets by the customs officials because they do not have \nthe electronic and technical equipment that is necessary to do their \njob right, in a fashion that does not inhibit the free and easy \ntransiting of American citizens into and out of our country.\n  In addition, section 503 of the Kennedy-McCain bill delays payments \nto Medicare providers, which generate $235 million to help offset the \nlosses of this bill.\n  No. 1, customs fees; No. 2, delaying payments to Medicare providers \nto the tune of $235 million.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, when they hold their town meetings, \ninvariably they have to have people from doctors' offices, from \nhospital organizations, and from nursing homes already complaining, why \ndoesn't the Federal Government pay its bills on time? Why are they a \ncash cow, an operating fund for the Federal Government while they are \nborrowing money at the local bank to keep their operation going because \nthe Federal Government does not pay its bills on time?\n  It is ironic that while many of us are spending significant amounts \nof our time working to improve Medicare's effectiveness and efficiency, \nthis bill actually takes steps to exacerbate the frustrations so many \nproviders already experience with delayed payments in Medicare today. \nSo, as you can see, the provisions of this bill go a long way to \nundermine the Finance Committee's jurisdiction, not only on customs but \nalso in the area of Medicare.\n  In this first action by new leadership, the committee system and the \ncommittee jurisdiction are being tossed aside. I have heard once or \ntwice from the other side that the justification of this behavior is \nbased on the patients' rights debates in 1999, 2 years ago. There is \ncontinued talk about how the 1999 patients' rights bills were rammed \nthrough this Senate by Republicans.\n  I want to say that is simply not the case. In 1999, the patients' \nrights legislation underwent a series of hearings in the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee, and ultimately there were 3 days of \nmarkup. Let me repeat: 3 days of markup in the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. Only after the bill was reported out of \ncommittee was it then brought up.\n  Let me hear no discussion on this point. There is no justification \nfor the conduct we are having on this bill. It is a fact that the \nKennedy-McCain bill before us today has never undergone the committee \nprocess that the 1999 Patients' Bill of Rights did.\n  Finally, let me repeat that for those who argue that this is just a \ndelaying tactic, they are simply wrong. The motion to commit instructs \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the one hand \nand the Finance Committee on the other to report this legislation \nwithin 14 days. I repeat, if this bill had been handled properly \nthrough the committee in the first place, this motion would not have \nbeen necessary.\n  This motion is not about delaying, it is about ensuring that we have \na good patients' rights bill with bipartisan support that is subject to \nthe benefits of the committee process and that the jurisdictions of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Finance Committees are \nrespected. In other words, it pursues a point of view I tried to raise \nso much when we had the tax bill on the floor in late May. As I managed \nthat bill, I said I hoped the work of Senator Baucus, on the part of \nDemocrats, and myself on the part of Republicans, would bring a \nbipartisan bill before this committee that would serve as somewhat of \nan example of not only what can be done in an evenly divided Senate to \npromote good public policy but to promote good public policy in a \ndivided body. Obviously, it must be done in a bipartisan way.\n  We showed that it could be done in the largest tax bill to pass this \nbody in 20 years. If we did it on taxes, surely we can do it on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I say that not just for the Finance \nCommittee. It is my belief the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee can do that as well on their part, serving 100 Senators \nrather than having just a handful of people in this body decide the \ncommittee system ought to be thrust aside in the case of a Patients' \nBill of Rights, and bringing a bill directly to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I have talked a lot about jurisdiction, but I want to talk about why \nI am raising these jurisdiction issues because that is a very important \npoint.\n  For me, the question isn't about inside baseball kind of topic like \njurisdiction, which is necessarily important. But it is about two \ndeeper issues that are even bigger than this bill.\n  I know the public watching this debate, as we are told, is pretty \ndisturbed when they only hear about Members of the Senate talking about \nthe intra-institutional issues. That is what I have been talking about \ntoday to some extent. But on the other hand, I know the people of this \ncountry are interested in making sure that we protect patients' rights \nwhen they are up against the insurance company and feel hopeless about \nthe insurance company not giving them the proper treatment which they \nare entitled to. The proper treatment the doctor-patient relationship \ndemands. People want to know that what we are doing is improving their \nlife.\n  So I spend a little bit of time on intra-institutional procedure to \nsay that having this bill go through the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee on the one hand, and the Finance Committee on the \nother hand, has something to do with drawing up a piece of legislation \nthat will get these patients the protections to which they are \nentitled.\n  What I am talking about can be summed up in two related questions.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n  The first is: Why are we here? The second is: What is my specific \nrole with respect to the people I serve in my State of Iowa and each \nSenator in their respective States in the larger national interest of \nseeing that patients are protected when they are up against an \ninsurance company?\n  The first question gets at our role as Senators with respect not only \nto this bill but any legislation. The second refers to our role as \ncommittee Members.\n  So the first question: Why are we here?\n  Just like the other 99 Members of this body, I wake up every morning \nand thank the people of my State for the privilege of representing them \nhere in the Senate. Every action I take is an effort to improve the \nlives of folks back home. Many times I improve it by reducing the role \nof the Federal Government in their lives. As a conservative, that is \ngenerally my preference. On the other hand, there are times that \nFederal legislation is needed to expand the Federal role to help on a \nparticular problem. This is an example--the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  With respect to any legislation but not just this one, if I believe \nit helps folks back home, I am going to push as hard as I can to see \nthat the legislation becomes law. There is no more satisfying event \nthan seeing the fruits of our labor revealed in ways that changes the \nlives of real folks back home.\n  When I approach an idea and I think it is a good idea, my goal is to \nget it across the goal line. That is true with respect to this bill, \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I think at this particular point in history the American people want \nresults, and particularly on this issue. They want less partisanship, \nmore action, and more thoughtful debate. People in Iowa expect \nRepublicans and Democrats to work together, and to work together in \nconjunction with the President of the United States to get things done. \nThey expect us as their Senators to do the same thing.\n  Iowans expect us to refrain from playing partisan politics and to be \nserious legislators.\n  I offer that as friendly political advice to many colleagues, \nparticularly those on the other side of the aisle who seem to be \nvisiting Iowa frequently these days. In fact, a surprising large number \nof Democrat Senators are coming to Iowa.\n  I approach the tax cut bill as a serious legislative effort. My goal \nwas to work with Republicans and Democrats to get a bill out of the \nFinance Committee. With Senator Baucus' support I did so. That bill \nimproved President Bush's basic proposal.\n  With respect to the particular policy areas that is the focus of the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I start off with a view of how I can make \ngood public policy become law. That particular policy is the arena of \nSenator Kennedy on the one hand, and Senator Gregg on the other in the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  If my motion is agreed to, it is up to Senators Kennedy and Gregg to \nuse the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to process the \nbulk of this legislation through their committee. That is their call.\n  This legislation faces a potential Presidential veto. That potential \nPresidential veto doesn't need to be there. It doesn't need to be \nhanging over our head as a cloud as we work on legislation.\n  That is where the committee process is very important because maybe \nthe product of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nmarkup would not face a potential Presidential veto. Maybe some of the \nambiguities that we have heard debated on the floor of the Senate this \nafternoon would be cleared up.\n  Does anyone really think that by following regular order and going \nthrough the committee process the bill before us would be in worse \nshape? Would we have better known the administration's position if it \nhad been in committee? Would we be sitting here wondering where this \nbill might be going, as we have heard countless numbers of Senators \ntalk about how we can work out a compromise?\n  Would we be hearing something more compelling from the bill's \nadvocates other than that anyone who opposes the bill is delaying this \nbill?\n  I guess one could argue that there is not much use in delaying a bill \nthat the President is going to veto; that we ought to just quickly pass \nit.\n  With the proper preparation and the proper compromise--and the \ncommittee system is the place to do that--we could avoid a veto, and we \nshould work to avoid a veto.\n  You can understand that the Finance Committee knows how to do this. \nSenator Baucus and I put a bill out, and we defeated all of the \namendments to destroy that bill--close to 50--over the course of 3 days \non the floor of this Senate. So it can be done right in committee.\n  I would like to go back to the question of why we are here in this \nparticular shape.\n  I tell the folks in Iowa who sent me here that I am trying to get a \nPatients' Bill of Rights that we will have signed; in other words, that \ndoesn't have a potential veto hanging over its head as the bill we are \ndebating today does. We would get a bill that would become law and \nprovide them with real protections; most importantly, a bill to \nguarantee treatment for patients, not tribute for attorneys.\n  In my view, bad process has impaired what could otherwise be a good \nproduct, a bipartisan, broadly supported Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  But, once again, my motion defers the exact language of the bill to \nthe Members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to \nresolve these issues. That is the place it should be done.\n  My second question: What is my specific role as a committee member?\n  My role is to best use my position as a senior Republican on the \nFinance Committee to protect and to promote policies that help Iowans \nand the Nation at large. I have a responsibility to advance and to \nprotect policy interests within the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  There are policy implications in this legislation that are within the \njurisdiction of my committee, the Finance Committee. These policies \ndeal with three major subjects of the Finance Committee: trade, \nMedicare, and tax.\n  It is my responsibility to Iowans and also to my Finance Committee \nmembers and to Members of the Senate as a body to be vigilant on these \nFinance Committee matters. I cannot let these things slip by, nor \nshould I let them slip by. That would be very easy to do. But it would \nalso be very irresponsible.\n  My motion provides the Finance Committee with the opportunity to do \nits job on trade, Medicare, and health-care-related tax issues. This \nbill affects each of these to some extent.\n\n  So I note that I am in some pretty good company when it comes to the \nvalue of the committee process.\n  I would like to refer to a couple quotes that illustrate the \nimportance of my point that we should not bypass the relevant \ncommittees of jurisdiction. These quotes come from Members who are very \ncritical of the way the Senate acted by bypassing the Budget Committee \non the budget resolution process a couple months ago.\n  I remind those Senators of some of their comments about the \nimportance of going through the committee process in the Senate. These \ncomments, as I said, were related to the budget. Now let me quote the \nnew chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad. This is a quote \nfrom a couple months ago:\n\n       I think it would be a profound mistake for us to miss the \n     chance to have the Budget Committee do what it was designed \n     to do, which is to make the work of the larger body easier \n     because of the concentration of efforts of the members of the \n     committee on the responsibility they have.\n\n  I quote the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the now-\nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He always shows great \neloquence and devotion to this institution in his comments:\n\n       Why have we seen fit in our constitutional system to have \n     committees? Why? If we are going to have committees, why \n     don't we have markups on bills and let Republicans and \n     Democrats hammer it out, hammer out the measure on the anvil \n     of free debate? Why does any chairman want to say to the \n     committee, I am not going to have a markup, period?\n\n  These comments are relevant no matter whether Democrats or \nRepublicans are in the majority in this body. Now, in a sense, since \nthe changes of 3 weeks ago on the chairmanships and the majority of \nthis body, the shoe is on the other foot. I will be curious to\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\nsee whether these Members, and others who were so critical of the \nbudget resolution process, will stick to the same rationale now that \nthe committee process is being short-circuited for a measure they might \nbe supporting.\n  I bring up these comments because they reflect a well-founded \nsentiment of two very serious legislators whom I respect, Senator Byrd \nand Senator Conrad. The committees are kind of like laboratories or, as \nSenator Byrd said, like anvils. They are a place to test ideas. They \nare a necessary part of serious--and I underline the word ``serious''--\nlegislating.\n  Senator Conrad indicated that there is a concentration of member \nknowledge and expertise in each of these committees. Is it exhaustive? \nAbsolutely not. Am I saying that a bill cannot be improved with \namendments on the floor? Of course, no legislation is perfect from that \nstandpoint. But my point is, the legislative product, especially on \nsomething as important as health care, should start in the relevant \ncommittee.\n  So my motion would allow the Finance Committee to assert its proper \nrole.\n  Let's turn to the specific Finance Committee matters that are \nimplicated with this legislation and, hence, the reason for my motion \nto commit. The first is trade. As I said previously, the customs user \nfees have been extended to offset the cost of the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We are talking about money that was raised by the Senate \nFinance Committee. Customs fees--getting in and out of the country, \ngetting your baggage inspected, getting your boxes inspected--that \nmoney was raised to help the Customs Service and particularly for their \nmodernization. Now they are talking about taking some of that money and \nputting it over here to finance a Patients' Bill of Rights. So should \ncustoms people be concerned? Should the Senate Finance Committee be \nconcerned because we have jurisdiction over that legislation? Should \npassengers and travelers in and out of the United States be concerned \nwhen they are in long lines to go through customs? Of course they \nshould be concerned.\n\n  The Finance Committee authorizes and oversees the Customs Service. \nCustoms may not be as politically compelling right now as a Patients' \nBill of Rights, but it is very important to all of our constituents. \nMillions of us, and our goods, come through customs. Customs also \nprotects our people from the entry of illegal products. For instance, \ncustoms checks for illegal drugs. Also, customs protects our farmers \nand consumers from diseased plants and animals.\n  Just think of the ground zero attitude that is taken by customs today \nto make sure that the BSE disease, the mad cow disease, prevalent in \nEngland and Europe does not come into the United States.\n  We need to have a customs operation that protects America. It is to \nbe done at the point of entry. The amount of money we spend on that, \nand the technology our customs employees have, has something to do with \nwhether or not they can do their job right and protect us. The quality \nof the Customs Service affects us all. So those of us on the Finance \nCommittee do not approach customs matters haphazardly.\n  As those of you who have traveled recently know, customs systems \nmodernization is a problem we have to tackle. If we are to extend the \nfee, we should modernize the Customs Service. Customs fees should not \nbe used to finance a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has had no \nhearings on Customs fees. There is a reason for that. The committee \ndoes not have jurisdiction over the Customs Service. Yet here we are \nwith a bill that has not even been through the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, and that bill is offset by a revenue \nsource from another committee, our Finance Committee. Any Finance \nCommittee member should be disturbed with this usurpation of our \njurisdiction. Any Finance Committee member who supports this action has \nceded away his or her role with respect to an important Finance \nCommittee matter.\n  The bottom line is, the Finance Committee, including all 20 of its \nmembers, has a duty to our constituents, and all of America, to make \nsure that the Customs Service isn't dealt with in a faulty manner. To \nthe degree that we ignore this duty, we are being negligent. Again, \nthat is the main reason for my motion: To let the committee members do \nour job.\n  There is a second Finance Committee policy item covered by my motion. \nThis legislation moves the payment date for certain Medicare providers \nby just one day. No big deal? Put it in its context. Medicare reform is \nsomething we are talking about right now in the Finance Committee. It \nis an important topic, particularly because we want to give a \nprescription drug program to seniors under Medicare. Payment structure \nand dates are important questions that should be considered in the \ncontext of Medicare policy, not as some sort of an offset--which is the \nword we use--for unrelated legislation, because, in fact, this is an \noffset for an unrelated subject, the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We ought not to mess with Medicare this way. This bill, pulled from \nthe calendar by the majority leader, gets around Senate rule XV. That \nrule provides a point of order if one committee treads on the territory \nof another committee. The reason for the rule is to allow committees, \nsuch as the Finance Committee, with the expertise on a subject, such as \nMedicare, to develop the policy first.\n  Why would Senate leaders, who expect the Finance Committee, in a \nbipartisan way, to report out a prescription drug bill for senior \ncitizens connected with the Medicare Program, and, hopefully, with some \ndramatic improvements in Medicare, expect us to do that but not ask our \nadvice on changing the payment date for Medicare?\n  We ought to develop it within a policy context by the people on the \ncommittee who know how to do it and do it right. Then again, as with \ntrade, my motion preserves the right of the Finance Committee to deal \nwith Medicare. It would allow Finance Committee members to review the \nchange in Medicare provider payment dates and make judgments of whether \nsuch a date change is sensible or not.\n  As I said before, all of us have heard complaints from doctors, \nhospitals, and nursing homes that the Federal Government never makes \nMedicare payments timely. Our health providers already feel as though \nthey are financing the Federal Government because of these late \npayments. This bill exacerbates that problem by creating further \ndelays. The Finance Committee understands this problem. We will do it \nright if it needs to be done. My motion simply lets the Finance \nCommittee members do the job they were appointed to do by the 100 \nMembers of the Senate.\n  Now I turn to the third Finance Committee policy area implicated by \nthis legislation, and that is the tax policy area. There are no Tax \nCode changes in this bill. The history of this legislation is an \nimportant element. The history of this legislation is that an important \nelement is greater health care affordability and access. That objective \nhas, in past legislation, been met through tax incentives.\n  This bill's principal sponsor, for instance, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, recognized the importance of these tax incentives \nin the debate, as you heard him speak eloquently over the last several \ndays. I also happen to believe that tax incentives for health care \naccess and affordability are a very important part of health care \nreform. They are the basis for helping 42 million Americans who do not \nhave health insurance today to get some health insurance. To this end, \nI have, for instance, proposed changes in the tax treatment of long-\nterm care insurance and expenses.\n  Some might ask: Why, if I support health care-related tax cuts, did I \noppose Senator Hutchinson's amendment on self-employed insurance? Well, \nit is a very good question, one I should be responsive to and answer.\n  The answer is, most obviously, that Senators Hutchinson and Bond have \nan excellent proposal, one I strongly support as a policy of their \namendment. But I opposed the amendment last week because the underlying \nbill is not a Finance Committee bill. In this case, the underlying bill \nis not a tax bill. So the third reason for my motion is to provide the \nFinance Committee with its rightful opportunity, through its tax-\nwriting powers, to add a health care-related tax cut title to this \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\n  If this bill had gone through our committee, that would have been \ndone. Or if it hadn't gone through our committee but we had had time, \nour committee would have voted out such an amendment, I am sure. There \nis no doubt that Senator Hutchinson's amendment, along with a number of \nother good health care-related tax cuts, would be on the floor right \nnow being debated as part of this package.\n  Once again, my motion let's us do this legislation the right way, by \nletting the Finance Committee members do their job. From that \nstandpoint, again, I stress the bipartisanship of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  At my urging, Chairman Baucus agreed to consider a package of health \ncare-related tax cuts in an upcoming Finance Committee markup. So even \nif my motion fails, we will be back on the Senate floor in the near \nfuture with a Finance Committee package of health care-related tax \nincentives.\n\n  In explaining the reason behind my motion, I talked about what the \nFinance Committee might or might not do if this motion is adopted. Just \nas importantly, I believe there are some serious negative implications \nif my motion is defeated in terms of how the Senate does the people's \nbusiness. Let me turn to a couple hypotheticals to illustrate the \nproblem my motion gets at. These hypotheticals, hopefully, will disturb \nall Members.\n  Turn the clock back a couple months and hypothesize that Senator \nLott, with my cooperation, were to move a version of the Finance \nCommittee's education tax relief proposal. Also, let me say that the \nrevenue loss from those tax cuts were offset by a change to a HELP \nCommittee program, something like student loans. In other words, I am \nsaying let's just suppose hypothetically that Senator Lott wanted some \nproposals from our committee to bring to the Senate floor and we were \ngoing to offset them with programs under the jurisdiction of the HELP \nCommittee.\n  Under this scenario, obviously, people on that committee could be \nvery angry. They would have every right to be angry because that kind \nof maneuver on my part, as a member of the Finance Committee, would be \nwrong. They would have a right, then, in the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, to be outraged. The Finance Committee would \nhave no business in a bill pulled off the calendar such as this one of \nundoing a student loan policy under the jurisdiction of another \ncommittee. It would be wrong from two points, both substantive and \nprocedural.\n  What has happened here is just as bad. The Finance Committee members \nwho support the process that has brought this bill before us should \ntake a ``beware'' position. Supporting the process means they support \ndisenfranchising their own committee. By contrast, anyone who supports \nmy motion recognizes the legitimacy of the committee system.\n  I have one last hypothetical. This time let's talk about another \nsponsor of this bill. Let's go back to Mr. McCain, the good Senator \nfrom Arizona, and his Commerce Committee. Under this hypothetical \nscenario, Senator Daschle, with Senator Baucus's cooperation, would \nbring a bill to create a special form of tax credit bond for Amtrak. \nThat issue has been before us before. A part of that legislation pulled \nfrom the calendar, such as this bill, would suspend the Amtrak reforms. \nThat is within the jurisdiction of Senator McCain's Commerce Committee \nor, as I could say, the Presiding Officer now, the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  I hope these Senators would be angry and rightfully so. I would \nexpect them to protect a policy important to the Commerce Committee. \nAmtrak reform is that policy and that subject. These Senators would not \nwant an alteration of the Amtrak reforms railroaded through the Senate \non an unrelated bill drafted by a committee other than their own \ncommittee, the Commerce Committee, I would suspect.\n  In both of these hypotheticals, the rights of committee members would \nbe violated. These cases are no different than the case before us, the \ncase of jurisdiction and sources of revenue from the Finance Committee \nbeing robbed without the consideration of the Finance Committee to fund \na piece of legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights, coming out of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  The two hypotheticals are disturbing because both involve dubious \nprocedural and substantive policy decisions. Both hypotheticals short \ncircuit important policy decisions and discussions.\n  A faulty process usually leads to faulty substance. So I have taken a \nlong time to tell you what my motion is all about. It corrects the \nfaulty process that has ensnared this Patients' Bill of Rights, which \nshould otherwise move to the floor only after debate in the committee. \nAnd if it had gone through the committees, I believe it would move \nthrough the floor proceedings very expeditiously.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Let me make sure I understand the Senator. This bill \nthat we have been considering has not gone through the committee \nprocess this year; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator mentioned the prerogative of the committee. \nHaving been a chairman, I understand what he is talking about. From the \nstandpoint of patients and the Patients' Bill of Rights, which we have \nbeen here discussing today and Friday in terms of who was covered and \nwho wasn't covered, when employers had liability and when they did not, \nare these the kinds of things that get hashed out in committee?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Obviously. From the standpoint of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, these things were debated and \nhashed out in 1999 before the bill came to the Senate floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. But not this year.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Not this year.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In 1999, were there any liability provisions in that \nbill? I don't believe there were any liability provisions in that bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Right, because I think there was due consideration to \nthe tradeoff between the people who don't have insurance now--42 \nmillion people--and the people who do have insurance through self-\nemployed plans, and that there was within the committee a real concern \nabout whether or not those employers might drop their insurance--not \nthat we are concerned about the employer, but we are concerned about \nthe employee if they are not going to have health insurance.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. What I am getting at is, is it not true that the \nliability parts of these bills have not been referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is absolutely right. I thought the Senator was \ntalking about the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. \nThese would also be within their jurisdiction.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Not only has the Finance Committee not had a chance to \nconsider their portion, the Judiciary Committee has not had the \nopportunity to consider the liability portion, which is so \ncontroversial. We are hashing out right now what this thick bill means \nregarding liability. It has never been in the appropriate committee to \ngo through the natural, normal committee process on a bill of this \nimportance; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, and we \nwould look at these things and give them the due consideration they \nought to have. I know the Senator from Tennessee has served on the \nJudiciary Committee and he knows that is a very important part of our \nwork.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for bringing those points to us \nbecause he reminds me that not only has it not been considered by the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which I have been \ntalking about, and the Finance Committee, because I am a member and the \nsenior Republican on that committee, but also a third committee should \nhave considered perhaps the most controversial part of this legislation \nbefore us, and that has not had the due consideration that important \nchanges in law and liability ought to have in this Chamber.\n  I am just about done. I have spoken now for a long time on my motion \nto commit to the respective committees. I guess I am being reminded my \nmotion to commit is to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on the one hand and to the Finance Committee on the other. \nMaybe my motion\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\nshould be broadened--although I am not going to do that at this point--\nto the point of the Judiciary Committee taking a look-see at the \nliability provisions as well.\n  A vote for the motion to commit would put this bill on the right \ntrack. It lets members of these committees do the job that we were sent \nhere to do. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and \nthe Finance Committee have a great track record in this Congress. They \nwill continue to do so. Taking this bill through the relevant \ncommittees will only improve it and ultimately make it a better law, \nand one that is not in any way subject to a potential--I predict, not \nsubject to a potential veto threat, as the legislation now is.\n  After all, isn't getting the job done, getting a good Patients' Bill \nof Rights, what the people really want--a good law that is produced in \na proper way, a bill that will guarantee treatment for patients, not a \ntribute for lawyers?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the bill and \ntell a story about a patient in North Carolina, and we will have an \namendment to offer. First of all, the entire purpose of this \nlegislation is to change the law so that the law is on the side of \npatients and doctors instead of being on the side of the big HMOs, \nwhere it has been for many years. We want health care decisions made by \nfamilies who are affected by them, and by doctors and nurses who have \nthe education and training to make those decisions. It is just that \nsimple.\n  That is the reason we create the rights among all Americans with \nhealth insurance or HMO coverage to have more control over their health \ncare decisions. That is what this is about--having those rights be \nenforceable because if they are not enforceable, they don't mean \nanything. That is why we have specifically provided for access to \nspecialists by families; access to clinical trials, if they need that; \nand being able to go to the emergency room directly without having to \ncall an HMO or a 1-800 number before going to the emergency room--that \nis the last thing in the world any family ought to have to worry about \nbefore going to the emergency room--making sure a woman can see an OB/\nGYN as a primary care provider.\n  These rights are aimed at giving patients and families more control \nover health care decisions. We have all heard the horror stories of \nlegitimate claims being denied by HMOs. That is what this bill is aimed \nat--putting the law on the side of the patients and on the side of the \ndoctors.\n  In addition to these substantive rights, we have provisions to make \nthose rights enforceable, so that they mean something. We have an \ninternal review process. First of all, the HMO decides in the first \ninstance whether they are going to cover a claim. If that is \nunsuccessful, then we have an internal review process within the HMO to \nget that decision reversed. So if a child is denied the care that child \nneeds, then the family has somewhere to go. These families who are up \nagainst big insurance companies, big HMOs, big bureaucracies, under \npresent law they can't do anything. I say this to my colleagues who \nhave been here.\n  Some say we need to spend more time on this issue. This issue has \nbeen around for years now. Every day that we fail to enact legislation \nand have it signed by the President, there are thousands of people in \nthis country who are being denied the care they need. This is an issue \nthat we need to do something about and stop talking about. It should \nnot be a political issue.\n  Senator McCain and I have bipartisan support, consensus support for \nour bill here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. We \nhave virtually every health care group and consumer group in America, \nincluding the American Medical Association, supporting our legislation. \nThese people deal with these issues every day. Doctors get to see what \nis happening to their patients, and there are bureaucrats sitting \nbehind desks 200 miles away, never having seen their patient, telling \nthem what their patient needs. We have families all over this country \nwho know that their child needs a test, but some bureaucrat five States \naway, sitting behind a desk somewhere, says they are not going to pay \nfor it.\n  That is what this legislation is about--so that when people have \nhealth insurance and they have HMO coverage, it means something. If \nthey get rejected arbitrarily and are treated unfairly and improperly \nby a big HMO, they would have the power, finally, to do something about \nit.\n  That is why we have an internal review process--to reverse the \ndecision within the HMO--and then if that does not work, we have an \nindependent third party review, a panel of doctors, who can come in and \nsay, that is wrong--the doctor was right, the HMO was wrong--and order \nthe treatment be provided.\n  None of these things exists today. Today, if a doctor orders a test \nfor a 5-year-old child with cancer and if an HMO says, ``We are not \npaying for it,'' they are stuck. There is no internal review process; \nthere is no external review process.\n  What chance does that family have against a huge insurance company? \nThat is what this bill is about. It is about a very simple idea: that \nHMOs and insurance companies ought to be treated as everybody else; \nmore importantly, putting the law finally back on the side of patients, \nfamilies, and doctors so they can do something about a wrongful \ndecision by an HMO or an insurance company. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n  The HMOs have been trotting out every conceivable obstacle to \nsomething happening. Anybody who turns their television on will see the \nads they are running right now, all these scare tactics and old \nrhetoric. They have been using it for years. They just want to do \neverything they can to keep their special status, their privileged \nstatus. They like things the way they are. They do not want patients \nand families to have any power.\n  We are going to do something about it. I will tell you something \nelse: The families, the children, the patients do not have lobbyists in \nWashington; they do not have millions of dollars to buy ads on \ntelevision. They are counting on us to represent them. They are \ncounting on us to do something for them. That is what this debate boils \ndown to: You are either on the side of maintaining the big HMO special \nstatus or you are on the side of letting families, doctors, trained \npeople, make health care decisions.\n  It is not an accident that the American Medical Association, hundreds \nof health care groups, doctors groups, and consumer groups support our \nbill. It is not an accident that most of the Senate supports our bill. \nIt is not an accident that most of the House of Representatives \nsupports our bill.\n  There is a consensus in this country that something needs to be done. \nWhat we have to make sure that we get past all the old rhetoric, all \nthe old scare tactics, all the propaganda that is put out by the HMOs. \nThey have huge resources and their voice is heard loudly and clearly in \nthis debate.\n  Our responsibility is to make sure the voices of the families of this \ncountry who do not have big money, who do not have anybody lobbying for \nthem in Washington, are being heard. That is what this is about. \nStalemate and nothing occurring is exactly what the HMOs want. That is \nthe easiest result. We have to overcome that. We have to overcome their \nrhetoric. We have to overcome these obstacles because we are fighting \nfor the children and families of this country who need to make their \nown health care decisions.\n  Today I want to talk about one such family. This is a young woman \nfrom Wilmington, NC. Her photograph with her husband is behind me. Her \nname is Terri Seargent. She suffers from a fatal genetic disorder known \nas alpha one. Alpha one keeps Terri's liver and lungs from working \nproperly. Her body is not able to fight off viruses or pollutants in \nthe air, and if it is left untreated, alpha one eventually destroys the \nlungs and causes the patient to die. Terri is still fighting this \ndisease, but she is at the point where she only has 43 percent lung \ncapacity.\n\n  The problem is Terri is not just fighting this serious disease; she \nis also fighting her HMO. Ever since she was diagnosed with alpha one, \nshe has been treated by specialists who put her on medication to keep \nher lungs working as well as they can, to keep her from getting worse. \nWith that medication, she is able to lead a fairly normal life even \nthough she has a serious problem.\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\n  She continues to work. She switched jobs, so she has a new HMO, a new \nhealth plan. Her HMO first would not let her see the specialist she had \nbeen seeing. Second, they would not pay for her medication. They told \nher she ought to switch to a generic drug because it was cheaper, but \nthen they would not pay for the generic drug.\n  Here is a young woman who has a very serious medical problem; she is \ncontinuing to fight through it courageously to go to work and do \neverything she can to be productive for herself and her family, and her \nHMO will not let her see a specialist and will not pay for her \nmedicine. Her medication costs $4,000 a month. It is expensive, but it \nis critical to the quality of her life and being a contributing member \nof her family.\n  What good is her health insurance--she has been paying premiums for \nyears now--what good is that if, when it actually comes time that she \nneeds this medication to allow her to continue to live and stay as \nhealthy as she can and continue to work, the insurance company will not \npay for these prescription drugs she desperately needs?\n  Unfortunately, Terri's case is one in a long list of what we hear \nevery day. When I have townhall meetings or when I am standing on a \nstreet corner talking with people, over and over they come up to me and \nsay: You won't believe what the insurance company did to me; you won't \nbelieve what the HMO did to my child.\n  These people need a chance; they need a fighting chance, and that is \nall we are trying to do, to level the playing field. Let's give these \nfamilies and young women such as Terri who have serious diseases a \nchance when their insurance company or HMO says: You are out of luck; \nwe are not paying for it. When a child with cancer needs a test or \nspecialized care and the HMO or insurance company says, ``We're not \npaying for it,'' even though they have been paying premiums for years, \nall we are trying to do is give that family a chance. It gets to be \npretty simple.\n  In many cases, it is an individual, a child, a family against a big \ninsurance company, the same big insurance companies that are spending \nmillions of dollars on lobbyists and television ads right now to make \nsure people such as Terri cannot take them on. That is what this fight \nis about. It gets to be about a very simple problem.\n  I have worked with my colleagues on this issue all the time I have \nbeen in the Senate--some worked on it very hard before I came to the \nSenate. I believe when we finish this debate--hopefully this week, but \nif not this week, for whatever period of time it takes--that we will \nfinally be able to say the big HMOs and all their money and all their \npower have been overcome and doctors, patients, and families in America \nfinally have a chance.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has done a great job of explaining how \nimportant this bill is to patients, but it is also important to \ndoctors. If the Senator will allow me to read a letter I received from \na Las Vegas physician, this physician is formerly head of the State \nmedical society and is chief of staff to the largest hospital in \nNevada, about an 800-bed hospital. This letter is addressed to me.\n  After the first paragraph saying hello to me, he said:\n\n       As you have heard from so many Nevadans over the past \n     several years, we need a mechanism where patients have \n     options where care is denied. The following case is a clear \n     illustration.\n       On April 20th 1999, Joseph Greuble died at the age of 47 \n     from malnutrition. Joseph's malnutrition was a direct \n     complication of his life long battle with Crohns Disease. \n     Joseph's gastrointestinal problem was quite complex. His \n     disease was complicated by ulcerations, fistulae, bleeding, \n     obstruction, electrolyte disturbances, seizures, and chronic \n     pain, and Joseph required multiple operations. Continuity of \n     care is most important when dealing with an incurable, \n     chronic, debilitating disease. In Joseph's case, the system's \n     failure to provide continuity of care proved tragic and \n     fatal.\n       I served as Joseph's personal physician for 11 years. As \n     Joseph's conditioned worsened he was no longer able to live \n     independently, and he moved into his mother's small apartment \n     in Las Vegas. His mother would accompany him to my office for \n     all of Joseph's visits and as a result, I came to know his \n     mother Marion quite well.\n       For over a decade, I performed needed physical \n     examinations, arranged for appropriate diagnostic studies, \n     wrote Joseph's prescriptions, and attended to him in the \n     hospital whenever he required admission due to complications \n     of his disease. One of Joseph's most pressing needs was for \n     nutritional support. Joseph had become malnourished as a \n     complication of his Crohns Disease, and required TPN \n     (intravenous nutrition). Joseph's weight had fallen to just \n     over 110 pounds, and a 5'10'' tall Joseph needed the TPN to \n     maintain his weight and prevent death due to malnutrition.\n       In January of 1999, Joseph was told by his HMO that I could \n     not longer treat him. Appeals by both myself and Joseph to \n     have this decision reversed were denied. My offer to see \n     Joseph free of charge was rejected by the HMO, as I still \n     would not have been permitted to write his prescriptions, \n     direct his nutritional support, order any diagnostic testing \n     or request needed consultations.\n       While I do not have any of the medical records of Joseph's \n     treatment for the three months after he left my care, \n     Joseph's mother informs me that his TPN had been \n     discontinued, that his malnutrition worsened, his weight \n     dropping to less than 100 pounds. Joseph, malnourished and \n     unable to fight off infection, subsequently developed \n     pneumonia, sepsis, and died.\n       I have received permission from Mrs. Grouble to share this \n     story. Morion hopes that sharing her son's story will help \n     achieve the needed legislation to prevent this from happening \n     in the future. Holding health plans accountable when they \n     harm patients is not about suing insurance companies and \n     driving up the cost of health care, it is about stopping \n     abuses and bringing compassion back to medicine. Until the \n     health plans are accountable, people like Joseph and his \n     family will continue to suffer.\n\n  I say to my friend from North Carolina, this is his bill before the \nnational legislature. This legislation, the Senator would agree, would \nhelp patients, but also would help physicians such as my friend, Dr. \nNemec, prescribe and give appropriate care to patients. Is that a fair \nstatement?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely a fair statement. When I have town \nhall meetings in North Carolina, we often have physicians show up and \nshare horror stories, including ordering care for a patient, with some \nclerk sitting behind a desk 300 miles away reversing it and overruling \na doctor with many years of education and training because they thought \nthey knew better; there was no way they would pay for the particular \ncare.\n  Mr. REID. Dr. Nemec stated this is one of many cases. He could write \nme letters on case after case, but he wanted me to indicate he feels \nthis is just about the straw that breaks the camel's back. A man 5 foot \n10, weighing less than 100 pounds, and they prevented him from eating, \nin effect: You are going to die anyway; what is an extra few months or \na year.\n  I want the Senator from North Carolina to know how much I and the \npeople of Nevada appreciate the work the Senator is doing, spending \nweeks of his time working with Senator McCain, coming up with \nlegislation that allows the Frank Nemecs of the world to give proper \ncare to patients and will allow people such as this lovely woman, \npictured behind me, to know when she pays for her insurance for years, \nwhen it comes time she needs help, that help will be there.\n  I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate what is being done. \nNot only do I appreciate it but so do the people of the State of \nNevada. Hundreds of organizations all over the country have contacted \nus. I have read into the Record already, and I will continue reading \nwhen we have time on the floor, the names of the entities that support \nthe work done by the Senator from North Carolina. The Senator has been \nhere a short period of time. The impact he has made and the impact he \nwill make adding his name to this legislation will give people hope for \ngenerations to come. I appreciate the Senator's work.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I point out, as the Senator well knows, the American Medical \nAssociation strongly supports our legislation. Having met with them \nmany times about this issue, they want their doctors to be able to \nprovide the quality care they need to provide to their patients. It is \na simple thing from their perspective. For health care providers, \ndoctors and nurses, this is not a money issue. This is not an issue of \nwhat their earnings or salaries will be. This is purely an issue of \nwhether they are going to be able to provide the care they have been \neducated and trained and have spent their life preparing to provide. \nThat is what this is about. They are committed to doing something.\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\n  Every day their members all over this country see in their offices \npatients who need treatment, who need care, who are being arbitrarily \ndenied by people far away who have never seen them, who have no idea \nwhat they need.\n  The horror stories go on and on. We have a young man in North \nCarolina who is severely sick. They quit paying for his oxygen. We had \na young boy with cerebral palsy who needed physical therapy and other \ntherapies on a daily basis and they said it would not do any good; they \nwere not paying. The stories go on and on and on.\n  With respect to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we will \nwork our way through the intricacies of this legislation, whether the \nissue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, legal terms that may \nnot mean a lot to the American people, we will work our way through \nthose issues and find a bipartisan way to get that done.\n  What we shouldn't do is leave the Senate without having done \nsomething about this issue. The issue has been around for years and has \nbeen fought vigorously by the HMOs. We have a responsibility to empower \nthe families of this country to have more control over their health \ncare decisions. That is what this debate is about. Hopefully, by the \ntime we finish this debate, whether this week or next week or the \nfollowing week, however long it takes--and I believe Senator Daschle \nindicated he is willing to stay as long as we have to--we will be able \nto walk out of here and be proud of what we have done in giving \nfamilies, doctors, and patients more control over their health care \ndecisions and the power to do something when they have been treated \nimproperly. That is what this is about.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 812\n\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the previous order, I call up the \namendment at the desk by Senator McCain and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards] (for Mr. \n     McCain (for himself and Mr. Edwards)) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 812.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate with regard to the \n             selection of independent review organizations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FAIR REVIEW PROCESS\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) A fair, timely, impartial independent external appeals \n     process is essential to any meaningful program of patient \n     protection.\n       (2) The independence and objectivity of the review \n     organization and review process must be ensured.\n       (3) It is incompatible with a fair and independent appeals \n     process to allow a health maintenance organization to select \n     the review organization that is entrusted with providing a \n     neutral and unbiased medical review.\n       (4) The American Arbitration Association and arbitration \n     standards adopted under chapter 44 of title 28, United States \n     Code (28 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) both prohibit, as inherently \n     unfair, the right of one party to a dispute to choose the \n     judge in that dispute.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) every patient who is denied care by a health \n     maintenance organization or other health insurance company \n     should be entitled to a fair, speedy, impartial appeal to a \n     review organization that has not been selected by the health \n     plan;\n       (2) the States should be empowered to maintain and develop \n     the appropriate process for selection of the independent \n     external review entity;\n       (3) a child battling a rare cancer whose health maintenance \n     organization has denied a covered treatment recommended by \n     its physician should be entitled to a fair and impartial \n     external appeal to a review organization that has not been \n     chosen by the organization or plan that has denied the care; \n     and\n       (4) patient protection legislation should not pre-empt \n     existing State laws in States where there already are strong \n     laws in place regarding the selection of independent review \n     organizations.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We have talked about the need for an independent review \nonce there is an internal review and the HMO or insurance company \ndenies the claim, to be able to go to a truly independent panel to get \nthe case decided and the decision reversed if a wrongful decision has \nbeen made. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment simply provides we all \nbelieve that review panel needs to be truly independent in that the HMO \nand the insurance company should not be able to appoint the members of \nthat panel nor have control over who goes on that panel.\n  We will debate this amendment tomorrow, but its underlying purpose is \nto support the notion that I think a majority of the Senate, maybe the \nvast majority, supports, which is if you are going to have an \nindependent review by a panel of health care providers or doctors, that \npanel needs to be truly independent, not connected to the HMO, not \nconnected to the insurance company, and also not connected to the \npatient or the doctor involved, so you have a fair and impartial group \nto decide whether the claim or treatment should be paid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I was listening to the description of \nthe sense of the Senate and I wish to compliment my colleague from \nNorth Carolina for introducing it. It is extremely important in the \nadministrative process that the procedures we set up are guaranteed to \nbe qualified and guaranteed to be independent. This bill goes a very \nlong way towards doing that. Obviously, I have some problems with this \nbill. With regard to the provision setting forth these independent \nentities, the qualified external review entity is established. That \nmeans when we have these cases where there is an issue as to whether or \nnot there is coverage, it is the independent person who decides.\n  We hear about a lot of terrible cases. We get letters from people. We \ntalk to people when we go back home. We hear about people who are sick; \nin some cases there is absolutely nothing anybody can do, and certainly \nnot us. We hear about people who have terrible accidents. We hear about \npeople who are victims of crimes. We hear about a lot of \nmisfortune. But, in the health care area, we have a system in this \ncountry where people can get insured for a lot of things. The deal is, \nyour employer provides this for you. The deal is, your wages are \naffected by it, of course. The deal is, we are going to provide you \ninsurance to cover certain things in exchange for a premium that the \nemployer is going to pay.\n\n  If you cover absolutely anything, and you have a contract--which has \nnever been drafted--that says whatever happens to you, however you get \nsick, however much it costs, however onerous your injuries, we are \ngoing to cover you, no questions asked--the premium for that would be \nastronomical. Nobody could afford that. It is unfortunate. It doesn't \nmake that person any less sick. It doesn't make that person any less \ndeserving. But that is just the way it is.\n  We got into managed care because we, in this body, encouraged the \ncreation of these HMOs. The reason for that wasn't because we liked \nHMOs. The reason was that health care costs were becoming astronomical \nand people were losing their health care. As tragic as these stories \nare, they would have been just as tragic had their employers never \nbought the health insurance. There would not be any dispute over \nwhether or not there was coverage. This would not even be a policy to \nstart with. That would not help these poor people.\n  So we have a system where certain things are covered for a certain \npremium. In a free market, those things work out. If somebody is \nmessing up on one side, the other side will take care of it. That is \nthe way the system works. As I say, if you are going to have a system \nwhere the Federal Government says that, regardless of whatever the \nclaim is, it has to be paid, you can have a system like that. Nobody \nhas suggested that. I wonder why no one has suggested that. Our hearts \ngo out to people because of these stories. Our hearts go out for all \nthese sick people. Why don't we just say the Federal Government will \nsee to it, either directly out of the Federal Treasury or we will make \nan insurance company take care of whoever is sick for whatever reason? \nIt is a nationalized health care system. You can debate that. You can \nargue that. Some people would argue on behalf of that.\n  Nobody is suggesting that. Why not? Because we do not want to take \ncare of\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nthese people? Of course not. It is because we know the effects of that. \nBecause for everything we do, for which we can make a case, to help \npeople and give rights and give benefits and make other parts of our \nsociety give third parties of our society certain rights and benefits \nso the Federal Government doesn't have to do it--we make other \ncitizens, other companies, do it for us--we can do all that, but there \nare always effects from that. We were elected to look at all that and \ntry to balance it and try to come up with something that is reasonable. \nNot something that will come up and cover every hypothetical case that \nmay ever come about, because that cannot be done, but something that \nwill reasonably balance the coverage we want people to have, I want my \nfamily to have, something the average person can afford, something the \naverage small employer can afford. Otherwise, they are not going to buy \nany insurance at all.\n  The point I am getting to is that there are some cases, where \ncoverage is at issue, in which everybody is operating in good faith. It \nis not a matter of the big guy and little guy and the big guy is always \nwrong and the little guy ought to be paid. It is a matter of reasonable \npeople sitting down and having a consideration, discussion, and \nsometimes a disagreement as to whether or not a particular procedure is \nmedically appropriate.\n\n  Honest doctors disagree about that all the time, whether or not a \nparticular procedure is experimental or not. If a policy covered all \nkinds of experimental things that we did not think would help you--\nthere is a 99-percent chance it is not going to help you any, but it is \nexperimental; we can spend $1 million to see what it is; policies just \ndon't cover that--prices would be astronomical. Nobody could afford \nthat. So you get into the question, Is it medically called for? Is it \nan experimental thing?\n  Honest people can disagree about things such as that. We do it all \nthe time. We are talking about lawsuits, and that is what happens in \nlawsuits. You would not have any lawsuits in the medical area, in the \nmalpractice area, unless you had doctors on both sides of the cases \ntaking different views of these matters. We have to resolve these \nmatters. We cannot just predetermine that because a case is meritorious \nand our heart bleeds for an individual case, all of it is covered any \ntime for anything. Nobody could afford it. It is a practical, hard part \nof life with which we have to deal. And we are doing a disservice to \nour constituents if we do not remind them that there are tradeoffs and \nthere is a bigger picture with which you have to deal.\n  Here is where we are going. We are getting down to the fact that, as \nI said, we have in some cases a dispute as to whether or not something \nis medically called for. What this bill does, and what this resolution \nsupplements, is that it says when you have a situation such as that, \nlet's set up an independent person, an independent entity. In the bill \nit is called a qualified external review entity. It is external because \nit is not a part of any employer's process; it is not a part of the \nemployer's deal. The employers do not control this.\n  The bill takes several pages setting up, I think very skillfully, an \nindependent entity that is highly qualified, that is very independent, \nthat is monitored by the Federal Government to make sure they take a \nlook at that issue to see whether or not there is coverage on an \nindividual incident.\n  Once again, if you were going to say on the front end everybody who \nneeds coverage has to be covered, regardless of whether or not it is in \nthe insurance policy or anything else, you would not need this external \nreview and your premiums would go through the ceiling and everybody \nwould be calling for nationalizing the health care system in this \ncountry. But we are not doing that.\n  This bill calls for this external review process. That entity \ndetermines whether or not this is a medically reviewable decision or \nnot. That entity determines whether or not there is coverage. If that \nentity decides that it is a medically reviewable matter, there is \ncoverage, it goes to another independent level. And this bill sets up \nan independent medical review. This first reviewer doesn't have to be a \ndoctor, necessarily. But on the second review it has to be a doctor. He \nis independent. He has nothing to do with the employer. He is \nqualified. He is supervised and overseen by the Federal Government. He \ntakes a look at it and he makes a decision.\n  So far so good. Again, this is a reasonable response to these sad, \nsad stories that we know people tell and we all hear about from time to \ntime. If you are not going to say: Cover everything all the time and we \nare going to, depending on how sick a person is, determine coverage--if \nyou are not going to do that, you have to have some way of reasonably \nand fairly deciding what is right. This bill sets up two levels of \nindependent review. I think that is an appropriate way to balance the \nneed to cover people for what they contract for, for what coverage is \nfor--for which you are paying a premium commensurate with the coverage, \non the one hand, and a need to make sure there is at the end of the day \nsome coverage that is affordable for somebody so we do not add to the \n40 million people who have no insurance at all.\n\n  So far, so good.\n  The problem I have is not with the bill I just described. The problem \nI have is not with this resolution which reinforces the idea that we \nneed independent review. The problem I have is that you can go through \nthat entire process and, if a claimant is turned down, they can ignore \nthat entire process and still sue in State court, they can still sue in \nFederal court, and they can still sue in any jurisdiction where the \ndefendant has a place of business or is doing business for unlimited \ndamages. They can still sue an employer who gave them the insurance.\n  That is what I have trouble with--not that we are setting up an \nindependent review process. It is that we are not honoring the \nindependent review process. We are saying we are going to set it up. \nBut if it turns out one way, we are going to adhere to it. If the \nclaimant wins, then it is binding on the employer. But if these \nindependent entities decide that the claimant does not win, because it \nis one of those 99 percent deals, and it is an experimental thing: we \njust do not cover that; our heart goes out to you, but you just didn't \npay for that much--if they decide that, then it is as if all of that \nindependent stuff doesn't count. Here is where the lawsuits start.\n  That is the problem I have with this bill.\n  We must recognize that there are tradeoffs for everything we do in \nthis field. It is easy to give new rights, and establish new rights, \neither out of the Treasury of the Federal Government or making some \ncompany pay for something else. But it has an effect on people's \nconduct. People do not just sit still. If you triple somebody's taxes, \nit is going to affect their behavior. If you cut their taxes in half, \nit is going to affect their behavior. If you place new liabilities \non employers--some of them are small employers trying to furnish decent \nhealth care packages to their employees--they do not have to. But if \nyou make things tough enough on them, they are just going to say: We \nare either going to drop coverage or we are going to give you some \nmoney. You go get your own health insurance and I don't have any \nliability. And that employee may or may not take that money and buy \nhealth insurance; he can do whatever he wants to with it.\n\n  What we do affects people's behavior. It is not enough to talk about \nsad story after sad story and say that is fact. We all agree to that. \nAll of us are looking for a way to balance the approach so people can \nbe properly covered to the extent possible where folks can still afford \ncoverage in this country. Health care prices are already going up at \ndouble-digit rates before this bill is passed. If we make the lawsuit \nliability so great that people can't afford coverage, it is going to go \nup even higher.\n  We already have 40 million people in this country who have no \ninsurance at all. Our job is to try to come up with a balanced approach \nso that we don't add to those 40 million people. We can't just sit out \nhere and talk about one sad story after another without considering the \neffect of the public policy we are putting into place.\n  We had before this body, before I got here, when President Clinton \nwas President, the Clinton health care plan. It had noble motives, too. \nWe heard about people who needed help and needed coverage, and so \nforth, at\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nthat time. The whole Nation did. This body considered that bill. This \nbody decided not to go in that direction because in many people's minds \nit was a nationalizing of our health care system; that as much as we \nhave instances sometimes where things fall through the cracks, on the \nwhole, people do not fly to England in order to get their medical \ncoverage. The rich people of the world fly here. We have the best \noverall medical system in the world. We didn't want to nationalize our \nhealth care system. We turned that down. It wasn't because our heart \ndidn't go out. It wasn't because there were some pitiful stories out \nthere where people needed more help than they were getting. But it was, \non balance, because we didn't believe it would be good for those same \npeople if we nationalized our health care system.\n  I do not know if we have changed our minds about that or not. I don't \nthink so. But that is what we are doing here with this bill the way it \nis now drafted. We are nationalizing our health care system in a \nsignificant respect by other means. We are doing it by an unfunded \nmandate on corporations. The Government is not sending people checks \nfor their health care, but they are requiring other people to. We can't \nthink we can do things such as that without having an effect on \npeople's conduct.\n  Health care costs got out of hand in this country. We responded with \na managed care response to it and tried to make that balance to provide \nenough care that would cover people in most cases but would not be so \ncostly that it would drive people out of the system. It didn't always \nwork. There were some excesses. Some of these HMOs did some bad things. \nStates got into the act. My State of Tennessee covers more things than \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill does in many respects--it is not as if the \nStates are not addressing these issues--and in response to that, health \ncare costs went back up a little bit. We can live with that. But now we \nare coming along and laying a whole new Federal layer on top of that, \ndouble-digit increases in health care costs being present today. And \nwe have no idea what that is going to do to costs when we are saying we \nare going from a system where there is no redress, right past the \nsystem of independent review, which would be a major beneficial change \nwhere independent doctors would be deciding the right to unlimited \nlawsuits.\n\n  We have no idea what that is going to mean to the cost of health care \nin this country. If we think employers are going to sit still for that, \nthat small employers are not going to change their conduct, that prices \nare going to remain the same and that these HMOs are not going to \nprotect themselves in terms of price increases to cover their new \nexposure, we are fooling ourselves.\n  I am not saying we shouldn't respond to current circumstances. I am \njust saying we are hearing too much of this side of the story and \nnothing about the other. We are doing the American people a disservice. \nIt doesn't take a lot for Members of this body to grant new rights and \nextend our sympathy. Sometimes it takes a little more to say that is a \nrelevant part of this discussion. But let's talk about the effects of \nwhat we are about to do.\n  I hope we don't have this debate 2 years from now and we have these \nsame sad stories coming in about my problem wasn't that we got into a \ndispute over coverage and they were not covering it, but they cut me \noff. My problem was I didn't have insurance to start with because my \nemployer couldn't afford it.\n  I commend the Senator for offering the sense of the Senate. I think \nthese independent entities ought to be strong. We have set them up now \nin this bill. My problem is we don't use them. They can be circumvented \nwithout exhausting the administrative remedies. It goes straight to \ncourt. Or we can go through and use them, but if you get an adverse \ndecision and the best independent minds look at this and say, sorry, \nbut there is no coverage, it doesn't matter; it is as if they didn't \nexist. You can then begin a whole realm of lawsuits against HMOs, \nagainst employers in some cases, and even against these independent \nentities that have made the determination. Both the external reviewer \nand the doctor can be sued because they decided against coverage.\n  There is in this bill a higher threshold of proof against them to \nprove they are guilty of gross misconduct. But when we use these \nindependent entities that we are bragging about and we are talking \nabout how strong and important they are, let's use them. Let's not just \nuse them as a starting place and a debating point and go through a year \nor two of that and a decision that everybody admits was objective and \nuntainted, and then totally treat it as if it didn't exist because we \nwant to open the door to unlimited lawsuits for unlimited amounts for \neverybody in sight. That is not helping those poor people. That is not \ngoing to help those poor people who need medical attention and medical \ncoverage.\n  They have exempted doctors and lawyers. A lot of doctors support the \nbill because when they get sued, they want the HMO also to be right \nthere beside them. I understand how that works. So the doctors support \nthem. The doctors were exempted. The doctors are exempted in this bill, \nand so are the hospitals. People who are giving the health care have \nbeen exempted. But the people who are furnishing the health care, the \nemployers, have not been exempted. It doesn't seem right to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I know there are a lot of folks who want to go home \nabout now. I have listened to this debate on the television with a \ngreat deal of interest. We have heard all kinds of examples of bad \nthings that can happen to people. Of course, we could talk about those \nkinds of things in any field because there are certain circumstances \nwhere you could sometimes find victims of circumstance and sometimes \nfind victims of greed.\n  We have also heard that our health care system is very complicated. I \nwill tell you, I do not think our system is complicated. I think we are \nmoving a piece of legislation that is going to complicate it.\n  Since the introduction of Medicare and Medicaid, it has grown more \ncomplicated all the time. If one thinks HMOs are hard to deal with, I \nam wondering if anybody has had the opportunity to deal with HCFA \nlately. Just try to get some things done for an elderly mother or \nfather. I do not see anything in the three proposals right now that \ndeals with the real and perceived problems with private insurance plans \nor HMOs.\n  We have advertising that is on every radio station in this town. They \nhave lots of facts, some of which are a little misleading. Patients' \nrights are assured to those who are covered by HMOs and insurance plans \nnow, but it seems to me where the dispute begins is either the insured \ndid not understand what he or she was buying or what the specific \ncoverages were to which they thought they are entitled.\n  I am not going to stand here and defend the HMOs or the insurance \ncompanies, but what has happened to the industry is making them more \ncautious about the kinds of contracts they issue. And again, with the \nconsumer, as in all areas of the American way, the buyer has to be \nconcerned. It has always been that way. But as plans were gamed and \nabused, insurance companies and HMOs became more precise in the \noffering of their coverages; in other words, the fine print became even \nfiner and smaller. Patients have rights, but not for compensation for \nspecific health care problems that are clearly exempted from coverage.\n  So what I am saying is, when you are buying something, buyer beware. \nAgain, with regard to this problem of companies being driven to that \nkind of a situation, how far they can go, and how far they will go, we \ndo not know. We do not know how much they can stand.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights is nothing new for me. In 1994, along with \nmy distinguished colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, we had a \nPatient Protection Act. The goal of that bill was to assure fairness \nand choice to patients and providers under managed care health benefit \nplans.\n  I still believe it is essential we ensure that managed care \ntechniques and procedures protect patients and guarantee the integrity \nof the patient-physician\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nrelationship. Let me repeat that. We have to guarantee that the \nintegrity of the relationship between the physician and the patient is \nprotected.\n  I am not without a physician in my family, and we talk quite \nfrequently of these and other issues related to the Patients' Bill of \nRights and the problems she faces as she attempts to administer quality \nand necessary medical care to her patients. It is an area in which I am \nparticularly interested.\n  I believe all Americans should have access to quality, affordable \nhealth care and to be able to select the health care plans of their \nchoice. I support legislation that requires HMOs to be more responsive \nand accountable to their patients. We must ensure choice, quality, and \naccess at all times.\n  I think it is fair to state we have reached general agreement over \nmany of the consumer protection aspects of all three of these bills \nthat have been presented to the Senate.\n  Doctors must be able to discuss the full range of treatment options \nto their patients. I continue to believe that gag clauses in health \ncare provider contracts attack the heart of the doctor-patient \nrelationship, and they eat into the most important factor in the \nhealing process, and that is trust.\n  In addition, customers should be fully informed about the financial \narrangements, if any, between their doctors and the insurers. Patients \nin need of emergency care must be free to go to the emergency room to \nreceive the care they need, uninhibited.\n  Customers must be fully informed about the costs and limits of the \ncoverage they buy, they should have complete information about \ntreatment options, a complete list of the benefits and costs of each \nplan, a full choice of doctors, and access to specialists.\n  Finally, patients who are denied care, or receive word that their \nplan will not pay, must have a right--and they have the right--to a \nfair, binding, and timely appeals process.\n  A great deal of debate has and will likely continue to center around \nthis appeals process and how it is structured and having access to the \ncourts. I believe access to the courts should be the last resort. First \nwe should structure a fair, timely, credible, and independent appeals \nprocess.\n  Independent, qualified reviewers should be able to draw upon the \nbroadest and best possible medical guidelines when determining the care \npatients need that is covered under the contract. Physicians should be \nable to set the timeframe within which the treatment should be \nprovided. When this process fails or is exhausted, then we should turn \nto the courts. In the cases where an HMO defies an order of the \nindependent reviewers to provide a benefit--or acts in bad faith to \ndelay making the necessary treatment available--I believe the HMO \nshould be held liable. After all, no American should be denied access \nto our court and justice system, as it is a constitutional right.\n  On the other hand, we cannot let the practice of medicine be governed \nby the fear of lawsuits and, of course, trial lawyers. This will surely \nadd to the cost of care. I am afraid that as the cost of obtaining care \nincreases, so too will the number of uninsured. That is what I have \nheard most in my State of Montana. That is a price that no one can \nafford, especially small business. We do not have big companies in the \nState of Montana. We are a State with a lot of small businesses. Those \nemployers are telling us to be very careful of the action we are \ntaking.\n  Any bill that passes this Congress cannot contain provisions which \nwould make the employers liable when they have nothing to do with the \ndecision made by their provider of medical coverage. I will tell you, \ntrial lawyers are very imaginative. When they sue, no one is exempt. So \nour language has to be specific. I was struck that even though it has \nbeen shown in this Chamber that the legislation we are considering has \nthat concern--where they say it doesn't say one thing, but there it is \nin black and white--nobody has offered to change it and make it \npalatable to either side.\n  Any such provision is extremely dangerous for any employer, whether \nit be a small Montana business with two employees or a larger employer \nsuch as a hospital or doctor's office or clinic.\n  There are many native people who do not understand how imaginatively \nand broadly trial lawyers can interpret statutory provisions to include \nbusinesses as defendants in lawsuits when it was not the intention of \nthe drafters of this legislation. To be very specific, I want to make \nsure that the innocent small businesses that are trying to provide much \nneeded health care for their employees do not find themselves in court \nfor their good intentions. I have always heard the old saying that no \ngood deed shall go unpunished.\n  Twenty percent of Montanans currently lack health coverage. I don't \nwant to see that number rise either. We cannot add to that number. I \ncannot support provisions which would threaten to do so. As a practical \nmatter, it seems unreasonable to potentially give one or two people and \ntheir lawyers millions of dollars in punitive damages and as a \nconsequence destroy thousands the ability to obtain health insurance \ncoverage. It just doesn't make a lot of sense.\n  For many the greatest obstacle we face in health care today in this \ncountry is the cost of insurance, It is not that we don't want it; we \ncan't afford it. What is driving those costs? It is not the person who \ntries to take care of themselves. It is the coverage of some extraneous \nprograms or plans that drives the cost.\n  Since way back in 1993 and 1994, we have been talking about health \ncare. We want three things when it comes to health care in this \ncountry: We want top quality, which we have; we want it fast; we want \nit low cost. If one would think just for a little bit, we can only have \ntwo of the three.\n  I believe we ought to start looking at the best way we can control \ncosts and make health care more accessible and affordable to those who \nneed it.\n  My primary and overriding concern is that any Patients' Bill of \nRights is indeed in the best interest of all my folks in Montana and \nall Americans. I am deeply concerned about those thousands of hard-\nworking folks who are self-employed or employed by small businesses \nthroughout my wonderful State. These people desperately need our \nprotection. I do not want to act in haste or irresponsibly, \njeopardizing their present health coverage by higher premium costs.\n  I, therefore, will support a bill that will assure the maximum \npatient protection to all and ensure that patients get the health care \nthey need when they need it.\n  I absolutely agree that a real Patients' Bill of Rights needs to be \nenacted as soon as possible. These are complex issues. We have come a \nlong way. I am confident we will be able to arrive at a fair and \nreasonable bill in the very near future.\n  We have to look at just exactly what we can do because in this piece \nof legislation, there could be and probably will be some unintended \nconsequences, as there always is when we pass major legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have heard a number of statements over \nthe past week about what is wrong with this legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate.\n  One of the arguments that has been made is that the real purpose \nbehind this legislation is to create socialized medicine in America, \nthat that is the whole purpose. That is why this bipartisan bill was \nintroduced, so that we would have socialized medicine in America. The \npurpose was to drive all the employers out of insuring their employees.\n  That argument didn't last very long because it was so fallacious on \nits face.\n  Then there was a statement that this was all about lawyers, that \nthere would be thousands of new lawsuits. Well, we looked at a couple \nof States where they have something comparable to what we want to pass.\n  Senator Miller from Georgia came to the floor and said: I don't know \nwhat they are talking about. In Georgia, since we have had a Patients' \nBill of Rights, there has not been a single lawsuit filed.\n  In Texas the law has been in effect for over 4 years, even though \nGovernor Bush--now President Bush--vetoed that. In 4 years there have \nbeen 17 lawsuits. So they dropped that debate. I will no longer debate \nthat issue.\n  Then they spent some time on States rights: What was being attempted \nin this bipartisan legislation is to take\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\naway the rights of States to settle their own problems. Example after \nexample was brought to the attention of the Senate that was simply not \ntrue, but they wouldn't let up on that. They said: Well, we think all \nlawsuits in this matter should be filed in Federal court.\n  We knew that wasn't the right way to go because people should be able \nto go to court in the place where they live. Again, Senator Miller from \nGeorgia laid that out very clearly. Why should someone have to travel \nhundreds and hundreds of miles to file a lawsuit when they can do it in \ntheir own community?\n  Senator Zell Miller of Georgia really put this debate on the right \ntrack. After Senator Miller spoke, they dropped that ``let's use the \nFederal court for all of our litigation.''\n  This boils down to a very simple proposition. Why should HMOs be \ntreated differently than anyone else in America except foreign \ndiplomats? As a result of our Constitution, foreign diplomats cannot be \nsued. HMOs are not in our Constitution. They should be treated no \ndifferently than anyone else. Why in America should there be the \nabnormal situation that the only people who can't be sued are foreign \ndiplomats and HMOs?\n  There are a number of suggestions floating around here. In fact, one \nof the sponsors, Senator Frist of Tennessee, said:\n\n       The Patients' Bill of Rights leans toward protecting trial \n     lawyers, not toward protecting patients.\n\n  President Bush said, when he was running for President:\n\n       If I am the President, people will be able to take their \n     HMO insurance company to court.\n\n  He said this on October 17 of last year.\n  Fact: As a candidate George Bush promised voters their insurance \ncompanies would be held accountable.\n  Fact: George Bush took credit for a law that allowed Texans to sue \ntheir insurance companies in State court even through he vetoed that. \nNow his administration is saying that holding HMOs accountable in State \ncourt is a terrible idea. He can't have it both ways.\n  Another of the fixes on this legislation that is being passed around, \nagain, by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist: ``You sue employers \nunder this bill.''\n  What the President has said in February of this year: ``Only \nemployers who retain responsibility for and make final medical \ndecisions shall be subject to suit.''\n  That sounds reasonable. That is what the McCain-Edwards bill does.\n  Fact: The McCain-Edwards legislation does not authorize a cause of \naction against an employer. In short, employers are protected from \nlawsuits relating to harm caused by an insurance company.\n  Another fix, again by the Senator who is sponsoring the other bill, \nMr. Frist. His statement: ``Their bill will drive people to the ranks \nof the uninsured.''\n  That is the socialized medicine argument. Here is what the Census \nBureau said: ``After Texas enacted a patients right law, the number of \nuninsured in the State actually decreased.''\n  This is the U.S. Census Bureau.\n  Fact: 2 years after the State of Texas gave Texans the right to sue \nHMOs in State court, the ranks of the uninsured in the State of Texas \nactually decreased.\n  George W. Bush, in October of 2000:\n\n       I support a National Patients' Bill of Rights and I want \n     all people covered.\n\n  One of the fictions stated here by my colleague, the Republican whip, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, was:\n\n       The United States will be considering a bill which could \n     preempt some of the good work States have done in the States \n     to protect patients.\n\n  That is fiction. Here are the facts: The McCain-Edwards legislation \nprovides a Federal floor for patient protections, not a ceiling. \nStronger unrelated patient protections enacted by the States would \nremain untouched by this bill.\n  The other argument they have used--and I touched on this before--is \nthat this is so expensive and how could you possibly ask people to pay \nfor this exorbitant cost that is going to be created by this \nlegislation? The Congressional Budget Office says:\n\n       Real patient protection costs about 37 cents more than the \n     GOP-backed Frist legislation.\n\n  Not hundreds of thousands or millions or billions but 37 cents.\n  Senator Frist:\n\n       We know this is going to drive up the cost of health care \n     premiums.\n\n  He is right, 37 cents. But last year--the facts are that last year \ninsurers increased premiums by an average of 8.3 percent, 10 times the \n1-year cost of this legislation. So it is no wonder that 85 percent of \nthe American public support the Patients' Bill of rights. That is why \nin a movie--when you hear HMO in a movie, people sneer and shout out in \nderision.\n  The Patients' Bill of rights is something we must do. The majority \nleader has said we are going to finish this legislation before we have \nthe Fourth of July break. Why? Because as the Senator from North \nCarolina indicated, every day that goes by, there is more grief and \npain to patients and doctors because the doctors can't render the care \nthey believe is appropriate for patients. Every day we wait is a day \npeople will be harmed as a result of our not passing this legislation.\n\n  Madam President, I read into the Record hundreds of names of \norganizations that support this legislation. The time is late and I am \nnot going to do that tonight. From time to time, I am going to read the \nnames of organizations supporting this legislation. I already read in \nthe names of hundreds. I would start tonight with the D's. It would \ntake a long time because the organizations that support this \nlegislation that have the name ``family'' connected with them goes for \nfive pages.\n  Literally, our bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights is supported by \nhundreds and hundreds of organizations. I hope we--and I am confident \nthat we can as legislators, Democrats and Republicans--pass this \nlegislation soon because the sooner we do it, the better off America \nis.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6860-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I would like to call attention to the \nintroduction of S. 1091, our bipartisan legislation to update and \nexpand the Agent Orange Act of 1991.\n  These changes, and my other ongoing Agent Orange work, are \nnecessitated by our imperfect understanding of how dioxin affects the \nhuman body.\n  As many of my colleagues know, dioxin is the toxic ingredient in \nAgent Orange, 11 million gallons of which were sprayed over Vietnam \nduring the war. Dioxin ranks with plutonium as one of the most toxic \nsubstances known to man, and this country dropped more on Vietnam than \nhas ever been released into the environment, anywhere in the world. S. \n1091 is another effort, more than 25 years after the war's end, to deal \nwith the wounds of, and determine the extent of the injury to, our own \nsoldiers.\n  As an example of how our knowledge of dioxin is evolving, I would \npoint to a provision in S. 1091 that would remove all deadlines for \nveterans to claim disability benefits for respiratory cancer. This \nprovision stems from a recent report by the National Academy of \nSciences, which pointed out that there is no scientific basis for the \ndeadline contained in current law--a deadline that effectively blocks \nbenefits for a veteran whose cancer develops 30 years after Agent \nOrange exposure. The Academy finds no evidence that the risk diminishes \nwith the passage of time.\n  And as scientists learn more about Agent Orange, we must continue to \nensure that veterans benefits are updated accordingly. The current \nmechanism\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\nfor continuous updating, established in the 1991 Agent Orange Act, has \nproven to work well, but it expires soon. The two-step process begins \nwith a biennial review of new dioxin research, via a scientific panel \norganized by the National Academy of Sciences. Next, the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs must respond to the report and recommend the addition \nof new diseases and conditions as appropriate. S. 1091 would extend the \nprocess until 2012.\n  Recently, this process has brought diabetes on the Agent Orange \npresumptive disability list, which means that if a veteran was exposed \nto Agent Orange, the veteran's diabetes is presumed to be connected to \nhis or her military service. Previous Academy reports have linked Agent \nOrange exposure to serious conditions such as prostate cancer, \nrespiratory cancer, the disfiguring skin disease chloracne, soft-tissue \nsarcoma, the lymphatic system cancers known as Hodgkin's disease and \nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma, porphyria cutanea tarda, multiple myeloma, and \nsubacute peripheral neuropathy.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 1091, along with the chair and \nranking member of our Veterans' Affairs Committee. My thanks to \nSenators Rockefeller and Specter for their hard work on this measure \nand their interest in Vietnam veterans, their families, and others who \nlive with the diseases, conditions, and uncertainty created by exposure \nto dioxin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6861-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 1, \n1991 in Staten Island, New York. An attacker called 53-year-old Frank \nKovarik ``fag'' before striking him repeatedly with a baseball bat, \nbreaking his right ankle, fracturing his right leg, breaking a kneecap \nand wrist, and causing a concussion. The attacker and an accomplice \nalso stole $400 and the keys to Kovarik's car.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6861-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES DAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the vast majority of cities throughout \nour Nation are small cities, many of which are fewer than 50,000 \npeople. It is in these communities that our Nation's citizens nurture \ntheir families, develop their work ethic, cultivate their values, and \nlive with their neighbors. Millions of Americans live better lives \nbecause small cities provide services and programs that meet the needs \nof their citizens. But small cities cannot meet these needs alone.\n  Businesses, civic organizations and citizens across the Nation \ncontinue to develop partnerships in an effort to improve the quality of \nlife in their communities. The Federal Government, too, must continue \nto be a good partner by supporting important efforts, such as the COPS \nprogram, Community Development Block grants, disaster assistance and \ninfrastructure assistance, that enable small communities to become \nbetter places in which to live.\n  The National League of Cities has designated this day, June 22, 2001, \nas National Small Cities ``Investing in Communities Day'' in an effort \nto highlight the many ways in which Federal, State, and local \ngovernments work together. We must continue that work and look for ways \nto improve our communities through continued cooperative efforts.\n  I join the National League of Cities and the Small Cities Council in \nencouraging President Bush, my congressional colleagues, State \ngovernments, community organizations, businesses and citizens to \nrecognize this event, honor the efforts of ``small town America,'' and \nrenew our commitment to work together on this day and in the future to \nimprove the lives of all citizens throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6861-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DEPUTY UNITED STATES MARSHAL PETER P. HILLMAN\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen \nAmerican hero: Deputy United States Marshal Peter P. Hillman.\n  Deputy Hillman was tragically killed in the line of duty 1 year ago \nwhen the van he was driving was hit by a truck, killing Deputy Hillman \nand the three prisoners he was transporting. Deputy Hillman's defensive \ndriving actions during that terrible incident helped save the life of a \nU.S. Marshals Service guard traveling with him that afternoon.\n  The U.S. Marshals Service and Oregon experienced a great loss with \nthe death of Deputy Hillman. His 14-year U.S. Marshals Service career \nbegan in 1986 in San Jose, California. He later transferred to the \nEastern District of California in Fresno. It was there that he was \ngiven the nickname ``The Hillmanator'' for his relentless efforts in \napprehending narcotics fugitives.\n  Whether his duties entailed lending support to members of the \ncommunity in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Marilyn, \napprehending fugitives during ``Operation Sunrise,'' providing security \nat a high-threat trial in Montana or at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, \nGeorgia, he gave his all in everything he did. Deputy Hillman was a \ndedicated and courageous man with an enthusiasm for life. His name is \nnow engraved on the Marshals Service's ``Roll Call of Honor,'' along \nwith nearly 200 other dedicated and brave individuals who have set a \nstandard of excellence for all United States Marshals and Deputy \nMarshals.\n  Today is the anniversary of Deputy Hillman's death, so I would like \nto take this opportunity to express my sorrow to the family of Deputy \nMarshal Hillman. I know they miss him dearly, and I want them to know \nhe has not been forgotten.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in expressing gratitude to the \nfamily of Deputy U.S. Marshal Peter Hillman for his service to our \ncountry. Displaying valor in both his life and his work, Deputy Marshal \nHillman is a tribute to this great nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6861-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6861-S6862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN RICHARD F. WALSH, UNITED STATES NAVY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to Captain Richard F. Walsh, Judge Advocate General's Corp, \nUnited States Navy. Captain Walsh will retire from the Navy on July 1, \n2001, having completed a distinguished 30 year career of service to our \nNation.\n  Captain Walsh was born in New York City, and is a graduate of the \nUnited States Naval Academy and the University of Virginia School of \nLaw. He also earned a Master of Laws degree from the Judge Advocate \nGeneral's School of the Army.\n  During his military career, Captain Walsh excelled at all facets of \nhis chosen professions of law and naval service. As a line officer, he \nserved as Combat Information Center Officer onboard USS LUCE (DLG-7), \ncompleting two U.S. Sixth Fleet deployments, and qualifying as a \nSurface Warfare Officer.\n  As a judge advocate, Captain Walsh has served in a variety of \nchallenging assignments. As the senior litigator at Naval Legal Service \nOffice, Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, Captain Walsh \nfaithfully preserved the fairness of the military justice system. Later \nin his career, he returned to the courtroom as a member of the General \nLitigation Division, Office of Judge Advocate General, and argued many \nimportant cases in numerous Federal Circuits. As a staff judge \nadvocate, he provided legal counsel to SEABEE Commanding Officers \nstationed in Gulfport, Mississippi, and was later selected to serve as \nCounsel to the Chief of Naval Personnel. A superb manager of people and \nmission, Captain Walsh headed the JAG Corps' accession program and \nlater assumed command of Naval Legal Service Office, National Capital \nRegion, where he continued to lead and inspire young judge advocates.\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n  I am sure that many of my colleagues remember and appreciate Captain \nWalsh's service as Director of Legislation in the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs, followed by his tour of duty as Executive Director \nfor Senate Affairs under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nLegislative Affairs. During these assignments, he directly contributed \nto clear and concise communication between Congress and the Departments \nof the Navy and Defense on a broad range of legislative matters. So \nnoteworthy are his talents, knowledge, and integrity, that Captain \nWalsh has been chosen to serve on the staff of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. The Navy's loss is certainly the Senate's gain, and \nwe look forward to working with Dick Walsh for many years to come.\n  The Nation, the United States Navy, and the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps have been made better through the talent and dedication of \nCaptain Richard F. Walsh. I know all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating Dick on the completion of his outstanding military \ncareer, and we welcome him to the Senate staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6862-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. THOMPSON:\n       S. 1095.

A bill to eliminate the requirement that certain covered \nbeneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, obtain \na nonavailability-of-health-care statement with respect to obstetrics \nand gynecological care related to a pregnancy; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nSpouse Physician Choice Act of 2001. This legislation amends the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, CHAMPUS, \nto eliminate the requirement that a military dependent obtain a \nnonavailability statement, NAS, or a waiver from a commanding officer \nof a military treatment facility, in order to receive maternity care \nfrom a civilian doctor. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Landrieu \nis joining me in introducing this legislation.\n  This legislation, which is a companion to H.R. 1511, introduced in \nthe House by Representatives Jim Ryun and Susan Davis, will eliminate \nthe requirement for TRICARE Standard maternity patients to obtain \nmilitary nonavailability statements before seeing other doctors. Under \ncurrent policy, Standard patients who live within 40 miles of a \nmilitary medical facility must obtain a NAS from the facility commander \nbefore receiving pregnancy care from a civilian physician.\n  Over 53 percent of our Nation's active service personnel today are \nmarried. Maintaining a high quality of life for these men and women in \nuniform must include the best possible health care for their spouses. \nWhile the services may recruit men and women to serve in our military \nforces, the reality is that we retain families to protect our Nation. \nIt is therefore critical that all military spouses receive the health \ncare services they signed up for.\n  Currently, a military dependent has two options under the military's \nhealth care system. All military personnel and 84 percent of military \ndependents enroll in TRICARE Prime, which is the military's version of \nan HMO. Prime provides quality care, usually at a military treatment \nfacility on the post or base. However, some dependents choose to enroll \nin the military's fee-for-service plans, called TRICARE Standard and \nExtra. These dependents voluntarily accept higher copayments and \ndeductibles in return for the promise of freedom to choose their own \ndoctor.\n  Unfortunately, the promises in the enrollment brochure do not apply \nin all circumstances. Currently, a woman who chooses a civilian doctor \nthrough TRICARE Standard or Extra is forced to change doctors and \nreturn to the military treatment facility when she becomes pregnant. \nThe only way for her to continue using her own doctor is to receive \nspecial permission from the commanding officer of that military \ntreatment facility. The result is a bureaucratic nightmare.\n  This situation is a concern for military dependents across the \ncountry. It represents a break in continuity of care that compromises \nthe invaluable relationship between a woman and her doctor. A woman who \nhas a trusted relationship with her civilian ob/gyn is required to \nchange to a doctor at the military treatment facility due to an \nunnecessary regulation that can, and should, be fixed.\n  Military families deserve better treatment. Many of them consistently \npay higher premiums and accept higher out-of-pocket costs in exchange \nfor an active role in controlling their health care decisions. It \nshould not take a military order to allow a woman to stay with her \nregular doctor for prenatal, delivery and postnatal care. This is why \nSenator Landrieu and I are introducing legislation to cut through this \nburdensome red tape. The Military Spouse Physician Choice Act would \neliminate the need for women to get special permission to receive the \ncontinuity of care they were promised.\n  Over the past few years, Congress has made several positive changes \nto military health care services. We have given our military personnel \nthe ability to choose the health care option that is right for each of \ntheir families. We have enabled our military treatment facilities to \nmaintain a high level of excellence, making them the choice of most \nmilitary dependents. It only follows that a pregnant spouse should be \nable to choose to utilize that treatment facility but not be mandated \nto do so.\n  If we want to continue to recruit and retain quality people for our \narmed services, we need to show them that they and their families will \nbe treated fairly when making health care decisions.\n  I am very pleased that the Military Coalition, a consortium of \nnationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations \nrepresenting more than 5.5 million members plus their families, has \nendorsed this legislation. The Retired Officers Association, TROA, has \nas well because the current policy denies TRICARE Standard \nbeneficiaries one of the most important principles of quality health \ncare, continuity of care by a provider of their choice.\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me and Senator Landrieu in \nsupport of the Military Spouse Physician Choice Act.\n  I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Spence National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted by \n     Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-446) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, or with respect to \n     obstetrics and gynecological care related to the pregnancy of \n     such a beneficiary who is enrolled in TRICARE Extra,'' after \n     ``TRICARE Standard''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (3) as \n     subparagraphs (A) through (C), respectively;\n       (B) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(c) Exceptions.--''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of \n     obstetrics and gynecological care related to the pregnancy of \n     a covered beneficiary.''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military \nSpouse Physician Choice Act of 2001 with my distinguished colleague, \nthe junior Senator from Maine. This legislation amends the Civilian \nHealth and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, CHAMPUS, to \nrestore equity to the families of our servicemembers. Simply put, this \nbill would delete the requirement for a servicemember's spouse to \nobtain a non-availability statement from the commanding officer of the \nnearest military treatment facility in order to receive maternity care \nfrom a civilian doctor.\n  Under current legislation, military dependents choosing to enroll and \npay for TRICARE Standard, the program in which enrollees accept higher \nco-payments in exchange for the option of choosing their own doctors, \nare still required to obtain a military non-availability statement \nbefore seeing their choice of civilian physician. This practice \ncontinues despite the fact they are already paying for just that \noption. Our bill eliminates the requirement for maternity patients \nenrolled in TRICARE Standard to get that non-availability statement \nbefore being seen by the civilian physician of their choice for all \nmaternity care throughout the pregnancy.\n  I am committed to the quality of life of the men and women in uniform \nwho sacrifice to serve their Nation. All too often we forget that \nfamilies and their treatment are key to the quality of life and \nretention of those servicemenbers. Our military and their families \ndeserve better treatment than what they receive today. If they choose \nto accept the higher costs of TRICARE Standard in exchange for greater \ncontrol over their healthcare choices, then they should have that \ncontrol over all healthcare choices. Pregnancy should not force a \nspouse to get permission from the military to receive her prenatal, \ndelivery, and postnatal care from the same doctor who she paid to see \nprior to the pregnancy. Anything less is fundamentally unfair and is \nsomething none of us would accept from any medical plan in the civilian \ncommunity.\n  This body has worked hard to improve military healthcare for our \nservicemembers, their families and retirees. With the creation of \nTRICARE, we gave them control over their medical treatment by allowing \nthem to pay additional costs out of pocket in exchange for greater \nflexibility, the same choice anyone outside of the military has the \nopportunity to make. If we want to continue to recruit and retain the \nbest and brightest people our Nation has, we owe them equitable \ntreatment. Any other course is a disservice to them and disrespectful \nof the choices and financial commitments they have made to the military \nhealthcare system. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a \nmessage to our military: You and your families will be treated fairly \nand with respect when making healthcare decisions. The Military \nCoalition representing more than 5.5 million servicemembers and their \nfamilies supports this legislation. So does The Retired Officers' \nAssociation, TROA. Fellow members of the Senate, support of this bill \nshould be common sense for all of us. This bill should pass unanimously \nbecause it does what is right, what is fair, and keeps faith with our \nmilitary.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this legislation with Senator Collins and \nurge all of you to join us in supporting the Military Spouse Physician \nChoice Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 1097.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 116, submitted \nearlier by Senators Voinovich and Biden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 116) congratulating the Republic of \n     Slovenia on its tenth anniversary of independence.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the people \nand Republic of Slovenia on their tenth anniversary of independence. It \nis a privilege to join my Republican colleague, Senator George \nVoinovich, as an original cosponsor of the legislation he introduced \ntoday to pay tribute to the remarkable transformation of Slovenia into \na free, democratic state during the past decade.\n  Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the break-up of the former \nYugoslavia, no country in either Southern or Eastern Europe has made \ngreater and faster progress in embracing human rights, the rule of law, \nopen markets, and democratic governance.\n  At the same time, Slovenia has demonstrated both the readiness and \nthe capacity to become a regional leader in pursuit of peace and \nstability that has long suffered from ethnic divisiveness, turmoil, and \nbloodshed. Let me cite just one example. Slovenia took the initiative a \nfew years ago to establish the International Trust Fund for De-Mining, \nITF, which has become the leading organization to rid the Balkans of \nlandmines and to rehabilitate the victims of these deadly weapons. In \nso doing, it is the Slovenians who deserve the credit for securing \ncontributions from the U.S. and eighteen other Nations as well as many \nprivate donors to meet this urgent humanitarian challenge. I am hopeful \nthat this Congress will authorize and appropriate a second U.S. \ncontribution to help sustain the outstanding work of the ITF this year \nand beyond.\n  Slovenia has also become an active member of various international \norganizations, including the United Nations, the World Trade \nOrganization, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe. Therefore, it is not surprising that \nPresident Bush and Russian President Putin held their first summit \nmeeting earlier this month in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia.\n  I salute the remarkable courage of the Slovenian people in achieving \ntheir quest for free and democratic government as well as their \nentrepreneurial drive in building a vibrant, growing national economy \nin such a short span of time. Accordingly, the U.S. and our NATO allies \nshould move forthwith to extend a formal invitation for Slovenia to \nbecome a full-fledged NATO member within the next 12-18 months.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, today, I am joined by Senators Biden, \nDeWine, and Harkin in congratulating the Republic of Slovenia on its \ntenth anniversary of independence.\n  Ten years ago today, on June 25, 1991, the Republic of Slovenia \ndeclared itself an independent and sovereign Nation. Since that time, \nSlovenia has remained a model of reform and progress in Central and \nEastern Europe, working to promote democratic ideals, respect for human \nrights and the rule of law, and the merits of free market economic \nsystems.\n  Slovenia has made great strides in its work to join the NATO Alliance \nand the European Union. In addition to its outstanding human rights \nrecord and commitment to the democratic process, the people of Slovenia \nenjoy the highest per capita gross domestic product in the region, and \nthe country's economy continues to grow. Slovenia has also demonstrated \nits ability to contribute to international peacekeeping operations, \nincluding NATO's Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well \nas NATO's force in Kosovo, among others. Given its record in these \nregards, I believe the Republic of Slovenia stands as a strong \ncandidate for NATO membership when the Alliance considers enlargement \nin Prague in November 2002.\n  Slovenia's progress extends beyond domestic reform and foreign policy \ngoals. In Southeast Europe, a part of the world that continues to feel \nthe burden of decades of war and ethnic strife, Slovenia continues to \nserve as a leader in efforts to remove destructive land mines in the \nregion. The International Trust Fund for Demining, ITF, established by \nthe Slovenian government in 1998, has undertaken more than 200 projects \nin the Balkans since its creation. As a result, more than 12 million \nsquare meters of land have been cleared throughout Albania, Croatia, \nBosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. In addition, the ITF Mine Victims' \nAssistance program has helped more than 500 people in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina who have been injured by land mines. Congress provided \nmatching funds to assist the International Trust Fund for Demining in \n1998, and this year the United States will again consider funding for \nthis important initiative.\n  As the Republic of Slovenia has made considerable and important \nprogress during its 10 years of independence, working to promote peace, \nstability and prosperity in Central and Eastern Europe, I am pleased to \nhave the opportunity to submit this resolution on the occasion of \nSlovenia's 10th anniversary of independence. I congratulate the people \nof Slovenia on their accomplishments thus far, and I urge them to \ncontinue their significant work to advance the ideals of democracy, \nhuman rights, the rule of law and free market economies throughout the \nBalkans region.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and finally, that any statements \nrelating to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The text of S. Res. 116 is located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Submitted Resolutions''.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/25/senate-section/article/S6866-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 26, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
