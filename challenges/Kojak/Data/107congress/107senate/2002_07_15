Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about an\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\nimportant issue specifically to Wyoming, the Yellowstone National Park. \nIn a broader sense, it is an issue that affects all kinds of parks and \nFederal public lands. It has to do with the question of access to these \nlands. Particularly, I am very interested in national parks, having \ngrown up just outside of Yellowstone. I served as chairman of the \nNational Parks Subcommittee for a long time. So I am very interested in \nparks.\n  We are in the process of working on an issue that I think has broader \nimplications. It is the ability to use snow machines to see Yellowstone \nNational Park in the wintertime. It is something that has been done, of \ncourse, for a number of years, and certainly there have to be changes \nthat take place with use, and, as people are involved, unfortunately, \nthose changes have not taken place as much as they should. Now we find \nourselves in a dilemma with efforts made to eliminate the opportunity \nfor people to use these machines in the wintertime.\n  As I mentioned, I think the purpose of the park is to maintain the \nresource, and all of us would agree to that. It is one of the national \ntreasures that we have. We spend a lot of time here on parks--to \nestablish new parks, and so on.\n  The second purpose of having a park, of course, in addition to saving \nthe resource, is to give the opportunity for the park's owners to enjoy \nit--the people of America. And of course it needs to be done in an \norderly way so there is not a problem with destroying those resources.\n  As I mentioned, snow machines in Yellowstone Park have been used for \na good numbers of years. They are limited to the roads that are \nprepared for snow machining. You cannot go off the road; you stay on \nthose roads. That has been the rule through the years. They enter, \nbasically, in three of the entryways that come into Yellowstone Park, \nwhich is fewer than there are in the summer.\n  Of course, the wildlife remains in the park in the winter, for a good \npart of the time at least, and so one of the problems or complaints has \nbeen that the idea of preparing the roads for the use by snow machines \nprovides an exit for the buffalo, and they go into Montana. There are \nconcerns about brucellosis, and so on, and they don't like to have that \nhappen.\n  The fact is that the roads are going to be prepared for use, whether \nvisitors can use them or others, because they have to be used by the \nrangers and the people who are in the park.\n  In any event, this issue kind of came to a head about 2, 3 years ago \nwhen the Clinton administration had prepared a regulation that there \nwould be no more use of snow machines in the wintertime. Well, many of \nus do not agree with that. We think there can be ways in which snow \nmachines can be managed so that they can be changed if they need to be, \nthat would take away the problems of that exit, and rather than to \neliminate them, we think there ought to be a way to change them.\n  Indeed, during the course of this time, there have been a number of \nchanges being made, partly by the manufacturers. Of course, there can \nbe a regulation and a standard as to how the machines would be allowed \nto reduce emissions they have had in the past. They would also reduce \nthe noise, which has been something people have been concerned about.\n  So we are prepared--and the manufacturers are prepared--to go into \nthe market with machines, probably four-cycle engines rather than two, \nthat would change both the emissions and the noise.\n  As this went on, of course, as the Clinton administration pushed \ntheir regulation, there were lawsuits brought. Then there was a change \nin the administration. The original EIS that was done was extended, and \nwe took action in the Congress to extend the use period for another \ncouple of years, and another supplemental EIS was held so there could \nbe some additional alternatives.\n  The alternatives, of course, could be: Continue as it is now; \neliminate it entirely; allow for coaches rather than individual snow \nmachines; or change the rule so there could be some combination of the \ntwo.\n  The time is down now pretty close to where there should be, in this \nmonth, as a matter of fact, a reestablishment of the options that would \nbe available, any favored option by the administration.\n  I met recently with the superintendents of the two parks, both the \nGrand Teton and Yellowstone, and they are prepared to do that. I think \nthey are prepared to favor the option that would allow for the changes \nto be made in the machines and also for additional noise, but they \ncould potentially have limitations on the numbers that could travel.\n  It is kind of interesting because those who oppose it, of course, do \nnot want to include any machines, regardless of the situation. There \nare now machines that have less emissions than an automobile. There are \nonly about 600,000 of these machines and 1.6 million cars in the \nsummer, so it is quite hard to figure out how they are going to do \nextensive damage.\n  As I mentioned, there was a lawsuit. The snowmobile manufacturers, \nthe State of Wyoming, and others brought a suit over the ban last \nsummer. The settlement was agreed to. It called for a supplemental EIS, \nwhich I mentioned, which now has been done, and it called for some \nreasonable and commonsense resolutions and changes to the debate.\n  The public process has been open. There have been lots of responses. \nBecause the environmentalists organized it, they had more people \nagainst it send in a card than those who were for it, but those who \nreally took time to examine the issue and come up with alternatives, \nthat was pretty evenly divided between those who want to continue and \nthose who do not.\n  We are down now to making some decisions, and I think that is what we \nought to do, and we are in this process.\n  I am disappointed that since then, a bill has been introduced in the \nSenate to eliminate snow machines in the park. It seems to me that is \nentirely inappropriate when we go through this whole process that has \nbeen laid out where people can be involved in this decision, and then \nsuddenly we decide we are going to make the decision here. I hope that \nis not the case. I think we have had, as I said, an opportunity, and we \ncan continue to talk about it and we ought to certainly let that \nprocess work its way through, which I think it will.\n\n  Everyone is for the protection of our parks. We all want to do that, \nand we can do that. We have had this sort of a problem in public lands, \nwhere you have to get a balance between usefulness and protection, and \nwe can do that.\n  We are into another thing now on limiting roads in the forests. \nObviously, there ought to be some limitation, but there also has to be \naccess. It is not only access to people who want to hunt or do those \nkinds of things. I have received lots of communications from veterans, \nfor instance, who say: Gosh, I cannot hike 5 or 10 miles to get there.\n  So we have to find a balance, and this is one of the areas in which a \nbalance is necessary--not the only one. But I am saying that our \nresources of public lands and public uses also have to have access for \na number of reasons. It also is an economic issue for people who live \naround the parks, as we do in Wyoming. So we hope we can go ahead with \nthis and that the administration will continue to pursue the idea of \nhaving a resolution that provides for management, provides for \nprotection, but provides people an avenue to still continue to enjoy \nthe park.\n  I thought it was kind of interesting that one of the complaints about \nthe noise--and I understand that--is people who go there do not want to \nhave noise in the wintertime. Well, there is nobody there unless they \ngo on machines because there is no place they can go without them. It \nis too far away. I wanted to raise that point. I feel very strongly \nabout it, of course, as do many of us.\n  We certainly hope we can go on through this process and end up with \nan alternative that allows for the use of visitors to Yellowstone Park \nin the winter. It is a beautiful place. When one goes up there by Old \nFaithful and goes up the river, talk about the wildlife. One of the \nthings that is sort of interesting is you drive along and if you want \nto stop, there is a buffalo right alongside the road in about 2 or 3 \nfeet of snow, and they move right along in this little place pushing \nthe snow out of the way so they can eat what is left\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nof the grass below. They are not concerned whether someone is there \nwith a snow machine.\n  I see my friend from Alaska is present to speak, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6731-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6731-S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGAL SYSTEM REFORM\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to indicate my concern about the \nrecent ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in regard to the \nrecitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in school as unconstitutional, \nnoting its reference to ``one nation under God.''\n  I think we were all a bit surprised at that particular ruling. \nPerhaps for more years than I care to acknowledge, I have witnessed one \nbizarre decision after another arising from what I consider a very \ntroubled court. During that time, a number of us in the Senate have \nworked to bring about fundamental reform in our legal system, including \na wholesale restructuring of the Ninth Circuit.\n  I quote from the court's decision on the pledge, and this was Judge \nAlfred T. Goodwin who wrote:\n\n       A profession that we are a nation ``under God'' is \n     identical, for establishment clause purposes, to a profession \n     that we are a nation under Jesus, a nation under Vishnu, a \n     nation under Zeus, or a nation under no god, because none of \n     these professions can be neutral without respect to religion.\n\n  I find that troubling because it is totally inconsistent. It tries to \nestablish a parallel that there is virtually no difference whether we \nare under Zeus, under Vishnu, or under no god because, as is stated in \nthe opinion, none of these professions can be neutral with respect to \nreligion. This is a type of extremism carried out by individuals who \nwant to eradicate any reference to religion in public life. It is \nclearly wrong. I am confident this ruling will be overturned. After \nall, it is quite common for a ruling from the Ninth Circuit to be \noverturned.\n\n  It is fair to take a few minutes and look at the record of the Ninth \nCircuit. Part of the problem is the Ninth Circuit is simply too large. \nIt extends from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border and spans the \ntropics from Hawaii, Guam, the Marianna Islands, the International Date \nLine, back to Montana and encompasses some 14 million square miles. It \nis the largest circuit by any measure. It is larger than the First, \nSecond, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \ncombined.\n  For these reasons and more, I am going to be introducing legislation \nin the balance of this Congress to split the Ninth Circuit. I will now \nbe offering an amendment to all legislation for the remainder of this \nCongress to enact this commonsense legislation until such time as I can \nget a vote. I am joined by a number of our colleagues: Senators \nStevens, Burns, Craig, Gordon Smith, Inhofe, and Crapo.\n  A little history will show this is not the first attempt to solve the \ncrisis of the Ninth Circuit. I believe the need for change, however, \nhas never been greater. The Ninth Circuit has grown so large and has \ndrifted so far from prudent legal reasoning that sweeping changes are \nin order. Congress has already recognized that the change is needed. \nBack in 1997, we commissioned a report on structural alternatives for \nthe Federal court of appeals. The commission was chaired by the former \nSupreme Court Justice, Byron R. White. They found numerous faults \nwithin the Ninth Circuit. In its conclusion, the commission recommended \nmajor reforms and a drastic reorganization of the court.\n  This legislation divides the Ninth Circuit into two independent \ncircuits. The new Ninth would contain basically California. I \nunderstand there is an interest from Nevada to stay with California. \nBasically, we propose to leave the Ninth containing California and \nperhaps Nevada. A new Twelfth Circuit would be composed of the \nfollowing: Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, \nGuam, and the Northern Marianna Islands. Immediately upon enactment, \nconcerns of the White commission would be addressed. A more cohesive, \nefficient, and predictable judicial group would emerge.\n  The circuit serves a population of more than 54 million, almost 60 \npercent more than are served by the next largest circuit. By 2010, the \nCensus Bureau estimates that the population of the Ninth Circuit will \nbe more than 63 million people. How many people does this court have to \nserve before the Congress of the United States realizes the Ninth \nCircuit is overwhelmed by its population? Congressional Members are not \nalone in advocating a split.\n  In 1973, a congressional commission on the revision of Federal Court \nAppellate System Commission, commonly known as the Hruska Commission, \nrecommended the Ninth Circuit be divided. Also that year, the American \nBar Association adopted a resolution in support of the split. In 1990, \nthe U.S. Department of Justice endorsed legislation to split the Ninth \nCircuit in a surprising reversal of the official ``no position'' \napproach it had previously assumed. That is significant in relationship \nto a fair evaluation based on facts in the White commission on the need \nfor splitting the court.\n  In 1995, a bill was reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee to \ngo ahead and split the Ninth Circuit. There were objections. Most of \nthose objections came from California and were simply based on the \ntheoretical concept that California has been the headquarters of the \nNinth, and there is a certain amount of prestige associated with having \nthe largest court, so it is quite natural that there should be such a \nresponse from California. But it was not necessarily based on what is \ngood for justice.\n\n  Supreme Court Justice Kennedy, a former member of the Ninth Circuit \nfor 12 years, testified before a Senate Appropriations Committee and \nstated he has increasing doubts about the wisdom of retaining the \ncircuit's current size.\n  Arguments in support of a divided Ninth Circuit are both qualitative \nand quantitative. The magnitude of cases filing in the Ninth Circuit \ncreates a slow and cumbersome docket. In 2001, the caseload of the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals was 10,342 filings.\n  I refer now to a chart which shows the filings of the court relative \nto the Ninth Circuit. We have the various circuits: The First, Second, \nThird, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and \nEleventh Circuits. The Ninth has a population of 54 million; the \ncaseload is 10,000 filings. The nearest would be the Eleventh Circuit. \nClearly, the workload is significant in this court.\n  I refer you now to chart 2, which shows the current size of the \ncourt. This gives a better understanding showing the makeup of the \nNinth Circuit covering Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, \nCalifornia, Nevada, and Arizona. It covers a population of 54 million. \nThe caseload is 10,000 cases. The Ninth Circuit area is 1.4 million \nsquare miles.\n  It is interesting to reflect on the east coast. On the east coast, we \nhave Maine, the eastern States, with their own court in red on the \nchart in the First Circuit. The green is the Second District. Third is \nin the raspberry color. The Fourth Circuit includes the Carolinas. We \nhave five circuit courts covering a significant population. Clearly, \nthis chart points out the difference between the size of the area of \nthe Ninth and the caseload.\n  I will quote from various Justices relative to their views on \nsplitting the court. It is imperative we reflect on those who have \nstudied this issue and evaluated it on its merits.\n  From retired U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger: I \nstrongly believe the Ninth Circuit is far too cumbersome and it should \nbe divided.\n  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy:\n\n       I have increasing doubts and increasing reservations about \n     the wisdom of retaining the ninth circuit in its historic \n     size, and with its historic jurisdiction. We have very \n     dedicated judges on that circuit, very scholarly judges. . . \n     . But I think institutionally, and from the collegial \n     standpoint, that it is too large to have the discipline and \n     control that's necessary for an effective circuit.\n\n  We go to the Honorable Diarmuid O'Scannlain, a Ninth Circuit judge:\n\n       We--the ninth circuit--cannot grow without limit. . . . As \n     the number of opinions increases, we judges risk losing the \n     ability to know what our circuit's law is. In short, bigger \n     is not necessarily better. The ninth circuit will ultimately \n     need to be split. . . .\n\n  Former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Howell Heflin, one of our \nformer colleagues:\n\n       Congress recognized that a point is reached where the \n     addition of judges decreases the effectiveness of the court, \n     complicates the administration of uniform law, and \n     potentially\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\n     diminishes the quality of justice within a Circuit.\n\n  Last, former U.S. Senator Mark O. Hatfield, State of Oregon:\n\n       The increased likelihood of intracircuit conflicts is an \n     important justification for splitting the court.\n\n  These are gentlemen who have reviewed this issue and evaluated it \nobjectively on its merits.\n  We see here the Supreme Court agrees that reform is needed. Here is a \nquote from Justice Scalia:\n\n       The disproportionate segment of this court's discretionary \n     docket that is consistently devoted to reviewing ninth \n     circuit judgments, and reversing them by lop-sided margins, \n     suggests that this error-reduction function is not being \n     performed effectively.\n\n  That is a pretty strong statement on the manner in which the Ninth \nCircuit has been conducting itself. As the reference is from Justice \nScalia, he cites a disproportionate segment of the Supreme Court's \ndiscretionary docket that is devoted to reviewing Ninth Circuit \njudgments reversing them by lopsided margins. That is certainly a \ncritique against the Ninth Circuit's performance.\n  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor:\n\n       With respect to the ninth circuit in particular, in my view \n     the circuit is simply too large.\n\n  Finally, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens:\n\n       In my opinion, the arguments in favor of dividing the \n     circuit into either two or three smaller circuits \n     overwhelmingly outweigh the single serious objection to such \n     a change.\n\n  So there you have three Justices indicating that in their opinion the \ncourt is too large, there have been too many reversals coming to the \nSupreme Court. It is the criticism of the function of the court.\n  Let me continue because I think it is important to reflect on just \nwhat these figures are, relative to the filings and the increase. The \nnumber of filings continues to increase in the Ninth, from 8,415 in \n1995 to 9,070 in 1998, and now 10,342 in the year 2001. We have seen \nthe chart with the caseloads increasing. Here is a vivid comparison of \nthe years, as this caseload jumps, particularly from 2000 to 2001, as \none can see, in the red.\n  The ever increasing, expanding docket in the Ninth Circuit creates an \ninherent difficultly in keeping abreast of legal developments within \nits own jurisdiction, rendering inconsistency in constitutional \ninterpretation within the court. Interestingly, the statistical \nopportunities for inconsistency on a 28-panel court calculate out to \nabout 3,276 combinations of panels that could resolve any given issue.\n\n  I have had conversations with judges on the Ninth Circuit who have \nindicated the caseload is such that it is impossible for them to \ncommunicate among themselves on the activities going on within the \ncourt, as opposed to the usual process of judges having an opportunity \nto review other judges' opinions. As a consequence, the caseload is \nsimply too big to allow, not for leisure, but it is a necessity, given \nthe manner in which judges reflect upon their observation.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues an article from the June \n30 New York Times entitled ``Court That Ruled on Pledge Often Runs \nAfoul of Justices.'' I would like to read highlights. Obviously, there \nis too much material in it, but specifically I quote:\n\n     . . . judges on the court said that they did not have time to \n     read all of the decisions it issued.\n       According to the commission's 1998 report, 57 percent of \n     judges in the Ninth Circuit, compared with 86 percent of \n     federal appeals court judges elsewhere, said they read most \n     or all of their court's decisions.\n\n  That does not take place in the Ninth Circuit.\n\n       Critics say the Ninth Circuit's procedure for full-court \n     review accounts for much of the reversal rate. All other \n     circuits sit as one to hear full-court, or en banc, cases. \n     The Ninth Circuit sits in panels of 11.\n       The procedure injects randomness into decisions. If a case \n     is decided 6 to 5, there is no reason to think it represents \n     the views of the majority of the court's 23 active members.\n       Critics say the Ninth Circuit's procedure for full-court \n     review accounts for much of the reversal rate. All other \n     circuits sit as one to hear full-court, or en banc, cases. \n     The Ninth Circuit sits in panels of 11.\n       The procedure injects randomness into decisions. If a case \n     is decided 6 to 5, there is no reason to think it represents \n     the views of the majority of the court's 23 active members.\n\n  One only needs to review the appallingly high reversal rate of Ninth \nCircuit cases to appreciate the severity of the problem.\n  During the 1995-1996 session, the Supreme Court overturned an \nastounding 83 percent of the cases heard from the Ninth Circuit--83 \npercent, Mr. President, a figure which is 30 percent higher than the \nnational average reversal rate.\n  In the 1996-97 session alone, an astounding 95 percent of its cases \nreviewed by the Supreme Court were overturned. This number should raise \nmore than a few eyebrows.\n  A split in the circuit would enable a more complete and sound review, \nthereby reducing the circuit's rate of reversal before the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The uniqueness of the Northwest cannot be overstated. An effective \nappellate process demands mastery of State law and State issues \nrelative to geographic land mass, population, native cultures that are \nunique to the relevant region, and particularly public land issues.\n  Presently, California is responsible for almost 50 percent of the \nappellate court's filings, which means that California judges and \nCalifornia judicial philosophy dominate judicial decisions on issues \nthat are fundamentally unique to the Pacific Northwest.\n  Let me show on this chart the specifics of where all the cases come \nfrom. Nearly half of them--46 percent--come from California; Arizona, 7 \npercent; Alaska 1.3 percent; Hawaii, 1.9 percent; Idaho, Montana, \nNevada, 5.6 percent.\n  Clearly, you see the significant overwhelming evidence that most of \nthe cases, of course, are from California.\n  As a consequence, this need for greater regional representation is \ndemonstrated by the fact that the east coast of the United States is \ncomposed of five Federal circuits. I wonder what the justification for \nthat was. Clearly, it was justified in the sense of good judicial \ndecision. But here we have on the west coast one court. The division of \nthe Ninth Circuit would enable judges, lawyers, and parties to master a \nmore manageable and predictable universe of relevant case law.\n  Establishing a circuit comprised solely of States in the West would \nadhere certainly to congressional intent. Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \nHawaii, Idaho, and perhaps Nevada--although I understand Nevada, in the \nminds of some, is in the State of California. In any event, we share \nsimilar land-based populations and economics. Each State contains a \nhigh percentage of public land, a fairly comparable population, is \nfinancially dependent on tourism and is blessed with an abundance of \nnatural resources.\n  In conclusion, while I may believe even more sweeping changes are in \norder, I strongly urge that this body address the crisis in our \njudiciary system. It is the 54 million residents of the Ninth Circuit \nwho suffer from our inaction. These Americans wait years before their \ncases are heard, and, after those unreasonable delays, justice may not \neven be served by an overstretched and out of touch judiciary.\n  Congress has known about the problem in the Ninth Circuit for a long \ntime. Justice has been delayed too long. The time for reform has come. \nI urge action on this legislation. I will be offering it on every bill \nuntil we obtain a vote on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6732-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6732-S6734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR ALL AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the corporate \nscandals and financial problems we have been experiencing, and discuss \nhow these problems highlight the importance of keeping the ``security'' \nin Social Security.\n  Last week, American financial markets plunged dramatically in \nresponse to the ongoing litany of corporate scandal and earnings \nrestatements. The New York Times called the current 2\\1/2\\-year slide \nin the stock market the ``worst bear market in a generation.'' For \nordinary investors, retirees, and near-retirees--last week, and \ncertainly the year--the post-bubble environment has been a financial \nnightmare. What felt like a hard-earned, secure retirement for many \nbecame an open question filled with uncertainty for many\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\nAmericans. People are feeling compelled to go back to work and evaluate \nwhen they will retire, continue their careers, or cut back on their \nstandard of living. They are experiencing a real sense of economic \ninsecurity.\n  U.S. equity markets have lost nearly $7.5 trillion since the peak of \nthe market--that is a mind-boggling number, frankly--and roughly $2.5 \ntrillion in market value has been lost this year alone.\n  That loss has created a profound sense of insecurity among American \nfamilies. We are seeing it in the real economy, we are seeing it in \nconsumer confidence, and in a whole series of measures.\n  Trees don't grow to the sky. We sometimes lost track of that in the \n1990s. Markets will not fall to zero either. But markets pose real risk \nand real challenges to the economic security of all Americans. That is, \nof course, why we must pass the accounting reform measure before the \nSenate, the Investor Protection Act. I hope we will do that today. We \nmust also stand firm on the principles and elements of this legislation \nas we continue in the conference committee, which will try to piece \ntogether this strong piece of reform legislation with a fairly weak and \ntepid response in the House.\n\n  Obviously, investors are deeply affected by the wave of corporate \nscandals and financial restatements that infect too much of the \ncorporate world: The so-called Enron Syndrome, WorldCom, Global \nCrossing, to Adelphia--the litany goes on, and, unfortunately, appears \nto be lengthening. I think we may just be at the head of this wave.\n  What we have is not merely a few bad apples but a systemic \nbreakdown--a breakdown in our accounting system, a breakdown in our \nauditing structures, and, more fundamentally, a breakdown in the trust \nthat is the foundation of our entire market-based economic system--\ntrust in our corporate leadership and trust in the truthfulness of \ntheir word.\n  As a former businessman and a CEO, I must say I am ashamed of this \nwave of corporate corruption. As a Senator, I am appalled at the \ncontinuing attempt of some lobbyists and too many in public office to \nsubstitute a token response for a strong and effective governmental \nresponse.\n  Frankly, I was disappointed with President Bush's response last week, \nwhich was long on rhetoric and short on reform. Nothing was really said \nabout the accounting industry conflicts, the conflicts with regard to \nresearch in investment banks, as Attorney General Spitzer has brought \nto light, the expensing of options, or about many other serious steps \nthat will be needed to restore public confidence.\n  The President also failed to face up to the urgent need for major \nstrengthening of the SEC, which today is drastically outgunned in the \nbattle against corporate fraud. We need not define the SEC by who is \nleading the SEC, but we need to make sure we speak to the scope of the \nresources they have and the tools they have to deal with the issues \nthat are involved in problems that have led to the crisis of consumer \nconfidence that we have today.\n  Many of my colleagues have expressed similar concerns in recent days, \nand I believe the American people are watching us closely today, and \nwill see how this process unfolds as the 107th Congress proceeds to \ncompletion, and whether we can put this strong reform legislation on \nthe President's desk not only by passing a strong bill in the Senate \nbut by making sure that when we get to conference, we put the public's \ninterest ahead of special interests.\n  With that said, there is another very important question that is \nreinforced by these events. It is really where the dots connect and \nwhat I will focus on today. That is something I have been speaking \nabout often here on the floor--the implications of a market meltdown \nand the President's drive to move toward the privatization of Social \nSecurity.\n  For anyone who has any doubt about the importance of providing a \nguaranteed safety net--a bedrock safety net--for America's retirees, \nrecent events prove how that is absolutely necessary.\n  In just the past week, millions of Americans have seen the value of \ntheir 401(k)s plunge dramatically. For some, this decline will mean \ntheir retirement will have to be delayed. For others already retired, \nit will bring a real decline in their standard of living. I have read \nabout and talked to people who will have to return to work. And for \nmillions of Americans, recent events have highlighted the risk of \nrelying on the stock market as the primary guarantor of retirement \nsecurity.\n  We have always talked in this Nation about a three-legged stool to \nsupport people in their retirement: Certainly, individual savings, and \nsome of that undoubtedly is well spent in the stock market; then there \nare pension benefits that are provided by employers; and then there has \nalways been this bedrock of Social Security. That is the three-legged \nstool.\n  I think we need to make sure we reinforce that fundamental leg, \nSocial Security. The purpose of Social Security is to ensure, despite \nthe inherent uncertainties of the marketplace, that retirees who have \ncontributed to our Nation will be guaranteed a basic level of \nretirement income. In other words, the Social Security system \nguarantees a degree of certainty, a certainty that will give people \nthat sense of security.\n  Privatizing the program, as the Bush Social Security Commission has \nproposed, will undermine that security and tear apart a program that \nhas been successful--enormously successful--for the American people for \nover 70 years. In fact, we have gone from where we had more than 50 \npercent of the American population retired and living in poverty down \nto almost 10 percent in recent years. In my view, moving away from that \nwould be a mistake.\n  For 50 percent of working Americans, the whole of their retirement \nsecurity is Social Security; they have no other means of retirement \nsecurity. And for about 70 percent, the primary means of their \nretirement security is Social Security. So we are really talking about \nputting at risk something that I think is very vital for most \nAmericans.\n  Ever since Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law, Social Security has \nbeen critically important for our Nation's seniors. Its importance has \ngrown even more in recent years. That is because fewer and fewer \nAmericans now have access to traditional defined-benefit pension plans. \nThose plans have declined from 175,000 programs in 1983 to just about \n50,000 programs today. There has been a dramatic decline in these \ndefined-benefit programs--ones that were secure. Increasingly, \ncompanies have switched from traditional plans, under which the company \nbears the investment risks, to defined-contribution plans, under which \nworkers and retirees are themselves the risk takers--market risk \ntakers.\n  Proponents of privatizing Social Security would compound those \ndefined-contribution or 401(k) market risks by making Social Security \nbenefits equally dependent on the uncertainties of the stock market. In \nmy view, that would be a cruel betrayal of America's senior citizens \nand a denial of the promise of Social Security.\n  Consider what has happened to the employees at MCI. MCI is another \ntelecommunications company that was merged into WorldCom about 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. Before the takeover by WorldCom, MCI maintained a \ntraditional defined-benefit plan; that is, the retirement security \nrisks were borne by MCI and guaranteed by a Government institution \ncalled the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But that plan was \nabolished after WorldCom merged, except, by the way, for senior \nmanagement; they continued to have defined-benefit programs for their \nretirements. Instead, MCI employees, as most WorldCom employees, were \noffered only one type of retirement program, a 401(k) plan.\n  I am not against 401(k) plans. They are a great idea for an \nadditional element, on top of Social Security, a guaranteed benefit. \nBut I think when we mix apples and oranges, we undermine economic \nsecurity for Americans.\n  By the end of 1999, over 103,000 workers and retirees participated in \nthis WorldCom 401(k) program. Their accounts at that time held more \nthan $1.1 billion of WorldCom stock, about one-third of the plan's \nassets. At that time, the stock was worth $54 a share.\n  Today, that stock and their retirement funds are almost worthless. \nAnd we read in the paper today that WorldCom is about to file its \nbankruptcy petitions. After WorldCom's \n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\nmassive accounting scam, the stock is not at $54 a share but 3 cents a \nshare. The WorldCom stock in WorldCom 401(k) plans is not worth $1.1 \nbillion, but it is now worth $20 million.\n\n  By the way, the 401(k) plan isn't guaranteed by the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation. It is actually imposing a cruel reduction in the \nsecurity of all those 104,000 folks. I say, as an aside, this situation \ncertainly argues for diversification in pension plans as well. The \nWorldCom plan started with about one-third concentration in WorldCom \nstock. It now has less than 1 percent in the WorldCom stock, but that \nis just because of the loss of value. It is really a very difficult \nsituation for a lot of working Americans.\n  These are not just numbers or abstract entries on a corporate balance \nsheet or somebody's notification of what their 401(k) plan returns are, \nthey represent the destruction of people's hopes and dreams for a \nsecure retirement life, after working responsibly and contributing \nresponsibly to their retirement.\n  Last week we had one WorldCom employee say:\n\n       I put all my money in WorldCom stock, and I'm pretty sure \n     I've lost everything. I knew what happened at Enron, but I \n     thought we [at WorldCom] were different.\n\n  Management told them they were different, and, as most people, \nemployees trusted the executives they worked for and wanted to be proud \nof their company and its leadership.\n  The experience of WorldCom employees, and those of hundreds of other \ncompanies--some of them, by the way, not falling prey to the whims of \nfraud but just simply market realities--shows that diversification is \nan absolute essential in pension reform. I hope we have that debate \nalso on the floor.\n  When retirees lose all their money through no fault of their own, \nwhen nothing is left in their retirement portfolio, one thing, and one \nthing only, stands in the way of total economic devastation. Social \nSecurity. Because no matter the state of the stock market, Social \nSecurity is always there--not with enough to live in luxury but enough \nto make a real difference for millions who have little or no savings on \nwhich to rely. Social Security is the ultimate safety net. We must not \nlet the administration shred it.\n  Privatization schemes would irresponsibly gamble with the guarantee \nof security for retirees, present and future. The average Social \nSecurity benefit last year was only about $10,000 a year--not the \nprincely sums received by executives who have failed their companies--\nand not enough in some parts of our country to have a secure \nretirement. In New Jersey, for instance, $10,000 a year can only get \nyou so far given the high cost of living in our part of the country.\n  Yet President Bush's Social Security Commission called for \nsubstantial cuts in guaranteed benefits. Cuts for some workers would \namount to 25 percent and future cuts could exceed 45 percent. If anyone \nwants to apologize for privatization by disputing these numbers, I just \nencourage them to read the report of the nonpartisan actuaries at the \nSocial Security Administration themselves. For more evidence, let me \nrefer you to the recent economic analysis by Professor Peter Diamond of \nMIT and Dr. Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution.\n  The Bush Commission parades its proposals as promoting choice. But if \nthe Bush privatization plans were ever approved, seniors would have no \nchoice. Their benefits would be cut. They would be cut if they shifted \nto privatized accounts, and they would be cut if they did not. The only \nchoice is this: If they opted for privatized accounts, their guaranteed \nbenefits would be cut more deeply.\n  The effective destruction of Social Security's guaranteed benefits \nrecommended by the Bush Commission is bad economics and bad social \npolicy. Fifty Senators have written the President urging him to \npublicly reject his Commission's proposals. So far, his response has \nbeen the same kind of silence we heard for months after the corporate \nscandals first broke with Enron.\n  Sometimes facts and reality ought to bring about a change in thinking \nfor individuals, for corporations, and for an administration on \nimportant topics of the day.\n  Cutting guaranteed Social Security may have sounded like a good idea \nwhen the stock market was only going up, but now the fallacy of that \nassumption is clear to everybody. I hope the Bush administration will \nreconsider its plans to privatize and cut Social Security.\n  Let's not take the security out of Social Security.\n  Mr. President, before I leave the floor, I would like to take a few \nminutes to discuss a different matter but one that I believe is \nfundamentally important as we seek to address the structural problems \nfacing our economy and what we need to face in the financial world to \nstraighten out some of the problems we have. We need to better account \nfor employee stock options.\n\n  This, too, is an issue that regardless of where one may have been \nhistorically, facts and reality ought to bring about a change in \nreasonable folks' thought with regard to options.\n  While the depth of liquidity and efficiency of our markets is still \nunrivaled, our markets need to make sure they are based on a \npresumption of integrity and accuracy in the information provided to \nthe country. Our entire financial system depends on the broad \navailability of timely, truthful and transparent information. To secure \nthat and restore the confidence of investors, it is absolutely urgent \nthat we address this treatment of employee stock options.\n  The fact is, in many instances where we continue to allow this \nwithout an acknowledgment of what is going on, two things are \nhappening: Earnings are overstated, and there is an enormous amount of \ndilution going on to the ownership of shares.\n  People may argue that you can derive this from financial statements \nand footnotes that are highly complicated even for the most \nsophisticated investor to read. But I argue that there is no common \nsense in making it as difficult to understand what the earnings \nstatements of a company state and, more importantly, protecting \ninvestors from the dilution that comes from the whole premise of \nissuing more stock without having an understanding of when that is \ngoing to happen. This needs to be put in the context of the \nasymmetrical incentives it gives management that has undermined \nconfidence in our corporate executives.\n  To be brief: We have a chance to address this issue in a very serious \nmanner in the next few hours before we take our final vote on this \nlegislation. I compliment Senator Levin and all those who stand to \nstraighten out and put into responsible format what needs to be done \nwith option accounting. We should do that not by writing option rules, \nat which I do not think the Senate has the capacity to be effective, \nbut making sure that an independent body, which we will independently \nfinance, has the ability to deal with a very complicated issue.\n  I hope with the help of all my colleagues, we can get around to \nstraightening out something that, as we saw today in news reports, even \ncorporate executives understand can lead to misallocation of resources \nand certainly misunderstanding of the performance of companies. We \nought to get to real economic performance being reflected, not \naccounting performance. I am glad to see Coca-Cola take the steps they \ndid. We need to move firmly and surely by passing the Levin amendment \nwhich would facilitate a solution that would make this permanent for \neveryone.\n  All three of these are important issues--accounting reform and \ncorporate responsibility, the treatment of stock options, and \nprotecting Social Security and rejecting privatization. The stakes are \nhigh for our economy. I hope we will move swiftly and certainly to \nreform and provide economic security to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6734-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 2673, which the clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for public companies, to create a Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, to enhance the standard setting \n     process for accounting practices, to strengthen the \n     independence of firms that audit public companies, to \n     increase corporate responsibility and the usefulness of \n     corporate financial disclosure, to protect the objectivity \n     and independence of securities analysts, to improve \n     Securities and Exchange Commission resources and oversight, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Edwards modified amendment No. 4187, to address rules of \n     professional responsibility for attorneys.\n       Reid (for Carnahan) modified amendment No. 4286 (to \n     amendment No. 4187), to require timely and public disclosure \n     of transactions involving management and principal \n     stockholders.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might inquire as to how much \ntime I have on my allotted time under postcloture rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I will at a later time ask unanimous consent that the pending second-\ndegree amendment be laid aside so I can offer a germane second-degree \namendment relative to stock options.\n  My amendment, which is at the desk, would direct the independent \naccounting standards board to review the accounting rule on stock \noptions and adopt an appropriate rule within 1 year.\n  It should not be necessary to seek unanimous consent. The whole \npurpose of our postcloture rules is to allow those of us who have \ngermane amendments such as this one to offer that amendment, to have it \nvoted on. It is a frustration of the clear intent of our rules to not \nallow germane amendments to be voted on after cloture is invoked.\n  We have a strict rule. It is called cloture. It ends debate. When \ncloture was invoked, I had pending an amendment which would have given \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission greater powers to impose civil \nfines administratively. It is an important addition to SEC powers. They \nnow have that power over brokers, but they don't have it over corporate \ndirectors. They don't have it over corporate managers. They ought to \nhave the power to impose civil fines administratively--subject, of \ncourse, to appeal to the courts--relative to corporate directors and \ncorporate officers.\n  That amendment, as relevant as it is to this bill, was frustrated \nwhen cloture was invoked and when all the time up to that vote was \nutilized so that my SEC amendment was not allowed to come up for a \nvote.\n  Now we are in postcloture. Now we are under postcloture rules. The \nquestion is whether or not the intent of those rules is going to be \ncarried out, which is to allow those of us who have germane amendments \nto have a vote on those amendments.\n  The amendment on which I would like to have a vote cannot be voted on \nbecause there is a pending first-degree amendment and a pending second-\ndegree amendment. So the second-degree amendment would have to be laid \naside in order to allow a vote. As long as the opponents of this stock \noption accounting amendment don't allow the first- and second-degree \namendments that are pending to come to a vote, we are foreclosed from \noffering germane amendments.\n  That is not the intent of our postcloture rule. I believe it is an \nabuse of the intent of our postcloture rule. I hope it will not happen \nhere. I am hoping against hope that there will not be an objection to \nmy unanimous consent request so that this most critical issue can be \naddressed by the Senate.\n  If we don't address this issue, it seems to me we are leaving a \nsignificant gap in the reforms we are struggling so hard to adopt to \ntry to restore honesty to accounting rules.\n  In 1994, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a tentative \nrule which said that stock options should be expensed like all other \nforms of compensation. That is what they decided was the right thing to \ndo.\n  Well, Congress intervened. The executives intervened strongly, beat \nback FASB with huge pressure, all set out in the FASB account of its \nrule. By the way, one of the most extraordinary documents I have ever \nread, as a matter of fact, in 24 years in the Senate, is that Financial \nAccounting Standards Board history of their effort to bring honesty to \naccounting for stock options, in their judgment, and how that effort \nwas beaten back by pressure from executives and from Congress so that \ntheir very existence was at stake if they proceeded in a way which they \nthought was right. All set forth in the record. It is quite an amazing \ndocument.\n  So what FASB did was, they said: We can't survive if we do what we \nthink is right. So what we will do instead is we will urge people to \nexpense options. We will urge corporations to expense their options, \nbut we will not mandate it.\n  FASB said: If you don't expense options, at least disclose the cost \nof the options as a footnote in your financial statements.\n  That was the way they decided to survive. This body voted, put some \nof the pressure on FASB, basically told them to leave stock option \naccounting alone. So we intervened on an accounting issue with a vote \nof something like 90 to 10 or thereabouts.\n  The executives weighed in. I was at one of the meetings in \nConnecticut when the executives weighed in heavily on this issue. So I \nsaw the pressure that was brought to bear on what should be an \nindependent accounting standards board.\n  Now we are doing something different in this bill. We are saying to \nthe board that we are going to give you an independent source of \nfunding. We are not going to make you dependent directly for your \nfunding from the very people you are seeking to regulate through your \naccounting standards. So we are making some progress now by giving them \nan independent source of funding.\n  What my amendment would do is take what is the most significant post-\nEnron issue that is left open, which is accounting for these huge \namounts of stock options that go mainly to executives, and direct this \nboard that now has an independent source of funding to review--\n``review'' is the key word--this matter and make an appropriate \ndecision within 1 year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I can yield on the time of the Senator from \nArizona, because time is so limited here that I am going to have very \nlittle. I think the Senator has a half hour and, assuming that the \nSenator can be recognized, I believe that I only have about 10 or 15 \nminutes of time remaining. I wonder if the Senator from Texas would \npermit that I be allowed to yield to the Senator from Arizona, if the \nSenator from Arizona is willing to ask a question to be taken out of \nhis own time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, the Senator started out \nwith a unanimous consent request and then launched into a speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no request pending.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Maybe if the Senator would do his unanimous consent \nrequest and then yield, that would be fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would rather do my unanimous consent request at the end \nof the time, rather than at the beginning of the time. I make a \nparliamentary inquiry. If I make a unanimous consent--\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't object to the Senator yielding. I wanted to be \nsure we had the time we were supposed to have.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Arizona, if \nhe is willing, be able to ask a question on his time. I yield to the \nSenator from Arizona for that question and then I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief, due to the shortness \nof time. I wonder if the Senator from Michigan remembers my comments \nlast Thursday when I referred to an old boxing term, ``the fix is in.'' \nThere was no vote allowed on my amendment, which is a clearcut, \nabsolutely unequivocal statement about the use of stock options for \naccounting. Does the Senator really believe that, since my amendment \nwas blocked by that side, his amendment is not going to be blocked by \nthis side?\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\n  The fix is in, I say to the Senator from Michigan. I hope he knows \nthat. This is a terrible mistake, a terrible mistake, because we are \nnot addressing what every observer knows is a vital and critical aspect \nof reforming this system, which continues to so badly erode the \nconfidence of the American people, the investors, which is over half of \nthe American people.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Michigan remembers what I said last \nweek, that the fact is the fix is in. I didn't get a vote on my \namendment and the Senator from Michigan won't get one on his. Very \nfrankly, since that side blocked my vote, I can understand them \nblocking this vote. I think it is wrong on both sides.\n\n  The American people deserve to know how we stand on the issue of \nstock options. Does the Senator understand that?\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator will recall the Senator from Arizona talking \nabout the fix being in, and the Record will clearly reflect that the \nSenator from Arizona asked that his amendment be in order postcloture, \nand, as the Senator from Michigan will recall, I objected to that \nbecause at that time we had 56 other amendments that were pending. They \nalso wanted them to be in order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, that is not correct. Mine was \na motion to recommit.\n  Mr. REID. I am talking about the objection about which I was \ninvolved, and does the Senator from Michigan recall that objection to \nthe unanimous consent request by the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe I do recall the objection to the request, and I \nwould rather let the Record speak for itself as to the other matters \nbecause I think the issue before us is a somewhat different issue than \nwe faced on the McCain-Levin amendment last week. Now we have a Levin-\nMcCain-Corzine amendment, which is somewhat different. I supported \nSenator McCain's amendment, and, indeed, I have been very active in \ntrying to get this accounting rule adopted in the way the independent \naccounting board wants to have it adopted. That is the key emphasis.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on my time for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand the Senator's amendment--the one he \nwill be seeking to offer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be seeking unanimous consent to have the second-\ndegree amendment laid aside so that I can do so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, this amendment is not the Congress \ntrying to legislate what the accounting standard should be; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is important because I, frankly, do not \nthink that the Congress should get into the business of trying to \nlegislate accounting standards. I don't think we have the expertise or \nthe competence to do it. And it turns established accounting standards \ninto a straight-out political exercise, and I don't think that is wise.\n  As I understand the Senator's amendment, it would simply reference \nthe issue of the treatment of stock options to the financial accounting \nstandards board, for them to make their own independent judgment as to \nhow this matter should be treated, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. And I understand that the terms of reference are such \nthat it does not presuppose a particular substantive conclusion; it is, \nin effect, left open, or even level, however you want to describe it--a \nlevel playing field for FASB, the expert body that has been established \nto make these judgments to make its own independent judgment as to how \nthese matters should be addressed, is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment directs FASB to review the issue and adopt \nan appropriate standard. Those are the words in the amendment. I must \ntell my good friend from Maryland, however, that there is a history \nhere that cannot be ignored.\n  The history is that FASB tried to adopt a standard in 1994. They said \nwhat the right standard was. They were beaten back and brow-beaten and \npressured, so they had to give up what they believed is right. That is \nin their own history. Then they recommended to corporations to expense \noptions, because that is the right thing to do. But they offered an \noption to corporations to simply disclose the value of options in their \nfinancial statement in a footnote. They left that option open.\n  So I have two hopes here. One is that there will not be an objection \nto a vote on this amendment. For the life of me, I cannot see how \nanybody can object to a vote on an amendment, which simply tells the \nindependent accounting standards board to reach an appropriate \ndecision.\n  Now, we did intervene 8 years ago, and I believed it was wrong for us \nto intervene. Nine of us voted no; 90 voted yes. We told them: Do not \nchange the rule; do not expense options.\n  In my judgment, it was wrong procedurally and it was wrong in terms \nof the substance. But it is my hope that, No. 1, we will be allowed to \nhave a vote, and, No. 2, it would be my expectation, however, if it is \nleft to the independence of FASB, that FASB would continue to do what \nthey said was the right thing, which is to expense options.\n  It is left to their independent judgment to reach an appropriate \nconclusion under the language of my amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So it would be FASB's call?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would be FASB's call.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply want to say I am supportive of \nthis amendment. I think this is the right way to go about it.\n  Let me repeat, I do not think the Congress itself should be in the \nbusiness of legislating accounting standards, but this amendment does \nnot do that. It references the issue to the very body that has been \nestablished to accomplish that, which has the expertise and the \ncompetence. The amendment also helps to underscore the independence of \nFASB and a congressional perception that they should call it as they \nsee it. I hope at the appropriate time the Senator will be able to \nobtain permission to bring his amendment before the body.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am sorry. I think the Senator from Michigan has the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I yield to the majority \nleader for whatever time he wishes to take and that time not be taken \nfrom the few minutes I have remaining, and that the floor be returned \nto me at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time so as not to \ntake any time still allotted to the Senator from Michigan.\n  I hope we can get the unanimous consent request that the Senator from \nMichigan is propounding. I will also say that this is not a question of \nif he can get consent and ultimately bring the amendment to the floor. \nOne way or the other we will have a vote on the Levin amendment. It may \nnot be on this bill this afternoon if we fail, but our colleagues need \nto know we will have a vote on this amendment. This will occur. If I \nhave to offer it myself, we will have a vote on this amendment. So we \ncan do it this afternoon, we can do it tomorrow, or we can do it next \nweek. We are going to have a vote on this amendment. Senators need to \ntake that into account before they object.\n  Let me say as strongly as I can, this amendment belongs on this bill. \nThis is exactly what I think we ought to be doing, and I think on a \nbipartisan basis there is strong support for what Senator Levin is \nproposing.\n  I want to speak briefly this afternoon, in my leader time, on the \namendment itself. I think it is important, as my colleagues have been \nnoting, that the Levin amendment contains precisely the right solution \nto the difficult problems of determining the proper accounting \ntreatment for stock options. It reserves that judgment for the \nappropriate body, the Financial Accounting Standards Board. They are \nthe ones given the authority, they are the ones with the credibility, \nthey are the ones with the standing to make the right\n\n[[Page S6737]]\n\ndecisions about this very important and complex matter.\n  I argue this is the heart of our ability to deal with the accounting \nreforms that are in the Sarbanes and Leahy bills.\n  It has become all too clear that accounting standards are complex and \ncan be easily manipulated by aggressive and sometimes unscrupulous \ncorporate executives. Unfortunately, FASB's weak, dependent condition \nhas contributed to those manipulations. In fact, it is arguable that \nthe undermining of FASB's independence was the necessary precondition \nto the crisis in confidence afflicting our capital markets today.\n\n  One of the many virtues of the Sarbanes bill is that it corrects that \nsituation. It provides for a new, improved FASB, giving it for the \nfirst time full financial independence from the accounting industry. \nThat certainly is the first and most vital improvement we need with \nrespect to establishing clarity and regularity of accounting standards.\n  Another needed improvement is for those of us in Congress to allow \nFASB to do its job. In 1994--and my colleagues have referenced this--\nwhen this issue was last taken up by the Senate, I am proud to say I \nwas one of nine Senators who voted against the Senate intruding itself \non FASB's decisionmaking process. That is the only reason I opposed my \ncolleague's amendment last week. As well intended as it is, in my view \nit did the same thing on the other side that they were trying to do 9 \nyears ago. It asserts Congress's authority to undermine the \nindependence of that board. I opposed it 9 years ago, and I oppose it \ntoday, but for obviously different results.\n  At the same time, the Senate was coming at the options issue from the \ndirection of prohibiting expenses back in 1994, and as I said today the \nmomentum is the opposite, but the right course is the same. Let the \nexperts on the accounting standards board do their job and make the \nappropriate decision. Eight years ago, the technical accounting \nquestions were essentially the same as they are today, although \nobviously 8 years have given us an entirely different perspective than \nthe one we had back then. Nonetheless, the questions are still real. \nAccountants still debate the relative merits of the opposing sides. We \nstill have expert opinion going both ways. On the one hand, the \nargument is made that if options are not expensed, bottom lines look \nfar more attractive than they actually should be, and the investors can \nbe deceived by the distorted financial pictures that result.\n  On the other hand, we hear that it is inherently impossible to value \noptions with no concrete reality behind what the options will actually \nbe worth when they are exercised. There is also a real debate about the \nincentive effects of options.\n  Supporters argue that they better align an employee's interests with \nthe company's. Opponents contend they result in a ``pump and dump'' \nmentality, with senior executives seeking to inflate their stock prices \nat any cost so they can quickly and cynically enrich themselves.\n  In contrast to those complex questions, the Levin amendment is \nsimplicity itself. It is one sentence. It says that FASB shall:\n\n       Review the accounting treatment of employee stock options \n     and shall, within one year of enactment, adopt an appropriate \n     generally-accepted accounting principle for the treatment of \n     employee stock options--\n\n  End of issue.\n  The business of setting accounting standards is lodged, by the Levin \namendment, in the board that the Sarbanes bill expressly seeks to \nstrengthen and improve. I fully support the Levin amendment and the \nphilosophy behind it. Congress should not be engaged in setting \ntechnical accounting rules. We should be seeking to do the reverse: \nEstablish an independent FASB that can help restore confidence in the \naccuracy of financial information.\n  I observe in this context that because of that principle, as I said a \nmoment ago, while well intended, I believe the McCain amendment went \ntoo far and did exactly what we were trying to do in 1994 but on the \nflip side. Restoring independence to the accounting standards is one of \nthe overriding objectives of the Sarbanes bill, and that is one of my \nmain reasons for supporting it as strongly as I do. That was my primary \nreason for voting in 1994 against a previous attempt to direct FASB in \nits decision about expensing, and it is the primary reason for \nsupporting the Levin amendment today.\n  So I will end on this particular issue where I began. There will be a \nvote on the Levin amendment. It will be today, tomorrow, next week, or \nat some point in the future, but Senators should not be misled. If \nthere is an objection today, it by no means ends the debate. We might \nas well have it. We might as well get it. We might as well include it \nin the Sarbanes bill because it will be included in one fashion or \nanother, ultimately, before the work has been done in the Senate on \nthis very important, complex, and comprehensive challenge we face.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I quote from a few observers what the \nstakes are in this vote and what the stakes have been in terms of the \nway in which stock options have not been expensed, have been stealth \ncompensation, have fueled the incredible increase in terms of executive \npay, and have been a driving force behind the deceptive accounting \npractices which have bedeviled this Nation and undermined public \nconfidence in the credibility of our financial statements.\n  Robert Samuelson, an economist, said the following:\n\n       The point is that the growth of stock options has created \n     huge conflicts of interest that executives will be hard-\n     pressed to avoid. Indeed, many executives will coax as many \n     options as possible from their compensation committees, \n     typically composed of ``outside'' directors. But because \n     ``directors are [manipulated] by management, sympathetic to \n     them, or simply ineffectual,'' the amounts may well be \n     excessive. . . .\n       Stock options are not evil, but unless we curb the present \n     madness, we are courting continual trouble.\n\n  This is what a retired vice president at J.P. Morgan and Company \nsaid: There can be no real reform without honest accounting for stock \noptions. A decade ago, the Financial Accounting Standards Board \nrecommended options be counted as a cost against earnings like all \nother forms of compensation, but corporate lobbyists resisted and \nCongress did their bidding. Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett, among \nothers, are calling for the same change now, but it remains to be seen \nwhether the accounting profession can act without congressional \ninterference. Treating options like other forms of pay would make \nexecutive compensation transparent, diminish the temptation to cook the \nbooks, and make managers less inclined towards excessive risk taking.\n  Warren Buffett, who was quoted by Senator McCain last week, said the \nfollowing: If options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If \ncompensation isn't an expense, what is it? If expenses shouldn't go \ninto the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?\n  A New York Times editorial of March 31 of this year stated:\n\n       We have no quarrel with the business lobby's claim that \n     stock options have helped fuel America's entrepreneurship, \n     particularly in Silicon Valley. But in the interest of \n     truthful accounting and greater financial integrity, options \n     should be treated as what they are, a worthy form of \n     compensation that companies must report as an expense.\n\n  Robert Felton, director of McKinsey & Company's Seattle office, said:\n\n       Because they have so much at stake with these huge grants, \n     options are likely to have encouraged some managers to cheat \n     and cook the books.\n\n  Allan Sloan of Newsweek:\n\n     . . . options are a free lunch for companies. . . .\n       I'm all in favor of employees becoming millionaires via \n     options--I'm an employee, after all--but I'm also in favor of \n     companies providing profit-and-loss statements that show the \n     real profit and loss. Ignoring options' costs and low-balling \n     CEO packages are simply outrageous. When campaigns start \n     expensing options and disclosing true CEO and director \n     compensation numbers, I'll believe that they've seen the \n     light.\n       According to the Economist, last year, stock options \n     accounted for 58 percent of the pay of chief executives of \n     large American companies. So over half the compensation of \n     our CEOs of major companies now comes from stock options. To \n     leave that expense off the financial statements' bottom line \n     is to distort what is going on at companies. It is\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\n     part of the reason we have not had accurately reflective \n     financial statements at our corporations. It is part of the \n     reason for the soup we are in right now.\n\n  Where financial statements have been giving a false picture of what a \ncompany's financial situation is, it has provided stealth compensation \nin huge amounts to executives, it has watered down the value of stock \nto the owners of a corporation. That is why now we have such tremendous \nsupport from the organizations which represent stockholders.\n  That is why, for instance, TIAA-CREF, the largest pension fund in the \nUnited States for teachers is supportive of changing the accounting for \nstock options. It is why the Council for Institutional Investors, which \nis the leading shareholders organization for pension funds, now favors \nexpensing stock options in order to give an accurate reflection of what \na company's financial statement is. It is why the AFL-CIO supports the \namendments offered last week and the amendment which hopefully will be \noffered today if we are allowed to have a vote on this.\n  Alan Greenspan says this is the top post-Enron reform. Expensing \nstock options is the top post-Enron reform. That is the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve Chairman, \nsupports a change in stock option accounting. Arthur Levitt, former SEC \nChairman, supports the change; Warren Buffett, as we mentioned; and a \nhost of economists. Standard & Poor's believes you have to expense \nstock options if you are going to show an accurate earnings \ncalculation; Citizens for Tax Justice; Consumer Federation of America; \nConsumers Union, and on and on.\n  The Washington Post of April 18 says the following:\n\n     . . . expert consensus favors treating options as a corporate \n     expense, which would mean that reported earnings might \n     actually reflect reality. . . . But nobody wants to ban this \n     form of compensation; the goal is merely to have it counted \n     as an expense.\n\n  That is the end of that particular quote. I would like the entire \nquote printed in the Record, and I ask unanimous consent that all the \neditorials and comments that I referred to be printed in the Record in \nfull.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2002]\n\n                          Stock Option Madness\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       As the Enron scandal broadens, we may miss the forest for \n     the trees. The multiplying investigations have created a \n     massive whodunit. Who destroyed documents? Who misled \n     investors? Who twisted or broke accounting rules? The answers \n     may explain what happened at Enron but not necessarily why. \n     We need to search for deeper causes, beginning with stock \n     options. Here's a good idea gone bad--stock options foster a \n     corrosive climate that tempts many executives, and not just \n     those at Enron, to play fast and loose when reporting \n     profits.\n       As everyone knows, stock options exploded in the late 1980s \n     and the '90s. The theory was simple. If you made top \n     executives and managers into owners, they would act in \n     shareholders' interests. Executives' pay packages became \n     increasingly skewed toward options. In 2000, the typical \n     chief executive officer of one of the country's 350 major \n     companies earned about $5.2 million, with almost half of that \n     reflecting stock options, according to William M. Mercer \n     Inc., a consulting firm. About half of those companies also \n     had stock-option programs for at least half their employees.\n       Up to a point, the theory worked. Twenty years ago, \n     America's corporate managers were widely criticized. Japanese \n     and German companies seemed on a roll. By contrast, their \n     American rivals seemed stodgy, complacent and bureaucratic. \n     Stock options were one tool in a managerial upheaval that \n     refocused attention away from corporate empire-building and \n     toward improved profit-ability and efficiency.\n       All this contributed to the 1990's economic revival. By \n     holding down costs, companies restrained inflation. By \n     aggressively promoting new products and technologies, \n     companies boosted production and employment. But slowly stock \n     options became corrupted by carelessness, overuse and greed. \n     As more executives developed big personal stakes in options, \n     the task of keeping the stock price rising became separate \n     from improving the business and its profitability. This is \n     what seems to have happened at Enron.\n       The company adored stock options. About 60 percent of \n     employees received an annual award of options, equal to 5 \n     percent of their base salary. Executives and top managers got \n     more. At year-end 2000, all Enron managers and workers had \n     options that could be exercised for nearly 47 million shares. \n     Under a typical plan, a recipient gets an option to buy a \n     given number of shares at the market price on the day the \n     option is issued. This is called ``the strike price.'' But \n     the option usually cannot be exercised for a few years. If \n     the stock's price rises in that time, the option can yield a \n     tidy profit. The lucky recipient buys at the strike price and \n     sells at the market price. On the 47 million Enron options, \n     the average ``strike'' price was about $30, and at the end of \n     2000, the market price was $83. The potential profit was \n     nearly $2.5 billion.\n       Given the huge rewards, it would have been astonishing if \n     Enron's managers had not become obsessed with the company's \n     stock price and--to the extent possible--tried to influence \n     it. And while Enron's stock soared, why would anyone complain \n     about accounting shenanigans? Whatever the resulting abuses, \n     the pressures are not unique to Enron. It takes a naive view \n     of human nature to think that many executives won't strive to \n     maximize their personal wealth.\n       This is an invitation to abuse. To influence stock prices, \n     executives can issue optimistic profit projections. They can \n     delay some spending, such as research and development (this \n     temporarily helps profits). They can engage in stock buybacks \n     (these raise per-share earnings, because fewer shares are \n     outstanding). And, of course, they can exploit accounting \n     rules. Even temporary blips in stock prices can create \n     opportunities to unload profitable options.\n       The point is that the growth of stock options has created \n     huge conflicts of interest that executives will be hard-\n     pressed to avoid. Indeed, many executives will coax as many \n     options as possible from their compensation committees, \n     typically composed of ``outside'' directors. But because \n     ``directors are [manipulated] by management, sympathetic to \n     them, or simply ineffectual,'' the amounts may well be \n     excessive, argue Harvard law professors Lucian Arye Bebchuk \n     and Jesse Fried and attorney David Walker in a recent study.\n       Stock options are not evil, but unless we curb the present \n     madness, we are courting continual trouble. Here are three \n     ways to check the overuse of options.\n       (1) Change the accounting--count options as a cost. \n     Amazingly, when companies issue stock options, they do not \n     have to make a deduction to profits. This encourages \n     companies to create new options. By one common accounting \n     technique, Enron's options would have required deductions of \n     almost $2.4 billion from 1998 through 2000. That would have \n     virtually eliminated the company's profits.\n       (2) Index stock options to the market. If a company's \n     shares rise in tandem with the overall stock market, the \n     gains don't reflect any management contribution--and yet, \n     most options still increase in value. Executives get a \n     windfall. Options should reward only for gains above the \n     market.\n       (3) Don't reprice options if the stock falls. Some \n     corporate boards of directors issue new options at lower \n     prices if the company's stock falls. What's the point? \n     Options are supposed to prod executive to improve the \n     company's profits and stock price. Why protect them if they \n     fail?\n       Within limits, stock options represent a useful reward for \n     management. But we lost those limits, and options became a \n     kind of free money sprinkled about by uncritical corporate \n     directors. The unintended result was a morally lax, get-rich-\n     quick mentality. Unless companies restore limits--prodded, if \n     need be, by new government regulations--one large lesson of \n     the Enron scandal will have been lost.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, April 18, 2002]\n\n                              Money Talks\n\n       Alan Greenspan, perhaps the nation's most revered \n     economist, thinks employee stock options should be counted, \n     like salaries, as a company expense. Warren Buffet, perhaps \n     the nation's foremost investor, has long argued the same \n     line. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the expert \n     group that writes accounting rules, reached the same \n     conclusion eight years ago. The London-based International \n     Accounting Standards Board recently recommended the same \n     approach. In short, a rather unshort list of experts endorses \n     the common-sense idea that, whether you get paid in cash or \n     company cars or options, the expense should be recorded. Yet \n     today's Senate Finance Committee hearing on the issue is \n     likely to be filled with dissenting voices. There could \n     hardly be a better gauge of money's power in politics.\n       Why does this matter? Because the current rules--which \n     allow companies to grant executives and other employees \n     millions of dollars in stock options without recording a dime \n     of expenses--make a mockery of corporate accounts. Companies \n     that grant stock options lavishly can be reporting large \n     profits when the truth is that they are taking a large loss. \n     In 2000, for example, Yahoo reported a profit of $71 million, \n     but the real number after adjusting for the cost of employee \n     stock options was a loss of $1.3 billion. Cisco reported $4.6 \n     billion in profits; the real number was a $2.7 billion loss. \n     By reporting make-believe profits, companies may have conned \n     investors into bidding up their stock prices. This is one \n     cause of the Internet bubble, whose bursting helped \n     precipitate last year's economic slowdown.\n       It is not surprising, therefore, that the expert consensus \n     favors treating options as a corporate expense, which would \n     mean that reported earnings might actually reflect reality. \n     But the dissenters are intimidated by neither experts nor \n     logic. They claim that the value of options is uncertain, so \n     they\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\n     have no idea what number to put into the accounts. But the \n     price of an option can actually be calculated quite \n     precisely, and managers have no difficulty doing the math for \n     the purposes of tax reporting. The dissenters also claim that \n     options are crucial to the health of young companies. But \n     nobody wants to ban this form of compensation; the goal is \n     merely to have it counted as an expense. Finally, dissenters \n     say that options need not be so counted because granting them \n     involves no cash outlay. But giving employees something that \n     has cash value amounts to giving them cash.\n       The dissenters include weighty figures in both parties. \n     Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) is the chief opponent of options \n     sanity in the Senate, and last week President Bush himself \n     declared that Mr. Greenspan is wrong on this issue. What \n     might be behind this? Many of the corporate executives who \n     give generously to politicians are themselves the \n     beneficiaries of options--often to the tune of millions of \n     dollars. High-tech companies, an important source of campaign \n     cash, are fighting options reform with all they've got. But \n     if these lobbyists are allowed to win the argument, they will \n     undermine a key principle of the financial system. Accounting \n     rules are meant to ensure that investors get good \n     information. Without good information, they cannot know which \n     companies will best use capital, and the whole economy \n     suffers in the long run.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, March 31, 2002]\n\n                         Stock Option Excesses\n\n       In his Congressional testimony last month, Jeffrey \n     Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, offered a primer on \n     the misuses of stock options. Options, he said, are the most \n     egregious way for companies to pump up their profits \n     artificially. They also netted him a tidy $62.5 million in \n     2000 and helped Enron pay no income taxes in four of the last \n     five years.\n       Stock options, in theory, aren't a bad idea. By giving \n     employees the chance to buy a company's stock in the future \n     at today's price, corporations can provide an extra incentive \n     for hard work and can augment compensation. The New York \n     Times Company awards option to its top executives. But like \n     other rational business practices that got out of hand during \n     the boom years of the late 1990's, options have been abused \n     by some companies and are in need of reform.\n       A good place to start would be for Congress to end the \n     conflict between how the tax laws and the accounting rules \n     treat employees options. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve \n     chairman, has identified that as one of the most pressing \n     post-Enron reforms affecting corporate governance.\n       That conflict creates a loophole that has allowed companies \n     to treat stock options as essentially free money during the \n     recent dot-come bubble. A company does not have to report \n     grants of stock options as an expense on its profit-and-loss \n     statements, as it does with other forms of compensation, but \n     it can deduct the options as an expense from its tax \n     liability when employees exercise them.\n       As a result, corporate executives can award themselves \n     oodles of stock options without fear of denting their profit \n     reports. Once the options are exercised, the company can \n     treat the appreciation in the shares' value--the employees' \n     profit--as an expense for tax purposes. At Enron, stock \n     option deductions alone turned what would have been a federal \n     income tax bill of $112 million in 2000 into a $278 million \n     refund. Mr. Greenspan said last week that Federal Reserve \n     Board research found that the average earnings growth rate of \n     the S 500 companies between 1995 and 2000 would have been \n     reduced by nearly a quarter if the companies had reported \n     their stock options as expenses on financial statements.\n       A decade ago, the accounting industry proposed a sensible \n     rule to make companies report options as expenses, but it was \n     beaten back by fierce corporate lobbying. Now Senators John \n     McCain and Carl Levin have proposed a bill that would end the \n     double standard, disallowing the tax deduction for any \n     company that fails to report options as an expense.\n       They are backed in that effort by investors like Warren \n     Buffet and big institutions like pension plans, which are \n     rightly incensed by abusive executive compensation schemes. \n     They are tired of unseemly practices like the repricing of \n     options to ensure that executives still get windfalls if the \n     stock price falls. Making interest-free loans for executives \n     to acquire stock (often forgiven if the bet does not pay off) \n     is another dubious compensation practice.\n       We have no quarrel with the business lobby's claim that \n     stock options have helped fuel America's entrepreneurship, \n     particularly in Silicon Valley. But in the interest of \n     truthful accounting and greater financial integrity options \n     should be treated as what they are: a worthy form of \n     compensation that companies must report as an expense.\n       Congress must end the dot-com-era notion that options equal \n     free money. That would be a first step toward reassuring \n     investors that top executives cannot treat publicly traded \n     companies as Ponzi schemes created for their own enrichment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     [From Newsweek, May 20, 2002]\n\n                     Show Me the Money (All of it)\n\n                            (By Allan Sloan)\n\n       Watching corporate America these days is like watching \n     drunks at a revival meeting. They're vowing to sin no more, \n     to tell shareholders the straight truth instead of playing \n     accounting games, to embrace ``transparency'' so outsiders \n     can see what's going on. But talk is cheap. When it comes to \n     action on two key reforms--accounting for stock options, and \n     showing the value of chief executives' compensation \n     packages--corporations are as opaque as ever.\n       The accounting first. As things stand now, options are a \n     free lunch for companies--employees place a high value on \n     them, but companies can issue as many as they want without \n     hurting corporate profits. That's because companies don't \n     have to count options value as an expense. With reform in the \n     air because of Enron, old-math types like Warren Buffett and \n     Alan Greenspan are pushing to change accounting rules to \n     force companies to count the value of stock options as an \n     expense in their profit-and-loss statements. Accounting rule \n     makers proposed this a decade ago, but backed down under \n     political pressure generated by corporations, especially in \n     options-happy Silicon Valley. Then there's a second, little-\n     known aspect of the options-accounting debate. If companies \n     have to count the value of options as an expense, they would \n     come under huge pressure to report their value as \n     compensation to the CEO, and to members of the board. Under \n     current rules, a company has to show shareholders a table \n     that includes how much it gave the CEO in salary, bonus, \n     long-term compensation and other benefits. But the table has \n     to show only the number of options granted to the CEO, not \n     their economic value. To find that, you have to hunt on other \n     pages--and you may not find it at all if the company opts to \n     report a different way. ``The original idea was to have the \n     value of options in the table, not the number of options,'' \n     says Graef Crystal, a compensation expert who worked on the \n     disclosure rules. But, he says, the SEC backed down after \n     companies objected.\n       It's easy to see why companies would have been upset at \n     having to count options as compensation. In most pay filings \n     I see these days, the economic value of CEO and directors' \n     options exceeds their cash payments. So counting options \n     would more than double the typical package.\n       To see how this works, let's look at Dell Computer and \n     Knight Ridder, two companies I just happen to have looked at \n     recently. Dell's most recent statement shows that Michael \n     Dell, its billionaire owner and founder, earned $2.6 million \n     in salary and bonus. Not starvation wages, but not much for a \n     big-time CEO. On a different page, you see that he got \n     options the company valued at $26 million. That's major \n     moolah. Dell directors were paid a $40,000 annual retainer \n     fee, but also got options on $850,000 worth of Stock. The \n     option's economic value: around $300,000. Note that I'm not \n     accusing Dell of hiding anything--it's following the \n     rules.\n       Dell shows why options have economic value when they're \n     granted, even if the stock subsequently falls. The directors \n     got their options when Dell stock was about $52, double \n     today's price. By getting options on $850,000 of stock rather \n     than buying 16,298 shares, directors avoided losing money--\n     and didn't have to tie up $850,000. Meanwhile, they had the \n     same upside as regular investors who risked $850,000. The \n     company says its compensation packages are skewed toward \n     options, so that employees and directors don't make out \n     unless regular stockholders do.\n       Now to Knight Ridder, which has been on a cost-cutting kick \n     for years. Last year chairman Tony Ridder got $935,720 in \n     salary and no bonus. He also got options on 150,000 shares. \n     Knight Ridder values the options at about $1.6 million, but \n     by most rules of thumb, they were worth twice that much. \n     Knight Ridder directors got a $40,000 annual fee--and 4,000 \n     options. The options were worth about $42,500 by Knight \n     Ridder's math, about $85,000 by conventional math. Knight \n     Ridder says its figures are lower because it assumes its \n     options are exercised much quicker than other analysts \n     assume.\n       I'm all in favor of employees becoming millionaires via \n     options--I'm an employee, after all--but I'm also in favor of \n     companies providing profit-and-loss statements that show the \n     real profit and loss. Ignoring options' costs and low-balling \n     CEO pay packages are simply outrageous. When companies start \n     expensing options and disclosing true CEO and director \n     compensation numbers, I'll believe they've seen the light. \n     Until then, I'll assume that they're still on the bottle.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2002]\n\n                         Accounting for Options\n\n                        (By Joseph E. Stiglitz)\n\n       Deja vu. The post-Enron imbroglio over stock options is a \n     reminder that history--if forgotten--does indeed repeat \n     itself. Eight years ago, while serving on President Clinton's \n     Council of Economic Advisers, I was involved in a heated \n     debate over information disclosure. The Financial Accounting \n     Standards Board had proposed a new standard that would \n     require firms to account for the value of executive options \n     in their balance sheets and income statements.\n       When FASB made its proposal for what would have clearly \n     been an improvement in accounting practices, Silicon Valley \n     and Wall Street were united in their opposition. The \n     arguments put forward then are the same as those put forward \n     today, and they are as specious and self-serving now as they \n     were eight years ago.\n\n\n                               Outrageous\n\n       The most outrageous argument--but the one that had the \n     greatest impact--was that\n\n[[Page S6740]]\n\n     disclosing the information would adversely affect share \n     prices. That is, if people only knew how much their equity \n     claims on the firm could be diluted by options, they would \n     pay less for their shares! True, and that is precisely why \n     the disclosure is so important. Markets can only allocate \n     resources efficiently when prices accurately reflect \n     underlying values, and that requires as good information as \n     possible. If markets overestimate the value of a particular \n     set of ventures, resources will mistakenly flow in that \n     direction. This is partly what caused the dot-com and telecom \n     bubbles. Irrational exuberance played its part, but so too \n     did bad accounting--i.e., distorted information.\n       To be sure, information will never be perfect and \n     asymmetries of information are pervasive. But one of the key \n     insights of the modern theory of information is that \n     participants do not always have an incentive to disclose \n     fully and accurately all the relevant information, and so it \n     is important to have standards.\n       This is where the second specious argument enters: Critics \n     of FASB`s proposal claimed that it is impossible to value \n     options accurately, and accordingly, it would be misleading \n     to include the options within the standard accounting \n     frameworks. To better understand the falsity of this \n     argument, let's take a closer look at how stock options \n     really work.\n       The basic economics of stock options are simple. Issuing \n     stock options does not create resources out of thin air. \n     Executives like stock options because they have value. But \n     the value however measured, comes at the expense of other \n     shareholders. The right of managers to buy shares is the \n     right to dilute the ownership claims of existing \n     shareholders. When markets work well--when information is \n     good--the market will value today the issuance of a right to \n     dilute, even when that dilution may never occur, and if it \n     does occur, would happen sometime in the future.\n       The existing owners of the firm will participate less in \n     the upside potential of the market them they would have in \n     the absence of the options. In principle, they can calculate \n     the circumstances when the executives are likely to exercise \n     their options, and therefore can calculate the diminution in \n     their potential gains from owning shares in the company. That \n     is why when this information is disclosed in ways that can \n     easily be understood by investors, it will lead to a fall in \n     the company's share price.\n       Making such calculations, however, is not easy or costless. \n     In principle, each shareholder could go through each of the \n     items in the firm's accounts to construct his own \n     ``estimates'' but that would be a foolish waste of resources, \n     and the transaction costs would put a major damper on capital \n     markets and the market economy. That is why we have \n     accounting standards. Such information is like a public good: \n     Better standards--more transparency--lead to better resource \n     allocation and better functioning markets; and if \n     participants have more confidence in markets, they will be \n     more willing to entrust their money to markets.\n       Which brings us back to the argument that it is \n     ``impossible'' to value options. Companies do, of course, \n     have ways of calculating the value of options and do it \n     themselves all the time for their own internal planning \n     purposes.\n       AS for the question of whether an estimate based on a \n     publicly-disclosed formula would be misleading, because it is \n     only an estimate, that is true of many line items that are \n     central to our accounting frameworks, such as depreciation, \n     `Calculations about the value of options would be just as, or \n     even more, accurate than standard depreciation estimates are \n     of the market value of the declines in asset values that come \n     with use and obsolescence--something which is a line item on \n     every accounting framework in corporate America and most of \n     the world. Of this much we can be sure: zero, the implied \n     valuation used by companies now when describing the cost of \n     options in their balance sheets and income statements, is a \n     vast underestimate.\n       Those who argue against including options within the \n     standard accounting frameworks try to have it both ways: They \n     believe that market participants are smart enough to read \n     through dozens of footnotes to figure out the implications of \n     options for the value of their shares, but so dumb that they \n     would be misled by the more accurate numbers that would be \n     provided under the reform proposals, and unable to redo the \n     calculations themselves.\n\n\n                              Transparency\n\n       There is one more reason for the U.S. to be resolute in \n     improving our accounting standards by including better \n     accounting for options. During the East Asia crisis the U.S. \n     preached the virtues of transparency but then refused to do \n     anything about regulating the murky world of offshore \n     banking. America also preached the virtues of our accounting \n     standards only to find that the world was laughing at Enron \n     and Arthur Andersen. Tightening our rules on accounting of \n     options would signal that the U.S. is serious about openness, \n     serious about improving its accounting standards--despite the \n     special interests opposed to changes--and willing to learn \n     from its mistakes.\n       Many of the same forces that allied themselves in the 1990s \n     against changes in accounting for options are now trying to \n     suppress this attempt to make our market economy work better. \n     In the earlier episode, the National Economic Council, the \n     U.S. Treasury, and the Department of Commerce intervened in \n     what was supposed to be an independent accounting board, and \n     put pressure on FASB to rescind its proposed regulations. \n     They won, and the country lost. Today, there is a risk once \n     again of political intervention. At least this time, the \n     voices of responsible economic leadership, such as Alan \n     Greenspan, are speaking out. I only hope that this time they \n     will succeed.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Republican staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee put out a report called, ``Understanding the Stock Option \nDebate.''\n  They have gone through a lengthy analysis dated July 9, 2002, in \nwhich they conclude the following:\n\n       Existing accounting principles provide an unambiguous \n     answer. Stock option awards should indeed be treated as a \n     cost in financial statements.\n\n  It is quite clear to me that two things are true. No. 1, that how we \ntreat stock options is an essential part of the post-Enron reform \neffort. That is No. 1. No. 2, it seems clear to me that there is at \nleast a likelihood that a majority of this body, if allowed to vote on \nthis amendment, will vote to refer this matter to an independent \naccounting standards board which has its own source of revenue, free \nfrom the kind of pressure which it was under in 1994 and 1995, to reach \nan appropriate conclusion.\n  Do I believe that conclusion will be the same as they reached in \n1994? I do. It is very clear to me they would reach such a conclusion \nand should reach such a conclusion. But as our colleagues have pointed \nout, that is up to the board under this amendment. We would not be \nadopting a standard.\n  In all honesty, I expect they would continue on the same course they \nwere on 8 years ago when they were violently thrown off course by \npeople who had control over the purse strings of the organization. I \nwould expect that would happen. But under this amendment, it is their \ncall, not ours.\n  I support the McCain amendment because I believe, as I believed then, \nthat the accounting standards board wanted to expense options and that \nwe, in executive pressure, interfered with that decision on their part. \nThat is why I believe Senator McCain's amendment is also appropriate. \nBut we cannot even get a vote on that amendment. Last week, we were not \nable to bring that amendment to a vote.\n  But this amendment is different. This amendment says to the \nindependent board: review this issue. Make an appropriate decision \nwithin a year.\n  For the life of me I not only do not see how folks--regardless of the \nside of this particular issue that they are on--could vote against such \nan amendment when it does not tell them what to do but just asks them \nto review it and decide within a year as to what the appropriate \naccounting method is. I do not understand why, in the middle of a \ndebate on the reforms which are essential to restore public confidence \nafter the Enron fiasco, this Senate should not be allowed to vote on \nthis issue on this bill.\n  When the majority leader announced that one way or another we will \nget to a vote on this amendment, I was glad to hear that. I didn't know \nhe was going to say that, but I certainly was glad he said that. But it \nseems to me that adds a reason we ought to vote for this amendment on \nthis bill.\n  This is the right place. Surely it is the right time. There has \nperhaps never been a more critical moment in our economic history in \nthe last few decades than we are facing right now, to help us restore \npublic confidence. It will be an additional contribution to that \nrestoration of public confidence if we take this action. If we say yes, \n8 years ago we did intervene, but now we don't want to tell the \naccounting standards board that they should not expense options. That \nwas 8 years ago. What we are telling them now is: Do the right thing.\n  We know what they tried to do 8 years ago. It is laid out in the \nrecord by them. They wanted to do what they believed was the right \nthing. If they had done so, they would have been put out of business.\n  Now we have an opportunity, it seems to me, to do the right thing \nourselves, which is to tell the board that has the responsibility to \nadopt accounting standards, to adopt what they believe is the \nappropriate standard. That is the right thing to do.\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the stock market, the Dow as of \nnow is down 338 points as of today?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was not aware of that. But it surely adds an additional \nurgency, if we need additional urgency, for why we should do everything \nin our power to restore public confidence in the financial systems in \nthis country.\n  I left off one of my cosponsors before. Senator Biden is a cosponsor \nof the amendment, which is at the desk.\n  I will ask unanimous consent we be able to vote on that at a later \nmoment.\n  I wonder if I could ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand Senator McCain would like to speak at this \ntime. I see the Republican manager on the floor, so I do not know if \nthis fits his particular timetable or not.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to yield to Senator McCain on \nhis----\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to lay \naside the pending second-degree amendment, No. 4286, and call up for \nconsideration my amendment 4283, on stock options, which is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Edwards amendment No. 4187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nthere is something on which I agree with the majority leader. That is, \nat some point we are going to make a judgment on this issue. But we are \ncurrently in a situation where we have 97 first-degree amendments that \nhave been filed. We have 24 second-degree amendments. We have 3 \ndifferent approaches to this issue.\n  Senator McCain wants to make a decision and set a policy.\n  Senator Levin, as I read it, wants a fair trial and then a hanging.\n  And Senator Enzi and others would simply like to have a fair trial.\n  What is the right outcome? I think that is subject to debate. That is \nwhy I think we ought to have the debate. The idea that when we have \nthree different approaches, we are going to decide that one of them is \ngoing to be debated on, voted on, but not all three of them is \nsomething we should not expect to happen.\n  I do not support Senator McCain's amendment, but he has every right, \nit seems to me, to have it considered. And I am certainly willing to \nvote on it. There may be people who do not want to vote on this issue, \nbut I am not one of them. So I certainly do object. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the only way we are going to get to debate \nand votes is if we allow the pending amendments which are the first- \nand second-degree amendments to be voted on so we can move to other \namendments without having one gatekeeper denying opportunity for all \nthe others on this floor to offer amendments and have them voted on. \nThat is not the intention of cloture and postcloture.\n  I do not believe this process has been used in this way before, \nwhere, postcloture, germane amendments are supposed to be taken up and \nvoted on, where first- and second-degree amendments have not been \ndisposed of so they can be used, not with the consent of their \nsponsors, but they are used by others to block consideration of the \namendments.\n  The Senator from Texas says he would like to have a debate and vote. \nThere is one way to do it. Let's dispose of the second-degree \namendment, take up the Carnahan amendment and vote on it, take up the \nEdwards amendment and vote on it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield on the Senator's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom Michigan is claiming his 1 hour. I understand he has been yielding \nback and forth. I assume we could, under these circumstances, have one \nSenator run the entire 30 hours, as long as they keep yielding to other \nSenators.\n  There are others of us, of course, who want to be heard and who want \nto offer amendments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I think that is fair. I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think if we want to deal with this issue \ntoday, probably the way to deal with it is to have a unanimous consent \nagreement and have a vote on all three amendments--have a vote on \nSenator McCain's amendment, have a vote on the Levin amendment, have a \nvote on Senator Enzi's amendment so that we would have the full range \nof choices. But to suggest that nothing is standing in the way except a \nfew obstacles to everybody having their will is to neglect the fact \nthat 97 amendments have been filed as first-degree amendments and 24 \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  So, therefore, by definition, I assume if I suggest and ask unanimous \nconsent that each and every amendment be voted on, someone would object \nsince our leadership has plans for this week and next week. I think it \nmight be possible if we want to deal with this issue today to have a \nunanimous consent agreement where Senator McCain would get a vote on \nhis amendment, where the Senator from Michigan would get a vote on his \namendment, and where Senator Enzi would get a vote on his amendment. \nThen we would have a range of choices.\n  I would be amenable to such an agreement if the Senator wanted to \nshop that around on his side of the aisle. We could do a hotline and \nsee if it would fly. But in the absence of some agreement where the \nother two gradations on this spectrum of opinion would have their day \nto debate this amendment and have it voted on, I don't think we are \ngoing to be able to do that. It might very well be that we need a \nseparate bill to deal with this issue. If a Senator were to offer this \namendment in earnest, I would want an opportunity to amend it. I think \nhaving FASB look at this issue--which they are certainly going to do \nafter this bill is agreed to because this is going to be a self-funded \nagency, and they are going to have greater independence--I think having \nthem look at it is something that we ought to do. But I think we \nshouldn't pretend to ourselves that the Levin amendment is a neutral \namendment.\n  Asking them to look at it when it mandates by law after having looked \nat it that within 12 months they adopt in appropriate generally \naccepted accounting principles for the treatment of employee stock \noptions--there is nothing neutral about that; in other words, study it \nand within a year adopt a rule.\n  As I understand it, Senator Enzi and others would have the SEC do a \nstudy and make a recommendation based on their study.\n  If this amendment were going to be dealt with in isolation, I would \nwant an opportunity to at least leave it to FASB as to what they \ndetermine rather than mandating that they ought to issue a new \naccounting principle. It may be that they would determine not to do \nthat.\n  Let me reiterate that I don't have any concern about voting on this \nissue. Maybe I should reserve my time. I want to speak on this at some \npoint. We have several Members here who are going to speak. I have to \nbe here for the whole time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I don't think this is necessary. But so there is no \nquestion about it, I ask unanimous consent that the time Senator \nDaschle used be counted against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I did not hear.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted Senator Daschle's time to be counted against the \n30 hours.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are in a postcloture period of some 30\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\nhours. I understand we will complete that at 6 o'clock or so this \nafternoon.\n  What is happening here is really an outrage, from my standpoint. We \nare in postcloture. I have a germane amendment. I have been here every \nsingle day since this bill came to the floor of the Senate prepared and \nready to offer my amendment. Now, postcloture, I have a germane \namendment. And the only way, apparently, that I can offer my amendment \nis if the Senator from Texas is willing to allow me to offer it. That \nis not the way the Senate should work.\n  I want to briefly describe my amendment.\n  My amendment requires the disgorgement of profits, bonuses, \nincentives and so on that the CEOs of corporations receive 12 months \nprior to bankruptcy.\n  That is not in the bill at the present time. It ought to be in the \nbill.\n  The bill contains a disgorgement provision requiring the return of \nincentives and bonus payments received prior to a restatement of \nearnings. I support that being in the bill, but there is nothing about \nthe requirement to divest all those bonuses and incentive payments 12 \nmonths prior to bankruptcy. That ought to be in this bill.\n  Let me describe some of the problems that we are dealing with. We \nhave been holding some hearings over in the Commerce Committee on the \nsubject of Enron. Here is what some Enron officers got before Enron \nwent bankrupt:\n  Kenneth Lay, $101 million; Ken Rice, $72.7 million; Jeffrey Skilling, \n$66.9 million; Stan Horton, $45 million; Andy Fastow, $30.4 million.\n  They did pretty well at the top. Of course, they have already filed \nbankruptcy with their corporation.\n  Should some of this be given back?\n  I have a constituent in North Dakota who wrote to me and said: I \nworked for Enron for a good many years. I built up a retirement fund of \n$330,000. It is now worth $1,700. That was my family's retirement fund. \nWhat am I to do? I have lost it all.\n  But not everybody lost it all with respect to Enron. Those close to \nthe top made a fortune, and the folks at the bottom lost their shirts. \nMost of the investors and employees lost everything.\n  The question I ask with my amendment is, Should we include a \nprovision in this bill that requires the give-back of this unwarranted \ncompensation in the form of bonuses, incentives, and various things 12 \nmonths prior to bankruptcy? The answer is, of course, we should require \nit. We ought not to be debating this. This amendment ought to be \naccepted.\n  Let me describe some of the other folks who believe this ought to be \ndone.\n  Mr. Richard Breeden, former SEC Chairman from 1989-1993 says:\n\n       We have long required officers and directors to disgorge \n     ``short-swing'' profits for purchases and sales within a six-\n     month period . . . we should consider disgorgement to the \n     company of any net proceeds of stock sales or option \n     exercises within six-months or a year prior to bankruptcy \n     filing.\n\n  That is Mr. Breeden, former SEC Chairman.\n  Henry Paulson, CEO, Goldman Sachs, who worked in the Nixon \nadministration, said:\n\n       The business community has been given a black eye by the \n     activities of and behavior of some CEOs and other notable \n     insiders who sold large numbers of shares just before \n     dramatic declines in their companies' share prices . . . in \n     the case of CEOs and other inside directors, we should raise \n     the bar and mandate a one year ``claw-back'' in the case of \n     bankruptcy, regardless of the reason.\n\n  He is right. This bill doesn't require it. There is no ``claw-back'' \nin this bill. There ought to be 1 year prior to bankruptcy.\n  I don't mean to diminish the importance of other issues that we have \njust discussed. The other issues are very important. On the issue of \nhow stock options are treated, in 1994, I was one of nine Senators who \nvoted against the proposal back then that would handcuff FASB. I come \nto that issue with fairly clean hands.\n  Let me say that while that issue is important, I have been here every \nsingle day this bill has been on the floor to offer this simple \namendment on disgorgement in the face of bankruptcies. If there are \npeople in corporations at the top of those companies who make $100 \nmillion or $70 million or $50 million, and then the company files for \nbankruptcy, do you not believe that some of that ought to be required \nto be given back? The folks at the bottom lost everything they had. \nThey lost their life savings. They lost everything, and the folks at \nthe top got rich. Shouldn't there be a requirement in this bill to \ndisgorge those profits? Does anybody think that is unreasonable?\n\n  The Senator from Texas left the Chamber as I was beginning to speak. \nI was hoping I might get his attention. But as I understand where we \nare, we have a first- and a second-degree amendment. The first-degree \namendment is the Edwards amendment. It is followed by a second-degree \namendment, which is the Carnahan amendment.\n  In order for anyone to offer an amendment postcloture today, we must \nask consent to set aside these amendments so we can offer our \namendment. My understanding is, if someone here does not agree with \nthat, then he can prevent that from happening. My understanding is that \nthat is precisely what would happen.\n  So the result is, for the next 5 hours, we will have gatekeepers who \nrequire us to say: Captain, may I? May I offer an amendment? And they \nwill say: No, you may not. We will not allow the setting aside of the \npending amendments.\n  So we will limp along to the end of the 30 hours not being able to \noffer germane amendments to this bill. It is outrageous, simply an \noutrageous process that puts us here. I think there will be a good \nnumber of Members of the Senate who, in the future, will consider this \nand find ways to avoid our being put in this position again.\n  But what I would like to do is have a debate about this amendment at \nsome point. And perhaps there are people in the Senate who want to \nstand up and say: Do you know what I think? I think if somebody takes \nhome $50 or $80 million 6 months before bankruptcy, in the form of \nincentive payments and bonuses, they ought to be able to keep it, even \nif they drove this company right straight into the ground.\n  Is there one person who will stand up in the Senate today to support \nthat? Does one person want to support that position? Well, we will see.\n  In the year before the Enron Corporation filed for bankruptcy, \nKenneth Lay, the chairman of that company, and 140 other company \nofficials received $310 million in salaries, bonuses, long-term \nincentives, loan advances, and other payments.\n  Does anybody here want to stand up and say: ``That makes a lot of \nsense.''? Anybody? Does anybody agree they should keep all that money? \nDo we hear nothing because they don't have the floor, or is it that \nnobody here believes the top officials of Enron should keep $310 \nmillion prior to filing for bankruptcy, where their employees lost they \njobs, lost their life savings in their 401(k)s, their investors lost \ntheir money?\n  How about NTL, Incorporated? It is a Manhattan TV cable operator that \nfiled for bankruptcy in May, just several months after it gave its \nchief executive officer $18.9 million. It made him one of the 30 \nhighest paid CEOs in New York, putting him ahead of IBM's Louis \nGerstner. That company had $14 billion in losses. And the CEO, Mr. \nKnapp, had a salary of $277,000, a bonus of $561,000, and stock options \nworth $18 million.\n  So does anybody here think he ought to keep all that money, just let \nthe investors and the employees lose, but the people at the top keep \nit--just walk away on some gilded, golden carpet?\n  There are plenty of other examples, of course.\n  In recent months, we have heard all of these discussions about what \nhas happened at the top in the boardroom by companies that wanted to \nfind the line, and then go right to it, and then go across it, if they \ncould. And there are accounting firms that were the enablers, who said: \nYes, go ahead and do that. And the law firms were on the side, \ncollecting big fees, saying: Yes, go ahead and do that--and the CEOs \nwithout moral conscience. The result is, they got rich and the little \nfolks got broke.\n\n  My amendment is very simple. My amendment says that 1 year prior to \nbankruptcy, if you are getting the big bucks, big bonuses, big \nincentives, big stock options, and you want to take off with $50 or \n$100 million, and leave everybody else flat on their back, you cannot \ndo it; you have to give it back. Very simple.\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\n  No one can misunderstand the amendment. This amendment is not strange \nor foreign to anyone. This bill will fall short of the mark, this bill \nwill be incomplete, if we just proceed now to the final vote this \nafternoon and we are told: You cannot offer this amendment. We will not \nconsider this amendment. And we do not want to require the give-back of \nmillions of dollars by CEOs who receive that money prior to bankruptcy.\n  If that is the message this Senate sends from this bill this \nafternoon, this Senate has a lot of explaining to do.\n  We came to this debate with great promise. I have been to the floor a \ncouple of times complimenting the Banking Committee, complimenting all \non the Banking Committee who worked to put this bill together. But I \nsaid there were areas where it needed to be improved. This is one of \nthem. This is the lightest load you will ever be asked to carry, in my \njudgment, to support an amendment of this type: The disgorgement of \nill-earned profits by CEOs who led their corporations to bankruptcy but \nwaltzed off with millions of dollars in their pockets and left everyone \nelse--the bondholders, the stockholders, the employees--holding the \nbag.\n  This is not heavy lifting, to do this amendment. It is absurd if the \nSenate says: No, we will have nothing to do with that. Our position is, \nlet's call this corporate responsibility. Let's change the accounting \nstandards. But, by the way, let's let those people who essentially \nlooted the corporation from the top--drove it into bankruptcy, and then \nleft town--let's give them a big wave and say: So long, God bless you, \nand I hope your future is a good one with all those millions of \ndollars. If we do that, this Senate has a lot of explaining to do.\n  A good many corporate leaders, respected business officials in this \ncountry, have said this must be in a bill, this should be in a bill, \nthere is no excuse for it not being in a bill.\n  So I have amendment No. 4214 at the desk. Let me ask unanimous \nconsent that we set aside the Carnahan amendment, which is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Edwards amendment, for the purpose of allowing \nconsideration of amendment No. 4214. Let me make the first unanimous \nconsent request first.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the Carnahan second-degree \namendment for the purpose of considering my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wyden). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. On behalf of the ranking member of the Banking Committee, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say, again, I think the process is \nan outrage--an outrage. We are in a situation today where we have 4 or \n5 hours left postcloture, and we are told that no one in the Senate has \na right to offer an amendment because someone has set himself up as a \ngatekeeper saying: I will object to setting aside the Carnahan second-\ndegree amendment.\n  What kind of a way is that to legislate? Is someone afraid he will \nlose on this amendment, that he will lose the vote? Is that the purpose \nof the objection, that he is afraid we will have a vote, Senators will \nvote for my amendment, and therefore he will lose, so the words ``I \nobject'' become a proxy for avoiding a loss on an important amendment?\n  How many votes do you think would exist in the Senate for saying: We \nwant to enable CEOs, who ran the corporation into the ground and took \n$20 million out and then filed bankruptcy, to keep the money; we want \nthem to keep the bonus, to keep the stock option, to keep the \ncommission payment, to keep the money? How many votes do you think \nexist for that? Ten, maybe 12? Probably zero.\n  I think the Senator from Virginia is correct. Probably no one would \nstand up and support that proposition. So the question is why are we \nnot allowing amendments to be voted on this afternoon? I would be happy \nto yield to someone to answer that. Is there someone who can answer \nthat? Perhaps we could find out on whose behalf the Senator from \nWyoming objected.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 29 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry: Are we entitled, as a Senator, to \n1 hour postcloture, those of us who are recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Several of my colleagues wish to speak. I want them to be \nable to speak. I hope they will offer amendments.\n  I will guarantee them this: I will not be objecting to an amendment \nif they want to offer them. They have a right to offer an amendment \ntoday. They have a right to get a vote on the amendment. I will not \nobject to that.\n  The parliamentary inquiry is, I have just made a unanimous consent \nrequest that has been objected to. Am I prevented from making an \nidentical request following the presentation by the two Senators on the \nfloor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is not prevented from making \nunanimous consent requests.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That will give me some time then to snoop around the \ncloakrooms and the corners and the nooks and crannies in the Capitol to \nfind out who won't come to the floor and answer the question I have \nasked.\n  Why will we not get a vote on the simple proposition that those \ncorporate leaders who run their corporation into bankruptcy and who \ntake $10, $20, $30, or $50 million out of it just prior to bankruptcy--\nwhy will we not allow a vote on an amendment that would require them to \ndisgorge themselves of that profit? Why should that ill-gotten gain not \nbe used to help the employees, help the investors, help others recover, \nwho lost everything? Why should one group in this circumstance walk off \ninto the sunset with a pocketful of gold, leaving everyone in their \nwake, employees, investors, and others who lost everything they had?\n  Perhaps in the next hour or so, I will find someone in the Chamber or \nin the anterooms who will say: I am the one who decided you should not \nget a vote because I believe that those CEOs ought to be able to get \naway with that money; that is the American way.\n  My guess is the Senator from Virginia was right when he shook his \nhead. I think this amendment passes 100 to nothing or very close to \nthat, and I hope he and others will help me get it to a vote before 6 \no'clock.\n  Obviously I am a little irritated about the process. It stinks. That \nis not a genteel way to say that. But postcloture, if we have germane \namendments, we should be able to be here to offer those amendments. \nThat is not now the case.\n  I will be here the next couple of hours trying to see if we can find \na way to cause enough trouble in as short a time as possible to allow \nthese amendments to be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to use a portion of my 1 hour \nof time to say I agree with the purpose and the intent of the Dorgan \namendment. I understand Senator Grassley of Iowa has a similar \namendment that would disgorge or claw back into some ill-gotten gains \nof executives for the benefit of creditors and victims of their \nmalfeasance or illegal acts.\n  I wish to speak not on process. Although, process seems to drive a \nlot of what happens in this body.\n  I would like to talk to my colleagues and the American people about \nthe merits of certain ideas or the demerits of certain ideas that have \nbeen raised. There have been several measures dealing with the issue of \nstock options.\n  Senator McCain's measure was a direct hit. I don't like it, but it \nwas an accountable approach in getting rid of or killing stock options. \nWe had Senator Levin's amendment, with Senator McCain, which was more \nof an indirect or ricochet killing of stock options by granting that \nstudy to FASB, when everyone knows what FASB's position is.\n  There is another option regarding stock options which I would like to \ndiscuss as the approach that ought to be taken. The majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, mentioned that we may have a vote on it today. We may \nhave a vote on it tomorrow, but some day we will have a vote. There \nought to be a full and fair discussion of the approach we ought to take \nas well as what the potential adverse impacts could be if either the \nstudy by FASB or the direct\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nkilling of stock options, as far as requiring the expensing of them, \nwere to occur.\n  The more wise and prudent approach is one that was chiefly sponsored \nby my good friend Senator Enzi of Wyoming, along with Senators \nLieberman, Boxer, myself, and others who joined with us, Senators \nMurray, Cantwell, Bennett, Wyden, Lott, Burns, Frist, Craig and Ensign. \nOur amendment is a more comprehensive, reasonable alternative that has \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission review and make regulatory or \nlegislative recommendations to Congress.\n  Clearly, in today's climate, with the stock market dropping again \ntoday, with the scandals from Global Crossing, Enron, the crisis at \nWorldCom, it is axiomatic that there is a pressing need for accounting \nreform to address the corporate abuses and accounting firm malfeasance. \nThe bill, as it is presented, is a very good bill. I think it addresses \nthe two key areas that need to be addressed.\n  It is focused, number one, on transparency. That means that people \ncan readily and easily discern the true financial condition of a \ncompany in which they may want to invest.\n  Secondly, you need deterrence, stiffer criminal and civil sanctions \nfor illegal actions by corporate officers. There may be a few things \nadded to make it better, but this bill essentially addresses those two \nfocused goals. Indeed, enhanced transparency and improved corporate \ngovernance may restore some investor confidence and foster proper \ndisclosure for investment decisions. More stringent penalties will \nprovide a deterrence and substantial disincentive for the corporate \nwrongdoing that has led to this understandable firestorm of skepticism \nas a fallout from the scandalous, fraudulent misrepresentations by \nexecutives in many companies.\n  In our effort to reform, we must not enact measures that stifle \ninnovation and endanger the American entrepreneurial spirit. Congress \nshould not harm future opportunities for employees to own a part of \ntheir company for whom they work. Unfortunately, the Levin-McCain \namendment does just that by unjustifiably upsetting the current tax \ntreatment of stock options. It is unnecessary and unwise to change \nthese particular accounting policies.\n  It is virtually impossible to accurately determine the worth or value \nof a stock option.\n  Now, how are you going to predict the future performance of a \ncompany? How are you going to predict the future share value of a \ncompany, especially with the vicissitudes of the stock market these \ndays? For example, somebody is granted a stock option by a company--a \nnew company--and the stock is trading, after an IPO, at $5 a share. The \noption to this employee is to be able to purchase 1,000 shares of that \ncompany at $10 a share.\n  Now, nobody is going to exercise a stock option until the share value \nreaches the strike price, or $10, and it may never get to $10. It may \ntake 5 years before that share value gets above $10 a share, where \nsomebody would exercise the option. So it is very difficult to \ndetermine what is the actual value of that stock option when it is \ngranted.\n  The amendment Mr. Levin has proposed will affect current law. \nCurrently employers are not required to expense stock option grants on \ntheir financial statements. But they are permitted to deduct the \nemployees' gains at exercise--that is, down the road--as a compensation \nexpense.\n  Now, this makes good sense. After all, a stock option grant does not \nrequire a cash outlay like other expenses such as wages.\n  Moreover, there is no transparency problem with failing to expense \nstock option grants because they are disclosed on the company's \nfinancial statement. If somebody says there ought to be better \ndisclosure, or it should be in bolder print, or it should be \nhighlighted more and the disclosure needs to be more clear, that is \nfine. But I don't think it is necessary, in the midst of better \ndisclosure and transparency, to kill this otherwise largely salutary \nidea and beneficial idea of stock options. Nonetheless, the amendments \nby Senators McCain and Levin mandate that any company taking a \ndeduction must report the stock option as an expense on their income \nstatement, profit and loss statement, and the deduction may not exceed \nthe reported expense.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator aware that the Levin-McCain amendment he is \nreferring to is not the amendment being offered at this time? There is \nanother amendment, and they are totally different matters involving the \ntaxation issue. This is not a taxation amendment at all. Hopefully, it \nwill come before the Senate today.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Michigan, I \nunderstand his amendment offered today was one to have FASB study the \nissue. Senator McCain's amendment was one to require the expensing of \nstock options. I realize they are two different matters.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that neither one addresses tax issues. That is a \ntotally separate bill, not in either the McCain-Levin or the Levin-\nMcCain accounting standard.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator that in the event you, in effect, \nrequire the expenses of stock options, that does affect the tax \ntreatment and the desirability of stock options.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  Now, the problematic aspect of these ideas is that, if you take away \nthe current method of accounting and taxation of stock options, a \ncompany can only take a deduction up to the amount they expense at the \ntime of the grant. Since the expense would be taken at the time of the \ngrant, the tax deduction would be taken at the time of the exercise. If \nthe value was too low at the time of the grant, then you are not going \nto get the full extent of your deduction. So the point is that if we \nare not careful here, with all these approaches of changing the tax \ntreatment, changing the expensing rules, or having it be done by FASB, \nthe result is a convoluted tax increase on companies.\n\n  Now, what will happen if these tax increases or this inability to \nactually determine the value of the stock option occurs, which may or \nmay not be exercised at some unknown future date, all of this \nconsternation, inaccuracy, unpredictability--the potential of actually \na tax increase, in effect--many companies will find this tax and \naccounting scheme is so onerous they will discontinue offering options \nto all but maybe a few senior executives who can bargain for them.\n  I think the idea of doing away with stock options, or making them \nless desirable, is a substantial detrimental impact on not only \ncompanies but many, particularly those companies in the high-tech \nsector and small startups. New businesses have powered our economy in \nthe last decade and, hopefully, they will do so in the future. Small \ncompanies motivate employees with stock options. That is the way they \nkeep employees. Especially the startups who will get folks to serve on \nthe board and pay them for that service in stock options.\n  I think it is a good idea for people to care about a company doing \nwell in the future; not only looking for a paycheck, but also caring \nabout how well a company will do.\n  Indeed, in the last 10 years, the number of workers who received \nstock options has grown dramatically--from about 1 million in 1992 to \n10 million today. First, as I said, the benefits of stock options has \nenabled companies to recruit and keep quality workers. Absent stock \noptions, many smaller companies lack the capital. They don't have the \nmoney to attract top-notch talent. Investors will be less likely to \ninvest in companies that retain stock option plans because the \ncompany's earnings will be artificially deflated by this phantom \nexpense.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important, stock options enhance \nproductivity by providing employees with a greater stake in their \ncompany's performance.\n  Mr. President, these options are particularly important to rank and \nfile employees who receive relatively modest salaries and wages. There \nis one company that has a pretty good presence in Virginia--Electronic \nArts--which recently told me that stock options enabled many of its \nemployees to purchase their first homes, to send their children to \ncollege, or to provide for their aging parents. Thus, the desirability \nof stock options as incentives is\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nreadily apparent, and we should not adopt any measure that would \neffectively eliminate their use as a form of employee compensation.\n  That is not to say that I oppose all stock option reform. In fact, I \nfully support President Bush's proposal that requires shareholder \napproval for stock option plans. I think the idea of equitable \ntreatment in the exercise of options by employees or executives is well \nfounded. But I am joining with Senators Lieberman, Boxer, Enzi, and \nothers in offering the amendment that directs the Securities and \nExchange Commission to conduct a comprehensive study and to make \nrecommendations regarding the accounting treatment of stock options, \nwhich is the way to go.\n  We may introduce this proposal as a free-standing bill. Maybe we will \nnot vote on it today but here is the approach that we ought to take. \nThe SEC will conduct an analysis and make regulatory and legislative \nrecommendations on the treatment of stock options in which the \nCommission shall analyze the following: No. 1, the accounting treatment \nfor employees' stock options, including the accuracy of available stock \noption pricing models; No. 2, the adequacy of current disclosure \nrequirements to investors and shareholders on stock options; No. 3, the \nadequacy of corporate governance requirements, including shareholder \napproval of stock option plans; No. 4, any need for new stock holding \nperiod requirements for senior executives; No. 5, the benefit and \ndetriment of any new option expenses rules on, A, the productivity and \nperformance of large, medium, and small companies and startup \nenterprises and, B, the recruitment and retention of skilled workers.\n  The Commission shall submit its regulatory and legislative \nrecommendations to Congress and supporting analyses of those matters as \nfar as any changes indicated in the treatment of stock options within \n180 days.\n  In my view, this is the reasonable alternative we ought to be taking. \nI urge my colleagues to support this approach rather than adopting, \nwhether it is today or in the future, Senator McCain's measure that he \nintroduced last week or Senator Levin's study today. I think either of \nthose would be harmful and damaging to both American industry and to \nworking men and women.\n  The Senator from Michigan mentioned evidence, or observations, of \nothers as to the impact of his recommendations and his amendment. I \nthink it is very good for us to look at what people who will be \naffected say about the measures that are passed in the Senate. I think \nit is important that we be accountable to those who are affected and we \nshould listen to them.\n  I have some other observations, as far as the issue of stock options \nis concerned. This first I will share is the views of the Information \nTechnology Industry Council. They expressed their support for the \npotential alternative amendment cosponsored by Senators Lieberman, \nEnzi, Boxer, and Allen that would direct the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to examine the accounting treatment of stock options and \nmake recommendations.\n  The Information Technology Industry Council stated that, in \nparticular, those entrepreneurial high-tech companies that are willing \nto take the risk in the pursuit of technological innovation have \noffered stock options as an incentive to attract and retain employees.\n  Unfortunately, the expensing of options would end the practice of \nproviding most employees with stock options. The result would be a \nreversal of the trends toward employee ownership and a significant \nreduction in financial opportunities for thousands of workers.\n  Let me share another observation, and this comes from the \nTelecommunications Industry Association, and I read, in part:\n\n       This sense of personal ownership referring to stock options \n     helps develop the innovative entrepreneurial spirit that has \n     characterized the high tech industry over the last decade. \n     Should the rules for options suddenly change and be treated \n     as a cash expense, the number of employees that receive the \n     benefit would be drastically reduced, most likely leaving \n     only members of the top management as recipients.\n\n  They conclude with this comment:\n       Adoption of this type of measure is a knee jerk reaction to \n     situations such as occurred with Enron, which is not what we \n     need. It is not in the best long-term interest of our \n     country.\n\n  Another observation from a large group of trade associations: \nAmerican Electronic Association, Bankers Association, Alabama \nInformation Technology Association, the Arizona Software and Internet \nAssociation, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Business Software \nAlliance, Information Technology Association of America, National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Retail Federation, Semiconductor \nEquipment and Materials International, as well as the Semiconductor \nIndustry Association, Software and Information Industry Association, \nSoftware Finance and Tax Executives Council, the Tax Council, the \nTechnology Network, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote me and said \nthat the stock options tax bill--not the Levin amendment but, rather, \nthe tax treatment changes--that legislation would, if enacted, \ndiscourage broad-based rank and file access to stock options. It would \nlead to investor confusion, less accurate financial statements, and \nraise taxes on companies issuing stock options.\n  Now we have heard also some scholarly points of view. It is nice to \nhear what some of these esteemed individuals may say from time to time \non the issue of stock options. Others in the body have quoted from \nWarren Buffett, a person for whom we all have a great deal of respect. \nBut in another scholarly work from two gentlemen, economics professors \nat Princeton University and New York University, Dr. Malkiel, professor \nof economics at Princeton, and Dr. Baumol, professor of economics at \nNew York University, say this:\n\n       Warren Buffett and other critics suggest that the income \n     statement should reflect an expense to the firm measured by \n     the cash equivalent value of options. There are two problems \n     with these views. First, if we were to consider the expense \n     of options to be equivalent to that of cash wages, there is \n     no way to measure that cost, the value of options at the time \n     they are issued, with any reasonable precision. The Nobel \n     Prize winning Black-Scholes model does an excellent job of \n     predicting the prices at which short-term options trade in \n     the market, but the Black-Scholes formula does not provide \n     reliable estimates for longer term options such as those \n     lasting 6 months to one year, and market prices often differ \n     substantially from predicted values. Because employee stock \n     options have durations of 5 to 10 years, are complicated by \n     not investing immediately, are contingent on continuing \n     employment and subject to various restrictions, it is \n     virtually impossible to put a precise estimate on the options \n     value. Moreover, employees' options cannot be sold, violating \n     one of the key Black-Scholes assumptions.\n\n  They conclude by saying that by targeting all stock options rather \nthan stock option abuses, politicians are risking destruction of equity \ncompensation instruments that have been engines of innovation and \nentrepreneurship.\n  Finally, an observation today from the Software Finance and Tax \nExecutives Council. They call themselves by the acronym SoFTEC.\n\n       SoFTEC believes that Senator Levin's amendment essentially \n     dictates a pre-determined result without requiring the FASB \n     to analyze other relevant issues surrounding stock options. \n     Rather than mandate FASB to achieve a predetermined result, \n     SoFTEC believes that the SEC currently has the ability and \n     authority to properly study all of the issues surrounding \n     stock options and make recommendations based upon not only \n     the technical accounting issue but the public policy \n     implications as well.\n\n  So I will conclude my time by requesting of my colleagues, whether we \nvote on it today, this afternoon, this evening, or in the future, that \nwe act responsibly. It is fine to be worrying about the details of \nprocedure and accounting minutia, but it is important also to \nunderstand the impact of this on our free enterprise system. While we \nare doing a lot of good as far as greater scrutiny, greater \ntransparency, and greater punishment for wrongdoers are concerned, let \nus make sure we do no harm because the way that this stock market is \ngoing to change is with more investment, more risk taking, more jobs \nbeing created, and that entrepreneurial spirit that rewards people who \ntake risks, who are creative, who are innovative. That is what is going \nto improve our economy, our competitiveness as a country, as well as \nthe stock market eventually.\n  The point is we do not need to come up with new, convoluted ways to \nincrease taxes on companies that we want to invest in and improve our\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\ncountry, and I hope we will support the free enterprise system and, in \ndoing so, look at reasonable, logical, wise, and fully comprehended \ndecision-making as we move forward in these very uncharted waters of \nmaking major changes in stock options.\n  The bill as it stands now is an outstanding bill. There can be \nimprovements made to it, such as the amendments of Senator Grassley and \nSenator Dorgan, but let us not have the perfect be the enemy of the \nvery good, and let us make sure we do no harm. By fouling up stock \noptions for many men and women working in this country, it would \ncertainly do a great deal of harm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Senator from Delaware was first to \nseek recognition.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa if he has a \ntime constraint, I will yield to him. Just so he knows, I was in the \nChamber before he came. I took a phone call and came back. But if the \nSenator has a time constraint, I have 10 to 12 minutes, but I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If I only have to listen to a 10- or 12-minute speech, \nI will be glad to wait.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I hope the Senator listens very closely. He may learn \nsomething. I know I learn when I listen, and I do not always listen \nenough.\n  Mr. President, let me begin where the Senator from Virginia ended, \nand that is that I think the bill fashioned by Senator Sarbanes and \nthis committee does exactly what the Senator from Virginia was \nsuggesting. That would be balanced; we do not do more harm than good.\n\n  If you look at other times--and I have been a Senator for a while--we \nfaced crises such as this, we have had occasion to overreact. We have \nfound sometimes that the cure is worse than the disease. I note we \nprobably did that in my early days here with Senate campaign financing \nand other issues.\n  There is a real balance that the Senator from Maryland has struck. I \ncompliment the Senator. I cannot think of any Senator better positioned \nto be chief spokesman for the Senate and Congress on this issue, not \nonly for the American people but all our allies and the investors \nworldwide.\n  The dollar now has weakened drastically. In my capacity as chairman \nof the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had occasion to meet with \nleading government officials from European countries and from Asia, \nasking me, as if I were some kind of broker: Can we continue to invest \nin your market? Is it real? What is going on? How much more is coming?\n  We are fortunate to have the steady and always cautious voice of the \nSenator from Maryland, whose background academically as well as \npolitically suits him well, and in this moment, as probably no one else \nin this place is better prepared, to take on this issue. I compliment \nthe Senator and his quiet, reasoned voice, and his profound \nunderstanding of the problem we face as well as his determination to \nmove ahead and try to restore confidence. It is a welcome circumstance \nat the moment. I compliment the Senator.\n  I realize from listening to him and knowing him as well as I do, as a \npoint of personal privilege, some will discount my remarks because they \nknow the Senator and I are close personal friends and I admire him as \nmuch as anyone I have served in all my years in the Senate. I \nunderstand there are other things that he may or may not have wanted to \nput in the bill to strengthen our position and the Nation's position \nand the economy, but he wants to make sure there is consensus and \noverwhelming support of whatever we do. This is not a circumstance of \nquestioning motives and wondering whether it is more for show than for \nserious reconstruction of the circumstances.\n  I say at the outset, I have one disagreement with the President of \nthe United States. Although there probably, pray God, are only a ``few \nreally bad apples''--I think that was his phrase--in the corporate \nworld, I do think we have a systemic problem. The marvel is that there \nare so many men and women in corporate America who have high moral \nstandards and have overcome a fairly overwhelming temptation that \nexists in the way business is being done, the way in which we have \nloosened some of the not regulations, loosened some of the oversight on \ncorporate America. It is a testament to the fact that there are so many \nhonorable people running America's major corporations and multinational \ncorporations.\n  The fact is, we have a systemic problem which leads me to my friend \nfrom Michigan, Senator Levin. Senator Levin, Senator McCain, Senator \nCorzine, Senator Edwards, myself, and several others, in varying \ndegrees, think what this debate is all about is fundamental fairness \nand efficiency of our economy. A lot of what we read about these days \nis focused on corporate scandals, individual villains, their schemes, \ntheir greed. There is plenty of that and maybe more than I can remember \nany time in my Senate career.\n  I believe we need to focus on the behavior of corporate executives \nwho have betrayed their positions of power, recklessly endangering the \ncareers of tens of thousands of employees and the savings of millions \nof Americans. That is why it was so important the Senate unanimously \nadopted my amendment last week and the amendment which was contained in \nthat of the Senator from Vermont for stronger penalties for corporate \ncrime.\n\n  In the hearings I have held in my criminal law subcommittee in the \nJudiciary Committee, I made clear from the outset--and I try never to \noverpromise what criminal law can do, even though we are only now \nfinally beginning to rectify and make our criminal justice system \nreflect our values more clearly--that is not a solution. It is a part \nof a solution. The Senator from Iowa and I conducted hearings in that \nsubcommittee. We have asked for stronger penalties. We have passed \nthem. One small example: If you were to violate the Federal law \nrelating to pension security, ERISA, it is a misdemeanor that could \ncost someone their entire pension or 1,000 people their pensions, \ntotaling hundreds of millions of dollars. It is a misdemeanor. All you \nget is up to 1 year in jail. Yet if you steal my automobile--I live 2 \nmiles from the Pennsylvania State line, in Delaware--and you drive \nacross the State line into Pennsylvania, you get 10 years under Federal \nlaw. Something is awry.\n  Criminal penalties are not the answer. They are just rectifying this \nincredible inequity within our system. Hopefully we are beginning to \nreestablish some sense of faith in the system where average people \nthink big guys get away with it and little guys go to jail.\n  Punishing and deterring corporate crime, although it is a major part \nof our response to excesses committed by some of the most privileged \nand powerful corporate executives, is not enough. We face another \nfundamental problem. It is the loss of trust in our system, most \napparent, perhaps, in the recent drop in the stock market. More than \n200 off the DOW in the days following the President's speech, and when \nI came to the floor the DOW was down 300 points. I don't know where it \nis right now. I hope and pray to God it has moved up.\n  The fact is, there is a profound lack of confidence at the moment in \nour economy. There used to be a chairman of the board of the Dupont \nCompany, a big, old farm boy from Ohio. He had great big hands. I \nremember, he was a wonderful guy, a first-rate chemist, first-rate \nscientist, as well as corporate executive. I was meeting with him one \nday and said: We have a problem; we are in the hole. And he turned and \nlooked at me and said: My father always said, Joe, when you get in the \nhole, stop digging.\n  Maybe the President should stop making speeches for a couple of days. \nHe has spoken twice and the market went down 500 points while he was \nspeaking. It is not because of a lack of anything in the President, but \npeople are looking for real change. They assume that if there is any \nrhetoric, it must not be likely to be followed by something real.\n  The Senator from Maryland has done something real. What the Senator \nfrom Utah and his committee has done is real. This is real. This \nunderlying bill is real; it is positive; it is substantial. The bottom \nline is, no pun intended, there is a profound lack of confidence\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nat the moment and that our economy can be shaken right now to the very \nfoundations of our market democracy. For a market democracy to work, we \nhave to have faith in our economy that will continue to create \nopportunities for job advancement and that our Government will continue \nto promote, as our Constitution requires, the general welfare.\n  In recent months, to be reminded how much we have in common, how much \nof our unique blessings we have come to take for granted prior to \nSeptember 11, we were reminded that in the end we are all in this thing \ntogether. Among those blessings we had come to take for granted was the \nmost dynamic economy in the world, that had just come off the longest, \nstrongest expansion in history. In the new economic arena, we are now \nreminded how much we depend on trust in each other to make our markets \nwork.\n  That sounds silly. No one was using the word trust before when we \ntalked of the market economy. We talked innovation, the new economy, \nproductivity, et cetera, but when you cut it all aside, it is all based \nupon trust, which is based upon transparency. If you cannot get out \nthere and make your judgment to invest or not invest in a corporation \nwith a clear sense that you have been told everything that is \nreasonable to tell you about the state of affairs of that company, then \nyou might as well play the lottery.\n  You might as well come on over to Delaware and play the slot machines \nat Delaware Park. You have about the same shot, unless you are on the \ninside.\n  The task we are debating today is how to restore the strength of our \neconomy, which is to restore the trust. At the core of that task is \nrevival of confidence that consumers and investors, including foreign \ninvestors, need to get back into the market.\n  This is going to turn around, Mr. President. You and I both know it. \nI am absolutely sure it is going to turn around. The question is, how \nmany bodies will be littered along the way; how many pensions will be \nlost; how many jobs will be lost; how long is it going to take? It will \nturn around.\n  I am sure the greatest strength of our system continues to be its \nresiliency: Our ability to see change as opportunity. I am sure of that \nbecause we have met this kind of adversity before. Every time we have \ncome out stronger.\n  I remember when the Senator from Maryland and I were on the Banking \nCommittee in those dark days of the savings and loan crisis. We made it \nthrough. We made some very difficult decisions that, I might add, Japan \nand other countries have not made, and it resulted in an even stronger \neconomy. So I am confident we can come out of this stronger.\n  After the glare from all the glitter during the boom phase and as our \nvision becomes a lot clearer, we know that our economy is, in fact, \nfundamentally stronger than it was, notwithstanding what is going on \nnow. Productivity gains were real. Information technology and corporate \nreorganization created real growth. It was not imaginary. It was not \nlike these profit margins that people were suggesting they had on the \nbalance sheets that were a lie. There actually was growth.\n  The economy, the marketplace has created real growth. In what \neconomists like to call the real economy where jobs are created, where \ngoods are produced, the real economy is faster and more efficient today \nthan it was a decade ago. Even old industries in our manufacturing \nsector have gained from advances in new materials, as well as \nimprovement in information sharing and organization.\n  We also know that a lot of what looked like growth, particularly in \nthe financial sector, was only paper profits and a lot of it was \nwritten in disappearing ink. Profits and paper valuations were all too \noften inflated by wishful thinking, by self-dealing analysts, by \naccounting gimmicks, and by outright fraud.\n  The amendment I am proud to support offered by Senators Levin and \nCorzine and others addresses one of the most glaring problems behind \nthose inflated profit statements that fueled the stock boom that is now \nunwinding.\n  Stock options are, as advocates tell us, a useful device. They can \nreward employees when companies are so young that they have little else \nto offer. Of course, we all want to encourage startup companies in \nevery responsible way we can. Also, stock options in theory, and \nsometimes in practice, keep employees' and corporate officers' \nincentives tied to the growth of their companies, but unlike virtually \nevery other kind of compensation the firm can give its employees, stock \noptions do not have to be listed on annual reports as an expense, and \nthat means the more stock options you give, the less compensation you \nhave to report, the lower your reported expenses, the higher your \nreported bottom line.\n  That part is simple, and that is a big reason stock options became so \nattractive not only for the good things they can do, but also for the \nconvenient way they inflated earnings statements and I would even say, \nif I want to go overboard and defend corporate America, even defending \nthose corporate executives who when they take the train up to Wall \nStreet and have some 30-year-odd or 35-year-old guy sitting around a \ntable saying: OK, what are you going to do next quarter? And giant \ncompanies that are strong and mature would say: We are going to do as \nwell as last quarter. That is not good enough. We are going to \ndowngrade your stock and your company.\n\n  I remember one CEO of a major Fortune 10 company telling me, I have \nto do one of three things: I have to say, so be it, and keep on the \nlong-term course or go out there and find some new product on the \nshelf, which I wish I had, that could increase productivity and profit, \nor go home and do something. The ``do something'' usually meant go home \nand cut the number of employees you have, cut expenses.\n  Guess what. I do not think these are bad, evil, and venal people. \nThey went home, and there is an easy way to do it. Let's make sure \ncompensation is not reflected as an expense. So instead of paying the \ntop executives an additional $15 million in compensation, give them \nstock options. Guess what. The bottom line looked $15 million better \nthan it did before.\n  That is not rocket science, and it may have been produced by Wall \nStreet's desire for immediate gratification, immediate response. \nWhatever the reason, it turned out to be as much of a liability in the \nliteral sense, as much as a damaging impact as the good things it could \ndo by tying the employees' fate as well as the CEO's fate to their \ncompany.\n  I see my friend from Utah standing. Does he want to ask me a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator is going into territory I \nwill deal with in my statement, but to keep it all in context as he is \ntalking, I must raise this question. The Senator is one of the \nhistorians of the Senate. He has been around a good long time and \nprobably will be around for longer than I will.\n  Does the Senator from Delaware remember that in 1993 when we \nincreased taxes in the Clinton tax increase, we also put a limit of $1 \nmillion on the total amount of deductions a company could take for \nsalary for its employees?\n  In other words, that CEO could not be paid over $1 million for his or \nher services and have the company deduct that as a legitimate expense \nfor tax purposes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. To be honest with the Senator, I do not remember that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator agree that might have been part of the \nreason why companies, in an effort to attract and hold the best \nexecutive talent, would have moved away from traditional compensation, \nthat the Senator and I both understood when we were growing up and \napplying for jobs, and into the more esoteric area of stock options \nbecause stock options were, in fact, not deductible; whereas, good old-\nfashioned pay for services rendered was given a tax disadvantage as a \nresult of the Clinton tax bill?\n  Mr. BIDEN. In response to the Senator, I have to check more closely. \nI have great respect for my friend from Utah. Based on what he says, it \nseems to me it would have had a negative impact rather than a positive \nimpact. That is one of the things we talk about at the front end.\n  Whatever we do here should have a positive impact. There is something \nelse stock options do, too. Because\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\nstock options are predominantly awarded to top executives, they are a \ngreat way to give yourself a sweetheart deal, with a powerful incentive \nfor executives to look for ways to inflate stock prices so their stock \noptions, at least for a while, are worth millions, even hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  Here is what Business Week said about stock options back in March:\n\n       Options grants that promised to turn caretaker corporate \n     managers into multimillionaires in just a few years encourage \n     some to ignore the basics in favor of pumping up stock \n     prices.\n\n  And pump they did. Here is how much stock options distorted the \nbottom line for some of the biggest and best companies in America. One \nstudy by a London-based consulting firm, Smither and Company, looked at \nthe use of stock options by 145 of the largest U.S. companies.\n  They found that those firms overstated profit by 30 percent in 1995, \n36 percent in 1996, 56 percent in 1997, and 50 percent in 1998.\n  Other analysts, including the Federal Reserve, have found the same \nthing.\n  These are huge distortions in the picture the public was given about \nthese companies and a huge distortion in information investors were \nusing to allocate capital. That kind of distortion was clearly a big \nfactor, maybe in addition to what my friend from Utah says, in driving \nup those stock prices that are now falling back to Earth.\n  This is no simple problem. The 200 biggest firms now allocate more \nthan 16 percent of their stock in options. Let me repeat that.\n  The 200 biggest firms now allocate more than 16 percent of their \nstock in options, mostly for their very top executives.\n  The potential for distortion and the temptation to distort is great.\n  Remember these stock options are predominantly given to top \nexecutives.\n  One study in 1998 found that 220 of the top managers at Fortune 500 \nfirms received an average of 279 time the number of stock options \nawarded to each of the firms' other employees.\n  Two hundred and seventy-nine times what ordinary employees got.\n  Despite the increased use of stock options this is clearly a device \ntop management has largely preserved for itself, and the kind of \nincentives they created are now all too clear.\n  This amendment takes what I believe is the most restrained and most \ncareful approach to the problem of stock options.\n  It does not legislate accounting standards, and it does not dictate \noutcomes.\n  It tells the Financial Accounting Standards Board that it is given \nnew resources and new independence by the underlying Sarbanes \namendment. It provides for FASB to come up with appropriate techniques \nto account for stock options, it does not dictate a one-size-fits-all \nat this moment, and it gives them a year to do it.\n  This is not about Government intervention this is about getting us \nout of the way of what every expert from Alan Greenspan to Warren \nBuffett and FASB itself says should be done.\n  It does nothing to interfere with the issuing of stock options.\n  It is about giving shareholders and investors the information they \nneed to reassert their control over America's corporations. That will \nhelp to promote companies' long-term value, and reduce the temptation \nto pump up short-term stock prices.\n  This amendment can help promote a stronger form of stockholder \ndemocracy, to cure a system that a greedy few have turned to their own \npersonal advantage. That kind of democracy needs openness and clarity--\nhonest information to make informed decisions.\n  This amendment is real reform, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I thank my friend from Utah for his intervention, and I thank my \nfriend from Iowa for listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to the Senator from Virginia, just to make a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my hour to Senator \nGramm, the Senator from Texas, who is the Republican manager of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Time is yielded. \nThe Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I forget, Mr. President, I make the request that \nthe unused portion of my hour that I will not be using here, I would \nlike to also have given to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have five amendments I filed: (i) An \namendment providing for a team of oversight auditors, (ii) an amendment \nproviding for prebankruptcy bonuses paid to top executives be pulled \nback into the bankrupt corporation's estate, (iii) an amendment \nproviding the Securities Exchange Commission with disgorgement \nremedies, (iv) an amendment providing that auditors who sell tax \nshelter products cannot opine on the financial effects of the tax \nshelter deal; and, (v) last, an amendment providing whistleblower \nprotection to the accountants and others who want to disclose financial \nstatement misconduct.\n  I am pleased, in regard to the last amendment I just announced about \nwhistleblowers, Senators Leahy and Hatch accepted that proposal as part \nof their amendment which has been adopted.\n  I am not going to speak about the other four. I am just going to \nspeak about one of those. It is the first amendment I put on my list, \nan amendment providing for a team of oversight auditors.\n  As I said, I congratulate my colleagues, Senators Sarbanes and Enzi \non their hard work in moving S. 2673 out of Committee and bringing the \nbill to the floor for further debate. The reform bill is a great step \nin the right direction for tackling some of the difficult accounting \nproblems our Nation currently faces. Nevertheless, I believe the reform \nbill isn't quite tough enough on several issues and should be \nstrengthened further, consequently, the amendment.\n  In my view, the recent rash of accounting scandals did not result \nfrom incompetency or lack of rigorous training of accounting \nprofessionals. Neither has the problem lied principally with misguided \nauditing standards known as GAAS or ill-considered accounting rules \nknown as GAAP.\n  The Worldcom debacle, among others, further demonstrated that the \nproblem does not rest entirely with a company's external auditors--\nwhose best efforts may not detect financial misrepresentations if fraud \nis repeatedly covered up by corporate insiders or contrived to defeat \nestablished internal controls. Instead, each of the most recent \ncorporate accounting scandals appear to have arisen from egregiously \nbad behavior of corporate insiders and internal accountants--with \nvarying degrees of complicity by those companies' external auditors.\n  Thus, as a matter of principle, I agree with the ``bad apples'' \ntheory being offered by many. However, I believe addressing those bad \napples requires additional oversight--and not just of a company's \nexternal accountants but of the internal accounting function itself.\n  To that end, I further respond to the President's call for increased \noversight and would like to offer an amendment that would strengthen \nthe provisions Sarbanes-Enzi bill by expanding the powers of the \noversight board to require the performance of ``spot audits.'' The \nunderlying bill which focuses on monitoring external auditors woud be \namended to provide additional board oversight of internal corporate \naccounting.\n  Specfically, my amendment would charge the Board with responisibility \nfor conducting oversight audits or ``spot audits'' of public companies. \nThe board would serve in a role analogous to the Internal Revenue \nService or the Federal Bank Examiner. The IRS, for example, achieves \nvoluntary public compliance through review of a very limited number of \nfederal tax returns each year. The IRS does not verify each and every \ntax return. Similarly, the Federal Bank Examiner sporadically and \nrandomly audits various banks throughout the country. Such ``spot \nauditing'' has been an extremely effective oversight tool for the \nbanking industry and one which has resulted in higher levels of \nregulatory compliance. In similar fashion, I believe that accountants \nand corporate America will prepare more carefully their financial\n\n[[Page S6749]]\n\nstatements if exposed to the risk of compliance review by the board's \noversight auditors.\n  Even in self-regulated form, the accounting industry has long \nrecognized the need for a second level of review. To that end, 24 years \nago the ACIPA established the peer review process by which one \naccounting firm would review audit work of another accounting firm. For \nexample, Deloitte & Touche was for many years the assigned peer \nreviewer of Arthur Andersen. Industry-wide self-checking on top of \nindustry self-regulation seems ill-conceived and has been widely \ncritized for its effectiveness by lawmakers and the SEC.\n  Over the past 25 years, a Big Five accounting firm has never issued a \nqualified report against another Big Five accounting firm at the end of \nany peer review despite the subsequent discovery of numerous \nirregularities including numerous conflicts of interest from stock \nownership in audit clients. This recognized need for a second level of \nreview is longstanding although the mechanism originally established by \nthe accounting industry seems to have proven largely inadequate.\n  Some may ask why the Board should be granted powers which may be \nexercised currently by the SEC. The answer is simply resources. \nProviding an effective mechanism for spot checking the books of various \nissuers requires a dedicated audit staff to carry out those purposes. \nHaving resources dedicated to a regulatory review process would allow \nthe oversight board to take a proactive approach in reviewing for \naccounting irregularities and take the SEC out of a purely reactive \nposture with respect to corporate accounting fraud. The SEC has done a \ngreat job of investigating corporate scandals once detected. \nUnfortunately, by the time many of the recent scandals were discovered, \nthings had progressed too far. We were unable to salvage the companies \nand the life savings of thousands of employees and shareholders. I \nbelieve the oversight auditor would provide a deterrent to committing \nfraud when coupled with tougher criminal sanctions. I further believe \nthat earlier detection could prevent the absolute destruction of \ncompanies in which fraud remains uncovered for too long a period of \ntime.\n  I note that the concept of an oversight auditor within the public \noversight board was rejected in the accounting reform proposal offered \nby the SEC and Harvey Pitt on June 20. The draft emphasized that the \nSEC's vision of a newly created public oversight board reassured \ncorporate America that the newly-created oversight board would require \nthe cooperation of audited corporations ``only to the extent necessary \nto further . . . reviews or proceedings regarding the [audit \ncorporation's] accountant.'' The draft further promised that the new \noversight board would not conduct ``roving investigations'' of audited \ncorporations nor would the board sanction those corporations. It occurs \nto me that by shifting exclusive focus and responsibility to accounting \nfirms, we ignore the underlying behavior of corporate wrongdoers who \nhave principal responsibility for fair and accurate financial reporting \nto corporate shareholders.\n  Under my proposal, the newly created oversight board would be charged \nwith reviewing the financial statements of issuers and focusing its \nresources on highest-risk audit areas and questionable accounting \npractices of which it is aware from the SEC Division of Enforcement or \nother sources such as whistleblowers under provisions I heartily \nsupported.\n  Upon discovery, the board would refer findings of possible accounting \nor auditing irregularity to the Division of Enforcement with respect to \nissuers or other appropriate federal and state enforcement officials \nsuch as the President's newly-created Fraud Task Force within the \nDepartment of Justice. This referral mechanism would ensure that those \nagencies continue to have primary authority and responsibility for \nconducting comprehensive corporate investigations of possible \nwrongdoing. The oversight board, of course, would have authority to \nconduct investigations of possible wrongdoing with respect to the \ninvolvement of accounting firms within its jurisdiction.\n  That is a basic summary of what this amendment would accomplish. I \nurge my colleagues to support establishment of an oversight auditor as \na means of improving the compliance of corporate issuers and their \nexternal accounting firms and detecting irregularities at a much \nearlier point in the system when a shareholder value remains \nsalvageable.\n  It seems to me that my amendment comes down to just a simple case of \ncommon sense. As I think proven so many times before, auditors need to \nbe audited in the same way the IRS does it for tax returns and in the \nsame way bank examiners do it in the case of bank audits. If auditors \nknow their work will itself be audited, they will think twice about \nlooking the other way on shady deals, as we have seen.\n  My amendment would put some very specific teeth in the Sarbanes-Enzi \nbill.\n  At this point, I was hoping the Senator from Texas was going to be \nhere because I have done so much for him on a lot of Finance Committee \nbills. I'm referring to tax bills, including the recent CARE bill and \nthe recent energy bill. I have helped him with so many amendments that \nhe wanted. I was sure he would be willing to help me get unanimous \nconsent to get my amendment up, particularly in light of the fact that \nlast week I was assured when it wasn't on the list that it would be on \nthe list. Then I came back and found that it meant being last on the \nlist.\n  Now we are getting down to the end. I would like to have what I \nconsider kind of a commitment, although it probably is not an ironclad \ncommitment, that I be on the list, and, obviously, I would be able to \nget a vote on my amendment.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside for the purpose of taking up my amendment just described, \nwhich is amendment No. 4232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. In light of the discussions, I have to object.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Was the President going to put my unanimous consent \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I did.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I did not hear the President do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming objects.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like \nto have just a short discussion of something that bothers me. In the \nSenate we have a right to be, and a responsibility to be, \nintellectually honest about these issues with which we are faced here.\n  I have heard so much during this debate--not so much during the \ndebate, because that wouldn't be fair, but more probably in news \nconferences held by Senators on the other side of the aisle--about the \nDemocrats wishing to use Enron and WorldCom events very much as, I \nthink, political issues. I think maybe the Democrats are hoping for a \n``November storm'' in which our economy is weak and no progress is made \non accounting reforms.\n  As this bill goes through the Senate, through conference, and comes \nback, I hope we will realize that there is enough blame to go around. \nBut, most importantly, I think it is wrong. For instance, the \ndistinguished majority leader on ``Face the Nation'' recently \nattributed the current crisis to the alleged ``permissive'' attitude in \nthe Bush administration towards business. I didn't see any \n``permissiveness'' in the President's speech last week. I don't think \nvery many people did.\n  But I think we also need to remember, while a lot of this mischief \nwas going on by corporations, that during the decades of the 1990s and \nnow in the 21st century there were 2 years in which Democrats \ncontrolled Congress. In those two years, we had a Republican President. \nThat was the first Bush Presidency. There was a period of time when the \nDemocrats controlled both Houses of Congress and the White House. That \nwas 1993-1994. Then there were 6 years that Republicans controlled the \nCongress--1994-2000, and the Democrats controlled the Presidency. Then \nthere were 135 days last year that Congress was controlled by \nRepublicans, and the President of the United States, but only 135 days \nout of a 12-year period of time, if you want to use the 1990s plus now. \nAnd what has happened has happened on the watch of both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\n  I think that to say a President has been President 18 months and this \ncrisis before us is because of a ``permissive'' attitude in the Bush \nadministration towards business just doesn't hold water.\n  I have a chart behind me. I hope I am very clear in making this more \naccurate than what I just said. The yellow is the 2 years of the Bush \nadministration going back to 1994, and the other color covers the \nClinton administration. But let's forget about the Bush administration \nand the Clinton administration. Let's just realize what the facts are.\n\n  In the case of Enron, it became public in the year 2001, but the \nrestated earnings and the mischief went on all the way back to at least \nthe beginning of 1997 because 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and the first two \nquarters of 2001 were restated earnings.\n  Adelphia: Half of 1998, all of 1999, all of 2000--before they were \npublic in 2001--but restated earnings for all those.\n  Go down to Xerox. It was found by the end of the year 2000 everything \nthat was done wrong in Xerox. The restated earnings of 1997, 1998, \n1999, and 2000 came before there was ever a President George Bush.\n  There were restated earnings for Rite Aid for 1998, 1999, and 2000. \nYou can go down the list. What the chart says, better than I can say, \nis that it is not a permissive attitude by this President that has put \nus in this position. It is because of the lack of transparency that was \nimplied in what the accounting profession and audit committees and \nboards of directors, who ought to be watching management, were doing, \nand the Securities Exchange Commission under the spirit of the 1933 law \nof what they should have been doing. I suppose there are a lot of \nothers as well.\n  But now politics should be put to the side. We should not be making \nthese statements. We ought to be correcting the situation so that \npeople have confidence and so that the crooks who are running our \ncorporations and doing these things that are evidenced here. When I say \n``crooks running our corporations,'' I mean the ones who would do this \nsort of thing to their stockholders and to the country and to the \neconomy--so that they cannot get away with that in the future.\n  That is what this bill is all about. I complimented Senator Sarbanes \nand Senator Enzi about this bill. I think it would have been improved \nwith my amendment. But, quite obviously, that is not the way the game \nis being played. So I am sorry that my amendment could not be put to a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have spent most of the afternoon in the \nChamber listening to this debate, which I have found to be \nilluminating, occasionally informative. I want to do what I can to \nperhaps add to the information, if not to some of the light.\n  I made reference, in my colloquy with the Senator from Delaware, to \nthe decision that was made by the Congress back in 1993 to put a limit \non the amount of compensation that executives could receive in terms of \ntraditional dollar salary. And the limit was $1 million.\n  I remember some of the rhetoric that flew around this floor at that \ntime, filled this Chamber--how terrible it was that people were being \npaid these outlandish salaries and that somehow it would benefit the \npeople at the bottom of our economic ladder if there was a limit placed \non those salaries. And so recognizing that they could not outlaw the \nsalaries, Congress could do the next best thing--or, if I might say, \nthe next worst thing--and say: All right, they can pay themselves these \nbig salaries, but, by George, we will not allow a tax deduction for \nanything over $1 million.\n  Then, recognizing that would probably produce all kinds of \ndifficulty, Congress said: Except in a number of areas. And one of the \nareas of exceptions was that nonsalary compensation could exceed $1 \nmillion and be expensed if it were approved by the shareholders.\n  In my view, this was a strong incentive to move towards stock \noptions. After all, if you are running a public company and your \nservices are worth $5 million or $10 million on the open market, you \nare not going to stay with a company that will only pay you $1 million \nin cash if a competing company will come along and offer you the $5 \nmillion or $10 million you think you are worth in the form of other \ncompensation.\n  So as we get lyrical around here about how terrible stock options \nare, and how stock options lead to all kinds of excess, we should \nremember that Congress, in its excess of enthusiasm for a form of wage \nand price controls, helped contribute to this situation.\n  We do not like to have institutional memory. We do not like to be \nheld accountable for our actions 4 our 5 years after those actions are \ntaken. But, in this case, I think it is appropriate for us to remember \nthe past while we are getting so exercised about what it is we plan to \ndo in the future.\n  If I might, Mr. President, be a little autobiographical for a moment, \nI would like to trace my own experience with stock options. I have \nreflected on this, and I think it has perhaps some value in this \ndebate.\n  I was working for the JC Penney Company in the mid-1960s. I was \ninterested, when I went to work for the Penney Company, to find out \nthat company had a tremendously innovative and singular form of \ncompensation; that is, no one in the company was paid more than $25,000 \na year--no one. The president, the chairman of the board, none of the \nvice presidents--no one was paid more than $25,000 a year.\n  There was a pool of profits that was created, and in addition to your \n$25,000 salary, you were given points in the pool. It was assumed that \nthe pool was divided up in such a way that any one point in the pool \nwas worth $1. So when I went to work for the Penney Company in 1964, my \nsalary was, as I recall, $10,000 a year. I was not important enough to \nget to the exalted $25,000 a year stage. But I was given 2,500 points \nin the pool, which meant that if the company met its earnings \nobjectives, I would get another $2,500; in other words, my real salary \nwould be $12,500.\n  So I did everything I could to make sure that every point in the pool \nwas, in fact, worth $1. I did what I could to turn off the lights. I \ndid what I could to save expenses. I did what I could to drive sales so \nthat the company would meet its goal.\n  My memory is that in one of those years each point was worth 93 \ncents; that is, the company fell 7 percent short of its projection. And \nevery one of us in the company who was having that kind of a salary \ncircumstance felt that 7 percent hit. In the example I have just given, \ninstead of getting another $2,500 at the end of the year, I would have \nthat $2,500 shaved by 7 percent. I would get my $10,000 salary, plus 93 \npercent of the additional $2,500.\n  There were stories in the Penney Company that were legendary about \nmanagers who would get transferred from one Penney store to another. At \nthe time, as I recall, the limit was not $25,000, it was $10,000. So \n$10,000 per year was the maximum anyone in the company was paid. A \nstore manager who was transferred from a relatively small store to a \nrelatively large one in a large city was sure he was going to get a big \nraise. He got his first check, and it was for $10,000 a year. And he \nsaid: But my expenses are higher. I am running a store that is two or \nthree times bigger. It doesn't matter; you get $10,000 a year. At the \nend of the year, when they added up the profits of that store, he got a \nbonus based on the profits of the store he was managing, and the bonus \nwas about $100,000. Well, he had an obvious incentive to see to it that \nstore was profitable.\n\n  What does any of this have to do with stock options? That system that \nwas followed by the Penney Company that helped drive its growth all \nthose years--where compensation was tied to performance, not only your \npersonal performance as in the case of the store manager I described \nbut in the company's performance, as in my own case--that program was \nscrapped. We went to a more traditional kind of compensation. As part \nof the traditional kind of compensation, we had stock options.\n  I got a little comfortable with the old system because I remember 1 \nyear where each point in the pool was worth $1.23. The company did much \nbetter than it had anticipated, and I got a 23 percent upward kick in \nmy compensation.\n  I questioned: Why are we getting away from this because it seems to \nme this works?\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\n  The answer was: Wall Street requires it.\n  Well, that wasn't enough of an answer for me. I said: What do you \nmean Wall Street requires it?\n  They said: The analysts at Wall Street have said to us, until you \ngive stock options, we are not going to believe that you are serious \nabout the future of your company because stock options are not tied to \nimmediate profits. Stock options are tied to future profits. And until \nyou put some of your compensation to your executives and key employees \nin the form of stock options, we will not believe that you believe the \nfuture of your company is as bright as you say it is. We want them to \nhave a stake in the future.\n  So as it was explained to me, in the scrapping of this unique \ncompensation plan that I think the JC Penney Company was the only \ncompany in the country, if not the world, that followed it, in the \nscrapping of that plan, you had to adopt some form of stock options. So \nthey did adopt stock options.\n  I didn't stay around long enough to take advantage of them. I entered \nthe Nixon administration in 1969 and gave up my vesting in a number of \ncircumstances at the Penney Company. Frankly, I was a little nervous \nabout that because I thought I had a bright future financially if I had \nstayed at the Penney Company. And again, as I say, at the end of the \nyear, when they sent me the money that had been accumulating in my \nbehalf during the part of the year I worked there, each point was worth \n$1.23. That said to me, once again, how much more money I would have \nhad if I had stayed with Penney instead of coming with the Government. \nThat is a separate issue. I will not go down that road any further. I \nam glad I made the decision I made. I probably would not be a Senator \nif I had not.\n  The point is, the compensation of employees should be tied to the \nfuture and benefit and prosperity of the company, and stock options \nwere created with that in mind. What we have seen them become, since \n1993, when they were not available as part of an intelligent \ncompensation mix, but they were made more valuable by tax treatment by \nthe Congress making an accounting decision, what we have seen is that \nstock options have accumulated the bad name we have been hearing about \nhere on the floor. I am not sure I agree with everything that has been \nsaid about how terrible stock options are, but I do recognize they have \nled to some excesses.\n  In the New York Times, on July 12, there was an editorial signed by \nWalter Cadette, senior scholar at the Levy Institute of Bard College \nand retired vice president of J.P. Morgan. With a background at J.P. \nMorgan, in my view, he has a little bit more credibility than some of \nthe people who write editorials for the New York Times. But he made the \nsame point that has been going around the floor here in some of the \nrhetoric when he says:\n\n       Options . . . hold out the promise of wealth beyond \n     imaging. All it takes is a set of books good enough to send a \n     stock price soaring, if only for a while. If real earnings \n     are not there, they can be manufactured--for long enough, in \n     any case, for executives to cash out. This, in essence, is \n     what happened at Enron, WorldCom, Xerox--indeed, at quite a \n     long list of companies.\n\n  That is not congruent with the explanation about stock options I \nreceived back in the 1960s, when I had my first opportunity to \nparticipate in stock options in a Fortune 500 company. That is \nsomething that is new, that has come along.\n  So we are back to the fundamental question of this bill, which is, \nHow do we account for the performance of a company in a way that will \nallow investors to make an intelligent judgment about the value of the \ncompany?\n  That is the fundamental issue here. It is fundamental enough that I \nthink I ought to repeat it: How do we account for the performance of \nthe company in an accurate enough manner to allow investors to make an \nintelligent decision about the future of that company?\n  Some will say to us: That is a very easy question to answer. \nCongressman Gephardt has been quoted in the press as suggesting that \naccounting is a science. It is a simple matter of black and white, of \nadding 1 and 1 and getting 2.\n  That is not the case, however much we would like to believe that is \nthe case. Yes, when you are talking about some aspects of accounting \nfor a company's performance, it is a simple matter of adding up the \nnumbers and reporting them. But in a company as complex as today's \nmodern industrial corporation, there are a whole series of judgment \ncalls that must be made. It is not just a matter of adding up all of \nthe sales. It is not just a matter of adding up all of the costs.\n  Back to my example of the JC Penney Company, this is a matter of a \njudgment call being made. What is the judgment of the value of this \ncompany if it does not trust its executives enough with stock options?\n  Analysts on Wall Street who are trained and experienced came to one \njudgment call: that the Penney Company was not worth as much without \nstock options as it would be with them--nothing whatever to do with the \nbottom line, nothing whatever to do with how many socks we sold or how \nmany shoes we sold or how many shirts we sold. It was a judgment call \non the value of the company based on accounting decisions.\n  Are we going to account for compensation strictly on the basis of the \nPenney Company's system or are we going to make a judgment call based \non stock options?\n  Well, the Penney Company did what it believed it had to do under \nthose circumstances and, of course, went forward in its history.\n  The point here is that there are judgment calls to be made every day \nin every circumstance with respect to accounting, and they will \ndetermine how the public, the investing public, will respond to the \ncompany that makes them.\n  That raises the question of what should those calls be and who should \ndetermine what those calls should be.\n  There is a term we use. It is called GAAP. It stands for generally \naccepted accounting principles. The very phrase itself defines what it \nis we are talking about. If we want to make an accounting decision as \nto what something is worth, we should make the decision within the \nparameters of GAAP; that is, we should make the decision on the basis \nthat is generally accepted.\n  Let me give an example of what happens when you go outside the basis \nof what is generally accepted accounting principles. I was involved \nwith an investor and he put out appropriate balance sheets, accounting \ninformation, profit and loss statements, and so on. He got a very angry \ncall from one of the subinvestors. This was the kind of man who would \nsell shares in his overall project primarily to doctors and dentists.\n  He said to me once:\n\n       I will not sell shares to lawyers.\n\n  I said:\n\n       Why not? Isn't a lawyer's money just as good as a doctor's \n     or a dentist's money?\n\n  He said:\n\n       No, because lawyers are trained to find problems and I \n     don't want sub-investors who spend all of their time looking \n     for problems.\n\n  Well, he got a phone call from a physician who said to him:\n\n       I have looked at your financial information and you are \n     lying to me.\n\n  He said:\n\n       What do you mean I am lying to you?\n\n  He said:\n\n       It is right here in your documents. You said this \n     particular venture made X hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     last year. Now you have given me your financial statements \n     and I have found out you didn't make a penny.\n\n  The man said:\n\n       What are you talking about?\n\n  He said:\n\n       I have it right here. Here is a list of your assets and a \n     list of your liabilities and they match each other to the \n     exact cent. You didn't make any money.\n\n  Well, generally accepted accounting principles say that a balance \nsheet always has to balance, that the number on one side and the number \non the other side must equal each other to the penny. This man did not \nunderstand generally accepted accounting procedures, he wanted to keep \nbooks a different kind of way, and he was misled. The solution, of \ncourse, was to educate him on what those generally accepted accounting \nprocedures ought to be. Once he generally accepted what those \nprocedures were, he could read the profit and loss statement, the \nbalance sheet, and he could discover that the man, in fact, was not \nlying to him and that, in fact, the venture had made several hundreds \nof thousands of dollars that year.\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\n  Now, let's come to Wall Street, let's come to Enron, let's come to \nall of the things that we are talking about here. One of the things we \nhave heard in many of the hearings that I have attended on this subject \nis that if you were a sophisticated analyst of financial statements, \nyou could, in fact, find all of the information that you needed in the \nfootnotes of the various financial statements that were published. You \ndid not need the kinds of disclosure that this bill is calling for.\n  Well, I examined that, listened to that testimony, listened to the \npeople who made that point, and came to the conclusion that they are \nright. If you are sophisticated enough to be able to go through every \nsingle footnote, examine every single side comment, and plow through \nall of the boilerplate that makes up a standard financial release, you \ncould create an accurate picture of that corporation--except in those \ncases where there was outright fraud. In my opinion, Enron was a case \nof outright fraud, not a case of hiding things in footnotes; it was a \ncase of lying.\n  Quite frankly, there is nothing we can do in this Chamber, or \nanywhere else in a legislative forum, to stop people who determine that \nthey are going to lie, who are determined they are going to commit \nfraud. That will happen no matter what kind of a bill we pass. We can \nraise the penalty and thereby discourage it a little more--and there \nare proposals to do that--but we cannot stop it. If someone is \ndetermined he is going to break the law, and he thinks he can lie and \nget away with it, he will still do it regardless of the bills that we \npass here.\n  But what we can do, what we should do, and what this bill is crafted \nto do is to make it easier for the ordinary investor to understand what \na company is worth, make it so that the generally accepted accounting \nprinciples conform with generally understood activities with respect to \nthe business world.\n  The question is, how can we establish accounting rules that will make \nit possible for the ordinary investor to understand what is going on \nand not restrict understanding to those who can read the footnotes, who \ncan decipher all of the boilerplate. I don't think we will ever get \nthere in a perfect world. Life being what it is, with the lawyers \ncoming in and requiring careful terms of art to be spelled out, we will \nnever get to the point where someone who does not have any kind of \nlegal understanding of the terms of art can read this as easily as he \nor she could read Harry Potter. However, we can move in that direction, \nand I feel this bill does so move.\n  The one thing that we should be most careful of, however, is to avoid \nhaving Congress set the accounting rules. Why? If Congress sets the \naccounting rules, it will--to use a phrase we use here derisively \nsometimes--take an act of Congress to turn that around. And having set \nthe rules, Congress is very reluctant to come back in an act of \nCongress and change them. But if the rules are set by the regulatory \nbodies over which Congress exerts some oversight responsibility, they \ncan be changed much more easily as more information comes along and as \npeople begin to discover that what they did previously maybe doesn't \nmake as much sense.\n  I offer as exhibit A Congress's action to outlaw the deductibility of \ncash compensation above a million dollars--something that, in \nretrospect, now looks like it was a pretty stupid thing for us to have \ndone. But we have done it, and the chances of trying to get a bill \nthrough that would undo it are very slim. If we stay out of the \nbusiness--we in Congress--of making these kinds of accounting \ndecisions, we will be better off, the economy will be better off, more \npeople will keep their jobs, et cetera.\n  Let me close on that particular subject with that particular idea in \nmind, and that is that Congress from time to time wants to step into \nthe marketplace, repeal the law of supply and demand, and assert our \njudgment over the judgment of the marketplace. I have said many times, \nand will say many times hence, if I could add to what we have carved in \nmarble around here, I would say: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply \nand demand.'' But we keep trying to do it with wage and price controls. \nWe keep trying to repeal the law of supply and demand.\n  We tried to do it in 1993 when we said we will do something about the \nexcessive compensation of executives. We won't say that the marketplace \nand the law of supply and demand will determine what people get paid; \nwe will legislate it. We will legislate it with tax policy. We will do \nsome social engineering through tax policy. We keep trying to do that \nall the time, and it almost always produces a perverse effect.\n  Let me address this question of overwhelmingly big salaries and \ncompensation--as if there was something really evil about that, really \ncorrupting about that. Maybe there is, in terms of the impact that that \nsort of compensation has in the lives of an individual, but it is the \nmarketplace at work.\n  Let me give an example with which I think everybody might be \nfamiliar. I am not talking about Jack Welch, the CEO of GE. I am not \ntalking about Ken Lay at Enron. Let's talk about somebody with whom \nmost people can identify. Let's talk about Wayne Gretzky.\n  Wayne Gretzky has been called, accurately in my view, the greatest \nhockey player who ever lived. Along with that, Wayne Gretzky is the \nhighest paid hockey player who ever lived. At the time the decision was \nmade by the hockey team that brought Wayne Gretzky into the United \nStates and paid him an incredible sum of money, there was a great hue \nand cry: How can one individual be worth this much money? For what? \nKnocking a solid piece of whatever hockey pucks are made out of around \non the ice, for that he is worth $20 million, $30 million, $50 \nmillion--whatever it was--a year?\n  The owner of the team came out of some obscurity long enough to say: \nYes, he is worth that much money, and let me explain to you why. Then \nhe outlined what the ticket sales for his team were the year before he \nhired Wayne Gretzky and what the ticket sales for his team were the \nyear he announced the hiring of Wayne Gretzky. The number was several \ntimes the total amount that Wayne Gretzky was being paid.\n  The owner said: On a percentage basis, he is a bargain. He is a steal \nat the price I got him.\n  These numbers are representative rather than absolute, but they stick \nin my memory that they were paying Gretzky something like $40 million \nor $50 million and the increase in ticket sales was going to be \nsomething like $120 million to $150 million.\n  The owner said: If I had to, I would pay him twice as much because I \nam getting the benefit.\n  People say: But that is measurable. Michael Jordan did the same thing \nfor the Washington Wizards. We can figure that out with accounting. But \nwhat these chief executive officers are being paid is obscene.\n  If you are a shareholder of General Electric, Mr. President, and you \nlooked at what Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric, did with that \ncompany during the time he had it in his stewardship, would you look \nback on that total period and say we paid Jack Welch too much money? Or \nwould you look back on the amount of the value of General Electric that \nwas generated under his stewardship and say he was a bargain; he was a \nsteal; we could have paid him twice what we paid him and still come out \nwell ahead?\n  You say: But look at all of the executives who flew their companies \nright into the sea. Look at the executives who destroyed their firms. \nYet they got this same amount of money.\n  If I may go back again to the sports world, have we not seen sports \nteams pay very large salaries, responding to the law of supply and \ndemand, for coaches who had losing seasons? For quarterbacks who ended \nup being on the waiver list? Those of us in the Washington, DC, area \nhave had a lot of experience with quarterbacks. Does that mean we are \ngoing to stop trying to get the right quarterback for the Washington \nRedskins by saying we will pay them average salaries in the National \nFootball League so that there will not be any more of these obscene \nsalaries and failures?\n  Several things will happen if the Washington Redskins take that point \nof view. No. 1, they will start to lose even more than they have lost \nin the past. And, No. 2, the fans will stop coming and the savings that \nyou will make in buying a quarterback that you can get for $400,000 or \n$500,000 a year, compared to the one that you are gambling $10 million \nor $20 million on will\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nall disappear as the ticket sales fall off, the television revenue \ndisappears, and people do not want to come anymore.\n\n  Yes, there have been corporate executives who have been vastly \noverpaid. There have been CEOs who have been hired on the basis of \ntheir reputation, just as football coaches who have been hired on the \nbasis of their reputation, who, to lure them into the company, have \nbeen given great packages and then failed to deliver. But there are \nalso the Jack Welches of this world who have turned out to be bargains \nno matter how much they were paid.\n  Who should make the decision as to how much they should be paid? The \nanswer is, The marketplace should do it. The law of supply and demand \nshould do it. Someone who has demonstrated that he or she has the \ncapacity to build, maintain, and expand a corporation with tremendous \nvalue for the shareholders is someone who can demand very high salaries \nbecause he or she is in very short supply.\n  We can complain all we want to about the social inequity of a CEO who \nis earning $20 million, $30 million, $40 million a year and someone who \nis working in that company for minimum wage, but it is the same \nprinciple as saying: Look at the difference between Wayne Gretzky down \non the ice earning $20 million, $30 million, $40 million a year and \nsomeone selling hot dogs in the stands. If Wayne Gretzky were not on \nthe ice, there would not be anybody in the stands to buy the hot dogs. \nWayne Gretzky and his skills are in much shorter supply than someone \nwho can stand in the stands and sell hot dogs.\n  We should not in our frenzy in this whole debate get so carried away \nwith our desire to deal with those who have damaged the system by their \nfailure to live up to their responsibilities that we, once again, make \nany statements that would cause us to try to repeal the law of supply \nand demand.\n  I see my colleagues are seeking recognition. I have carried on long \nenough. I leave with this one last thought: If we are going to deal \nwith these issues, we should deal with them in the way this bill deals \nwith them and not in the proposal that Congress itself should set \naccounting standards or should set wages or caps or compensation.\n  Past history tells us Congress can act in a hurry but repent at great \nleisure.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have a unanimous consent request and a request for the \nyeas and nays that I want to make while we have at least a handful of \nMembers here. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Edwards amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in order to request the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to request the \nyeas and nays on both pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is in order to seek the yeas and nays at this \npoint.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending Edwards \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I now ask for the yeas and nays on the Carnahan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Democrat floor leader had a unanimous consent request \nhe wants to propound.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the process of working that out \nnow. I think we will be able to do that later.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business, with the time \nconsumed counting against the postcloture debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is also my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Nevada is going to yield an hour to the manager of the bill; is \nthat right?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If you require the 50 minutes that will be left against.\n  Mr. REID. Or whatever time is left.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand he has a right to do that; is \nthat true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to yield time. The \nmanager of the bill may receive up to 44 additional minutes. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, at the end of my remarks, I will yield \nwhatever time the Senator from Texas can receive.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about something a little different than \nwhat we have been talking about today, although I have very strong \nfeelings about the bill and think that both the managers of the bill, \nalong with Senator Enzi from Wyoming, have done a terrific job in \naddressing some very serious problems out there. I still believe there \nare a few problems with the bill we need to clean up in conference.\n  I do think the overall legislation has some positive reforms that \nmust be implemented to try to restore some confidence back in the \ninvesting public.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what I want to talk about is something we \nare going to be dealing with later this week--as early as tomorrow from \nwhat I understand--and that is the whole idea of prescription drugs \nwithin Medicare. Earlier today, Senators Hagel, Gramm, Lugar, Inhofe, \nand I all introduced a new prescription drug bill. It is the \ncompilation of work mainly that Senator Hagel and I have been doing for \nthe last couple of years. We think it is a proposal that deserves the \nattention of our colleagues, and I encourage them to study this \nproposal.\n  I want to start by reading an e-mail I received from a senior citizen \nback in Nevada. This e-mail came in at 11:21 p.m. Pacific standard \ntime, so obviously this person was up late at night thinking about the \nwhole issue of prescription drugs. Let me read it:\n  I urge you to ponder very honestly the proposed prescription coverage \nwith Medicare. Many social problems arise due to the fact that many \npersons who need medication to maintain some sort of life existence are \nnot able to purchase the needed medications. Must we continue to choose \nhousing or our medications? Please step back and consider if an elderly \nor disabled person in your own family were in this precarious \nsituation. Would you not step up to the moral plate and fight to find \nfunding for Medicare covered prescriptions?\n  I think this person summed up very well what a lot of seniors are \nfeeling: They are having to choose sometimes between the type of food \nthey eat and prescription drugs; sometimes between whether they can \nturn their air-conditioner on in the summertime or their heat on in the \nwintertime and prescription drugs; sometimes between rent and \nprescription drugs.\n  There are several proposals, and I commend the people who have been \nworking on their proposals, but, frankly, the reason we decided to \nintroduce this bill is that some of the other bills, especially when \none looks into the outyears, are so costly that they literally could \nbankrupt the Medicare system in and of itself.\n  Our bill does a few things. First, it is available to every \nbeneficiary, and it is also available faster than any of the other \nprescription drug proposals. Our bill can be implemented as early as \nJanuary 1, 2004, whereas the earliest the other proposals can be \nimplemented is 1 full year later.\n  Our bill is also the most affordable bill, especially to the \ntaxpayer. We are waiting for the final score from CBO, but we think it \nis going to come in somewhere around $150 billion over the next 10 \nyears. The next cheapest proposal, that we are aware of, is around $370 \nbillion, and when one looks at the full cost of a 10-year program, \nother programs can be up to a trillion dollars.\n  A trillion dollars is not something this country can afford, \nespecially under current economic conditions, and especially when we \nthink about young people who would like to see Medicare as a benefit to \nthem someday.\n  So we must enact a reform that not only America can afford but also \nsenior citizens can afford, and we think we\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nhave come up with that balance. Basically, the way the program would \nwork is, every senior on a voluntary basis would be able to get a \nprescription drug discount card. For a $25 annual fee, they would sign \nup and get this prescription drug discount card. They would then go buy \ntheir prescription drugs, and all seniors would save because of volume \ndiscount buying. We would use the private sector to do this. They would \nsave, on average, 25 to 40 percent on their drugs. That is a huge \nsavings right upfront that every senior could achieve.\n\n  On top of that savings, seniors up to 200 percent of poverty would \nnext spend, on average, about $100 a month out-of-pocket; then after \nthat, other than a very small copay, the Federal Government would cover \nthe rest of their prescription drug costs.\n  This is what seniors are looking for. In my campaign in the year \n2000, I took this plan all over the State of Nevada and talked to low-\nincome, moderate-income, and higher income seniors groups about it. I \ntold them that people who are in the lower income bracket are going to \nget most of the benefit, and for people in the higher income bracket, \nit is going to cost them more money, as it should.\n  In some of the other programs, no matter whether one is a lower \nincome or higher income senior, they basically are treated the same. I \npersonally do not think Ross Perot or somebody in his income category \nshould be treated the same as somebody who makes $15,000 a year. There \nshould be some difference. Under our bill, there is a great difference \nin the way those two categories of people would be treated.\n  The reason our bill is less costly to the taxpayer is one simple \nfact: All the other bills give a percentage of first dollar coverage. \nWhether it is 50 percent or whatever the coverage, after a very small \ndeductible, they all start covering right away. Our bill says the \nsenior is going to pay about the first $100 a month out of pocket, and \nthen after that, our coverage kicks in.\n  About 50 percent of the seniors do not have $1,200 worth of \nprescription drug costs per year, so about half the seniors, other than \nthe discounts they will get because of the prescription drug discount \ncard, actually will not use it. But, frankly, most seniors can afford \nabout $100 a month for prescription drugs. It is for that diabetic \npatient or that heart patient or that cancer patient who has maybe \nabout $500, or $300, or $400, or whatever it is, a month that they are \npaying in current prescription drug costs. These are the people that \nreally cannot afford their prescription drugs, and our bill helps that \nperson much more than most of the other plans.\n  The reason our bill saves so much money is that we keep the patient \naccountable for the drugs they are getting. They do not have somebody \nelse paying for it and as they get the benefit. That is one of the \nbiggest problems we have with our current health care system: There is \nno accountability with patients. They are receiving the benefit \nregardless of the cost, and so they do not think about shopping because \nsomebody else is paying the bill.\n  We do not have market forces working in the health care field today, \nand if we enact a prescription drug benefit without utilizing market \nforces, someday we are really going to regret it because we will have \nseverely out of control costs.\n  The bill we have introduced, we believe, is more fiscally responsible \nand targets most of the benefit for those who truly need it the most. \nWe can enact it a lot more quickly than some of the other programs, and \nit is permanent. It is because of those factors that we believe this \nbill is the bill that our colleagues should take a look at supporting.\n  We would be happy to meet with anybody to talk to them about the bill \nand possibly about cosponsoring the bill. Do not be turned off because \none political party may be offering one bill and the other party \noffering another bill. We are offering an alternative to either of \nthose bills, and we think this bill, with its fiscal responsibility to \nthe taxpayer, is the bill that people should support.\n  In closing, I look forward to engaging in a meaningful debate on \nprescription drugs after we deal with this accounting reform issue--and \nthis issue is so important, and I see my friend from Wyoming who has \ndone so much work on the bill, and I applaud him and the others who \nhave worked on this bill. But later in the week as we are debating this \nprescription drug benefit proposal, we need to take a serious look and \nnot play politics because seniors cannot afford for us to play politics \nwith the prescription drug issue. We need to work together in a \nbipartisan, rather, in a nonpartisan fashion, so seniors can get the \nhelp they so deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that under the provisions of rule XXII, I may \nyield whatever time I can yield back to Senator Gramm. I understand it \nis 44 minutes, and I yield that amount of time to Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have had two speakers from the other side. I ask \nunanimous consent to follow the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, some \nof us have been on the floor all this time waiting to speak, as well. \nWe hope for a chance to speak before we reach the end of the day.\n  I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I ask recognition to discuss my \namendment No. 4236. This amendment addresses the accountability of \ncorporate officers and directors. I strongly support the legislation \nbefore us which addresses the critical need to create an environment of \naccountability within corporate America. We need to send a strong \nmessage to corporate executives that the days of living large while \nlying, cheating, and stealing from the American people are over. \nControl of a company certainly has its advantages, but it also carries \nimportant obligations and duties. My amendment would address a \nsituation like Enron where officers cashed in on bonuses, severance \npackages and millions of dollars in stock sales as they saw the light \nof the train coming through the tunnel. Unfortunately for thousands of \nEnron employees and investors, they had no similar warning and were not \nable to bail themselves out before many lost not just their jobs, but \ntheir life savings as well. My amendment would make sure that officers \nand directors who know what is happening, who know that financial \nreports are being manipulated, can't cash in on this knowledge while \nleaving employees and investors holding the bag. It is the duty of \nofficers and directors to know what is happening in the corporation and \nto blow the whistle when they know there is wrongdoing.\n  In the case of Enron, 10 executives or directors joined CEO Ken Lay \nand Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow in siphoning off company \nproceeds and reaping millions of dollars when they sold their Enron \nshares high. Together these 12 individuals made stock profits totaling \nmore than $30 million before the company took a public nose dive at the \nend of last year. These corporate high rollers were reaping huge \nprofits at the same time thousands of hard working Americans were \nlosing more than a billion dollars in retirement savings, including \n$127 million in lost retirement savings in my home State alone by \nteachers and State employees.\n  Corporate greed, should not be rewarded. The underlying bill requires \nthat when a corporation has to file a restated financial report because \nof misconduct in the original report, the CEO and CFO have to give back \nany profits they have made from bonuses and stock sales for a year \nafter the original report. My amendment would expand on the bill by \ncalling into account all officers and directors who know about the \nmisconduct in filing the financial report and through that knowledge \nabuse the company's trust and the trust of their employees. It would \nalso mandate that officers and directors who have knowledge of \nwrongdoing in their financial reports would not only have to give up \nbonuses and profits but also their severance packages. Why should \nsomeone like\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\nJeff Skilling get a parachute as he bails out of a disaster he helped \nto create?\n  This amendment, my amendment, deserves support. It is endorsed by \nArthur Levitt, one of this nation's most distinguished financial \nauthorities. It is high time we call corporate executives on the carpet \nand hold them accountable. It is time we create an atmosphere that \nencourages responsible behavior and restores the confidence of the \nAmerican people in the economy of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is to be recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I will take a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I guess I just yielded the floor.\n  I yield to the Senator and ask recognition afterwards.\n  Mr. REID. We have had some very long speeches by those on the other \nside and I thought it appropriate we respond.\n  The ranking member of the Finance Committee had all these charts \nindicating that all the problems were not the problems of this \nadministration. The fact is, we realize there is a lot of blame to go \naround. With do not try to whitewash this issue.\n  The fact is, the President of the United States appointed the SEC \nCommissioner, who stated in the hearings he wanted a friendlier, a more \ngentle Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  That statement speaks for itself.\n  We also have to understand that actions speak louder than words. What \nI mean is, we have a Federal Government today, this administration, \nthat is basically run like corporate America. That has to change. That \nis what this legislation is all about.\n  When there is a situation where the President of the United States is \nbeing written up in editorials all over the country and news articles \nthroughout the country over his dealings with stock, borrowing money \nthat basically he did not have, to pay back the principle until you \nsell your stock--no one else gets deals like that. The commentators are \nlooking at that, as they should. Of course, the dealings that the Vice \nPresident had with Halliburton, we would like to know more about that. \nBut the Vice President is treating that like he treated his energy task \nforce: in complete secrecy, contrary to how we should be running this \nGovernment.\n  I believe we have a situation that cries out for passing this \nlegislation as quickly as possible. This administration must step \nforward and recognize they are part of the problem, until they start \ntalking about supporting this legislation, as I understand the \nPresident did today. I think that is wonderful. I understand he is \ngoing to help us get this through conference. I think that is \nimportant. I would like to see it before the August recess. It is \nimportant this legislation move forward.\n  Actions speak louder than words. This administration has to do more \nthan talk about what needs to be done. They have to work with us in \nsolving the problems of corporate America today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, there are many important provisions in \nthe legislation before the Senate to increase corporate accountability. \nI had hoped to offer an amendment to make workers' retirement plans \nwhole again when the corporate executives cheat.\n  After the collapse of Enron--the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history--\nthe President and many Republicans in Congress suggested that it was an \nisolated example of corporate wrongdoing. Since that time, the nation \nhas witnessed a continuing series of corporate scandals which have \ndemonstrated otherwise.\n  The lack of corporate responsibility in the United States has \nundermined the credibility of our markets and devastated the retirement \nsavings of millions of Americans. This widespread abuse of corporate \npower has also jeopardized our nation's economic recovery and hurt the \nlegitimacy of our fundamental institutions. We must take bold action \nthis week to ensure that corporations are made accountable and that \nworkers and investors are protected against these abuses.\n  In the past month, we have seen a jury criminally convict the Arthur \nAndersen accounting firm for engaging in the obstruction of justice to \ncover up the Enron debacle. We have seen WorldCom admit that it wrongly \nreported its true financial condition by nearly $4 billion. Just last \nweek, the Wall Street Journal reported that Merck recorded $12.4 \nbillion in revenue from a subsidiary that it never actually collected.\n  In response to these scandals the President gave a speech last week, \nwhich the White House likened to the words of former President Teddy \nRoosevelt. Unlike our nation's great trust-buster, the President failed \nto lay out a comprehensive plan to restore America's confidence in our \neconomic system.\n  Hard-working Americans and their families have suffered immensely as \na result of these scandals and the failure of the Administration to \ntake decisive action. Workers have lost their jobs, their health \nbenefits, and their retirement savings. Today, over 47 million workers \nrely on 401(k) plans and the stock market for retirement security. We \ncan't wait for the next report of corporate fraud, the next round of \nlayoffs, and retirement losses before we take serious action.\n  This wave of corporate scandals is undermining the confidence of \ninvestors in the U.S. economy. Mutual fund investors have lost about \n$700 billion in just the last 15 months. In May of this year, new \ninvestments in stock funds declined by nearly two-thirds from the \nprevious month. As foreign investors lose confidence in the \ntransparency of U.S. corporations, these investors are pulling out of \nthe U.S. market and the value of the dollar is now falling against \nforeign currency. With an unemployment rate of 5.9 percent, America's \nworkers can ill afford to have their economic prospects dimmed by \ncorporate corruption.\n  Its time--in fact its long past time--to pass tough new laws to \nprevent future abuses of corporate power. We must reform our accounting \nsystem, enact criminal penalties for corporate wrongdoers, and pass new \nprotections for workers.\n  Senator Sarbanes' accounting bill is critical to reforming our public \naccounting system and ensuring transparency and accountability for \ncorporations in the United States. The legislation creates an \nindependent oversight board; it restricts the non-audit services than \nan accounting firm can provide to the public companies that it audits; \nit holds corporate executives responsible for the accuracy of corporate \nfinancial statements; it requires corporate insiders to report stock \nsales and corporate loans to the SEC; and it provides additional \nresources to the SEC to improve its investigation and enforcement \ncapabilities. We all owe a debt of gratitude to our colleague, Senator \nPaul Sarbanes, for shepherding this legislation through the Banking \nCommittee and bringing it before the Senate.\n  In addition to these accounting reforms, we must hold corporate \nexecutives accountable when they mislead workers and undermine their \nretirement security. At Enron, executives cashed out more than a \nbillion dollars of stock while Enron workers lost nearly a billion \ndollars from their 401(k) retirement plans. Thousands of Enron workers \nlost virtually all of their retirement savings. Enron executives got \nrich off stock options even as they drove the company into the ground \nand systematically misled workers about the true financial state of the \ncompany. Ken Lay now has a pension of nearly half a million dollars a \nyear for life. Many Enron workers have nothing at all.\n  These are all statements that were made by Mr. Lay. Ken Lay's lies \nencouraged workers to buy Enron stock at $49. He ``never felt better \nabout the prospects of the company.'' He predicted to employees a \n``significantly higher stock price,'' saying it was ``an incredible \nbargain'' as it was going down. Mr. Lay has a pension of nearly half a \nmillion dollars a year. At WorldCom, the workers lost more than half of \ntheir retirement savings as the stock dropped from $60 to just 6 cents. \nWorkers across the country also lost big as a result corporate \nwrongdoing at WorldCom. The brave firefighters and police officers of \nNew York City lost $100 million from their pension fund.\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\nOver 20,000 workers have been laid off in the last few weeks because of \nthe actions of WorldCom executives. Yet, those same executives made out \nlike bandits. Former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers is guaranteed a million \nand a half dollars for the rest of his life while WorldCom workers face \na bleak financial future.\n  Sadly, Enron and WorldCom are not just isolated tales of corporate \ngreed that hurt America's workers. At Kmart, 22,000 workers were laid \noff. At Lucent, 16,000 workers were laid off. At Xerox, over 13,000 \nworkers were laid off. At Tyco, almost 10,000 workers were laid off. At \nGlobal Crossing, over 9,000 workers were laid off.\n  These corporate debacles reveal a much deeper crisis of corporate \nvalues. In America, people who work hard all their lives deserve \nretirement security in their golden years. It is wrong--dead wrong--to \nexpect Americans to face poverty in retirement after decades of working \nand saving.\n  For far too long, corporate executives have been obsessed with their \nown compensation instead of the long-term health of the companies they \nlead. Executives, like those at Enron and Wordcom, should not put their \nown short-term gain ahead of the long-term interests of workers and \nshareholders. They must not be rewarded for doing so. At Enron, workers \nwere systematically misled by Enron executives about the financial \nsituation of the company. For years, Enron, like many other companies, \npushed its workers to buy company stock with their own 401(k) \ncontributions.\n  Until the bitter end, Enron executives continued to promote Enron \nstock to workers in a series of e-mails. On August 14, Enron CEO \nKenneth Lay told workers that he ``never felt better about the \nprospects for the company.'' On August 27, Lay predicted to workers a \n``significantly higher stock price.'' And on September 26, Lay called \nEnron stock ``an incredible bargain.'' Even as they promised the moon, \nLay and other executives were cashing out their stock for a billion \ndollars.\n  If Enron and WorldCom scandals teach us anything, it's that we must \nstop rewarding corporate misbehavior.\n  Our amendment--it is cosponsored by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire--\nmakes it clear that executives who give workers misleading information \nabout the company stock in their 401(k) plans face serious penalties. \nThe amendment is the civil law parallel to the Leahy criminal \nprovisions, which punish executives for defrauding investors. The \namendment is also the ERISA civil law parallel to the Biden amendment, \nwhich increases the ERISA criminal penalties. When executives lie and \nmislead workers about company stock, they must face real penalties.\n  Under current pension law, Enron executives, like Ken Lay, and Arthur \nAnderson, cannot be held responsible for workers' losses in their \n401(k) plan. The amendment makes a corporate ``insider''--an officer or \ndirector or the independent public accountant--responsible under \npension law if the insider misleads workers about the company's stock.\n  America's workers need this amendment to hold Ken Lay and other \nexecutives engaged in wrongdoing accountable. The amendment empowers \nworkers to seek restitution when executives knowingly abuse workers' \npensions. If workers lose their retirement savings due to deliberate \ncorporate mismanagement, then they should have the right under our laws \nto hold those top executives accountable in a court of law, and recover \nwhat they lost. This right could make the difference for a family \nbetween an impoverished retirement and a comfortable retirement that \nthey earned.\n  The economic health of our nation depends on reigning in the abuses \nof corporate power which we have witnessed in recent months. Restoring \nthe credibility of accounting standards, as the Sarbanes bill would do, \nis critical to restoring confidence in our markets. At the same time, \nwe must also restore basic fairness to our system.\n  When corporations like Enron fail because of executive wrongdoing, \ncorporate executives get golden parachutes but workers are left with a \ntin cup when it comes to their retirement. Corporate criminals must be \nmade to pay for their misdeeds.\n  We see from this chart what has happened: Ken Lay, $457,000 a year \nfor life, retirement savings were decimated, 4,200 layoffs; former \nWorldCom CEO, Bernard Ebbers, $1.5 million a year, retirement savings \ndecimated, 20,000 layoffs; Richard McGinn, $12.5 million lump sum pay \nfor Lucent, retirement savings decimated, layoffs for 16,000; Charles \nConway, $9 million lump sum pension, retirement savings decimated \n22,000 layoffs.\n  This has to stop. Today we have a critical opportunity to protect \nworkers and investors against future abuses of corporate power. We must \nnot let these hard-working Americans down.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside the \npending amendment in order that I may offer the Kennedy-Gregg \namendment, which I send to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nMassachusetts retains the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I have heard objection. We tried to get \nthis amendment up during the period of the last week and were closed \nout. It is a simple amendment. It is an amendment that can do more to \nprotect workers' interests than many other proposals. I think we ought \nto have some accountability for those who willingly mislead, willingly \nand knowingly mislead workers, and then benefit from insider \ninformation.\n  It would just give them a cause of action, a specific case, no \npunitive damages. It would be a factual situation which would have to \nbe decided in the courts of law. But it does seem to me to offer a real \nmeaningful opportunity to protect workers and the savings of workers \nfrom the kind of gross abuse we have seen currently here in the Senate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts has just \npropounded a unanimous consent request on an amendment that makes good \nsense to me, and it certainly should be added to this bill. I assume it \nis a germane amendment. We are postcloture. At the very least, he \nshould have gotten a vote on the amendment. But I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts knows that this has gone on all afternoon. I offered \nan amendment a couple of hours ago that was simple and germane. It \nshould have had a vote. It said that if the CEOs and directors of a \ncorporation waltz out the door with millions of dollars of bonuses, \nstock options, and incentive pay, and then the company goes bankrupt, \nthey have to give it back. I couldn't get that amendment up for a vote \nbecause of the same objection.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Massachusetts might conclude from this \nthat the things here in the final hour which are germane have a right \nto be considered and heard on behalf of the workers and the \nshareholders and the folks who didn't get rich but the folks who lost \neverything. I wonder if there is not a pattern here that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts sees and that others see to shut down those \namendments and protect the folks at the top while the folks at the \nbottom lost everything.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this amendment is relevant. But under \nthe strict rules of the Senate, it would not be considered germane, \nalthough I think a commonsense evaluation or review of the amendment's \npurpose and what the underlying bill is about would certainly appear to \nI think most people to be an important strengthening provision if we \nare interested in corporate responsibility and protection for workers. \nIt is certainly relevant, but under the technical rules it is not \ngermane.\n  But I think anyone who knows what this bill is really all about \nunderstands what is happening in these circumstances. This would \ncertainly be a very strengthening provision in the underlying \nprovisions. We were unable to get the opportunity to have the \nconsideration because we were foreclosed from that opportunity at the \nend of last week and we are getting objections this week.\n  I think that is unfortunate. As I understand it, the most current \nsupport for this is overwhelmingly among Republicans and Democrats \nalike across\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\nthis country. They understand. It doesn't take a lot of debate or \ndiscussion to understand what accountability is all about. Under the \nexisting laws, they can only have accountability, not for those who are \nat the CEO level, who are really the ones making these judgments and \ndecisions upon which workers are relying, but they would only be able \nto sue lesser figures in the corporate ladder. Therefore, this is not \nan effective remedy for workers.\n  We are trying to provide an effective remedy for workers who are \nbeing shortchanged. It makes eminently good sense. It is eminently \nfair. It is eminently responsible. It is eminently relevant. But there \nhas been objection to it.\n  I want to give assurance to the Senator that we look forward to \noffering this amendment at another time at the first opportunity.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nbe recognized today at 5 until 15 after the hour to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            insider trading\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. S. 2673 includes provisions prohibiting insider trading of \ncompany stock during so-called blackouts--or periods during which \npension plan participants are unable to exercise control over the \nassets in their accounts. In order to implement the insider trading \nprohibition, it was necessary to provide a definition of a blackout \nperiod. The Banking Committee also provided a 30-day notice requirement \nprior to a blackout, so workers and executives alike would know when \nthe insider trading prohibition would be effective.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there appears to be broad consensus that \npension plan administrators should be required to provide 30 days' \nnotice to affected plan participants before limiting their ability to \nexercise the rights provided through their pension plans. These advance \nblackout notices will become integral requirements for how pension \nplans will operate in the future. Because of this, notice requirements \nwere included both in the pension bill reported by the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, HELP, Committee on March 21, and in the \nbill reported by the Finance Committee unanimously on July 11.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree with the Senator from Iowa. Although the general \nconcepts are agreed upon, however, there are differences between these \nprovisions in all three bills that affect the operations of pension \nplans, and will clearly need to be worked out before the bill is sent \nto the President's desk. Harmonizing these requirements will require a \ncareful balance between the rights of pension participants and the \nfinancial burdens on plan administrators.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I certainly agree with the remarks of my colleagues. My \nbill provides pension plan participants with written notice 30 days \nbefore a plan blackout begins, and prohibits blackouts from continuing \nfor an unreasonable time. This important disclosure to pension plan \nparticipants is within the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I also agree with the remarks of my colleagues. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, which also has jurisdiction over \npension plans, I join the chairman of the HELP Committee and the \nranking members of both the Finance and HELP Committees in urging the \nchairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee to work with us as \nyou go to conference on S. 2673, to ensure that the blackout provisions \nare drafted in such a way as to ensure the proper operation of the \npension system.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I look forward to consulting with both the Finance \nCommittee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee as \nwe go to conference to make sure the provisions are appropriately \ndrafted.\n\n\n             Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Section 302 of S. 2673 involves Corporate Responsibility \nfor Financial Reports. I am concerned that in subsection (b), where the \nCEO and CFO sign documents to verify the accuracy of financial reports, \nthe bill's language says they shall ``certify'' the accuracy of the \nfinancial documents. In my view, this language should read ``certify \nunder oath'' in order to be consistent with current Securities and \nExchange Commission, SEC, regulations. You can clearly see that the SEC \ncurrently requires that these statements to be under oath. Let's not \ncreate a lower standard in this bill than currently exists in \nregulation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate the Senator's interest, and I hope his \nconcerns can be addressed in conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for his assistance on this issue and \nhis leadership on this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Exhibit A of the order be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From SEC website www.sec.gov, June 27, 2002, OMB Number: 3235-0569; \n                       Expires: January 31, 2003]\n\n     Exhibit A--Statement Under Oath of Principal Executive \n         Officer and Principal Financial Officer Regarding Facts \n         and Circumstances Relating to Exchange Act Filings\n       I, [Name of principal executive officer or principal \n     financial officer], state and attest that:\n       (1) To the best of my knowledge, based upon a review of the \n     covered reports of [company name], and, except as corrected \n     or supplemented in a subsequent covered report: no covered \n     report contained an untrue statement of a material fact as of \n     the end of the period covered by such report (or in the case \n     of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, as of \n     the date on which it was filed); and no covered report \n     omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the \n     statements in the covered report, in light of the \n     circumstances under which they were made, not misleading as \n     of the end of the period covered by such report (or in the \n     case of a report on Form 8-K or definitive proxy materials, \n     as of the date on which it was filed).\n       (2) I [have/have not] reviewed the contents of this \n     statement with [the Company's audit committee] [in the \n     absence of an audit committee, the independent members of the \n     Company's board of directors].\n       (3) In this statement under oath, each of the following, if \n     filed on or before the date of this statement, is a ``covered \n     report'':\n       [identify most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with \n     the Commission] of [company name];\n       all reports on Form 10-Q, all reports on Form 8-K and all \n     definitive proxy materials of [company name] filed with the \n     Commission subsequent to the filing of the Form 10-K \n     identified above; and\n       any amendments to any of the foregoing.\n\n\n                GUIDANCE TO STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure \nthat State regulators do not automatically apply the provisions of this \nbill to accounting firms, particularly small accounting firms and firms \nthat service small businesses without first looking at the possible \nharmful unintended consequences to those small businesses. The \nstandards applied by the board under this act could create undue \nburdens and cost if applied to nonpublic accounting companies and other \naccounting firms that provide services to small business clients.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I agree with my friend, the Senator from Nevada, and want \nto add that what we need to avoid is a possible cascading effect, \nstarting with the Federal Government, that could eventually hurt the \nsmall accounting businesses in this country.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Many of these small businesses rely on their CPA or \nauditor to provide objective, trusted advice and counsel on a broad \nrange of tax and business related issues. Without this amendment, we \nwill end up harming thousands of American accounting firms and their \nsmall business clients.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Nevada is right \nabout the harmful affects this legislation could have on small \nbusinesses, not only the small accounting firms in this country, but \nalso the small business clients of those companies. This\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\namendment says to the State regulators to look very carefully at the \neffects this legislation could have for smaller and medium-sized firms, \nand also on small businesses that may rely on larger firms for their \naudit work.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Senator from Texas for his comments.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as a businessman, I have been deeply \nconcerned about the reports of fraudulent and even criminal behavior at \nprominent American corporations. When I worked in business on a daily \nbasis, this is not the kind of behavior I saw or expected from my \npeers. It is imperative that we respond to the corporate malfeasance \nwhich has been roiling our markets. The impact of these acts, all for \nthe sake of boosting short-term profits, has been broad, costing many \ntheir jobs and others their savings.\n  The free market is the underpinning of our economic system, the key \nto the growth and development of our Nation in the last two centuries. \nThe many creative and dynamic businesses which make up our democratic \ncapitalism make important contributions in the form of good paying jobs \nand the taxes which pay for critical services, such as our national \ndefense. Above all, these businesses are good citizens in their \ncommunities. As a result, businessmen are important and highly valued \npeople in our society. The vast majority of businessmen act in good \nfaith and with integrity. It is the bad apples who give the rest a bad \nname.\n  Our system has been abused. Unfortunately, those who have raped the \nsystem have reaped financial gain, while the rest have lost jobs, \nsavings and pensions. They and their boards violated the public trust.\n  Those who are lucky enough to be in positions of leadership have an \nenormous responsibility to enhance and not damage our economy. \nUnfortunately, the current system of regulation has not been sufficient \nto prevent bad actors from abusing their positions. That is why we are \ntaking action today. We must build more accountability into our economy \nbecause the bad actors--even if they are not in great numbers--have \nimpacted our whole economy. The stock market is no longer the \nplayground of the rich: We are now in an era when as many as 50 percent \nof the American people have some of their assets in the stock market, \nmeaning enormous repercussions if companies are misrepresenting their \nfinancial positions.\n  I agree with the President that ethical behavior and corporate \nresponsibility are essential if we are to restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in our free markets. However, the colossal corporate \nwrongdoing we have seen uncovered--in 2001 alone, 270 public companies \nhad to restate the numbers in their financial statements--requires that \nwe step up to the plate and address some of the structural problems \nwhich have allowed these frauds to occur.\n  That is why I support S. 2673, the Public Accounting and Corporate \nReform Investor Protection Act of 2002.\n  There are those who have said this legislation is too strong. I \ndisagree. This legislation will not have a negative impact on people \ndoing their jobs as they should. We have an obligation to protect \ninvestors, employees, citizens. We are saying to CEOs, their fellow \nexecutives, and their boards: We expect you to do your jobs correctly, \nwith integrity, and if you don't, you will be held accountable.\n  It is not enough to challenge corporate America to do better. We must \nmake clear that there is a cost to engaging in accounting and \nsecurities fraud. That is why I supported the Leahy amendment, a \nversion of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act. This \namendment strengthens existing criminal penalties for corporate crime, \ncreates a securities fraud felony punishable by up to 10 years in \nprison, and creates a new crime for schemes to defraud shareholders. \nThe amendment also would establish a new felony antishredding provision \nand would protect corporate whistleblowers.\n  The strength of the Sarbanes bill is not in the penalties alone. The \nbill addresses conflicts of interest which have permitted these crimes \nto occur and is a balanced approach which will help prevent corporate \nfraud from occurring in the first place.\n  The bill sets up a strong, independent, and full-time oversight board \nwith broad authorities to regulate auditors of public companies, set \nauditing standards, and investigate violations of accounting practices. \nThe Public Accounting Oversight Board proposed in the bill is a better \nalternative to the part-time board currently being pushed by the SEC. \nThat board would leave standard setting to the accounting profession \nand would most likely perpetuate the status quo. It is the lack of \nclear standards coming from the current system of self-regulation which \nhas been the root of many of the frauds being revealed today.\n  The Sarbanes bill also restricts the nonaudit services a public \naccounting firm may provide to its clients that are public companies. \nThese consulting services are clear conflicts of interest for \nindependent auditors. We cannot rely on auditors to serve as the \nwatchdogs of publicly traded companies if they are deeply invested in \nthese same companies. If we cannot rely on the auditors, than how are \nwe to rely on the markets?\n  Finally, the Sarbanes bill addresses the problem of stock analyst \nconflicts of interest. The Merrill Lynch case recently settled in New \nYork is an egregious example of stock analysts pushing stocks that they \nactually thought had little value. Most often the motive for pushing \nstocks of questionable value is to boost their own investment banking \ndepartments which are underwriting these stocks. The bill before us \ntoday addresses this problem and requires the SEC to adopt rules \ndesigned to protect the independence and integrity of securities \nanalysts.\n  I have no illusions that one bill will be the panacea for all that \ncurrently ails corporate America. For example, I believe there is more \nwe should do, beyond the corporate disclosures in this bill, to address \nproblems with corporate boards. We have a responsibility, however, to \nrestore confidence in our markets and in the solid businesses which \nmake up these markets so that our economy can thrive. Only decisive \naction can prevent this fraud on the American people from happening \nagain.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the past year as Americans have \nworked hard to restart our economy, we have been hit by report after \nreport of irregularities, misconduct, and blatant conflicts of interest \nby corporate executives, auditors, and brokerage firms.\n  The current corporate and auditing scandals are hurting American \nfamilies. Thousands of jobs and retirement accounts have disappeared. \nMillions of current investors have watched their gains evaporate. Our \neconomic recovery looks more distant. And most importantly for our \nlong-term prosperity, investors are no longer confident that the \nfinancial information provided by public companies and their auditors \nis accurate.\n  Congress cannot restore the jobs and retirement savings caused by \nthis wave of corporate and auditing scandals. It can act to strengthen \noversight of the accounting industry, to demand greater responsibility \nfrom corporate executives, and to address conflicts of interest in \nbrokerage firms.\n  Today I am voting for reform. We need to send a strong message to \nworking and retired Americans, to investors, and to the executives and \nauditors of publicly held companies that this Senate will act to \nrestore accountability and faith in our free market system. The \nSenate's bipartisan accounting reform bill will do just that.\n  First, the bill limits its scope to publicly held companies. The bill \ndoes not attempt to federalize accounting oversight. Instead, it \nstrengthens the Federal Government's historic role of regulating \npublicly traded companies and their auditors. The State boards of \naccountancy will continue their important role of regulating \naccountants who audit private companies.\n  Second, the legislation establishes a strong, independent Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board. The board is empowered to set \nauditing, quality control, and ethics standards, to inspect registered \naccounting firms, to conduct investigations, and to take disciplinary \nactions. As a check on the board's power, its decisions are subject to \noversight and review by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\n  Third, this bill seeks to ensure that auditors are fulfilling their \npublic duties by ending potential conflicts of interest. Large \naccounting firms typically provide both audit and nonaudit services to \ntheir public company clients. The legislation would prohibit auditors \nfrom performing specific nonauditing services, unless those services \nare approved on a case-by-case basis by the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board. All legal nonaudit services would need to be approved \nby a public company's audit committee.\n  Fourth, the Senate legislation demands that corporate leaders take \ngreater responsibility. The bill requires that chief executive \nofficers, CEOs, and chief financial officers, CFOs, certify financial \nreports, outlaws fraud and deception by managers in the auditing \nprocess, prevents CEOs and CFOs from benefitting from misstatements \nmade in their financial reports, and prohibits corporate decisionmakers \nfrom selling company stock at a time when their employees are \nprohibited from doing so.\n  Fifth, the Senate bill would limit the growing pressure and conflicts \nof interest that affect the independence of stock analysts. Just as \ninvestors need to know that a company's financial reports are accurate, \nso should investors expect objective opinions from stock analysts.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize additional funding for the SEC and \nwould establish independent sources of funding for the new oversight \nboard and FASB. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I \nwill support full funding for the SEC.\n  We need to work to prevent future scandals. We also need stronger \ncriminal laws and penalties to address fraud and abuse by corporate \nexecutives and auditors. During last week's debate I voted for three \namendments, including an amendment by Senator Leahy, that would close \ngaps in current law.\n  I know some of my constituents in the accounting and business \ncommunities are concerned by a few of the steps in the Senate bill. As \nI talk to certified public accountants in my State, they have \nemphasized that it is critical to encourage greater competition in the \npublic accounting field. I agree investors would be better served by \nmore competition. The bill requires the Comptroller General, in \nconsultation with various agencies and organizations, to identify the \nfactors that have led to the consolidation of public accounting firms \nsince 1989, the impact of consolidation, and ways to address it. While \na study does not guarantee action, I look forward to reviewing its \nfindings.\n  It is time to restore confidence in corporate financial statements. \nIt is time to hold people accountable who violate the public trust. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Individual investors, saving for their retirement or \ntheir children's education, count on business leaders to play by the \nrules. They also count on financial industry professionals including \naccountants and research analysis to produce reliable, professional, \nand honest work.\n  But recent business scandals at Enron, Tyco, Merrill Lynch, WorldCom \nand others are proving that without strong government oversight and \nregulation, greed will lead executives, accountants, and investment \nanalysts to abuse the trust that American workers and investors have \nplaced in them.\n  We have to restore that trust. This bill is a good first step. It has \nthe necessary teeth to clamp down on corporate irresponsibility. First, \nit creates a full-time independent board to set ethical auditing \nstandards. Second, it prevents companies from providing most consulting \nservices for the very same companies that they audit. Third, if \nenforced, it would send corporate executives who mislead shareholders \nto jail. Fourth, it forces Wall Street investment research analysts to \ndisclose any conflicts of interest that they or their financial \ninstitution might have in the investment recommendations that they \nmake. And finally, it protects whistleblowers who reveal unethical acts \nby the companies for which they work.\n  I support this bill and would have supported even stronger \nlegislation. I remain concerned that the public members on the board \ncreated in this bill are not chosen according to specific independence \nstandards. I am also concerned that disclosure requirements do not \ninclude the holdings of family members of influential research analysts \non Wall Street. And most importantly I had hoped we could do more to \nget funds to workers who lose their jobs as a result of executive \nmisconduct. Those concerns aside, this bill is a good first step in \nrestoring confidence in the system.\n  Unfortunately, the House recently passed a bill that is weak and will \nnot get the job done. It fails to establish a full-time board to design \nand enforce auditing standards, does not mandate jail time for \nsecurities fraud, and fails to protect whistleblowers. On the conflicts \nof interests that investment analysts are forced to disclose in the \nSenate bill, the House bill calls only for a study of the issue.\n  I urge the President to go beyond rhetoric and endorse the Senate \naccounting reform bill so that we can get a strong bill out of \nconference. I also urge the President to join us in fighting for \nmeaningful pension reform to ensure that American's retirement savings \nare protected.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few \nmoments to praise the Banking Committee for bringing the Public Company \nAccounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002 to the floor and \nall the hard work they have done in the past week. In the weeks before \nthis bill came to the floor I thought that what we needed was some type \nof Investors' Bill of Rights.\n  I had worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come up \nwith bipartisan goals to prevent corporate abuse and protect investors. \nI feel that much of the bill on the floor fulfills these goals. I feel \nthat there are a few things that investors should see happen when we \npass this bill. I believe that much of this bill will help, and in \nother areas we may have to work further.\n  I believe that investors must have access to information about a \ncompany. We should ensure that every investor has access to clear and \nunderstandable information needed to judge a firm's financial \nperformance, condition and risks. The SEC will have the power to make \nsure companies provide investors a true and fair picture of themselves. \nA company should disclose information in its control that a reasonable \ninvestor would find necessary to assess the company's value, without \ncompromising competitive assets.\n  I believe that investors should be able to trust the auditors. \nInvestors rely on strong, fair and transparent auditory procedures and \nthe concept of the Oversight Board in the Sarbanes bill is a sound one.\n  I believe investors should be able to trust corporate CEOs. Unlike \nshareholders or even directors, corporate officers work full-time to \npromote and protect the well-being of the firm. A CEO bears \nresponsibility for informing the firm's shareholders of its financial \nhealth. I support the concept of withholding CEO bonuses and other \nincentive-based forms of compensation in cases of illegal and unethical \naccounting. Further, I do believe that CEOs must vouch for the veracity \nof public disclosures including financial statements.\n  I believe that investors should be able to trust stock analysts. \nInvestors should be able to trust that recommendations made by analysts \nare not biased by promises of profit dependent on ratings. It is only \ncommon sense that there should be rules of conduct for stock analysts \nand that there must be disclosure requirements that might illuminate \nconflicts of interest.\n  Finally, I believe that we should be able to rely on the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to protect investors and maintain the integrity \nof the securities market. Current funding is inadequate and should be \nincreased to allow for greater oversight, ensuring investors' trust in \ngood government.\n  During the debate on this bill my attention has been called to the \nplight of public pension systems, such as Oregon's Public Employment \nRetirement System, known by the acronym PERS. PERS you see was invested \nin both Enron and WorldCom stock and has been hit hard by the debacles \nthat occurred in each company. The PERS system lost about $46 million \nafter Enron self-destructed and another $63 million following the \nWorldCom scandal.\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\n  These losses occurred because false profits were inflated and \ncorporate books were doctored. Under the PERS system, an 8 percent rate \nof return is guaranteed for the 290,000 Oregon active and retired \nmembers of PERS. Oregon taxpayers have to make up the difference \nfollowing an ENRON debacle or WorldCom scandal, and my State's budget \nis not prepared for this kind of loss.\n  While this bill goes far in creating accountability, I am interested \nin finding out if there is more we can do and am asking the General \nAccounting Office, in consultation with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Department of Labor, to report to Congress on the \nextent to which Federal securities laws have led to declines in the \nvalue of stock in publicly traded companies and in public and private \npension plans.\n  I believe this study is necessary because many public and private \npension plans continue to rely on the continued stock growth in \npublicly traded companies, much like the PERS system. I hope this study \nwill provide the needed information so public and private pension plans \ncan reevaluate future investments in publicly traded companies.\n  We cannot stand by and watch our hard working Americans ruin their \npension systems while corrupt corporate executives take advantage of \ninvestors. I am proud of the work the Senate has done in the last week \nin creating accountability and responsibility in corporate America and \nlook forward to working on this issue in a way that will help the \ninvestors and pensioners in the PERS system in Oregon.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nPublic Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002. I \nthank Chairman Sarbanes for his leadership and the Banking Committee's \nstaff for their efforts which have resulted in a measure which is fair, \nrealistic, and protects investors. The steady disclosure of accounting \nscandals and corporate misdeeds underscores the need for legislation to \nprotect investors and to restore public trust in the accounting \nindustry and financial markets. Chairman Sarbanes has been the leading \nvoice for reform. Our Banking Committee held ten hearings on accounting \nand investor protection issues in February and March. These hearings \nproduced extremely valuable information from which S. 2673 was \ndeveloped.\n  Public confidence has been shaken by the incidences of fraud and \nmisrepresentations revealed in the financial statements of companies. \nEnron, Xerox, and WorldCom are just a few examples of corporations \nwhich have misled investors with their financial statements. Since \n1997, there have been almost 1,000 restatements of earnings by \ncompanies. Investors have suffered substantial financial losses and are \nunsure of the validity of the audits of public companies. There is a \nlingering fear that there will be additional revelations of corporate \nfraud or misrepresentation. This has already harmed investor confidence \nand could continue to have an adverse impact on the financial markets.\n  I support this bill because it takes the appropriate steps to help \nrestore public trust in the accounting industry and financial markets. \nS. 2673 would create an independent Public Accounting Oversight Board \nto provide effective oversight over those in the accounting industry \nresponsible for auditing public companies. Previous attempts at \nregulation have been complex and ineffective. As the numerous auditing \nfailures demonstrate, there is a need for an independent Board with \nauthority to adopt and enforce auditing, quality control, ethics, and \nindependence standards for auditors.\n  The legislation also requires additional corporate governance \nprocedures to make Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial \nOfficers more directly responsible for the quality of financial \nreporting made to investors. After the numerous misstatements and \ncorporate abuses that have occurred, this is a necessary step to ensure \nthat corporate executives are held accountable for the financial \nstatements of their companies. A particularly important provision in \nthe bill would require that CEOs and CFOs forfeit bonuses, incentive-\nbased compensation, and profits from stock sales if accounting \nrestatements result from material noncompliance with SEC financial \nreporting requirements.\n  Rules to limit and disclose conflicts of interests for stock analysts \nare included in the legislation. There is a concern that firms pressure \ntheir analysts to provide favorable reports on current or potential \ninvestment banking clients. This provision would provide protection to \nthose individual investors who often depend on analysts for making \ninvestment decisions without being aware of the potential conflicts of \ninterest that the analysts may have with companies whose stock they \nevaluate.\n  The Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act also \nauthorizes additional appropriations for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission in order to provide the resources necessary to protect \ninvestors. According to the General Accounting Office, approximately \n250 positions were vacant last year because the Commission was unable \nto attract qualified candidates. Additional funding is needed to \nattract and retain qualified employees. S. 2673 would authorize \nappropriations of $776 million for the Commission, which is much \ngreater than President Bush's original budget request of $467 million. \nI am pleased that the President is moving closer to supporting the \ndollar amount included in the bill.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Sarbanes for including an amendment in \nthe bill which I have worked closely with the Committee staff in \ndeveloping. The amendment would require the General Accounting Office, \nGAO, to conduct a study of the factors that have led to consolidation \nin the accounting industry and the impact that this has had on the \nsecurities markets. Since 1989, the Big 8 accounting firms have \nnarrowed down to the Big 5 and may soon become the Final 4. This study \nis necessary to evaluate the impact that consolidation has had on \nquality of audit services, audit costs, auditor independence, or other \nproblems for businesses. In addition, the study is necessary to \ndetermine what can be done to increase competition among accounting \nfirms and whether federal or state regulations impede competition.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has worked in a strong bipartisan \nfashion to strengthen this bill. Extremely valuable amendments have \nbeen added to the original committee bill. In particular, the Leahy and \nBiden amendments strengthen penalties for corporate fraud. These two \namendments will help provide much needed additional protection for \ninvestors and retirement plan participants.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Public Accounting Reform and \nInvestor Protection Act of 2002 to restore public trust in the \naccounting industry and the financial markets.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support and \ncosponsor an amendment to S. 2673 offered by the senior Senator from \nNew York, which would prohibit all loans by a corporation to its \ndirectors or executive officers.\n  Among the abuses committed by senior executives and directors at \ncompanies such as WorldCom, Enron, and Global Crossing is the practice \nof issuing large, favorable loans to those executives and directors.\n  Those loans can create conflicts of interest that limit that the \nability of outside directors, in particular, to voice their criticism \nof the institution.\n  Many years ago, I served on the board of directors of a bank, and \nnoted that at the time, several of the directors had hundreds of \nthousands of dollars worth of outstanding loans at that bank.\n  At the time, this occurred to me to be wrong, and I could not \nunderstand why these directors did not take out loans at another bank, \nthereby avoiding any conflicts of interest.\n  The only conclusion I could draw was that the loans to these \ndirectors were either easier to procure or made on more favorable terms \nthan loans from another bank would be.\n  I see no justification for providing loans to corporate directors or \nexecutive officers. The goal of the reforms that we are currently \ndebating should be to create an environment in which outside directors \nand major corporate officers act in as pure and honest a manner as \npossible.\n\n[[Page S6761]]\n\n  They should not enter into any appearance of conflict, such as the \nconflict that occurs when the corporation that they serve extends them \na personal loan.\n  When an individual investor chooses to buy a stock, he or she does so \nwith the full knowledge that it might turn out to be a bad investment. \nThe stock may appreciate in value, but it might also go sour.\n  Anyone who makes that investment knows that the only way to be sure \nnot to lose any money is to keep the money in cash or buy a T-bill.\n  But that is not the way it worked for the CEOs and directors of some \nof the largest public companies in this country.\n  For example, Bernard Ebbers, the former CEO of WorldCom, took out \n$430 million in loans from his company between September 2000 and the \nend of 2001.\n  When the SEC began investigating WorldCom earlier this year, $343 \nmillion in loans were still outstanding, most of which may never be \nrecovered by WorldCom's investors.\n  Those loans to Ebbers are far from unique in corporate America today. \nOne of the most egregious examples of this type of abuse recent months \nis the disclosure of $3.1 billion in loans extended to family members \nand affiliated business interests of the Rigas family by Adelphia \nCommunications, a publicly traded company controlled by the Rigas \nfamily.\n  These loans were never disclosed to shareholders, and were apparently \nused to shore up a wide variety of business deals involving Rigas \nfamily members, including a golf course and an infusion of cash into \nthe Buffalo Sabres hockey team.\n  On July 9, President Bush went to Wall Street and called for, among \nother things, ``an end to all company loans to corporate officers.''\n  I believe that the President was right, and have cosponsored this \namendment with that goal in mind.\n  Investors have a right to know exactly how much of their dividends \nare going to pay for excessive pay packages. They also have a right to \nexpect that the board of directors is truly independent and that no \ndirectors are tied too closely to the corporation they serve because of \nloans they have received from it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nlegislation we are considering, S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting \nReform and Investor Protection Act of 2002.\n  Last fall, we watched as a company once in the top 10 of the Fortune \n500 imploded from the weight of its own complex efforts to mask debt \nand hide losses. We watched as the company stock-laden retirement plans \nof Enron's loyal employees dwindled by $1 billion. Meanwhile, company \nexecutives cashed out their own shares while these employees were \nbarred from doing so. And finally, in congressional hearings, we \nwatched and listened as former Enron executives either chose to remain \nsilent, or pointed fingers of blame at everyone's actions except their \nown.\n  Tragically, the bankruptcy of Enron was no anomaly in the business \nsector. Rather, it was only the beginning. It ultimately proved to be a \nwatershed event, as several other companies have reevaluated their own \nbusiness and accounting methods, and found significant indiscretions. \nGlobal Crossing, a telecommunications company, is being investigated by \nthe SEC and FBI in regard to questionable accounting practices used to \nartificially inflate revenue. Adelphia Communications, a cable company, \nis now in bankruptcy proceedings due to investigations by the SEC and \ntwo federal grand juries for off-balance sheet loans to the company's \nfounders.\n  More recently, Xerox announced that it would restate 5 years of \nresults which could affect the true nature of what had been reported as \n$6 billion in revenues. And on June 25, WorldCom announced that it had \nmisrepresented $3.8 billion in expenses over five quarters, therefore \nallowing the company to report financial gain, when in reality, the \ncompany was experiencing a net loss.\n  While the downward spiral of each of these companies was unique, \ncommon threads are woven through each of their failures. First, the \ninsistence by executives that, above all else, stock price remain high \nwas an integral part of the creation of the financial woes of each \ncompany; in essence, this short-term focus compromised the long-term \nviability of these entities.\n  What has also been disturbing as these revelations have come to light \nis the role played by the so-called independent auditors of the \ncompanies under investigation. While the accountants are not the sole \nperpetrators of the financial deception that has occurred, the apparent \nlack of scrutiny of the financial statements of the aforementioned \ncompanies has created an inherent mistrust in the accuracy and \nintegrity of the true nature of corporate earnings.\n  Furthermore, the practice of allowing auditing companies to perform \nnon-audit services can have the ultimate effect of allowing such \ncompanies to audit the work of their own personnel. This practice \ndefeats the purpose of having an unbiased entity objectively reviewing \nthe merits and accuracy of financial statements.\n  The legislation we are considering in the Senate includes crucial \nprovisions that will play a pivotal role in restoring confidence in our \nmarket system, and enhancing the public and private sector controls \nthat are in place to monitor the relevant entities. The legislation \ncreates a Public Accounting Oversight Board, which will be an entity \nsolely focused on companies that audit and account for publicly traded \nfirms. This oversight authority will include the ability to investigate \nand punish any wrongdoing by companies under SEC jurisdiction as well \nas their auditors. The bill also disallows simultaneous auditing and \nconsulting, while providing for the Board to approve certain exceptions \nto non-specified non-audit services under this rule.\n\n  The pending legislation also makes important strides in ensuring that \nany gain made by company executives be subject to retrieval if the \ncompany has to prepare an accounting restatement due to certain \nnoncompliance with SEC regulations. As Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill \nso aptly states in response to the actions of Enron executives, ``I \nreally do believe that the CEO is in effect the steward for all the \npeople who work in their organization. And that with that \nresponsibility goes a commitment that the people come first and that \nthe practices are open and above board and without reproach.'' These \nexecutives should not be able to leave their beleaguered companies, \npockets stuffed with profits from cashed out stock options, while \ninvestors and employees suffer the consequences of questionable company \npractices.\n  With the unanimous passage of the Leahy amendment, the Senate \nrecognized the need to strengthen penalties for the punishment of those \ninvolved in corporate crime. For example, the amendment created a new \nfelony for persons involved in the destruction of evidences--to address \nin the future such indiscretions as the document shredding perpetrated \nby Arthur Andersen's Enron Audit team. In addition, the Leahy amendment \ngrants important whistleblower protections to company employees--like \nEnron's Sherron Watkins--who bravely report wrongdoing occurring within \ntheir own corporation.\n  The bottom line is that integrity and trust are at the core of a \nsuccessfully functioning market system. These recent business scandals \nhave severely damaged this foundation. And as with any foundation in \ndisrepair, leaving unaddressed the damage caused by lost faith in the \nsystem will lead to continued instability, or worse.\n  Therefore, we in Congress have an obligation to do what we can to \nmaintain and build investor confidence and faith in our free market \nsystem. I believe that the legislation we are considering today is a \ncrucial first step toward that end, as well as ensuring the full \nrebound of our floundering economy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2673, the \nPublic Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002.\n  Nearly every day, it seems, the front pages of our newspapers are \nawash in stories about the latest corporate accounting scandal. Just 3 \nweeks ago we learned that WorldCom hid $3.8 billion in expenses in the \nlast five quarters alone.\n  And WorldCom is merely the latest member of an increasingly large \ngroup of public corporations that have knowingly deceived shareholders, \ndirectors,\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\nand, in some cases, their own auditors. WorldCom, Enron, Tyco, Global \nCrossing, Xerox--the list goes on and on.\n  Much attention has been focused on the huge sums that CEOs and other \nsenior executives have extracted from these companies in the form of \nincentive pay, but even those large sums pale in comparison to the \ntotal shareholder value that has been destroyed as a result of these \ndisclosures. At its peak, WorldCom's market capitalization exceeded \n$190 billion, making it, for a time, the most valuable \ntelecommunications services company in the world. Now, WorldCom shares \nare effectively worthless.\n  Despite a slowdown in the telecom industry, some of the value of \nthose shares might have been preserved had its executives relied on \nsound management, instead of deceptive accounting, to make their \nnumbers.\n  Who will suffer most from the immense value decline associated with \nWorldCom and other companies that have deceived their investors? Not \nthe senior executives, most of whom have stashed away enough of their \npay to let them spend the rest of their days in comfort. The people who \nwill really suffer are the thousands of employees whose retirement \nsavings were proudly invested in company stock; or the millions of \npublic employees whose pension funds held shares in these companies. \nThose are the people who will bear the brunt of this value decline.\n  CalPERS, the pension fund set up to invest the retirement savings of \n1.3 million public employees in my home State, has estimated that it \nsuffered a $580 million loss on WorldCom stocks and bonds. That means \nthat the average California public employee lost over $440, not \nincluding any investments in WorldCom they may have held independently.\n  To give you some perspective on that amount, the amount of money lost \nby California public employees due to the WorldCom fraud alone is \nlikely to exceed the entire sum of the tax rebate checks they received \nas part of the President's tax cut last year.\n  In fact, every American who invests in our stock markets will suffer \nas a result of these scandals, because every scandal further tarnishes \nthe reputation of American corporate honesty for investors around the \nworld. In recent months, those investors have pulled billions of \ndollars in investments out of our country, further reducing the value \nof stocks and weakening the dollar.\n  The only way that we can turn this culture around is by fostering a \ncorporate environment that rewards honest management by senior \nexecutives and severely punishes fraudulent activities. That is exactly \nwhat would be achieved by the bill proposed by Senator Sarbanes.\n  The Sarbanes bill tackles many of the major problem areas associated \nwith recent corporate scandals. Most importantly, the bill would make \nit much more difficult for public companies to bypass or trample over \nauditors in attempt to produce inaccurate or deceptive financial \nstatements.\n  For the first time, the Sarbanes bill creates a truly independent \naccounting oversight board, staffed with objective, unbiased overseers, \nwho can enforce rules and prosecute violators without having to vet \ntheir decisions elsewhere. Unlike the Public Oversight Board, which \ndepended on fees from the very auditors it was meant to regulate, this \nnew board will be funded by mandatory fees paid by all public \ncompanies. These are fees that cannot be withheld at the whim of those \nwho have the greatest interest in undermining the work of the board.\n  The Sarbanes bill does not stop at the creation of this new board, \nhowever. Rather, the bill strengthens areas of the law that have proven \ninadequate to prevent the fraudulent corporate behavior that has become \nso prevalent today.\n  The Sarbanes bill prevents auditors from controling the entire \nfinancial reporting system at an individual company by both designing \nthe internal audit system, and then purporting to offer an unbiased \nexternal audit. The bill will also stiffen the resolve and oversight of \nboard of director audit committees by requiring, among other \nprovisions, that all committee members be independent and that they be \ngiven free reign to question auditors without executive officers \npresent.\n  But rather than rely solely on increased oversight, the bill moves to \nreduce conflicts of interest at their source, by requiring the CEO and \nCFO of a company that has had to restate its financial accounts to \ndisgorge any bonuses or other incentive pay they received in the year \nprior to the misstatement.\n  Moreover, under an amendment sponsored by Senator Schumer and myself, \ncompany loans to executive officers are now prohibited, sharply \nlimiting the types of ``hidden'' compensation that can be offered to \nexecutives without being fully disclosed to shareholders. Our amendment \npassed by a voice vote and will go a long way toward preventing the \ntypes of loan-related abuses prevalent at WorldCom, Global Crossing, \nand other companies now under investigation by the SEC for loan-related \nabuses.\n  When Senator Sarbanes drafted this bill, he focused on the single \nreform that matters most: increased transparency. Unfortunately, we may \nwitness more corporate failures like those of Enron or WorldCom. These \nare failures that are brought on by over-investment, the accumulation \nof excessive debt, or an ill-conceived belief in markets or services \nthat never live up to expectations.\n  What we cannot abide by, and what the Sarbanes bill goes a long way \ntoward preventing, is the ability of senior executives to hide those \nbad decisions in misleading financial statements. By ensuring true \nauditor oversight, creating meaningful penalties for senior executives \nwho defraud investors, and putting in place new disclosure \nrequirements, this bill will dramatically increase the quality and \ntimeliness of the information available to individual investors.\n  The United States is blessed with the best-regulated markets in the \nworld, and for that we have been rewarded with tremendous foreign \ninvestment and a leadership position in world financial markets.\n  A vote in favor of this legislation is a vote to strengthen our \nposition and avoid a wholesale loss of investor confidence that would \nbe perilously difficult to restore.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish today to express my support for S. \n2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act \nof 2002. I am pleased that the Senate is acting decisively to impose \nharsh, swift punishment on those corporate executives who exploit the \ntrust of their shareholders and employees while enriching themselves. \nThe recent corporate scandals demonstrate just how important it is to \nhold corporate executives accountable. I believe it is equally \nimportant for prosecutors to be provided with the tools necessary to \naid in the investigation of these forms of fraud.\n  During this debate, our colleagues on both sides have consistently \ncalled for increased penalties for corporate fraud offenses. This week, \nas the Dow Jones index plummeted nearly 300 points--representing the \nbiggest single day point drop since the week following the attacks of \nSeptember 11 we voted unanimously to adopt a series of amendments that \nwill strengthen criminal fraud penalties and create new criminal fraud \noffenses. I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Biden to enhance \nwhite collar penalties. And I supported an amendment offered by Senator \nLott, which incorporated the President's proposal by enhancing white \ncollar penalties, supplementing existing criminal laws, and increasing \nthe Security and Exchange Commission's administrative powers to enforce \nthis nation's securities laws. I also supported Senator Leahy's \namendment, a measure I worked to improve in committee. This amendment \nincludes new criminal and civil provisions that I believe will also \nassist in deterring and punishing future corporate wrongdoing.\n  Further, I am glad to see the Senate finally considering legislation \nthat will overhaul government regulation of the accounting industry. I \nagree with my distinguished colleague from Maryland that there is an \ninherent conflict of interest between internal and external auditing. \nThe same people should not be installing the internal control system, \nperforming the internal audits, and then reporting on the financial \nstatements. The external auditor sometimes has to be tough as nails, \nand willing to disagree with its client's top\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nexecutives. It is hard to be the bad cop when you are also the personal \ntrainer.\n  However, Congress cannot always second-guess the desires of \ninvestors. In some cases, stockholders, bondholders, and other \nstakeholders will be worse off if Congress imposes too strict a barrier \nbetween consulting and auditing. This is especially true for small \nbusinesses that may not be able to afford to hire both a consulting \nfirm and a separate accounting firm. And, as the President has noted, \nin our fast-changing economy, Congressionally-imposed barriers between \ndifferent business practices can end up becoming Congressionally-\nimposed barriers to productivity growth.\n  I think the bill before us represents an effort to strike a good \nbalance between these two competing goals of auditor independence and \nbusiness innovation. It prevents internal and external audit work from \nbeing done by the same firm, and it establishes clear lines of \nresponsibility and accountability. At the same time, the corporation's \nindependent audit committee will be permitted to authorize certain \nconsulting services if they are convinced it is in the shareholders' \nbest interest. This audit committee, consisting of members of the \nclient's board of directors, will be required by law to be completely \nindependent of the corporation itself. This will mean that if the CEO \nand other top corporate officials believe it is in their company's best \ninterests to have their accounting firm help with, for example, tax \nconsulting and preparation, the corporate officials will have to argue \nthe merits of their case before the independent audit committee. That \nkind of independence makes good sense, and it makes good law.\n  The Federal Government needs to help investors whether banks, pension \nfunds, or individual investors in their quest for accurate information \nabout the financial condition of America's businesses. Doing so is \ncrucial for our economic long-term health. While Enron's and WorldCom's \nfinancial shenanigans contain many differences, the similarities are \nfar more important. These were both firms that borrowed too much money \nduring the expansion years of the late 1990s. And when it started \ngetting tough to make the debt payments, both firms tried to hide their \nfinancial difficulties through creative bookkeeping, cooked up at \ncompany headquarters. They succeeded for a time, but the combination of \ninvestor vigilance, media investigations, and government scrutiny are \neventually bringing the facts to light.\n  If there had been real financial transparency, both current \nstockholders and potential investors could pierce the veil of \nbookkeeping to immediately see these companies' true financial \nsituation. This may not have prevented the painful layoffs and tragic \nloss of retirement assets by thousands of employees. However, with more \naccurate and timely information, investors, directors, analysts, \nfinancial institutions, and others could have intervened earlier and \nhelped to restructure these firms before all-out catastrophe \nthreatened. When it comes to business information, knowing sooner is \nalways better than knowing later.\n  And even more importantly, if corporate officials had faced the \nthreat of serious jail time and the certain knowledge that their \nfinancial and accounting capers would be exposed to the world, they \nwould have been much less likely to have overborrowed and \nunderdisclosed in the first place. Mr. President, the bill on which we \nwill vote today, on which Senator Sarbanes and many of our colleagues \nhave worked so hard, contains solid provisions that I believe will put \nreal fear of serious consequences into the minds of corporate \nwrongdoers.\n  Does this bill represent a perfect solution to the corporate \naccountability issues presently facing our country? Of course not. I \nwould have written a different bill in several respects. However, I \nbelieve that the bill is a good attempt to balance competing interests \nand different political philosophies. As the bill goes to conference \nwith a House-passed bill that has some significant differences, I \nexpect the balance to improve even further.\n  Strengthening corporate accountability is crucial to our nation's \nlong-term welfare. If Congress and the President can act together to \nhelp increase corporate transparency and restore investor confidence, \nthen businesses will be better able to raise investment capital. \nGreater access to capital will enable U.S. businesses to fund the \ngroundbreaking research and to purchase the high-tech equipment that is \nthe foundation of America's long-term prosperity. And Americans from \nall walks of life will reap the rewards.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of \namendment No. 4283 that is being offered by Senator Levin. The \namendment says that the standard-setting body for accounting principles \nthat is set up in this bill shall review the accounting treatment of \nemployee stock options and shall within a year of enactment of this act \nadopt an appropriately generally accepted accounting principle for the \ntreatment of employee stock options.\n  Unfortunately, this body is not going to get the opportunity to vote \non this reform or the reform I proposed last week requiring the \nexpensing of stock options. We want to help restore investors' \nconfidence for the long run, but we are being denied an opportunity to \ndo this. A simple vote on this amendment is all we ask. And yet, we are \nbeing denied, and that is truly regrettable. I see no reason that a \nvote should not be permitted on this amendment, but let's face it--the \nfix is in.\n  I want to talk more about the expensing of stock options.\n  Americans have heard from the President and practically every Member \nof the Senate about the vital need to restore trust and transparency in \nbusiness practices so we can begin to repair investors' faith in the \nhonesty of our companies and in our markets. We need more transparency \non a company's books so that any person wanting to invest their hard-\nearned money has a true financial picture of the company they are \nplanning to invest in.\n  This issue of expensing stock options is not going to go away. Look \nat what has just happened. Coca-Cola, a Fortune 100 company, just \nannounced that it will begin in the fourth quarter to treat all \nemployee stock options as an expense. And I believe more companies will \nfollow Coca-Cola's lead. It is only a matter of time.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to read a quote from a July \n22, 2002 Weekly Standard article, ``Big Businesses Bad Behavior,'' in \nwhich economist Irwin Stelzer, Director of Regulatory Studies at the \nHudson Institute, eloquently explains why governmental action is needed \nto restore faith in our financial institutions. The ``opposition of \nimportant segments of the business and accounting communities to \nreform,'' he writes, ``means that government must take on the burden of \nrevising the institutional framework within which business operates--\nsetting the rules of the game that will allow markets to do their job \nof allocating human and financial capital to its highest and best uses. \nAs Milton Friedman, no fan of big government, has written, society \nneeds rules and an umpire `to enforce compliance with rules on the part \nof those few who would otherwise not play the game.' '' I couldn't \nagree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, July 22, 2002]\n\n                      Big Business's Bad Behavior\n\n                         (By Irwin M. Stelzer)\n\n       No sensible person can quarrel with what the president told \n     the Wall Street biggies he addressed last week. Crooks should \n     be forced to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and should go \n     to a jail for extended periods. Enforcement agencies should \n     be given adequate resources. Corporate executives should be \n     held responsible for the accuracy of what they tell \n     shareholders, disclose their compensation in annual reports \n     ``prominently and in plain English,'' and explain what their \n     ``compensation package is in the best interest of the \n     company'' Board members should be independent and ``ask tough \n     questions.'' Shareholders should speak up. Most important, \n     chief executive officers should crate a ``moral tone'' that \n     ensure the company's top managers behave in accordance with \n     the highest ethical standards.\n       The quarrel comes not with what the president said, but \n     with what he didn't say. In the game of matching his laundry \n     list of reforms against the inevitably longer list generated \n     by the Daschle-Leahy-Sarbanes-Gephardt crowd the president \n     inevitably loses, as last week's unanimous vote of Senate \n     Republicans for the Democrat's bill proves. Longer\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\n     sounds better if you're just compiling a laundry list of \n     items aimed at punishing politically unpopular corporate bad \n     guys. Only if there is a conceptual framework within which \n     specific reforms can be created and defended is there any \n     hope that a sensible corporate governance system will emerge \n     from the congressional legislation factory.\n       Start with the fact that it is important to distinguish the \n     role of government from that of the private-sector \n     institutions that monitor corporate America. The latter can \n     be relied upon to act when the integrity of the system is \n     threatened, not because these private sector players are a \n     bunch of goodie-two-shoes, but for the more reliable reason \n     that honest markets and accurate profit reporting are in \n     their interest. Just as gamblers won't put their bets down \n     when they know a wheel to be rigged, so investors won't put \n     their money into shares if prices can be manipulated by \n     inflated profit reporting or special treatment of insiders.\n       Hence we have a stream of quite sensible reforms proposed \n     by the Business Roundtable and the New York Stock Exchange, \n     some going beyond those being pushed by the president. And we \n     have companies scrambling to adopt governance rules and \n     accounting practices that will reassure investors that the \n     game is not rigged against them. No CEO wants to see his \n     company's stock battered by investors who fear that share \n     values will evaporate as profits are restated to eliminate \n     the imaginative counting of revenues (claim them now, before \n     the customers pays or even considers paying) and of costs \n     (capitalize rather than expense every outlay, regardless of \n     the life of the item purchased). Plummeting share prices are \n     dangerous to the careers of chief executives.\n       But, as the president recognized when he called for higher \n     ethical standards, self-interest cannot be relied upon to \n     produce honest business dealings unless that self-interest \n     includes what Adam Smith called a ``desire to be both \n     respected and respectable,'' and such esteem is seen to flow \n     not from ``wealth and greatness'' but from ``wisdom and \n     virtue.'' Which may be what Bush had in mind when he said \n     that we need ``men and women of character, who know the \n     difference between ambition and destructive greed'' to lead \n     our major corporations. And it may be what he had in mind \n     when, immediately after delivering talk, he returned to \n     Washington to award the Presidential Medal of freedom--\n     America's highest civilian honor--not to the nations' richest \n     (Intel founder Gordon Moore may have been the one exception), \n     but instead to folks who have enriched our national life with \n     their sharp iconoclasm (Irving Kristol), gentle humor (Bill \n     Cosby), and quiet devotion of family and good causes (Nancy \n     Reagan).\n       Still, neither self-interest reform nor a new emphasis on \n     business ethics can be relied upon to save capitalism from \n     the capitalists. Immediately after the president's speech the \n     White House was bombarded with calls from CEOs protesting his \n     demand that they disclose their compensation packages in \n     easily accessible terms. I well recall the reaction when, \n     several years ago, I made a similar suggestion at a think-\n     tank-sponsored meeting of top business and government \n     officials. One captain of industry replied that he would not \n     tell his shareholders how much he earns lest he encourage \n     kidnappers (as if they would only become aware of his \n     affluence if he revealed it in his company's annual report).\n       Nor did anything the president said persuade the \n     accountants to call off their lobbyists, who continue to \n     oppose reforms that would make their devotion to the accuracy \n     of their audit statements unambivalent. Or convince CEOs of \n     Silicon Valley and other high-tech companies to bow to Alan \n     Greenspan's call for them to report their share options as \n     the expenses they most certainly are. Again, I recall a \n     discussion that followed a similar proposal I made several \n     years ago. One CEO said that he couldn't place a value on \n     these options for purposes of reporting to shareholders, even \n     though he could value those same options for the purpose of \n     deducting their cost from his profits for tax purposes. \n     Another claimed that if he treated options as an expense, he \n     would wipe out his entire reported earnings, an argument, I \n     suppose, for refusing to account for almost any expense that \n     constitutes a threat to reported profits--what might be \n     called the WorldCom excuse. (For the economy as a whole, \n     experts estimate that expensing of options would reduce \n     aggregate corporate profits by about 8 percent.) Note that \n     the issue is not whether companies, especially start-ups, \n     should be allowed to use options to attract talented staff, \n     but whether they should have to treat this compensation as an \n     expense when reporting profits. As Greenspan points out, \n     refusing to deduct the cost of options diverts capital and \n     other resources from truly profitable to only apparently \n     profitable firms.\n       This opposition of important segments of the business and \n     accounting communities to reform means that government must \n     take on the burden of revising the institutional framework \n     within which business operates--setting the rules of the game \n     that will allow markets to do their job of allocating human \n     and financial capital to its highest and best uses. As Milton \n     Friedman, no fan of big government, has written, society \n     needs rules and an umpire ``to enforce compliance with rules \n     on the part of those few who would otherwise not play the \n     game.''\n       To keep rules to a Friedmanesque minimum, we need a \n     conceptual framework for reform rather than competing laundry \n     lists. The first step is to understand the limits of criminal \n     sanctions. Yes, it makes sense for the Senate to insist, as \n     it did unanimously last week, that the crimes perpetrated by \n     some corporate managers and accountants be defined as \n     precisely as possible. Yes, criminal sanctions can be used to \n     make life miserable for those caught with their fingers in \n     the till and to deter from evildoing those for whom Adam \n     Smith's ``desire to be respectable and to be respected'' is \n     insufficient inducement to decent behavior. But, as law \n     professors David Skeel and William Stuntz recently pointed \n     out in the New York Times, ``Criminal laws lead people to \n     focus on what is legal instead of what is right. . . . In \n     today's world, executives are more likely to ask what they \n     can get away with legally than what's fair and honest.'' The \n     Senate was pleased with itself for toughening the laws under \n     which executives will operate, but criminalizing bad behavior \n     is no guarantee of future good behavior--behavior that is not \n     merely indictment-avoiding, but is efficiency- and wealth-\n     enhancing.\n       Instead, policymakers should turn to that trusty guideline, \n     ``Get the incentives right.'' The problems we are facing stem \n     from the fact that we have provided the four guardians of \n     shareholder interests--auditors, analysts, directors, and \n     corporate managers--with the wrong incentives.\n       Auditors know that success or failure in their profession \n     depends not so much on the accuracy and realism of their \n     audits, as on their ability to conduct themselves so as not \n     to imperil the flow of consulting fees to their firms. Enron \n     paid Arthur Andersen as much or more in consulting than in \n     auditing fees; Andersen's $12 million in consulting fees from \n     WorldCom dwarfed its $4 million audit fee. It would have \n     taken a brave auditor indeed to fly in the face of these \n     clear incentives and tell Enron's management that placing \n     some item off-balance-sheet might be technically legal, but \n     would obscure the company's true financial condition, or to \n     insist on access to documents that might have revealed \n     WorldCom's recording of current expenses as capital \n     investments. Rather than rely on such strength of character, \n     some 70 percent of the directors surveyed by McKinsey & Co. \n     now say they will in the future oppose the granting of such \n     contracts, a policy that Arthur Levitt, Bill Clinton's SEC \n     chairman, was unable to push through over the massed \n     opposition of the accountants' lobbyists. All of which makes \n     Bush's silence on this subject rather odd, and the Senate \n     Democrats' insistence on a broader prohibition on consulting \n     than is contained in the House Republicans' bill more likely \n     to get the auditors' incentives lined up with shareholder \n     interests.\n       Once those incentives are in place, other provisions of the \n     House and Senate bills become unnecessary. Both bills call \n     for still more regulation of auditors, and create still \n     another regulatory body to set and oversee accounting \n     standards. One need not be an apologist for the accounting \n     profession to suggest that such a move would merely continue \n     the failed practice of attempting to control auditors by \n     closely supervising them. There is no reason to believe that \n     such supervision will be any more successful in the future \n     than it has been in the past, especially since in the end \n     auditors are required only to say that they followed often \n     complex and arcane rules that necessarily involve the \n     exercise of judgment.\n       Instead of such ongoing regulation, including half measures \n     that merely restrict auditors from engaging in some specified \n     form of consulting activity, let's get the incentives right \n     by complete, mandated separation of the audit and consulting \n     businesses, as John McCain proposes. Lead the CPAs not into \n     temptation, and reliance on porous Chinese walls becomes \n     unnecessary. Auditors will compete for business on the basis \n     of their ability to provide a product that gives investors \n     confidence in the transparency and accuracy of the company \n     accounts, with the uplifting effect that will have on the \n     prices of their clients' shares. (Audit firms are unlikely to \n     compete on price, since the risks associated with the audit \n     business have risen. There are only four major firms, and \n     rotation of auditors on something like the five-year basis \n     favored by Senate Democrats, although necessary to prevent \n     over-identification between client and auditor, is a classic \n     cartel market-sharing arrangement--all legal, in this case.)\n       Analysts are another group who now face perverse \n     incentives. Investors may have been naive to believe that \n     these students of income statements, balance sheets, and \n     other economic data would provide honest advice about a \n     company's financial condition and prospects. But they had a \n     right to such a belief, since the commissions they pay their \n     brokers are supposed to be in return for such advice. Along \n     comes New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and \n     revelations that some of these supposed agents of the \n     shareholders' interests are recommending stocks they know to \n     be ``shitty'' in order to win investment banking business for \n     their partners and increased compensation for themselves. All \n     of this in the presence of Chinese walls erected to separate \n     bankers from analysts. It took no Joshua-plus-trumpet to \n     bring these walls down; the prospect of hefty banking fees \n     was quite enough. Jack Grubman, the Salomon Smith Barney (a \n     division of Citigroup) analyst famous for his enthusiastic \n     recommendations of WorldCom stock, last week told the House \n     Financial Services Committee, ``No one can sit here on Wall \n     Street and deny to anybody on this\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\n     committee that banking is not a consideration in the \n     compensation of analysts of a full-service firm.'' Forget the \n     double negative: Grubman was conceding that part of his \n     salary, which reached $20 million per year, came from the \n     $140 million in underwriting fees that his firm received from \n     WorldCom over the past five years.\n       Again, get the incentives right. One way, now preferred on \n     Wall Street, is to write contracts that make analysts' \n     compensation independent of the fees flowing into the \n     investment banking divisions of the large firms. But just how \n     analysts can prosper if the banking division isn't earning \n     enough to pay the rent is unclear. Besides, unless analysts \n     suddenly become willing to issue ``sell'' recommendations \n     just when their investment banking partners are pitching a \n     company for business, this proposed reform is unlikely to be \n     effective, especially after the current heat is off and \n     congressional attention turns to other matters. True or not, \n     bankers believe that CEOs, being human (yes, most are), are \n     likely to take into account what a firm's analysts are saying \n     about their stock when selecting an investment banker. It \n     would be an unusual CEO, indeed, who would cheerfully receive \n     an investment banker after reading in the morning papers that \n     the banker's analyst-partner had just downgraded his \n     company's stock from a ``buy'' to a ``sell.'' Many investment \n     bankers--not all, but many--will find ways to persuade their \n     partner-analysts to be team players. Banking fees are large \n     enough to give them an enormous incentive to do just that.\n       So, let's get the incentives right and mandate a separation \n     of the investment banking and stock-picking businesses, \n     another McCain proposal. Analysts would then have an \n     unambiguous incentive to make the best ``buy'' and ``sell'' \n     recommendations they possibly can, so as to build reputations \n     that will attract investors to them. And investors will get \n     something in return for their commission dollars--honest \n     advice from men and women expert in the analysis of corporate \n     financial data, competing with one another to attract \n     clients by creating a track record of picking winners.\n       Which brings us to Directors. Again, we have a case of \n     skewed incentives. Directors are hired by managers to protect \n     shareholders from, er, those same managers. To make sure the \n     directors remain friendly, executives often shower them with \n     perks and consulting fees, the continuation of which depend \n     on the goodwill of the CEOs they are supposed to be \n     supervising. It is the rare director who chooses to feast on \n     the hand that feeds him, not merely because he is venal, but \n     because the courtesies lavished upon him genuinely persuade \n     him that the CEO is a decent chap, deserving of every million \n     he is paid.\n       To get the incentives right, directors must be selected by \n     vigorously participating shareholders, most especially \n     institutional shareholders, from a slate of demonstrably \n     independent people who, although well compensated, have \n     reputations worth protecting. Nominations for that slate \n     should come from sources other than the company management, \n     to avoid a you-sit-on-my-compensation-committee-and-I'll-sit-\n     on-yours, selection process. The directors should not accept \n     anything within the gift of the CEO; their directors' fees \n     should be compensation enough, and high enough to provide an \n     incentive to accumulate a record that will persuade \n     shareholders to reelect them at reasonably regular periodic \n     intervals--perhaps throwing in term limits to make sure that \n     directors and management don't develop too cozy a \n     relationship.\n       Finally, we come to the CEO's and top managers. How to \n     create incentives to induce managers to act in the interests \n     of the shareholders who own the business has bedeviled \n     students of corporate governance ever since 1932, when Adolph \n     A. Berle Jr. and Gardiner C. Means published their classic \n     ``The Modern Corporation and Private Property,'' detailing \n     the potential for managerial abuse created by the separation \n     of ownership from control of large corporations. Managers \n     placing self-interest above the interests of owners were \n     immune to retaliation by far-flung and essentially powerless \n     shareholders. That situation was partially corrected when \n     Mike Milken and his debt-financed corporate raiders snatched \n     control of many companies from the worst abusers of \n     shareholders' interests, grounded fleets of corporate jets, \n     sold off hunting lodges, and generally sweated the fat out of \n     expenses--a wonderful example of markets working to correct \n     abuses that seemed beyond the reach of regulators.\n       But nowadays there aren't many people who want to be like \n     Mike, so it is incumbent on policymakers to get managers' \n     incentives right. President Bush's proposal for publication \n     of compensation arrangements in an accessible format would be \n     a step in the right direction, its effectiveness attested to \n     by the howls of outrage it produced from some CEOs. Truly \n     independent boards, created along the lines described above, \n     would be another advance, since compensation committees not \n     beholden to corporate managements are more likely to relate \n     pay to performance than the supine committees that now exist \n     on some boards. Add in the requirement that options be \n     treated as profit-reducing expenses--another McCain proposal \n     that so horrified senators that it has for now been \n     derailed--and you will have a new parsimony that will keep \n     salaries to levels commensurate with effort and performance. \n     Under such a regime, executives would have a clear incentive \n     to spend their time creating efficiencies and new markets, \n     rather than figuring out how to cash in options, and how to \n     persuade their boards to revalue options if poor company \n     performance has driven the stock price below the price at \n     which the options may be exercised, rewarding executives \n     whether or not they have delivered long-term value for \n     shareholders.\n       This may sound like an awful lot of regulation. But it is \n     of a special, self-liquidating sort. If we adopt policies \n     that get the incentives of all the players right, government \n     can then get out of the way so that the various actors can do \n     their thing--audit, advise on investments, monitor management \n     performance in the interests of owners, and manage the \n     company in a world in which managers' interests coincide with \n     those of shareholders. The right kind of regulation can be a \n     model of minimal--and effective--government.\n       Irwin M. Stelzer is a contributing editor to The Weekly \n     Standard, director of regulatory studies at the Hudson \n     Institute, and a columnist for the Sunday Times (London).\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 15, 2002]\n\n           Leading the News: Coke to Expense Employee Options\n\n\n move may spur others to follow and could shape current talks in senate\n\n                            (By Betsy McKay)\n\n       Atlanta--Coca-Cola Co. said it will begin in the fourth \n     quarter to treat all employee stock options as an expense, a \n     move that could accelerate debate in corporate boardrooms \n     over whether to adopt that accounting practice.\n       The beverage company's decision also could shape the \n     outcome of discussions today in the Senate over whether to \n     instruct a new accounting-oversight board to study the fate \n     of stock options--in particular, whether they should be \n     expensed as other forms of compensation.\n       Republicans tried Friday to block the measure, offered as \n     an amendment to an accounting-overhaul bill. But Democrats \n     say they will try again before final passage of the \n     underlying accounting bill, expected late today.\n       ``We are in a new environment,'' Gary Fayard, Coke's chief \n     financial officer, said in an interview. ``There had been a \n     loophole in the accounting, and we thought it was the right \n     time to step up to the plate.\n       ``There's no doubt that stock options are compensation,'' \n     he added. ``If they weren't, none of us would want them.''\n       Coke said its decision, announced yesterday morning, will \n     reduce earnings only slightly--by about a penny a share--for \n     2002. That reflects the fact that Coke doesn't grant options \n     as extensively as do some other companies. And while Coke \n     isn't the first public concern to make the accounting \n     change--Boeing Co. and Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. in recent years \n     began calculating stock options as an expense--its high \n     profile could prompt other businesses to consider calls from \n     investors, regulators and politicians for greater financial \n     candor.\n       Last week, AMB Property Corp., a San Francisco-based owner \n     of industrial real estate, also said it would record stock \n     options as an expense.\n       Proponents of expensing say options are compensation and \n     should be treated as such, especially since generous option \n     awards dilute the value of shares outstanding. Opponents say \n     options are difficult to value and argue that expensing would \n     confuse investors, not enlighten them. Changing accounting \n     rules would reduce earnings at some companies.\n       In 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board tried to \n     mandate the expensing of options but retreated in the face of \n     stiff opposition from business leaders and Congress. The \n     issue flared up again after Enron Corp's demise late last \n     year and has taken on new life with recent disclosures of \n     earnings misstatements at WorldCom Inc.\n       Coke's Chairman and Chief Executive Douglas Daft raised the \n     idea of recording stock options as an expense about two \n     months ago, Mr. Fayard said, as news of financial scandals \n     continued to unfold. About 10 days ago, with lawmakers \n     calling for tougher accounting standards, Mr. Daft fielded \n     the idea in phone calls to Warren Buffet and some other Coke \n     directors. Mr. Buffett, Coke's largest shareholder, for years \n     has been an outspoken proponent of expensing options.\n       Mr. Daft pressed ahead with his proposal to make the \n     accounting change last week after President Bush called in a \n     speech for better corporate governance. Mr. Bush didn't \n     embrace the idea of forcing companies to expense options, but \n     numerous economists and financial experts, including Federal \n     Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, have endorsed the \n     move, and growing investor unease sent stocks plummeting last \n     week.\n       Mr. Daft convened a meeting at 7 a.m. Thursday in Sun \n     Valley, Idaho, where he and several other directors were \n     attending a conference. The discussion, over breakfast in the \n     condominium of director Herbert Allen, was short. It wasn't \n     hard to win the directors' support; Mr. Buffett, in \n     particular, applauded the move.\n       ``Our management's determination to change to the preferred \n     method of accounting for employee stock options ensures that \n     our earnings will more clearly reflect economic reality when \n     all compensation costs are recorded in the financial \n     statements,'' Mr. Daft said in a statement. A spokeswoman \n     said he wasn't available for further comment.\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n       ``I'm delighted,'' Mr. Buffett said in a telephone \n     interview. ``This tells shareholders what really happens in \n     terms of costs.'' The new plan, he said, also eliminates bias \n     in structuring compensation packages, encouraging Coke to \n     design packages that fit its and employees' needs without \n     regard for accounting.\n       While Mr. Buffett said he never pushed Coke to treat stock \n     options as an expense, he said he did encourage the company \n     last week to take a further step and use independent \n     investment banks to determine the fair value of stock options \n     that Coke grants. The move is intended to ease concerns over \n     whether options that are expensed are being properly valued. \n     Coke will ask two investment banks, Goldman Sachs & Co. and \n     Citibank, to price options, and will expense the option value \n     based on the average of those firms' quotes.\n       Coke said stock options will be expensed over the period in \n     which they vest, based on the value the day they are granted. \n     Coke's 2002 options plan authorizes as many as 120 million \n     shares, or 4.8% of the company's share outstanding. The \n     company usually issues 25 million to 30 million shares a \n     year, however.\n       For 2001, Coke's top five officers received options on 3.7 \n     million shares, including options on one million shares for \n     Mr. Daft. About 8,200 of Coke's 38,000 employees received \n     options during 2001.\n       Mr. Buffett predicted Mr. Daft's move could make him \n     ``unpopular'' among other CEOs, but he also said that while \n     business leaders had managed to quash efforts in 1993 to \n     force expensing of stock options, the current environment \n     could force them now to accept it.\n       ``I'm sure a few others will do it,'' he said. ``It may be \n     that good practices drive out the bad.''\n       Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) issued a statement applauding \n     Coke's decision and expressing hope that ``other companies \n     will follow suit.''\n       Judy Fischer, managing director of Executive Compensation \n     Advisory Services, in Alexandria, Va., said she believes \n     other corporations will follow Coke. ``If a corporation can \n     do it without a lot of problems to their bottom line, I think \n     a lot will follow suit,'' she said.\n       However, it wasn't clear how other companies will react, \n     particularly high-tech businesses that rely heavily on stock \n     options. A spokesman for Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor \n     maker Intel Corp., where all employees are eligible for stock \n     options, said he couldn't comment on Coke's move. One \n     lobbyist was skeptical. ``I doubt just because one company \n     made this decision that other companies will follow suit,'' \n     said Ralph Hellmann, top lobbyist for the Information \n     Technology Industry Council, a high-tech trade association in \n     Washington. ``Each individual company is going to make its \n     own determination.'' Looking beyond 2002, Coke's Mr. Fayard \n     said earnings per share will be reduced by about three cents \n     in 2003, with the reduction gradually increasing to about \n     nine cents a share by 2006, he said. But the change won't \n     affect the company's cash flow, he said.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise first in support of our free \nmarket economy. The revelations over the last few months of corporate \nofficials having betrayed the trust of their employees and their \ninvestors is simply unacceptable. These corporate officials must be \nprosecuted to the full extent of the law and if additional penalties \nare required, then we should enact them.\n  But let us not forget, that despite these terrible, unconscionable \nacts perpetrated by some CEOs on their workers and investors, the \nprinciples of our free market economy remain the envy of the world. \nThese principles have allowed our economy to be the most productive, \nmost innovative, most creative system, that has created income and \nemployment only dreamed of in other parts of the world.\n  One of these principles is property rights. But it seems that some \ncorporate managers have forgotten that the companies they run are not \ntheir personal property to operate however they see fit or for their \nown benefit. The exuberance of the 1990s that Chairman Greenspan warned \nus about and the extraordinary income and wealth generated during that \nperiod, allowed for unethical persons in our business sector to exploit \nthis time of growth for their own selfish purposes and to bend the \nrules for their own benefit.\n  So as we pursue new rules to punish those who have betrayed a trust--\nand we must--let us not allow the pendulum to swing so far that it \njeopardizes the innovation and vitality of our economic system for the \nfuture. Rather than working against the principles that make our \neconomic system so great, our actions should affirm these principles.\n  I am angry, shocked and extremely concerned about the revelations \nthat have emerged in the past 6 months concerning the accounting \npractices of a number of public companies. To operate efficiently our \nfree market system requires a high level of honesty and trustworthiness \namong its participants, especially among its key decisionmakers.\n  In the long run our economy--our stand of living--reflects not only \nour inventiveness and hard work but our moral character. Corporate \nexecutives have to be worthy of the key role they play. With all their \nwealth and high position comes responsibility. Sadly, some executives \nwere not worthy of this responsibility.\n  Restoring the public's trust is of paramount importance. America's \nsystem of corporate governance and its trust in our financial reporting \nmechanisms have been shaken and restoring this trust is of critical \nimportance. It will take more than words to restore that confidence and \ntrust. It will take something that I, Senator Dodd and others have been \nlecturing on for many years, and this is something not easily \nlegislated. It will take a renewed awareness of the ethics of \nresponsibility. It will take a reaffirmation that ``Character Counts.''\n  Reaffirming that ``Character Counts'' means not only encouraging our \nyoung people to live by the six pillars--trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship--but expecting that \nour corporate leaders adhere to these traits and conduct themselves \naccordingly.\n  Cooking the books has hurt thousands and thousands of hard-working \nAmericans. American companies must adhere to the highest standards of \npublic accounting ethics. Despite these abuses, as I have said our \neconomy remains strong and the vast majority of CEOs are honest and \nabide by the rules. Unfortunately, a few bad characters have tainted \nthe reputation of our enterprise system.\n  The President and the Congress are addressing reform. I will support \nthese reform efforts that are aimed at regaining trust and confidence \nin our Nation's financial markets and ensure that American workers are \nprotected from unscrupulous corporations. No violation of the public's \ntrust can be tolerated.\n  But I also believe more can be done, and this bill before us moves us \nin that direction. I support:\n  Full and accurate disclosure: I endorse the SEC's proposals to \nrequire CEOs to certify that their financial statements completely and \naccurately reflect the true condition of the company.\n  Trust and accountability: Corporate leaders must be held accountable \nfor any abuse of public trust. I believe that executives should be \nrequired to return moneys they received as a result of fraudulent \naccounting practices, as embodied in the Senate bill.\n  Independence: Boards of directors must exercise independent judgment \nand a substantial majority of board members must be independent of \nmanagement.\n  Auditing reform: Strong oversight of the accounting profession is \nessential if we are to ensure independence of auditors and credibility \nof the auditing process.\n  Pension protection: I fully support steps that will protect the \nretirement savings of American workers. Workers should have freedom to \ndiversify and monitor their own retirement funds, giving confidence \nthat their investments will not fall prey to unethical executives.\n  I urge the SEC to move forward with the implementation of its \nproposed reforms. And, I strongly believe that the NYSE and the NASDAQ \nmust proceed to improve their listing standards. I support the reform \nthat works to strengthen our free enterprise system. It is our \nobligation as a Congress and as a country to ensure that the unethical \nfew that are causing hardship for so many hard-working Americans, be \nswiftly brought to justice and face jail time. We will restore faith in \nour economic system for it is the greatest in the world. I support \npassage of the Senate bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, while I support the passage of this bill, \nI think we ought to recognize the role the Administration is already \nplaying to deal with these serious problems of corporate \nresponsibility.\n  I was pleased that President Bush announced last week his suggestions \nfor corporate accounting reform. The President forcefully argued that \nhigher\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\nethical standards are an imperative to restore confidence in corporate \nAmerica. Those standards should, in his words, ``be enforced by strict \nlaws and upheld by responsible business leaders'' and that \n``corporations should not be disconnected from the values of our \ncountry.''\n  I also support the President's executive order to create the \nCorporate Fraud Task Force. Combined with new criminal penalties for \ncorporate fraud, this taskforce can help bring stability to our \nNation's economy. The President has also asked the Securities and \nExchange Commission to adopt new rules to make sure that auditors are \ntruly independent from the businesses which they audit.\n  We also need to be sure the SEC has the resources it needs to carry \nout its other important responsibilities.\n  I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee will be able to \nprovide the necessary amount of funding for the SEC to hire the \nenforcement officers it needs and to acquire state-of-the-art \ntechnology that is necessary for the performance of its duties.\n  With the passage of this bill by the Senate, we will be able, in \nconference, to work with the other body to produce a good bill that \ndeals effectively with the problems in this area of very legitimate \nconcern to our country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to compliment the majority leader \nfor turning to the Sarbanes bill and the issue of corporate \nresponsibility. I also want to thank Chairman Sarbanes for his \nleadership on the impressive bill that he has produced in the Banking \nCommittee.\n  So many times all that the public hears about Congress is about turf \nand partisanship. This comprehensive reform effort disproves those \nclaims. Thanks to the leadership of the Majority Leader and Senator \nSarbanes, the bill that we are about to vote on is a tough, \ncomprehensive reform package that enjoys broad bipartisan support in \nthe Senate. It brought together the best ideas from many Senators, from \nmany Committees, and from both parties.\n  From my standpoint, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, this has \nbeen an opportunity to benefit once again from the wonderful \npartnership that we have forged between the Banking Committee and the \nJudiciary Committee. After September 11, our two Committees worked \ntogether to write the anti terrorism provisions of the USA Patriot Act \nthat dealt with money laundering. Here, with the 97-0 vote to adopt of \nthe provisions of the Corporate and Criminal Fraud and Accountability \nAct, as a Leahy-McCain amendment to this bill, Senator Sarbanes and I \nhave again united the forces and expertise of our Committees. This time \nwe have done so to craft comprehensive laws to deal with financial \nwrongdoing, and again done so with bipartisan support in both \nCommittees. I think that the final product is better and more complete \nbecause of our joint work. Thank you Chairman Sarbanes.\n  But the joint effort did not stop with Senator Sarbanes and myself. \nSenators Biden, Hatch and the Minority Leader offered provisions that \nwere also adopted by the Senate, adding aspects of the President's \nrecent proposal. That is an impressive show of bipartisanship because \nthose proposals were only made after the Senate had already begun \ndebate on this bill. Despite the White House's refusal to help us shape \nour more comprehensive proposal, we did not hesitate to include the \nPresident's suggestions in our final product.\n  The bill was further perfected by Senator Edwards' thoughtful \namendment dealing with the conduct of corporate attorneys. Once again, \nwe were able to draw on the expertise of a particular Senator to enlist \nthe help of lawyers in stopping corporate fraud, not designing it. In \nshort, we started with a fine bill from Senator Sarbanes, and have \nstrengthened even further, never losing our strong bipartisan support.\n  We need to remind ourselves of the underlying reasons for the \nbipartisan support behind these measures. Enron brought it to light, \nbut it goes deeper. It's about a basic fairness and equity that \ntranscends party lines. It's about rewarding people who play by the \nrules and punishing people who don't. It's about the basic American \nideal of treating all people equally under the law.\n  We cannot have a system where a pickpocket who steals $50 faces more \njail time than a CEO who steals $50 million. The integrity of our \nfinancial system depends on accountability. The mounting scandals and \ndeclining stock market have damaged the integrity of our public markets \nand we must restore it.\n  I was proud that the Judiciary Committee, joined by the Majority \nLeader and a bipartisan group of Senators including Senator McCain and \nothers was able to make such an important contribution to this effort \nby contributing the provisions of S. 2010, the ``Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act,'' as it was unanimously reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee in April, as an amendment to the Sarbanes bill. \nBoth in Committee in April and again last week on the floor, not a \nsingle Senator from either party has voted against the provisions of \nthe Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act.\n  We worked hard to reach across party lines on this measure, and I \nhope that the House of Representatives acknowledges that fact. I was \nglad to see in last Friday's newspapers that Speaker Hastert also \nendorsed the joint Sarbanes-Leahy measure after its adoption. I hope \nthat the President can follow the leadership of Speaker Hastert and \nsupport the Senate measure as this bill moves forward.\n  Recent events have served as a stark reminder that we need to \nreexamine our laws to make sure that they reflect our important and \nshared values of honesty and accountability. Enron has become a symbol \nfor the torrent of corporate fraud scandals that have hit the front \npages and battered our financial markets. Tyco, Xerox, WorldCom, \nAdelphia, Global Crossings, the list goes on.\n  The things that happened at Enron did not happen by mistake. They \nwere not the result of one or two ``bad apples.'' Senior management at \nEnron, assisted by an army of accountants and lawyers spun an intricate \nweb of deceit. They engaged in a systematic fraud that allowed them to \nsecretly take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the company. This \nkind of fraud is not the work of a lone fraud artist. Rather, it is \nsymptomatic of a corporate culture where greed has been inflated and \nhonesty devalued.\n  Unfortunately, as I have said and as the experts warned at our \nFebruary 6 hearing, Enron does not appear to have been alone. Each week \nwe read of corporation after corporation that has engaged in \nmisconduct, and these are not small or marginal corporations. These are \nmajor mainstays of corporate America. The web of deceit woven by such \npublicly traded companies ensnares and victimizes the entire investing \npublic who depend on the transparency and integrity of our markets for \neverything from their retirement nest eggs to their children's college \nfunds. That is why this comprehensive reform is urgently needed to \nrestore accountability in our markets.\n  The Leahy-McCain amendment to the Sarbanes bill, approved 97-0 by the \nSenate, provided important provisions to ensure just such \naccountability.\n  The Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act which I authored \nprovides tough new criminal penalties to restore accountability and \ntransparency in our markets. It accomplishes this in three ways:\n  punishing criminals who commit fraud, preserving evidence to prove \nfraud, and protecting victims of fraud.\n  Here are some of its major provisions as adopted by the unanimous \nJudiciary Committee in April and the unanimous Senate last week: It \nestablishes a new crime of securities fraud, with a tough ten year jail \nsentence. It breaks the ``corporate code of silence'' by providing, for \nthe first time, federal protection for corporate whistleblowers who \nreport fraud to the authorities or testify at trial. It closes \nloopholes and toughens penalties for shredding documents as we learned \nhad occurred at Arthur Andersen. It requires audit documents to be \npreserved for 5 years and provides tough criminal penalties for their \ndestruction. It protects victims the right to recoup their losses by \npreventing fraud artists from hiding in bankruptcy or concealing their \ncrime and using an unfair statute of limitations to hide.\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\n  With these bipartisan provisions and others incorporated, this bill \nwe have produced is truly a comprehensive measure. It tightens \nregulation of corporate misconduct, but it now also provides an \nimportant deterrent to fraud artists. This bill is going to send \nwrongdoers to jail and save documents from the shredder, which sends a \npowerful and clear message to potential corporate wrongdoers ``dont do \nit.'' As a former prosecutor, I have discovered that nothing focuses \nattention to morality like the prospect of a long prison sentence.\n  In the Senate, as we have been debating and shaping specific and \ncomprehensive reform proposals, we had been trying for months \nunsuccessfully to get the President's support. The Administration had \nstayed on the sidelines during this important debate .\n  For whatever reason, perhaps the mounting scandals or the declining \nmarket, the President decided last week to speak out against corporate \nfraud. He spoke again today on our economy. I welcome his participation \nand hope that he will follow up his speeches by supporting real reform. \nIt is amazing to me that with such broad bipartisan support and now on \nthe verge of Senate passage, that the Administration has still not \ngiven a clear statement supporting the bill on which we are now about \nto vote.\n  Although I now understand that a White House official reportedly said \nthat they agreed with the ``goals'' of this reform bill, I was \ndisappointed that the President has not yet voiced his support for this \nbipartisan measure about to pass the Senate. Supporting the ``goals'' \nis a good first step but it is nonetheless a baby step. I read in the \npaper last week that the President does not want to ``tip his hand.'' \nThis is not a game of poker, however. This is the time for Presidential \nleadership with the integrity of our markets at stake. When there are \nspecific proposals passing the U.S. Senate by an overwhelming majority \nof Senators from both parties and the Speaker of the House is \nsupporting the measures as well one wonders what it will take for the \nPresident to express his opinion.\n  For those of us in the Senate, like myself, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nMcCain, Majority Leader Daschle, and others who have worked hard to \ncome up with specific and bipartisan reform proposals, the ``goals'' \nhave been clear for a long time. It is now time for comprehensive \naction.\n  While the President's proposal was short on details, some of it did \nsound familiar to those of us on the Judiciary Committee. Three of the \nPresident's proposals are found in S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act, which we adopted 97-0 in the Senate: One, The \nPresident advocates for strengthening the laws punishing document \nshredding and obstruction of justice. That is in our bill. Two, The \nPresident wants the Sentencing Commission to raise penalties for \ncorporate misconduct. That is in our bill. Three, The President wants \nthe Sentencing Commission to raise the penalties for the existing fraud \nlaws. That is in our bill as well.\n  I am glad the President adopted three proposals from my bill, even if \nhe will only say that he supports the `` goals.'' As I said, we were \nalso quick to write up his ideas into concrete proposals and include \nthem in our bill. Unfortunately, the President's proposal failed to \ninclude many of the important provisions in the bipartisan Leahy \namendment. It fails to create a new crime to punish securities fraud to \ndirectly punish corporate wrongdoers. It fails to provide \nwhistleblowers with protection that will break the corporate code of \nsilence. Remember, you can put whatever criminal laws you want on the \nbooks but unless there are witnesses who are not scared to help \nprosecutors prove what happened no one will be held accountable. It \nfails to protect victims of fraud by allowing them to recover their \nlosses from a fraud artist who declares bankruptcy. It fails to \nestablish a realistic statute of limitations to allow victims to recoup \ntheir losses when a fraud artist can manage to conceal his crimes for \nlong enough, a change that has received strong bipartisan support \ndating back to the SEC under former President Bush.\n  As I said, I was glad to hear the President finally join this reform \ndebate. Now is not the time, though, for half measures. We need \ncomprehensive action. We were glad to include the President's proposals \nin the Senate bill, but we unanimously agreed to more comprehensive \nreform, including the Leahy bill.\n  Now I hope that the President will support such comprehensive reform \nas is found in this bill. I hope that his rhetoric is backed by action \nand that his generalities are backed with specifics.\n  Speaker Hastert has now publicly supported the Sarbanes bill and the \nLeahy amendment. I hope that the President will support the bill's \nprovisions as it moves forward to conference and will appeal to other \nRepublican House members not to water it down. That will be the true \ntest of his resolve to restore accountability to our markets.\n  It is time for action, comprehensive action that will restore \nconfidence and accountability in our public markets. The Sarbanes bill, \nincluding the unanimously approved Leahy-McCain amendment incorporating \nthe Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, provides just such \naction.\n  Let's pass this comprehensive bill and send the President a strong \nmeasure to sign into law. Congress must act to restore integrity in our \ncapital markets to strengthen our economy.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:45 p.m. \ntoday all time postcloture expire, and that all the time available, not \ncounting the time available for Senator Byrd, be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two managers or their designees; that without \nfurther intervening action, the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Carnahan amendment No. 4286, to be immediately followed \nby a vote in relation to the Edwards amendment No. 4187, as amended, if \namended; that upon disposition of these amendments, the bill be read a \nthird time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill; that upon \npassage, the Banking Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof H.R. 3763, the House companion, and that the Senate then proceed to \nits consideration; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and \nthe text of S. 2673, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof; that the \nbill be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; that upon passage of H.R. 3763, the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate; that all succeeding votes in this \nvote sequence, after the first vote, be limited to 10 minutes; that \nthere be up to 2 minutes of explanation prior to each vote, with no \nfurther intervening action or debate, with the 2 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to propound a parliamentary inquiry. Under this agreement, when \n5:45 comes, we would begin to vote on the two amendments, and then vote \non final passage, and no other amendment would be in order under the \nagreement; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I do not object. I think under this \nagreement we will have time to go back and forth. I would say that if \nit saves anyone time, we do not need a vote on the two pending \namendments. We could do them by voice vote and proceed to final \npassage.\n  Mr. REID. We will be happy to discuss that after the UC is entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of H.R. 3763, passage of S. 2673 be vitiated and the bill \nbe returned to the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I want to begin by very briefly \nresponding to Senator Kennedy. I was somewhat taken aback at his \nsuggestion that we set aside the two amendments and allow a nongermane \namendment to\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nbe offered when, in fact, on a bipartisan basis, earlier this week, we \ndecided not to deal with pension reform.\n  So I want to make it clear to my colleagues that I am perfectly happy \nto deal with pension reform. I think a bipartisan consensus is evolving \non pension reform. But we made a decision, on a bipartisan basis, \nearlier this week, not to put pension reform on this bill. Its day will \ncome. I want to make that clear.\n\n  Madam President, let me try to respond to several points that were \nmade earlier today. I will try to be brief so that my other colleagues \nwill have an opportunity to speak on my side of the aisle.\n  I want, first, to talk about stock options. Then I want to talk about \nthe bill before us and where we go from here. And I will try to be \nbrief on all of them.\n  First, let me make it clear that stock options are pretty important \nto the American economy. More than 6 million nonexecutive workers in \nAmerica receive stock options every year. So when we finally get around \nto having a policy set on stock options--which I hope will be done by \nFASB, the accounting board, based on logic and reason--we need to take \ninto account that 6 million people who are not executives of companies \nget stock options every year.\n  We want to be sure that we are not endangering their ability to own a \npiece of America with the reforms designed to deal with a few people \nwho violated the law in some cases, who did not act honorably in some \ncases.\n  We want to be sure we do not deprive or preclude 6 million workers \nwho are not executives--or people who did not violate the law, did not \nact dishonorably--from the ability to get stock options.\n  Let me also say, in areas such as biotechology and the computer \nprogramming industries, that 55 percent of rank and file employees get \nstock options.\n  So I just want to urge, as we are going about our business here, with \nall this talk about people who have made millions, that we do not \nforget that millions of Americans benefit from this, and we need to be \ncareful about what we are doing.\n  Let me say, secondly--and Senator Bennett made the point today; I \nmade it last week--if you listen to what is being said in this debate, \na big point is made of the fact that in 1994 we saw an explosion in the \nuse of stock options and low-interest loans and other nonconventional \nforms of executive compensation.\n  What happened to trigger that is in 1993, as a gratuitous provision \nin the 1993 tax bill, we changed the law so that if you are \ncompensating an executive in corporate America and you pay that \nexecutive more than $1 million a year, you cannot count that \ncompensation as a business expense. Of the top 30 companies in America, \nthe level of compensation at that point was already substantially above \nthe million-dollar mark. So because of what Congress did in 1994, \nhaving passed a law that said you could not pay people with a paycheck \nabove a certain level and have it count as a business expense, we \nshould not have been surprised that accountants and financial planners \nand people who were smart enough to make over $1 million a year found \nother ways to receive compensation.\n  So I want to make it clear that the point I am making is, if you are \nlooking for somebody to point the finger of blame at here--and many \npeople are trying to do that--I think Congress is a good institution to \npoint at because Congress eliminated the ability of companies to pay \ntheir executives the old-fashioned way.\n  A lot has been made about who is at fault in all this. I would just \nsimply make the following points. If somebody said to me: I know you \ndon't know what caused all these current problems, but tell me; I am \ngoing to force you to tell me what you think the cause was. I would \nsay: The inadequacy of GAAP accounting, which, in its current \nincarnation, works very well for old-style companies with assets that \nare written off.\n  GAAP accounting fits the steel industry perfectly. It fits the \nautomobile industry pretty well. But the problem in the 1990s--when \nproductive power became knowledge, when companies with relatively \nlittle in the way of assets gained huge market caps because of people's \nassessment of their know-how and the technology embodied by the \ncompany--was that GAAP accounting did not keep pace with the reality of \nthe world that we live in today and that we lived in the 1990s.\n  It is very complicated to try to figure out what the values of these \ncompanies actually are by any conventional method where you are adding \nup their acquisition cost of assets and depreciating those assets.\n  This created a giant void in GAAP accounting in the 1990s, and people \npushed the envelope within that void. In some cases, it appears they \nviolated the law; in other cases, they have certainly violated \nstandards of ethics.\n  Nothing we are doing in this bill is going to solve the problem in \nGAAP accounting. I am confident that over time we will find new ways of \ndeveloping generally accepted accounting principles that don't rely on \nconcepts such as goodwill, which don't make a lot of sense \neconomically. But I do believe the bill before us is a step in the \nright direction.\n  There are differences of opinion. Before we go to final passage, I \nwant to make clear what those differences are. Senator Sarbanes and I \nboth believe that we should have an independent accounting board. We \nboth believe that that board should set and enforce ethics standards. \nWe both believe that part of setting ethics standards is looking at \nauditor independence.\n  Senator Sarbanes believes that we should write in law in some great \ndetail what is entailed in auditor independence. I believe the problem \nwith that is that while the law might fit General Motors, there are \n16,254 publicly traded companies in America, and I am concerned that \nthere is no law that Congress can write that will fit all 16,254 \ncompanies.\n  My second problem is, if you make a mistake in writing the law, then \nyou have to go back and pass another law to correct it. If we had set \nout Glass-Steagall, separating banking and securities, by regulation, \nmy guess is that by the mid 1950s, we would have concluded that that \nwas a mistake, and we would have fixed it. But since it was written \ninto law, it couldn't be fixed by regulation. Regulators tried to make \nmarginal changes. We ended up with a very unstable system, and we were \nonly able to fix it by law in 1999.\n  A second problem with writing the details of these different \nstandards such as auditor independence into law is if you make a \nmistake, it is hard to fix it; whereas if you set up a board and, based \non their expertise, they set out a regulation, if they make a mistake, \nthey can fix it.\n  My final point on setting these standards by law is, one size fits \nall never works. What we need is the flexibility for this board to set \na standard and then determine, based on the circumstance of the \nindividual company, what makes sense.\n  I intend to vote for the bill on final passage. There are probably 10 \nthings in the bill I am opposed to. But we are going to conference with \na House bill that is very different. I am confident that in conference \nwe can write a bill that will be supported by both Houses of Congress \nand signed by the President. I think we can strengthen the bill where \nit needs to be strengthened. I think we can provide flexibility where \nit is needed to bring in reason and responsibility.\n  Our objective has to be to fix what is broken in American capital \nmarkets and do it while minimizing the cost we impose on businesses, \ninvestors, and workers that did not violate the law and did not act in \na nonethical manner.\n  The sooner we can get to conference, the sooner we can write this \nbill and see the bill signed into law. We have reached the point where \nwe have a bill before us that addresses the major issues that we \ndecided to address.\n  I know people have been unhappy about the inability to offer \namendments today. The plain truth is, we have 97 first-degree \namendments that have been filed and 24 second-degree amendments, and \nthere was never any possibility that those amendments could be offered. \nWe tried to come up with amendments that were agreed to and in the \nprocess, ended up excluding some people.\n  Let me conclude my remarks, at least for the time being, by \ncongratulating Senator Sarbanes on his leadership on this bill. \nOverall, he has done a\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\ngood job. I do not agree with him on each and every part of it, but he \nhas always been open. We have had many good discussions. I am confident \nthat in the end we will write a bill that will be broadly supported and \nthat will be in the interest of the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4:55 \nhaving arrived, the Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                           supplemental bill\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, there is a game being played with the \ncritical issue of homeland security. It is a political game which could \nhave disastrous consequences.\n  The White House is talking big about homeland security, exhibiting \nstrong presidential interest in homeland security, trotting out \nproposals for a whole new Department of Homeland Security, and \npublicizing alerts.\n  It is strange, then, strange indeed that despite its public \npronouncements on homeland security, the White House refuses to back \nthe rhetoric up with resources.\n  Twice--once last year, and currently--large bipartisan majorities in \nboth Houses of Congress have withstood veto threats from this \nadministration and insisted on significant funding increases for \nhomeland security.\n  President Bush's own appointees have all but begged the President's \nOMB Director for additional funds to fight the war on terrorism here at \nhome. Many of these requests are urgent and quite compelling, yet the \nOMB has continually rejected a surprising number of these pleas. It is \nas if this administration has delivered an internal unfunded mandate to \nits own cabinet secretaries and Federal workers. Fight the war on \nterrorism on every front here in the homeland. Fight vigorously. Spare \nnothing, but make sure you do it on a shoestring. Protect our people \nhere at home, but protect them on the cheap.\n  The Department of Energy proposed a total of $380 million to fund \nprojects to enhance the security of radioactive materials here at home \nand overseas, including: better security measures to safeguard the \ntransport of nuclear weapons within the United States; improvements in \nthe ways in which we secure and store plutonium; cleaning up, \ntransporting, and protecting low-level radioactive materials that could \nbe used in a ``dirty bomb.''\n  For these and similar activities $380 million was asked for by the \nSecretary of Energy. But do you know what? That request fell on deaf \nears at the Office of Management and Budget. Despite all of the \nworrying and nail biting about what would happen if some lunatic \nobtained radioactive material and detonated a ``dirty bomb'' on the \nmall in Washington or in some other large city, the OMB provided less \nthan $27 million or about 7 percent of the Energy Department's request. \nLet me say that again: The OMB provided less than $27 million or about \n7 percent of the Energy Department's request. This urgent supplemental \nbill contains $361 million for the Department to dedicate to securing \nthese dangerous and vulnerable materials. That is $334 million above \nthe amount requested by the President.\n  Another striking omission from the Bush supplemental request for \nhomeland security involved efforts to deport those individuals who \nentered the country on visas that have now expired. Currently there are \nan estimated 8 million undocumented immigrants in the United States and \nonly 2,000 interior immigration enforcement officers nationwide. This \nis a very dangerous situation. We know that terrorists live and plot \ntheir crimes among us. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nrequested $52 million for analysts to help find, arrest and deport \nhigh-risk individuals who have disregarded the departure dates on their \nvisas.\n  OMB said no, nada, nix. It denied the entire request. The \nsupplemental bill, now stuck in conference because of the \nadministration's latest demands, contains $25 million that the \nAppropriations Committee believes the INS can usefully spend this year \nto address the need to locate some of these individuals. We also \ninclude $88 million for construction and equipping of border \nfacilities, and for improved border inspections.\n  Last fall, OMB denied $1.5 billion in funding which the FBI requested \nin the wake of the attack on the twin towers in New York. Part of the \nFBI's funding request was for acceleration of a new computer system \nthat will be at the heart of all communications within the bureau. Also \nincluded in the request were funds to enhance the internal security of \nthe FBI's systems and procedures; for ``cyber cops'' and for hazardous \nmaterials personnel. The Congress provided $212 million above the \nPresident's request to permit completion of the new computer system \nmuch earlier than would be allowed under the Bush plan. In addition, we \nhave included--the Appropriations Committee--$175 million for cyber \nsecurity and counter terrorism in the supplemental that the White House \nis now delaying--delayed at the last minute last Thursday evening.\n\n  I could go on, but suffice it to say that this administration talks a \ngood game about homeland security but it is unwilling to put its money \nwhere its mouth is.\n  Over this past weekend, during his radio address, the President said \nthat, ``Strengthening our economy and protecting the homeland and \nfighting the war on terror are critical issues that demand prompt \nattention.'' I agree. I only wish that the same message would be made \nclear to the Office of Management and Budget.\n  We have worked diligently in the Congress to get these critical \nhomeland security monies out to federal and local personnel charged \nwith protecting our people. Yet, we have been met by objection after \nobjection by this administration.\n  In March, the President insisted he needed more money for national \ndefense in an urgent supplemental. We gave him every dollar he \nrequested. In addition, the House and Senate provided more money for \ncritical homeland defense needs.\n  Instead of letting the House and Senate work out our differences and \nget the funding out, the White House started issuing veto threats \nbefore the Senate bill was even off of the floor. And last Thursday \nevening, just as all differences appeared to be worked out, the White \nHouse bomb throwers blew up the agreement with new demands.\n  It makes one wonder how much the White House really needs that \ndefense money and it certainly causes one to wonder how serious this \nadministration really is about homeland security.\n  Senator Stevens and I have beseeched the White House over and over \nagain to have the Homeland Security Director come before our Committee \nto tell us about the needs for Homeland Security. Our requests were \ndenied. We held days of hearings with administration officials, local \nfirefighters, policemen, mayors and governors. We did our best and \nfunded the needs as testimony we heard indicated.\n  We wrote a good bill, and we were ready to convene the conference \nFriday. But our efforts were blown up by the OMB Director, suddenly and \ncompletely and with no warning until the very last minute, Thursday \nevening.\n  So needs go wanting in our military and in our homeland defense \neffort. There is no excuse for such irresponsibility. Such tactics are \nnot in the best interests of our people. Hollow rhetoric on homeland \nsecurity will never replace solid funding for these needs.\n  Political gamesmanship over issues so critical to our Nation and our \npeople is irresponsible, arrogant and totally out of line.\n  I deplore the arrogance with which the good faith efforts of both \nHouses of Congress have been treated by this White House. Apparently \nthe security and safety of this nation and its people have taken a back \nseat to gamesmanship by a White House that has no respect for the \npeople's representatives or for the people's urgent needs.\n  Under OMB Director Mitch Daniels' stewardship, the Federal budget has \ngone from a surplus of $127 billion in FY 2001 to an estimated deficit \nfor the current fiscal year of $165 billion. This is a swing of $292 \nbillion in just one year.\n  The President is now threatening to veto the urgent national defense \nand homeland defense supplemental appropriations bill based on Mr. \nDaniels recommendation. Why? Because Mr. Daniels asserts that the bill \nspends too much money. Yet the conference report's spending levels that \nhave been\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nagreed to on a bipartisan and bicameral basis would increase the \ndeficit by only about $600 million compared to the President's request.\n\n  Mr. Daniels believes that the critical port security, border \nsecurity, firefighting, law enforcement, nuclear security and other \nhomeland defense programs funded in the supplemental can wait because \nthe bill would increase the deficit by about $600 million, when his \nfailed fiscal policy has resulted in a $292 billion swing in the \ndeficit.\n  The OMB Director seems to have forgotten, or perhaps never learned, \nthat the appropriations process is about more than just numbers. Maybe \nat OMB, they can be bean counters, but here in Congress we are \nresponsible for understanding what the numbers mean for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Daniels is cynically focused only on the bottom line. In an \neffort to make the supplemental bill look smaller, he has proposed \nrescinding the balance of funds under the airline loan guarantee \nprogram. He asserts that this would produce $1.1 billion of savings. \nYet these funds under the law can not be spent. There are no real \nsavings here. The Congressional Budget Office would not score savings \nfor this proposal. This is the kind of phony accounting that is getting \nour nation's corporations in trouble.\n  This phony accounting is proof that Mr. Daniels does not care about \nhomeland defense or about our national defense, or about fiscal \ndiscipline. This phony accounting proves that the President's veto \nthreat is only about proving that he can force the Congress to hit some \narbitrary bottom line. And the unmitigated gall of a high White House \nofficial coming to the Congress with an accounting gimmick at a time \nwhen that same White House is decrying phony accounting practices and \nscandals in the business community is beyond belief.\n  We should not delay this conference one more day. There are some in \nCongress who suggest that we should throw our hands up on this bill and \nwait until the next fiscal year to address these priorities. Such \nstatements ignore the critical needs facing the nation for defense and \nhomeland security. Our fighting men and women need this money to \nprosecute the war on terrorism. Dr. Dov Zakheim--the Defense Department \ncomptroller--said in a briefing on Friday that the Defense Department \nis hitting a wall and that our people in uniform cannot be paid if the \nSupplemental Bill is not enacted by the August break. He said in that \nbriefing that there is good will on Capitol Hill, and he is right. We \nare trying to do the right thing for our people here at home and our \nfighting men and women in the field. It is deplorable that good will, \nhard work, and good intentions can be trashed by OMB Director with \nreckless abandon. I do not think this President or this nation are \nwell-served by tactics and gamesmanship when the stakes are so high.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum be printed \nin the Record which sets forth the highlights of the $7.2 billion for \nhomeland defense in conference funding levels.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Highlights of $7.2 Billion for Homeland Defense in Conference Funding \n                                 Levels\n\n       The tentative conference funding levels are $1.9 billion \n     above the President's request. A summary of the $1.9 billion \n     increase with examples of changes to the President's homeland \n     defense proposal follows:\n       $701 million for first responder programs, $343 million \n     above the President's request, including:\n       $150 million for firefighters, with the funds going \n     directly to the local firefighters. The President did not \n     request supplemental funds despite the fact that over $3.0 \n     billion in applications from 18,000 fire departments were \n     received for the $360 million currently available.\n       $100 million for State and local governments for improving \n     interoperability of communications equipment for fire, police \n     and emergency medical technicians, none of which was \n     requested. The funding flows through existing FEMA and \n     Justice program, rather than the new, centralized program at \n     FEMA, proposed by the President for FY 2003. In addition, we \n     are directing the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology to take the lead in developing uniform standards \n     for interoperable State and local law enforcement, \n     firefighting and emergency medical communications equipment.\n       $151 million for the Justice Department, $151 million above \n     the President's request to give to State and local \n     governments for improved training and equipment for law \n     enforcement personnel (rather than through FEMA). Funds would \n     also be used to improve the processing of security clearances \n     for state and local first responders so that State and local \n     governments can have information on potential security risks \n     and to promote mutual aid agreements to coordinate the \n     response of State and local governments to a terrorist \n     attack.\n       $193 million, $134 million below the request for FEMA \n     grants to State and local governments to update their \n     emergency operations plans and to improve State emergency \n     operations centers. $25 million is approved for a new, \n     unauthorized program requested by the President, $25 million \n     below the request. The proposal establishes a Citizen Corps \n     within FEMA to promote volunteer service for emergency \n     preparedness.\n       $54 million, $22 million above the President's request for \n     FEMA's search and rescue teams. Currently, there are 28 FEMA \n     search and rescue teams around the country that can be \n     deployed to major disasters to assist local first responders \n     in search and rescue operations. Funding will be used to \n     upgrade equipment and training for responding to events \n     involving a biological, chemical or radiation attack.\n       $37.1 million of unrequested funding for the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology for developing uniform \n     guidelines for chemical, biological and radiation detection \n     equipment ($17.1 million) and for developing best practice \n     guidance for homeland security technologies ($20 million).\n       $15.9 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training \n     Center to expand training capacity for law enforcement \n     personnel of the new Transportation Security Administration.\n       $739 million for port security programs, $465 million above \n     the President's request, including:\n       $125 million for port security grants through the \n     Transportation Security Administration. Last Fall, Congress \n     approved $93 million of unrequested funds for port security \n     grants. DOT received $692 million of applications for the $93 \n     million we provided. Despite this, the President did not \n     request additional funds.\n       $528 million for the Coast Guard for port and maritime \n     security, $273 million above the President's request. \n     Increased funds would be used to: expedite vulnerability \n     assessments at our nation's ports, rather than follow the \n     Administration's current plan to do the assessments over the \n     next five years; add two new maritime safety and security \n     teams; purchase a total of six homeland security response \n     boats; and expand aviation assets as well as the shore \n     facilities to support them.\n       $39 million for Customs to target and inspect suspect \n     shipping containers at overseas ports before they reach U.S. \n     ports. The Administration requested no funds for this \n     activity.\n       $19.3 million, as requested for 34 additional personnel for \n     improved background checks for truck drivers, for improved \n     fraud detection for truck licensing and for improved fraud \n     detection for driver's licenses.\n       $28 million of unrequested funding for the Safe Commerce \n     program to develop better procedures for securing the \n     contents of the 6 million containers that enter U.S. ports \n     each year.\n       $251 million for bioterrorism funding, $251 million above \n     the President's request, including:\n       $251 million for the Centers for Disease Control for \n     improved and secure facilities, including toxicology and \n     infectious disease labs, an emergency operations center and \n     for information technology security.\n       $235 million, $209 million above the President's request to \n     improve security at our nuclear weapons facilities (Energy \n     requested the funds, but the White House did not request \n     them). Funding would be used to improve security of the \n     nuclear weapons stockpile, the national nuclear labs and our \n     nuclear weapons plants. Funds are included to establish a 911 \n     system for local first responders to call when confronted \n     with nuclear hazzards, enhanced funding for the National \n     Center for Combating Terrorism, expansion of radiological \n     search teams, and establishment of a National Capital Area \n     Response Team at Andrews Air Force Base. Funds would also be \n     used to consolidate nuclear materials sites so fewer \n     locations need to be protected. Several requested items that \n     are approved include funds to improve security on the \n     electrical grid and funds to improve our capability to detect \n     radiation.\n       $147 million, $128 million above the President's request \n     for cyber security to help deal with the threat to Federal \n     and private information systems. $82.6 million is provided to \n     Justice to improve the investigation and prosecution of cyber \n     crime, research to improve the detection of cyber crime, \n     ``data warehousing'' and ``data mining'' to help expose cyber \n     crime and for information sharing. $20 million is provided to \n     Commerce to develop unified Federal guidelines and procedures \n     for system security certification and to develop guidelines \n     and benchmarks for secure information systems. Funding is \n     also provided to improve wireless intrusion detection \n     systems. $25 million is provided to the Energy Department to \n     improve cyber security at our nuclear weapons plants and \n     labs. $19.3 million, as requested, is included for NSF for \n     scholarships to develop cyber security skills.\n       $120 million for border security, $78 million more than \n     requested by the President, including $32 million for \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service Construction to \n     improve\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\n     facilities on our nation's borders, $25 million for better \n     equipment for the additional personnel that are being hired \n     with the funds Congress provided at Fall and $5.7 million for \n     the Justice Department to deploy to 30 more ports the IDENT/\n     IAFIS system for rapid response criminal background checks by \n     the INS of suspect aliens prior to their admission into the \n     country. $57 million for INS for identifying and removing \n     immigration felons from the country and for information \n     technology enhancements.\n       $140 million of unrequested funding for the Department of \n     Agriculture to enhance our nation's food safety capabilities \n     and to protect against devastating plant and animal disease; \n     to increase support for the Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service, especially to ensure the safety of imported \n     products; for improved security at USDA labs in order to \n     secure bio-hazardous materials; funding for the Extension \n     Service to provide emergency training for first response in \n     rural areas; for FDA to improve the ability to inspect \n     imported products such as medical devices that contain or are \n     susceptible to being contaminated with radiation; and for \n     vulnerability assessments and security improvements to \n     protect rural water systems.\n       471 million of unrequested funding for airport security, \n     including $150 million to insure that all small and medium \n     hub airports have all of the funds necessary to implement the \n     FAA's new airport security guidelines and that large airports \n     have some additional funding to meet those requirements; $225 \n     million is provided above the President's request for \n     explosives detection equipment; $42 million is provided to \n     improve the security of the FAA air traffic control system; \n     $17 million is provided to improve airport terminal security \n     for our nation's airports; and $7.5 million is provided to \n     FAA to repair long range radar systems that the Department of \n     Defense believe must be continued for several years because \n     these assets are the only FAA radar capable of continually \n     tracking aircraft with disabled transponders. In addition, \n     $15 million is provided for improved air to ground \n     communications for the air marshals, $4 million for radiation \n     detection equipment for air cargo and $10 million is included \n     for improved technology for air cargo safety and other cargo \n     modes.\n       $100 million for unrequested nuclear non-proliferation \n     programs. The best opportunity to stop a potential ``dirty'' \n     bomb is to minimize the opportunity for terrorists to get \n     their hands on nuclear material. Funds are included to \n     protect fissile material abroad, purchase radiation detectors \n     and to establish international standards for securing fissile \n     material.\n       $108 million of unrequested funding for the Corps of \n     Engineers to improve security at Corps water projects.\n       $92 million, $82 million above the President's request for \n     the FBI for counter terrorism and information technology \n     enhancements. In total, FBI receives $175 million when cyber \n     security funding is included.\n       $50 million of unrequested funds for EPA to provide funds \n     to local governments to conduct vulnerability assessments on \n     our drinking water systems.\n       Examples of the remaining $273 million, most of which was \n     unrequested include: $12 million for security at the \n     Smithsonian; $17.7 million for the National Park Service for \n     installation of bollards at the Jefferson Memorial and an in-\n     ground retaining wall at the Washington Monument (requested \n     by the President in FY 2003); $26 million for the US \n     Geological Survey for high resolution mapping and imagery of \n     the nation's major cities for use in developing vulnerability \n     assessments of infrastructure and for expanded data storage \n     capacity; $28.5 million to expand Secret Service capacity to \n     combat electronic crimes; $23.6 million for the Legislative \n     branch for Capitol Police and for the Library of Congress to \n     cover part of the lost copyright fees from the slowed mail \n     and for costs associated with cleaning up the Hart building \n     after the anthrax attack; $19 million to improve response \n     capacity to chemical attacks and for research on the impact \n     of the release of toxic substances at the World Trade Center; \n     $15 million for improved bus safety; $7.2 million for NOAA to \n     develop back-up capacity for the supercomputers that support \n     our weather forecasting system; $17 million for security and \n     renovations of the Federal courts, $3 million above the \n     request; and $44 million for the District of Columbia and the \n     Washington Metro to improve security; consistent with the \n     congressionally-mandated District emergency operations plan \n     and FEMA's emergency plan for the National Capital Region, \n     and to construct decontamination and quarantine facilities at \n     Children's Hospital and the Washington Hospital Center.\n       The conference funding levels include $4.1 billion for the \n     new Transportation Security Administration, $331 million \n     below the request ($439 million of which is for unrequested \n     items highlighted under port security and airport security).\n       The conference funding levels also include the $87 million \n     President's Budget request for the Postal Service to improve \n     protection of postal customers and postal employees from a \n     bioterrorist attack, the $52 million President's Budget \n     request for improved security of Federal buildings and $3.8 \n     million for the Office of Homeland Security, $1.2 million \n     below the President's request.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. Let \nme begin by stating that which I have said on several occasions: We are \nall deeply indebted to the Senator from Maryland for the tremendous \nwork he has done as the chairman of the Banking Committee in fashioning \nthis legislation. He has worked with many of us to put this bill \ntogether. My guess is that, within an hour or so, we will \noverwhelmingly pass this bill before us. The chairman will be largely \nresponsible for the result.\n  I also commend my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and others \nwho have worked very hard and have made it a bipartisan bill. Without \nhis leadership, I don't think that would have happened. We may have had \na partisan vote coming out of committee. That would not have bode well \nfor the handling of this matter on the floor. So I commend him and \nothers for reaching an accommodation that made this a strong, good \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes toward the close of this \ndebate to urge our colleagues to be supportive of this bill, and I hope \nMembers of the other body will support what we have done in the Senate.\n  The House passed legislation a number of weeks ago, prior to a lot of \nthe events that have unfolded over the last 2 or 3 weeks. The argument \ntoday for a stronger Senate bill hardly needs to be made in light of \nevents that occurred over the past number of days. Just today, the Dow \nis down some 40 points; Nasdaq is even. But over the last week, we have \nseen a continued decline in investor confidence and, of course, how \nthat is reflected in the stock markets.\n  Investors, both domestic and foreign, are losing confidence in our \nfinancial markets. Investor trust is contagious. I also point out the \ncorollary to that: Investor mistrust is also contagious. What we are \nwatching is an erosion of trust that has begun and is almost impossible \nto stop once it gets rolling. Obviously, a lot of factors will \ncontribute to stemming this tide of continued erosion of investor trust \nand confidence.\n  One of the things we can do is what we are doing today. Other people \nwill have to add their voices to the debate. In my view, the President \nstill has to be stronger than he has been. The House will have to rise \nto the occasion as we have endorsed in large measure what we have \naccomplished here, but our step, the first step, is the one we are \ntaking this afternoon. Therefore, I think this is critically important.\n  This is not just another bill we are passing. This is far more \nimportant. In fact, the impact of how people react may be more \nimportant than the actual wording and language of the bill. It is \ncritically important we have as strong a vote as possible.\n  If we fail to enact serious reforms--and this bill is serious \nreform--then I believe we endorse dangerous and discredited accounting \npractices that we have seen in the last 7 months alone cost \nshareholders and workers billions of dollars in their savings and \npensions.\n  The Nasdaq has fallen over 37 percent, and the Dow has fallen 17 \npercent since the beginning of the year. Both Nasdaq and the Dow have \ndropped over 10 percent each in the past week alone. So Congress must \nact today, Mr. President, and act with a very strong voice to stem the \nrising tide of investor apprehension.\n  Passage of this bill will not and cannot of itself restore investor \nconfidence. More must be done to win back consumer faith, but this bill \nis a critical piece of the overall effort and, therefore, it is \nessentially important we adopt it.\n  The part of the rationale of the original securities law in the 1930s \nwas to increase public trust in America's financial markets and \nreliability of disclosed corporate financial information. Those laws \nover the past 70-plus years were a part of the modern economic \nfoundation of our Nation, and they were designed to promote market \nefficiency and inspire investor confidence.\n  The resulting market confidence in the statements of financial health \nof publicly traded companies has paved\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nthe way for America's rise as an economic superpower.\n  I could make a strong case that the vote we are going to take today \nis for one of the most important bills impacting the Nation's financial \nmarkets since the 1930s. I say that because this legislation will \nfundamentally change the way publicly traded companies will do business \nand how the accounting profession performs its statutorily required \naudit function.\n\n  Much has been said about what this legislation does not accomplish. \nBriefly, I wish to focus my remarks on what it does do and repeat, we \nare not solving every problem with this bill. There are a lot of other \nissues that need to be addressed, but we have to begin the process, it \nseems to me, by getting the accounting part of this equation right, and \nwe will not know ultimately whether we have done all we could, but I \nthink this is a major step in that direction.\n  The bill, we now know, creates a new independent regulator for the \naccounting profession. The new body will act as a strong, independent, \nfull-time board with significant authority to regulate auditors of \npublic companies. The independent board will have clear authority for \nsetting auditor standards and important investigative standards. It \nstrengthens audit reporting standards for the accounting profession and \ncontains significant prohibitions for accountants performing nonaudit \nservices for audit clients, and it addresses the growing conflicts of \ninterest that have been too pervasive throughout the accounting \nprofession.\n  It provides for the first time an independent funding source for the \nFinancial Standards Accounting Board, which I think is also extremely \nimportant and one of the major reforms in this bill.\n  There are additional dollars to provide the SEC with more firepower, \nif you will, to have more cops on the street so we might avoid some of \nthe problems that have occurred in the past.\n  It also improves corporate governance requirements and improves \ncorporate disclosures. The bill grants additional authority and \nresponsibility to the audit committees of publicly traded companies.\n  Those are very important steps. The provisions contained in the \nlegislation were carefully considered. We had 10 hearings, and by a \nvote of 17 to 4, the committee--the Presiding Officer being one--passed \nout this very fine legislation.\n  Additionally, during floor consideration of this bill, Senator Leahy \nof Vermont added new criminal penalties for securities fraud. I commend \nhim and strongly endorse the provision that won the overwhelming \nsupport of the Members. I hope it will add to our efforts of restoring \ninvestor confidence.\n  One of the last issues I would like to address, because it has been \ntalked about so much, is the stock options issue, which involved a lot \nof debate and discussion of the last number of days. I commend our \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, who has made an extraordinary \neffort to find a resolution to this issue we all can support. \nObviously, this question inspires more questions than answers in many \nways, but I commend him for his thoughtfulness and energy that he has \nbrought to this debate.\n  The issue of whether or not stock options should be expensed is not \nan issue that is going to go away. It has to be addressed. I must \nadmit, I am swayed by those who have a great deal of expertise in this \narea: Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, Paul Volcker, all of whom support \nthe expensing of stock options.\n  I also recognize the danger when Congress begins the process of \nlegislating accounting standards.\n  My friend from Texas and I have been involved in the past when there \nhave been efforts by people who wanted to have us vote on some of these \nmatters. I recall 3 or 4 years ago the debate was over pooling and \npurchasing accounting standards. I was very sympathetic to the \narguments made by those advocating pooling. Certainly, if I were a \nmember of FASB, I think I would have voted to allow that accounting \nstandard to go forward, but the idea that the Senate might vote by 51 \nto 49 to pick one accounting standard over another is just ludicrous on \nits face. We do not want to set a precedent, in my view, of the \nCongress of the United States deciding what accounting practices ought \nto be. That is why we set up these boards to do the job.\n\n  The approach taken by having the Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, \nand others look at these matters and get back to us with their \nrecommendations is the appropriate and proper way to go. Despite the \ntemptation of others to want to legislate these matters explicitly on \nthe floor, I remind my colleagues who have done that in the past, we \ninevitably regret doing it when we set precedents such as those and are \nonly duplicated by other ideas that temporarily may be very popular, \nmay be politically attractive, but may be terrible economics as well.\n  I applaud the effort to approach the stock option issue in the manner \nin which it has been addressed. I mentioned Senator Enzi. I mentioned \nmy colleague from Texas as well. He and I worked many years on a lot of \nmatters affecting the financial services sector of our economy. He does \nnot have that many days left with us, and I am going to miss him. I \ntold him that privately, and I tell him publicly that he is a valued \nMember of this institution. Whether we agree or disagree on matters he \nalways brings a great deal of thought to the debate. He has been a fine \nmember of the Banking Committee, and I have enjoyed my service with him \nfor many years. I do not want to be too complimentary. I will reserve \nany final glowing accolades for when we have completed the process. We \nhave a conference to go through yet.\n  Again, my compliments to Senator Sarbanes.\n  What we are doing is important. This is extremely important \nlegislation. I said earlier it may be more important what message it is \nwe are sending; that we are not sitting in the bleachers, we are not \njust standing by as these events unfold. All Members of this Chamber \ncan take great pride that the Senate of the United States has responded \nwith a responsible bill we think is going to make a difference. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland controls almost 14 \nminutes, and the Senator from Texas controls just under 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, my amendment requires that when \ncorporate insiders, such as CEOs, trade the stock of the companies they \nmanage, they must take reasonable steps to disclose those transactions \nto their shareholders. Current law requires that insiders file \ndisclosure forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, \nalmost all of these forms are filed on paper and average investors have \nno practical way of seeing these disclosures. My amendment requires \nthat these disclosure forms be filed electronically and that the SEC \nmake these disclosures available to the public over the Internet.\n  This amendment also requires that corporations disclose insider \ntransactions on their own Web sites. Investors have a right to know if \ncorporate officers are dumping their stock. However, it is meaningless \nto require these disclosures if investors have no practical way of ever \nseeing these disclosures. Without this amendment, the disclosure forms \nsimply sit in a file cabinet at the SEC in Washington. My amendment \nensures that investors have access to this important information.\n  In the 3 years leading up to its bankruptcy, as Enron's top officers \ntouted the company's stock, they sold more than $1.1 billion worth of \ntheir own holdings. Ken Lay alone sold more than $100 million worth of \nEnron stock while telling others to buy it. Enron's vice president of \nhuman resources, Cindy Olsen, was asked by employees if they should \ninvest 100 percent of their retirement funds in Enron. She replied: \n``Absolutely.'' But within 3 months she personally unloaded $1 million \nworth of Enron stock. Had Enron employees only known, they might have \nbeen skeptical about this advice.\n  Investors are entitled to know how executives are acting with their \nown shares of their company's stock, and my amendment will ensure they \nwill.\n  I yield my remaining time back to the Senator from Maryland.\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to Senator Enzi, and \nmight I say on my time, not his 8 minutes, that I want to thank Senator \nEnzi for his contribution to this bill, for his work from beginning to \nend. He has been a major contributor to the bill. He has proven that \nknowledge sometimes is a nice thing to have.\n  Our standard in Washington for objectivity is that you came in off \nthe turnip truck and you know absolutely nothing and therefore you are \nobjective, but I would say that Senator Enzi proves that it is nice \nevery once in awhile to have somebody who knows what he is talking \nabout. I think in many ways, large and small, the good things in this \nbill he has had a very positive impact on and the bad things in the \nbill he could not do anything about anyway--that was a joke, I would \nsay to the Senator from Maryland.\n  In any case, I do want to congratulate Senator Enzi for all the \ncontributions he has made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Texas for his gracious comments.\n  It has been mentioned several times today that there is nervousness \nin the stock market. There has been since we started debating this \nissue. I am very convinced that some of that is because people may read \nsome of the amendments that have been suggested and recognize the \nlegislative principle that, if it is worth reacting to, it is worth \noverreacting to. That ought to be enough to scare anybody.\n  We have had extensive debate. In fact, one reporter I talked to asked \nme if we were going to pass the McCain bill. The reporter talked about \nthe accounting reform, and I had to say, no, that is the Sarbanes bill \nwe have been working on. It is not stock options, in spite of the \nthreat we had the other day.\n  We usually do bills the way we have done this one--with a lot of \ncooperative talk. We then make arrangements to develop the best \npossible outcome. The accounting reform bill before us is designed in \nsuch a way that we set up processes that people with accountability and \nresponsibility and knowledge have to oversee. This bill does not tell \nthem exactly how to do the details of accounting. It gives a fair \nprocess for accountants to be able to do the details of accounting.\n  In past years, we have decided we knew more than the people who had \nthe expertise in the area of accounting and we have given them \ndirection on how to do it. We almost made that mistake again. For \ninstance, the McCain amendment was very simplistic. In one paragraph it \ntold people how to do accounting that may actually take about 500 pages \nto explain. It would have caused the most massive restatements in the \nhistory of the United States, and restatements right now make everybody \nnervous. People ought to realize that some restatements are caused by \nchanges in rules, not by people doing things wrong. So investors should \nalways review restatements and determine the actual cause. I certainly \nhope it is never Congress, but I suspect it very well could be.\n  Another proposal that was going to be put before us was one telling \nFASB, this Financial Accounting Standards Board, exactly what they were \nsupposed to examine next and what they were supposed to resolve in the \nnext year. I have to say, FASB is working on some important things \nbecause they have been examining what Congress has been debating and \nthey know in greater detail than we do what caused the massive \nrestatements. I have to say, I do not believe it was stock options. It \nwas likely a number of other things that need to be investigated.\n  This Financial Accounting Standards Board is diligently looking at \nthese issues. They are looking at some high-profile rules in the areas \nof accounting for intangibles and accounting for special purpose \nentities. We have talked a lot about special purpose entities, and our \nhearings showed that they may have been a cause for the Enron collapse. \nAlso, they are looking at accounting for guarantees and examining a \nfinal rule on liabilities and equity. They are also studying whether to \ncreate a rule on revenue recognition.\n  Those five things probably put one to sleep, but they are important \nto have resolved to make sure we do not have problems with companies in \nthe future. We have to be careful now and in the days to follow that we \nensure we use all of FASB's expertise, knowledge, and staff to resolve \nhigh publicity problems of accounting.\n  In this bill, we have made the Financial Accounting Standards Board \nmore independent. We have provided them with independent funding so \nthey no longer must beg for donations and perhaps encounter a conflict \nof interest. Through this process, we should not insert ourselves and \nsay we are going to tell them exactly what is important.\n  I would like to thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Gramm for the \nextraordinary work they have put into the process. Last week was an \nextremely difficult week. I thank them for the careful work and review \nthey have done on every single one of the amendments that has been \nsubmitted, and the process they established to make sure this bill \nwould not get out of hand, that it would not be an overreaction, and \nthat when we finish it tonight and we can reassure America it is still \nokay to invest in the stock market.\n  We are fortunate on the Banking Committee to have these two people I \nconsider to be the finest public servants in Congress. They have worked \nlong and hard to assure that the product that came out was bipartisan \nand reflected the views of as many Members as possible. I also thank \nthe members of the staff who worked diligently on the bill.\n  From my own staff, Katherine McGuire, Kristi Sansonetti, and Michael \nThompson. From Senator Gramm's staff, Wayne Abernathy, Linda Lord, \nStacie Thomas, and Michele Jackson. And from Chairman Sarbanes' staff, \nSteve Harris, Steve Kroll, Dean Shahinian, Marty Gruenberg, and Lindsey \nGraham and Vince Meehan. All of these staffers have spent many late \nnights and weekends working to build this legislation.\n  This legislation is badly needed. The markets have been in a steady \ndecline for several months now. While I do not believe it is \nWashington's job to step in every time the market is in a decline, I do \nbelieve that when markets move as a reaction to illegal or unethical \nacts, then we have obviously not made penalties severe enough to \ndissuade this type of behavior. Congress had to act in this climate.\n  However, I would also like to comment on a few things happening \noutside of the real debate--namely the attacks on SEC Chairman Harvey \nPitt. I have to say that Chairman Pitt and I may not always agree, but \nI believe the recent attacks on him to be unwarranted. Mr. Pitt has \ncome under fire for having represented some of the accounting firms who \nhave been criticized in recent restatements. I believe Chairman Pitt's \nwork in the private sector is a great asset to investors. We need \nindividuals who are willing to work in government who know and \nunderstand the industries they regulate. I do not want lifelong \ngovernment bureaucrats monitoring these companies.\n  These restatements did not all of a sudden appear when Chairman Pitt \nwas confirmed. In most cases, they begun during the late 1990s when \ncompanies became intent on not seeing the Internet bubble burst. I have \nto ask what was going on at the SEC while these companies were filling \nall of these false financial statements? What I imagine happened was \nthat the companies, who are very familiar with who is at the Commission \nand where the resources are being devoted, thought they could take \nadvantage of the situation because no one was paying attention.\n  Look at what has happened since Chairman Pitt has taken office. He \nhas opened a record number of investigations of restatements filed by \npublic companies. He has taken steps to break the relationship between \nresearch analysts and investment bankers. He has supported legislation \nthat will increase penalties on corporate executives engaged in \nfraudulent behavior. And, he has indicated his support of this \nlegislation, which by the way, I anticipate to be supported by the \nmajority of the Senate later today.\n  The numbers are clear. In Chairman Levitt's last year as Chairman, \n503 total enforcement actions were filed. Already this year, Chairman \nPitt has\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nfiled 415. Officer and Director Bars for 2000 were 38--this year so far \n71. Subpoenaed enforcement proceedings in 2000 were 9--this year 18. \nThe numbers go on and on. My point is that Chairman Pitt seems to be \nleft cleaning up the mess his predecessor left in corporate America.\n  I offer my support for these actions taken by Chairman Pitt. Instead \nof attacking him, I am more concerned about what was happening at the \nSEC that bred this climate where executives felt compelled to engage in \nthis unethical behavior. Why weren't some of these actions taken three \nor four years ago? Did the SEC Chairman not see the potential conflicts \nthat could arise out of research analysts getting compensation based on \ninvestment banking business?\n\n  Therefore, I would say that I commend Chairman Pitt for the work he \nis doing. From what I understand, the actions he is taking at the SEC \nhave struck fear throughout the corporate community that they had \nbetter get their act together.\n  This legislation before us now will also go far in restoring faith in \nthe markets. It will provide assurances to investors that we will not \nsit by and watch executives shatter the retirement dreams of workers \nwhile leaving themselves with millions of dollars. It will show the \nAmerican people that we will work to make financial statements \ntransparent and accurate to make sure they know as much about the \ncompany's financial state as possible.\n  The legislation builds an accounting oversight board to oversee the \naccountants who prepare financial statements of public companies. This \nboard will have broad authority to enforce and discipline rules by \nwhich accountants must live. The board will have full access to \naccounting firms' records and policies to require uniformity throughout \nthe industry when it comes to ethics and independence. Accountants must \nknow that someone is watching over them to require that their work is \nin the best interest of investors. This legislation will also provide \nfor the SEC to have the resources they need to enforce the law.\n  However, I also do not want this legislation to provide a payday for \nthe trial lawyers. The competitiveness of the accounting industry is at \nstake and we can ill afford to lose another firm solely because we \ndidn't offer proper protections in this legislation. I am in no way \nindicating that accounting firms should have new, special protections. \nThe only thing I am asking is that accounting firms aren't exposed to \nmore liability after this bill is enacted than they were before.\n  I am not sure some Members truly understand the situation facing \naccounting firms. We are down to the final four firms. These are the \nonly firms that have the expertise and resources to audit companies \nsuch as Microsoft, Coca Cola, and the thousands other large companies. \nIf we subject them to the will of the trial bar, it will only be a \nmatter of time before we lose the rest of the firms one by one.\n  I know that, given what has happened recently with the restatements, \nit is easy to be critical of accountants and easy to legislate them. I \nagree we do need legislation, but what also needs to be understood is \nthat overlegislating could be drastic to the economy. In the long run, \nif we overlegislate, it could be detrimental for the future of capital \nformation in this country.\n  Once again, I thank the Chairman for all of the work he and his staff \nhave done with this legislation. I think it is a good bill, and I do \nintend to support it. I also think it will continue to improve through \nthe Conference process and when all is said and done, investors will \nrespond positively to passage of this legislation.\n  I wish to speak about the Financial Accounting Standards Boards, \nknown as FASB, which has been referenced many times throughout the \ncourse of discussion on the underlying accounting bill, the Public \nCompany Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002.\n  Some of the pending amendments have referenced FASB and directed or \nmandated it to change how companies must expense stock options or to \nperform a study on how to expense stock options. In addition, the \nMcCain amendment sets the accounting standard for expensing stock \noptions, without allowing FASB to set rules on this form of expensing. \nThe Levin amendment mandates FASB conduct a one-year study on expensing \nstock options, and then adopt a rule based on a narrow set of external \nparameters. The Levin amendment implicates a desire to have such \nexpensing done.\n  In order to understand some of the problems with these types of \namendments, it is important to understand exactly what FASB does. Since \n1973, FASB has been the designated organization in the private sector \nfor establishing standard of financial accounting and reporting. In \nshort, those standards govern the preparation of all financial reports.\n  The mission of FASB is ``to establish and improve standards of \nfinancial accounting and reporting for the guidance and education of \nthe public, including issuers, auditors and users of financial \ninformation.''\n  To accomplish this mission, FASB acts to improve the usefulness of \nfinancial reporting; keep standards current to reflect changes in the \nmethods of doing business and the economic environment; consider any \nsignificant areas of deficiency in financial reporting; promote the \ninternational convergence of accounting standards together with \nimproving the quality of financial reporting; and improve the common \nunderstanding of the nature and purposes of information contained in \nfinancial reports.\n  FASB follows certain precepts in its activities. One is to be \nobjective in its decision making. Another is to carefully weigh the \nviews of its constituents in developing concepts and standards. But its \nultimate determination must be the Board's, based on research, public \ninput and careful deliberation. It also aspires to promulgate standards \nonly when the expected benefits exceed the perceived costs.\n\n  Overall, FASB was created to serve as an independent agency with an \nindependent agenda. However, FASB is currently funded by companies and \naccounting firms. The long standing concern was that FASB did not act \nwholly independently, and succumbed to industry pressures in order to \nget the funding it needed to operate. Back in 1993 and 1994, when \nexpensing of stock options was an issue, some critics say FASB \nsuccumbed to pressure by industry and Congress when it created a dual \nmethod of either expensing stock options at the time of grant, or \nplacing the information in a footnote as a form of public disclosure of \npossible stock dilution.\n  The underlying accounting reform bill fixes this perceived problem of \nindependence and autonomy by providing FASB with funding from both \nissuers and the accounting firms. Because of this change, FASB will be \ncompletely independent from the very companies it will set standards \nfor in the future. This is a good start.\n  It is also important to understand that, historically, FASB has never \nbeen directed by Congress through legislation to adopt one particular \nstandard for accounting, including expense accounting. It has also \nnever been directed by Congress to perform a study. FASB's role is not \nto perform studies for Congress and they should not be bogged down \nperforming them for political purposes.\n  Following that precedent, the Senate Banking Committee made certain \nnothing in the bill directs FASB to take any particular action. In \nother words, there is no federal mandate to FASB, nor should there be, \nif it is to remain an independent authority. In addition, why should \nCongress, a body without expertise in accounting standards for \npublically traded companies, set these standards?\n  I, and many other members, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan \nGreenspan, believe that Congress has no business setting accounting \nstandards. Instead, the Securities and Exchange Commission and FASB are \nthe entities with the expertise needed to make these types of \ndeterminations.\n  Ordinarily, FASB establishes plans with milestones it works towards. \nCongress should not dictate what plans and milestones it should work \ntowards or address. FASB also never sets artificial deadlines on when \nto reach a conclusion. As an independent agency, it carefully and \ndeliberately makes its determinations and sets rules, without adhering \nto outside pressures or timetables. Just as Congress should not set\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\naccounting standards for FASB to follow, it also should not set \nartificial deadlines for FASB to adhere to either.\n\n  Nevertheless, some members have filed amendments asking FASB to not \nonly take a specific action, but instructing it as to a specific \ntimetable. One amendment actually sets an accounting standard, thereby \ninstructing FASB to immediately change expensing standards. Another \nmandates FASB complete an expensing study within a year. These \namendment set unrealistic timetables and mandates.\n  It is important to remember that FASB already has its hands full with \nimportant projects to help improve financial standards and reporting. \nIt is currently working towards promulgating high profile rules in the \nareas of accounting for intangibles; accounting for special purpose \nentities; accounting for guarantees; and a final rule on liabilities \nand equity. FASB has also added to its agenda a project to research and \ncreate a rule on revenue recognition.\n  Let us not forget that the improper use of special purpose entities \nplayed a role in the downfall of Enron. Stock options had nothing to do \nwith Enron's bankruptcy.\n  The projects FASB is concentrating on are important projects which \nwill help clarify financial statements for investors. FASB itself needs \nto cue up and prioritize its projects based on what is more important \nto financial accounting and reporting. Congress should not dictate what \nthose priorities should be or the timetable it must adhere to.\n  If some of the amendments we are looking at are accepted, Congress \nwill establish a bad precedent of setting up a timetable and \nprioritizing projects for FASB. Congress will be putting stock option \nexpensing--an accounting standard which did not cause the collapse of \nEnron or the demise of other big companies--at the front of the cue.\n  And another question we need to ask ourselves is whether FASB has the \nmanpower to perform the mandates and timetables Congress would be \nproviding through the McCain and Levin amendments. Already, FASB is \nshifting its personnel to different projects to try to timely \npromulgate needed rules. While the underlying accounting bill will help \nthese staffing problems by providing independent funding, in the short \nterm, FASB cannot possibly perform the mandates of some of the \namendments within the time frames given.\n\n  I hope I have given members some solid reasoning on why Congress \nshould not begin setting accounting standards. Should we really be \ndoing something we do not fully understand? There are already agencies \nto perform this type of rulemaking, and they are the SEC and FASB. They \nare fully aware of the debate surrounding stock options. We don't need \nto mandate FASB to make a new rule. I am certain if FASB deems it \nappropriate, it will be looking at this issue in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the junior Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the final moments, I hope again to \npersuade my colleagues to accept by unanimous consent my amendment \ndealing with corporate bankruptcy. Let me again say what this amendment \nis.\n  It says that during the 12 months preceding a bankruptcy, CEOs who \nhave received stock options, bonuses and other performance-based \npayments shall not be able to keep that kind of compensation. If they \nride a company down to bankruptcy, they know the inside details of that \ncompany and got incentive-based compensation, including stock options, \nthey ought not ride off in the sunset with a pocketful of gold while \nthe employees and investors lose everything they have. That is not the \nright thing. A bankruptcy disgorgement proposal ought to be part of \nthis bill. Everyone in this Chamber knows it should be part of this \nbill. Former SEC Chairman Breeden, a Republican, says it ought to be in \nthis bill. I quoted other CEOs who say it should. Pass this bill \nwithout it and this bill is incomplete.\n  My colleague said he thought maybe the market, which has been so \nvolatile recently, has been frightened by amendments that have been \nconsidered by Congress. I don't think so. I think the market has been \nvolatile, up and down like a yo-yo, because we have story after story \non the news in this country about financial crooks. These are crooks \nwho have cooked the books of their corporations, cheated investors, \npulled the rug out from under their employees, and ruined some good \ncompanies. They did it in broad daylight, under the nose of their \naccounting firms and law firms.\n  It seems to me those CEOs who made millions, in some cases over $100 \nmillion prior to bankruptcy, ought to give that money back. That money \nought to go to help those who lost their live savings and those who \nlost their jobs.\n  We have in this bill a provision that says if there is a restatement \nof earnings, you have to give back some of these incentive-based \ncompensation packages. However, the bill is silent on the issue of \nbankruptcy. What about top executives who ride their company right into \nthe ground and run off with $50 million in their pockets and leave \neveryone else flat on their back? How about asking those executives to \ndisgorge themselves of their ill-gotten gains? How about telling them \nin this legislation that they must give that money back? That is what \nmy amendment would do.\n  I want to talk about the SEC, but I don't have time at the moment. I \nwill save that for another day.\n  This process has been a travesty of the Senate, in my judgment, \nhaving someone as a gatekeeper and preventing us from bringing up \ngermane amendments. It does not make sense. That is not the way the \nSenate is supposed to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the Edwards and Carnahan \namendments so I may offer amendment 4214 on bankruptcy disgorgement.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is, of course, the last chapter on \namendments, and a pretty sad book. I know people will go up to the \ngallery--and I understand someone is at a press conference from the \nother side--claiming credit for this bill. I want to know who wants to \nrun up to the press conference and claim credit for preventing an \namendment that says you must disgorge ill-gotten gains, incentive-based \ncompensation, if you ran a company into bankruptcy. I want somebody to \ngo to the press gallery and take credit for blocking that kind of \nlegislation. Tomorrow I want to read about it. Who takes credit? \nSomeone ought to take credit for blocking an amendment that ought to be \npassed in the Senate by a 100 to zero vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will not get into a debate with the \nSenator. There is nothing ill-gotten in this amendment. This amendment \ndoes not belong in this bill.\n  We have a provision in this bill. If you violate the law, then you \nhave to give back what you have earned from the company in terms of any \nkind of incentive in bonus.\n  But to say that people who work for a company that goes bankrupt has \nto give back compensation is to guarantee that a company that is in \ntrouble would never get anybody to go to work for them. They would \nnever have an opportunity to be saved. That amendment does not belong \nin this bill. It makes no sense in the logic.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will not yield.\n  If you did something wrong, making you give back what you earned \nbelongs in this bill. And it is in this bill. Not only belongs, it is \nhere.\n  But to simply say because somebody worked for a company that goes \nbroke, that they have to give back compensation, that sounds great in \nthe environment we are in, but, look, I have a company, we are in deep \ntrouble, and we try to go out and hire a top-notch person to come in \nand save us, and we pay him a compensation to try to do it. To say we \nwill take it back if he fails, as if that is an ill-gotten gain, I am \nsorry, I don't think that is good economic policy. I don't think it is \nsmart. It has nothing to do with the provisions of this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, perhaps the Senator from Texas would like \na explanation.\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I deeply appreciate the Senator from Maryland yielding.\n  What the Senator from Texas misses is we are talking about incentive-\nbased compensation. Should someone who gets incentives for running the \ncorporation into bankruptcy be able to keep that? I don't think so for \nsomebody that gets a big bonus while he runs the company into \nbankruptcy, or for someone that gets big stock options while she runs \nthe company into bankruptcy.\n  The Senator tried to win a debate we were not having. He says we will \ntake compensation away from someone who is engaged in working for a \ncorporation that went into bankruptcy. No, this is about incentive-\nbased compensation and profits. It is not about taking away their \nsalary. It is about saying if you are paid on an incentive basis and \nyou are running that corporation into bankruptcy, you ought not to be \ngetting the bonus. If you did, you ought to give it back. You ought not \nget stock options; if you did, you ought to give it back.\n  This is simply about something my friend has missed. It is about \nincentive-compensation and the fact that you ought not walk out of a \ncorporation you ran into bankruptcy with a pocketful of gold while you \nleft the employees and the investors flat on their back. This is not an \namendment that is hard to understand.\n  I regret very much it has been blocked. I regret especially we were \nnot allowed to vote on this amendment. That is the travesty, in my \njudgment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think you could debate whether the \namendment is understood or not. I think I understand it perfectly. In \nfact, there are people in this country who are turnaround specialists, \nwho are hired to try to save companies. If somebody did something \nwrong, if they violated the law, then make them give back \ncompensation. You put them to death, if you want to put them to death. \nBut to simply say, if you hire somebody with an incentive package to \nsave the company, and the company goes broke, that you are going to \ntake it back, that is up to the bankruptcy court to decide.\n\n  So this ill-gotten gain business is good rhetoric, but it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with this amendment. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Just 29 seconds remain to the \nSenator from Texas, and 5\\1/2\\ minutes remain to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 5 minutes \nremaining, the Senator from Texas has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Senator from Maryland should have the \nright to end the debate.\n  I think we have two bills: One in the Senate, one in the House. We \ncan come up with a better bill than either. I think America will \nsurvive under either bill. Given the environment we are in, that \nrepresents some achievement, and I am proud of it.\n  I think we will come out of conference with a better bill than the \nHouse bill and a better bill than the Senate bill. I think people will \nbe proud of what we did.\n  If I were an investor today, and I had a lot of money, I would invest \nin the stock market today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Maryland has 4 minutes 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have been trying to clear amendments. \nWe have yesterday--not yesterday, but on Friday we adopted three \namendments on the basis of a unanimous consent request. We have worked \nthrough two additional amendments. I am going to offer them now.\n  One is an amendment by Senator Shelby for a study with respect to \naider and abettor violations of the Federal securities law. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside; that the \nShelby amendment, No. 4261, be called up and modified with a \nmodification that I send to the desk; that the amendment as modified be \nagreed to; and then we then return to the regular order which, as I \nunderstand it, would be the Edwards as modified by the Carnahan \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4261, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) for Mr. Shelby, proposes an \namendment numbered 4261, as modified.\n  The amendment is as follow:\n\n(Purpose: To require the SEC to conduct a study and submit a report to \nthe Congress on aider and abettor violations of the Federal securities \n                                 laws)\n\n       On page 108 after line 15, insert the following:\n       ``(c)(1) The Commission shall conduct a study to determine \n     based upon information for the period from January 1, 1998 to \n     December 31, 2001--\n       ``(A) the number of ``securities professionals,'' which \n     term shall mean public accountants, public accounting firms, \n     investment bankers, investment advisers, brokers, dealers, \n     attorneys, and other securities professionals practicing \n     before the Commission--\n       ``(i) who have been found to have aided and abetted a \n     violation of the Federal securities laws, including rules or \n     regulations promulgated thereunder (hereinafter collectively \n     referred to as ``Federal securities laws''), but who have not \n     been sanctioned, disciplined, or otherwise penalized as a \n     primary violator in any administrative action or civil \n     proceeding, including in any settlement of such actions or \n     proceedings (referred to hereinafter as ``aiders and \n     abettors'') and\n       ``(ii) who have been found to have been primary violators \n     of the Federal securities laws;\n       ``(B) a description of the Federal securities laws \n     violations committed by aiders and abettors and by primary \n     violators, including--\n       ``(i) the specific provisions of the Federal securities \n     laws violated;\n       ``(ii) the specific sanctions and penalties imposed upon, \n     such aiders and abetters and primary violators, including the \n     amount of any monetary penalties assessed upon and collected \n     from such persons;\n       ``(iii) the occurrence of multiple violations by the same \n     person or persons either as an aider or abetter or as a \n     primary violator; and\n       ``(iv) whether as to each such violator disciplinary \n     sanctions have been imposed, including any censure, \n     suspension, temporary bar, or permanent bar to practice \n     before the Commission; and\n       ``(C) the amount of disgorgement, restitution or any other \n     fines or payments the Commission has (i) assessed upon and \n     (ii) collected from aiders and abetters and from primary \n     violators.\n       ``(2) A report based upon the study conducted pursuant to \n     subsection (c)(1) shall be submitted to the Senate Committee \n     on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs no later than six \n     months after the date of enactment of the ``Public Company \n     Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002.''.\n       Page 78 strike lines 15-24 and insert the following:\n       In supervising non-registered public accounting firms and \n     their associated persons, appropriate State regulatory \n     authorities should make an independent determination of the \n     proper standards applicable, particularly taking into \n     consideration the size and nature of the business of the \n     accounting firms they supervise and the size and nature of \n     the business of the clients of those firms. The standards \n     applied by the Board under this Act should not be presumed to \n     be applicable for purposes of this section for small and \n     medium sized nonregistered public accounting firms.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment as modified \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4261), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Was the Ensign amendment also on that amendment?\n  I urge the adoption of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments have been agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in the regular order we are back with \nthe Edwards and Carnahan amendments pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have a couple of minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 1 minute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think the Senate is about to take a \nmajor step to contributing to the restoration of investor confidence.\n  This legislation establishes a strong independent board to oversee \nauditors\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nof the public companies. The board can set standards, investigate, and \ndiscipline accountants. It will be overseen by the SEC, but it will \nhave independent funding and membership. I think this marks the end of \nweak self-regulation with respect to public company auditors.\n  It addresses pervasive conflicts of interest by ensuring auditor \nindependence by restricting them from providing a defined list of \nconsulting services. Other consulting services on the part of the \nauditor can be permitted if preapproved by the company's audit company.\n  This legislation strengthens corporate responsibility. It establishes \nsafeguards to protect investment/analyst conflicts, and it gives the \nSEC expanded staff resources so it has the resources to carry out its \nmandate of protecting investors in this critical time.\n  It is no exaggeration to say the crisis in our markets has put the \nplans and hopes and dreams of millions of Americans at risk. To restore \nmarket integrity on which investor confidence depends, we should move \nexpeditiously to move this legislation into law.\n  I want to express my deep appreciation to my colleagues with whom we \nhave worked for many weeks: To Senator Gramm, the ranking member of the \ncommittee with whom we interact in an interesting and, on occasions, \nexciting fashion; to Senator Enzi, who made a major contribution; to \nSenators Dodd and Corzine on our side of the aisle who played an \nessential role and introduced vital legislation on this issue very \nearly on; to Senator Durbin who also introduced significant legislation \non this subject, and to many other colleagues; and to Senator Reid, who \nhas been extraordinarily helpful here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the 1 minute Senator \nCarnahan has--she is not going to be using it--that it be given to the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has an additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we don't do this work by ourselves. We \nall know that very well. We rely very heavily on dedicated, absolutely \ndedicated staff members. I am going to take the closing time I have to \nsimply read their names into the Record: Dean Shahinian, Steve Kroll, \nLynsey Graham, Vincent Meehan, Sarah Kline, Judy Keenan, Jesse Jacobs, \nAaron Kline, Marty Gruenberg and Steve Harris of the Banking Committee \nstaff; Wayne Abernathy and Linda Lord of Senator Gramm's staff on the \ncommittee. There has also been the staff of the individual Members.\n  I particularly want to acknowledge Mike Thompson and Katherine \nMcGuire of Senator Enzi's staff, and Alex Sternhell and Naomi Camper, \nJon Berger, Jimmy Williams, Catherine Cruz Wojtasik, Leslie Wooley, \nMargaret Simmons, Mat Young, Roger Hollingsworth and Matt Pippin.\n  I express my very deep appreciation. The dedication these staff \nmembers demonstrated over the last few months was just extraordinary: \nLong nights, weekends, day in and day out. I hope very much they will \ntake a measure of satisfaction in the sense that they have made a very \nimportant and significant contribution to better public policy in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 4286\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 94, \nthe nays are 3. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and affirmed \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support the nomination of \nLavenski R. Smith, of Arkansas, to be a U.S. Circuit Judge. I did so as \na member of the Judiciary Committee, and I will do so again on the \nfloor. But I will also support the effort made by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, to advance the long overdue appointment of a \ncommissioner to the expired position on the Federal Elections \nCommission, and in doing so I opposed the cloture motion to bring \ndebate on the Smith nomination to a close. As we have seen, the FEC \ncommissioners have a direct impact on Federal election laws, even to \nthe extent of obstructing the will of Congress. Given the recent \nbehavior of the FEC, it is reasonable for us to take every appropriate \nstep to facilitate the filing of the expired position.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Justice Lavenski \nSmith to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Before I speak directly \nabout him and his nomination, however, I would like to take just a \nmoment to explain where the Senate stands on its job of considering and \nconfirming President Bush's judicial nominees during this Congress.\n  The Senate has not confirmed a single judge since May 13, exactly 9 \nweeks ago today. This is nothing short of irresponsible considering the \nvacancy rates and backlogs around the country.\n  There were 31 vacancies in the Federal courts of appeals when \nPresident Bush sent us his first 11 circuit nominees on May 9, 2001, \nand there are 31 today. We are barely keeping pace with the rate of \nattrition.\n  The Sixth Circuit is half-staffed with 8 of its 16 seats vacant. The \nDC. Circuit is two-thirds staffed, with 4 of its 12 seats sitting \nvacant. Meanwhile, seven of President Bush's first 11 nominees have not \neven been scheduled for hearings--despite having been pending for 432 \ndays as of today. A total of 23 circuit court nominations now sit \npending for those 31 vacancies. But we have confirmed only 3 circuit \njudges this year, and only 9 since President Bush took office.\n  It is bad enough that the Judiciary Committee has been slow to even \nbegin the process of consideration by scheduling hearings. It is even \nworse that the Democrat leadership can't do what is necessary to move \nthe 17 judges that are still pending for a floor vote. Of course, I \napplaud the leadership for bringing Lavenski Smith to a vote, but I \nthink everyone has to admit that 1 out of 17 is, at most, a low start. \nMany of my colleagues have noted with displeasure the Judiciary \nCommittee's wholesale slow-walking of President Bush's nominees, but \nnow I must bring some attention to the Senate leadership's role as \nwell. It is high time for them to demonstrate their leadership, and \ntheir control of the floor, by setting votes on the rest of the 16 \njudicial nominees who are awaiting a final vote.\n\n  Mr. President, let me put the current situation into context. \nHistorically, a President can count on seeing all of his first 11 \ncircuit court nominees confirmed. Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nall enjoyed a 100 percent confirmation rate on their first 11 circuit \ncourt nominees. In stark contrast, 7 of President Bush's first 11 \nnominations are still pending without a hearing for over 1 whole year.\n  History also shows that Presidents can expect almost all of their \nfirst 100 nominees to be confirmed swiftly. Presidents Reagan, Bush and \nClinton got 97, 95 and 97, respectively, of their first 100 judicial \nnominations confirmed. But the Senate has confirmed only 57 of \nPresident Bush's first 100 nominees.\n  Some try to blame Republicans for the current vacancy crisis. That is \nbunk. In fact, the number of judicial vacancies decreased by 3 during \nthe 6 years of Republican leadership. There were 70 vacancies when I \nbecame chairman of the Judiciary Committee in January 1995, and there \nwere 67 at the close of the 106th Congress in December 2000.\n  Now I know that some try to justify the current wholesale delay as \npayback for the past. That is just a sleight of hand. Look at the \nfacts: During President Clinton's 8 years in office, the Senate \nconfirmed 377 judges--essentially the same, 5 fewer as for Reagan, 382. \nThis is an unassailable record of non-partisan fairness, especially \nwhen you consider that President Reagan had 6 years of a Senate \ncontrolled by his own party, while President Clinton had only 2. \nFurthermore, almost 50 percent of all Federal judges currently serving \nare Clinton judges.\n  Finally, some suggest that the Republicans left an undue number of \nnominees pending in committee without hearings at the end of the \nClinton administration. Well, we left 41, which is 13 less that the \nDemocrats left without hearings in 1992 at the end of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, the President's nominees deserve better; President \nBush deserves better; and most importantly, the American people--the \npeople who own this Government and who rely on the judicial branch for \ntheir rights and freedoms--deserve much better.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to turn to the matter directly at \nhand, the confirmation of Lavenski Smith to the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Justice Smith is a highly qualified jurist who has \ndistinguished himself through his service to the poor, his service in \nthe public sector, and his service on the State bench. His \nexperience includes working for legal services, running his own law \nfirm, serving with distinction on the Arkansas Supreme Court, and \nholding his current position on the Arkansas Public Service Commission.\n\n  Justice Smith began his legal career at Ozark Legal Services in \nFayetteville, AR, specializing in consumer defense and the \nrepresentation of juveniles as a guardian ad litem. He worked with \nthose who are traditionally underrepresented: low-income individuals, \nfamilies, and children. After 4 years, he\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nopened his own law firm in the Arkansas town of Springdale, where he \nhandled all sorts of cases, including business law, real estate, \ndomestic relations, worker's compensation, public benefits, and \nestates. Notably, his firm was the first minority-owned firm in the \nhistory of the town.\n  Justice Smith's excellence as a lawyer and his commitment to public \nservice did not go unnoticed: in 1999 Governor Huckabee appointed \nJustice Smith to the Arkansas Supreme Court. During his tenure on the \nbench, Justice Smith wrote opinions on a range of legal issues, \nincluding criminal, tort, worker's compensation, insurance, contract, \ncivil procedure, oil and gas, tax, probate and attorney discipline \nmatters.\n  Currently, Justice Smith serves on the Arkansas Public Service \nCommission, which is responsible for regulating the State's electric, \ngas, and telecommunications industries. In this position, Justice Smith \nhas become an expert in understanding and interpreting a wide variety \nof complex Federal regulations, including the Federal Power Act and the \nFederal Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  Chief Justice Arnold of the Arkansas Supreme Court, Justice Smith's \nformer colleague, praises his intelligence and the quality of his \nservice on the court, saying, ``I think he'll make a great Federal \njudge.'' Justice Smith has wide, bipartisan support in his home State, \nbut I think the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette summed it up well: It said \nthat Justice Smith possesses ``integrity, intelligence, and \ncompassion.'' I agree, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this qualified candidate for the Eighth Circuit. I think \nthat each of us can be proud about voting for the first African-\nAmerican Arkansan to serve on a circuit court of appeals.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, ``Lavenski Smith is a young Arkansas \npolitical appointee, who has had a total of 7 years experience \npracticing law, has had minimal Federal experience, minimal appellate \nexperience, and no experience at all arguing in front of the Federal \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to which he has been nominated. \nHe is nominated to the judgeship held by Judge Richard Arnold, one of \nthe most distinguished judges ever to serve on the 8th Circuit.\n  Mr. Smith served a brief term on the Arkansas Supreme Court, after \nbeing appointed by the Governor and before running for election to a \nlower State court judicial vacancy and losing. He also spent several \nyears as the volunteer executive director of the Arkansas chapter of \nthe Rutherford Institute, an organization devoted to, among other \nthings, doing away with a woman's constitutional right to choose, and \nsupporting efforts against Governor, and then President, Bill \nClinton.''\n  The following is what the Arkansas Times had to say about Mr. Smith's \nqualifications:\n\n       Lavenski Smith of Little Rock is not the best-qualified \n     Arkansan President Bush could have chosen for the U.S. 8th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, nor even close. Marginally \n     acceptable, if that, Smith was nominated by Bush, on the \n     recommendation of Senator Tim Hutchinson, because Smith is \n     racially, ideologically and politically correct--a black \n     conservative Republican, avidly anti-abortion and anti-\n     Clinton, whose nomination will, it is hoped, aid Hutchinson's \n     re-election effort. Not much there to suggest a distinguished \n     judicial career. Still, there are worse things than \n     mediocrity, and Bush has nominated them, too.\n\n  It is difficult to vote in favor of a nominee to a lifetime \nappointment on a Federal appellate court with this kind of record, but \nhe is supported by both of his home-State Senators. Senator Blanche \nLincoln worked hard to be sure that Mr. Smith was included in a hearing \nearlier this year and she supports his nomination. Based on Senator \nLincoln's confidence in this nominee's ability to do the job and based \non the nominee's assurances that he will not seek to impose his \npersonal views in his legal decisions, I have reluctantly decided to \nvote in favor of this nomination.\n  Smith seems like an honorable person, and despite his political views \nand political activism, I am hopeful that he will be a person of his \nword: that he will follow the law and not seek out opportunities to \noverturn precedent or decide cases in accord with his private beliefs \nrather than his obligations as a judge.\n  This is one of 17 nominations that have been reported by the \nJudiciary Committee to the Senate but were stalled for the last 2 \nmonths. In addition, nearly two dozen Executive Branch nominees \nreported by the Judiciary Committee are also awaiting action.\n  The delay in final Senate action on these nominees has been due to \nthe failure of the administration to fulfill its responsibility to work \nwith the Senate in the naming of members of bipartisan boards and \ncommissions. Last week I congratulated the majority leader for \novercoming this impediment and for his patience and determination in \nachieving some movement on these matters.\n  I understand that he hopes to be able to resume voting on judicial \nnominations once cloture is achieved on the Smith nomination today.\n  Democrats are taking extraordinary efforts to overcome impediments to \naction on nominations. Had the administration not caused this delay, \nand had Republican Senators not placed ``holds'' over the last several \nmonths, I am confident that the Senate would have confirmed more than \n70 judicial nominees by now.\n  We were able to overcome the other obstacles created by the \nadministration and proceed to confirm 57 judicial nominees in our first \n10 months in the majority, a record outpacing any Republican total in \nany 10-month period in which they held the majority.\n  We have also addressed long-standing vacancies on circuit courts \ncaused by Republican obstruction of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. We held the first hearing for a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 \nyears, the first hearings for Sixth Circuit nominees in almost 5 years, \nthe first hearing for a Tenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, and the first \nhearings for Fourth Circuit nominees in 3 years.\n  We have reformed the process for considering judicial nominees.\n  For example, we have ended the practice of anonymous holds that \nplagued the period of Republican control, when any Republican Senator \ncould hold any nominee from his home State, his own circuit or any part \nof the country for any reason, or no reason, without any \naccountability. We have returned to the Democratic tradition of holding \nregular hearings, every few weeks, rather than going for months without \na single hearing.\n  With a positive vote on the nomination of Lavenski Smith, the Senate \nwill have confirmed its 10th Court of Appeals nominee of President Bush \nsince the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee a year ago, \non July 10, 2001. During their recent 6\\1/2\\ years of majority control, \nRepublicans averaged seven Court of Appeals confirmations a year.\n  The Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has had a record-breaking \nfirst year fairly and promptly considering President Bush's nominees, \nwhich I detailed last Friday. For example, in 1 year, we have held \nhearings for 78 of the President's nominees.\n  That is more hearings for this President's district and circuit court \nnominees than in 20 of the past 22 years.\n  Under Democratic leadership, the Senate confirmed more circuit and \ndistrict court judges, 57, than were confirmed during all 12 months in \neach of 2000, 1999, 1997, 1996, and 1995, 5 of the prior 6 years of \nRepublican control of the Senate. The Judiciary Committee has since \nlast July voted on 15 circuit court nominees. In our first year, we \nheld more hearings for more of President Bush's circuit court nominees \nthan in the first year of any of the past three Presidents.\n  More of President Bush's nominees have also been given committee \nvotes than in the first year of any of the past three Presidents.\n  Unfortunately, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial nominees--\nmore than 50--never got a committee hearing and committee vote from the \nRepublican majority, which perpetuated longstanding vacancies into this \nyear. If the Republicans had not left more than 50 of President \nClinton's nominees without a hearing or a vote, the current number of \nvacancies might be closer to 40 than 90.\n  In addition, large numbers of vacancies continue to exist on many \nCourts\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nof Appeals, in large measure because the recent Republican majority was \nnot willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's Courts of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was \nnot willing to confirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during \nthe entire 1996 session.\n  From the time the Republicans took over majority control of the \nSenate in 1995 until the reorganization of the Committee last July, \ncircuit vacancies increased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  Democrats have broken with that recent history of inaction. During \nour first year in control of the Judiciary Committee, we held 16 \nhearings for circuit court nominees. That is almost the same number of \ncircuit court nominees, 17, who were never given a Committee vote by \nRepublicans in 2000.\n  Democrats are working hard to reduce judicial vacancies and we have \nmoved quickly on these nominees, as well as many, many others. I have \nnoted that we could have been even more productive with a little \ncooperation from the White House, but that has not been forthcoming.\n  Moreover, of the current vacancies, more than half do not have a \nnominee. We are almost out of district court nominees ready to be \nincluded at hearings, because the President has been so slow to \nnominate district court nominees and insists on delaying the ABA peer \nreview process until after the nominations are made.\n  Today's vote on the nomination of Lavenski Smith to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is the third Eighth Circuit \nnominee the committee has considered in the past year. This is in sharp \ncontrast to the treatment of Eighth Circuit nominee Bonnie Campbell by \nRepublicans.\n  Ms. Campbell is now a partner at the distinguished Washington law \nfirm of Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin & Kahn, where she acts as an adviser, \nnegotiator, advocate, and litigator, representing employers in \npersonnel, labor relations, employment discrimination, benefits, and \nother employment-related matters. A graduate of Drake University and \nDrake's law school, Ms. Campbell has an outstanding record of public \nservice.\n  She was nominated by President Clinton early in 2000 to serve on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n  She was supported by both of her Senators, Democrat Tom Harkin and \nRepublican Chuck Grassley, given a ``Qualified'' rating by the ABA, and \nafforded a hearing before the Judiciary Committee a few months later, \nin May of 2000. However, despite a noncontroversial hearing, Ms. \nCampbell was never scheduled for a committee vote. No explanation for \nthis failure to give her a vote was ever given, and her nomination was \neventually returned at the end of the 106th Congress. Other individuals \nnominated after Ms. Campbell were given committee hearings and votes \nand were confirmed later that year, while Ms. Campbell's nomination \nlanguished.\n  She seems to have been the victim of the Republican practice of \nanonymous, indefinite holds. In January of 2001, President Clinton re-\nnominated Ms. Campbell, but President Bush failed to seize the \nopportunity for bipartisanship, and withdrew her nomination shortly \nthereafter.\n  At the time of her nomination Ms. Campbell was nearing the end of a \ndistinguished term at the U.S. Department of Justice, where she served \nas Director of the Violence Against Women Office, a position to which \nshe was appointed by President Clinton in 1995.\n  In that capacity, she oversaw a $1.6 billion program to provide \nfunding to States to strengthen their efforts in the areas of domestic \nviolence and sexual abuse. She also directed the Federal Government's \nefforts to implement the new criminal statutes created by the 1994 \nViolence Against Women Act. Ms. Campbell oversaw the Justice \nDepartment's efforts to combine tough new Federal criminal laws with \nassistance to states and localities to fight against violence against \nwomen.\n  Bonnie Campbell had, before coming to Washington, served as the \nAttorney General of Iowa, the first woman ever elected to that \nposition. During her tenure in office, she was instrumental in pushing \nthe State legislature to strengthen Iowa's domestic abuse statute, and \nin 1992 she authored one of the Nation's first anti-stalking laws. In \n1997 Bonnie Campbell was named by Time magazine as one of the 25 most \ninfluential people in America.\n  Ms. Campbell's record of distinguished public service and her \nexperience in private practice combined to make an excellent nominee to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a fact with which both of \nher Senators obviously agreed. Yet once afforded a hearing, Bonnie \nCampbell was left to linger in an indefensible limbo. She was not \ngranted a committee vote, but neither was she confronted with any \nobjections to her nomination to the Eighth Circuit proceeding.\n  Contrasting the treatment of the nominations of Bonnie Campbell and \nLavenski Smith to the Eighth Circuit evidences the difference in how \nthe Republican majority and the current Democratic majority have \nhandled judicial nominations and highlights the fairness that has been \nrestored to the confirmation process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6796-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6796-S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will return to legislative session.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Lavenski R. Smith, of Arkansas, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Eighth Circuit?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Judge Lavenski \nSmith who has been confirmed this evening for the eighth circuit court \nof appeals. This is a great evening for him and his family. He is going \nto be a great jurist. I congratulate Judge Smith tonight.\n  I thank President Bush for making an excellent choice, a choice that \nI think Arkansas can feel good about, the Eighth Circuit can feel good \nabout, and, indeed, the country can feel good about. Judge Smith is an \nexcellent choice. He is the first African American to represent the \nState of Arkansas in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. He will do so \nwith great distinction.\n  I will speak, very briefly, about his career. But the hallmark of \nJudge Smith's entire career has been one of service. It has been a \nstorybook tale.\n  He is a native of Hope, AR. He earned both his bachelor's degree and \nhis law degree from the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He \nworked his way through college. Following law school, he clerked for 3 \nyears, and then he served the poorest citizens of Arkansas as the staff \nattorney for Ozark Legal Services, representing abused and neglected \nchildren.\n  After working with Ozark Legal Services, he opened the first \nminority-owned firm in Springdale, AR, handling primarily civil cases. \nHe then taught business law at John Brown University and took several \npositions in public service, including Regulatory Liaison for Governor \nHuckabee. Currently Judge Smith serves as the commissioner of the \nArkansas Public Service Commission.\n  In 1999, he was appointed to the Arkansas supreme court and served on \nthe Arkansas supreme court with distinction for 2 years. As a supreme \ncourt justice, he presided over hundreds of cases and authored several \ndozen majority opinions. He was highly praised by all his colleagues in \nthe Arkansas supreme court.\n  In June of 2001, the American Bar Association reviewed Justice \nSmith's qualifications and made a ``unanimous qualified'' \ndetermination.\n  Beyond all of his obvious legal qualifications, I want to point out \nthat he has had a long history of community service. Whether it was as \na board member of the Northwest Arkansas Christian Justice Center, a \nnonprofit organization dedicated to providing mediation and \nconciliation services, working with the Partners for Family Training, a \ngroup that recruits and trains foster parents, or whether it was \nraising funds for the School of Hope, a school for handicapped children \nin Hope, AR, at every stage of his life there has been this hallmark of \nservice.\n  This outstanding record of service is the most outwardly visible sign \nof something the people in Arkansas know well; that he is a good and \nhonorable man who will serve his country well. We can all be proud of \nthe vote that occurred this evening.\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\n  It is a storybook tale, but it is a storybook tale that has not yet \nhad the last chapters written. There are going to be a lot of wonderful \nchapters in the years ahead as he, as a young man, has a long time to \nserve on the Federal bench.\n  It will be a wonderful culmination to what has already been a great \nstory and a great career. I stand with Arkansas this evening in pride.\n  I thank Senator Blanche Lincoln for her cooperation, for her support, \nand all that she has done over the last year to make tonight's vote \npossible.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for \nthose kind words.\n  I rise to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues tonight for \ntheir support of the cloture motion before the Senate this evening of \nthe nomination of Judge Lavinski Smith of Arkansas to fill a vacancy on \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I am certainly pleased that the majority leader has taken a step \nwhich demonstrates a commitment of the Democratic leadership in the \nSenate to move the nomination process forward and to fulfill our \nobligation under the Constitution.\n  As one of those who signed the cloture motion to bring forward Judge \nSmith's nomination, I am proud of my colleagues for joining in with an \nexcellent vote in supporting this fine Arkansan to the bench.\n  I want to say a special thanks to the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his hard work over the last year to reduce the number of \njudicial vacancies which will ensure our Federal courts can operate \nefficiently. He has tirelessly worked in the Judiciary Committee to be \nfair and to be expeditious.\n  There has certainly been a good deal of heated debate surrounding the \npace of judicial confirmations in recent months. However, I can say \nfrom personal experience that the chairman has been highly responsive \nto my inquiries regarding this nomination. I am grateful for his \nefforts and those of the committee staff in trying to move the process \nforward expeditiously and fairly.\n  I also thank my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, for his \nwork in this arena.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who are not familiar with Judge \nSmith, I am pleased to offer a few words of introduction.\n  As my colleague from Arkansas mentioned, Lavinski Smith is a lifelong \nresident of Hope, Arkansas, as many people from Arkansas have been \nrecognized being from Hope. After graduating from high school, Judge \nSmith moved north to Fayetteville, where he received both his BA and JD \nfrom the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.\n  Since that time, Judge Smith has enjoyed an impressive career as a \npracticing attorney, as my colleague mentioned, with great service \nthrough the legal services to the indigent, a State supreme court \njudge, a professor, and, most recently, a member of the Arkansas Public \nService Commission.\n  This would be an impressive list of accomplishments for anyone, but \nat the age of 43, Judge Smith's record is a good indication that he has \nmany years of productive service in his future.\n  Since President Bush announced the appointment of Judge Smith last \nyear, I have heard from dozens of Arkansans from across the political \nspectrum who support his nomination. In fact, my support for Judge \nSmith's nomination is based in large part on the enthusiastic \nendorsement he has received from those who know him the best: his \ncolleagues and friends who have firsthand knowledge of his professional \nand personal attributes, those who have worked with him in the legal \nfield who have sent their recommendations to me.\n  Those who have indicated strong support for Judge Smith in Arkansas \ninclude Arkansas supreme court chief justice ``Dub'' Arnold and \nArkansas NAACP president Dale Charles. In addition, I believe it is \nimportant to note that Judge Smith received a unanimous ``qualified'' \nrating for this position by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary.\n  Even though Judge Smith and I may not agree on every issue, that is \nnot the test I apply to determine an individual's fitness for the \nFederal judiciary. I evaluate judicial nominees based on skill, \nexperience, and ability to understand and apply established precedent, \nnot on any one particular point of view a nominee may hold. \nFundamentally, I am interested in knowing that a nominee can fulfill \nhis responsibility under the Constitution in a court of law.\n  I am satisfied that Judge Smith has met that standard, and I, \ntherefore, thank my colleagues for supporting his nomination and the \ncloture motion to move that forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Passage of S. 2673\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank all of my colleagues for the tremendous work \ndone in the past week. I especially compliment the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for the \nextraordinary leadership he has shown in getting us to this point. I am \nsure there were few who have ever guessed this could have passed so \noverwhelmingly as it did tonight.\n  That is the accounting legislation. I am very grateful to all who had \na significant role to play. I thank the staff of the Banking Committee \nand so many of my colleagues. I also acknowledge the fine work done by \nSenator Leahy on the enforcement aspects of this legislation.\n  The combination of the contribution made by the Judiciary Committee, \nalong with the Banking Committee, makes this a historic moment for the \nSenate, a historic moment for corporate governance, and a real \nrecognition that at long last we are going to be rebuilding the \nconfidence and trust we need in our free enterprise system.\n  We made a contribution in that regard today. I am very hopeful we can \nget this work done very soon.\n  It would be my hope, given the President's support for the Sarbanes \nbill, and Speaker Hastert's support, as he indicated just last week, \nthat the House consider taking up the Sarbanes bill and passing it \nfree-standing so we could send it directly to the President in time to \nafford the President the opportunity to sign it very quickly. That \nwould be the quickest way, and given the broad bipartisan support this \nlegislation now enjoys, and given Speaker Hastert's support for the \nlegislation, I would think this would be a tremendous opportunity to \ndemonstrate in a bipartisan way how quickly we can respond as we did \ntoday. But more than how quickly, how effectively we can respond to the \nneeds of our Nation when it comes to restoring that confidence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6797-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6797-S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001--Motion To \n                                Proceed\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Having disposed of the banking legislation, it is now \nour intent to turn to the whole issue of prescription drugs. We will \ndeal with both cost containment as well as Medicare benefits. The bill \npassed out of the Labor Committee, S. 812, Calendar No. 491, will be \nthe vehicle for our debate.\n  It is my intention now to ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 491, S. 812, to provide greater \naccess to affordable pharmaceuticals at 10:30 a.m., Tuesday, July 16.\n  Mr. GREGG. This bill was reported out of the committee on which I am \nranking member. At the time it was reported out, which was last \nThursday--so it has been a very quick turnaround and no report has been \nfiled on the bill--there was an understanding within the committee that \nthere would be two issues resolved before it came to the floor. One \ninvolved bioequivalency and the other involved the 45-day rule.\n  There are other issues with the bill. There are other issues which \nmay require further work, but those two issues need to be resolved \nbefore this bill comes to the floor. As I believe was the understanding \nwhen the bill was passed out of committee, it would be passed with \nthose being resolved before it got to the floor.\n  I understand it is being moved to the floor quickly to be the vehicle \naddressing the other issues involved in drug coverage.\n  The bill itself has some very strong points in it; I have drafted a \nfair amount of it so I recognize that. But at this time I have to \nobject to the motion to proceed.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in regard to the language to which the \nSenator has referred on the question of the bioequivalence, a whole new \nsection was added, subsection (C) of section 7, dealing with \nbioequivalency. It was sent out to the good Senator on Thursday \nevening.\n  We had indicated if we did not hear back from the Senator or his \nstaff, we would assume that language reflected what was discussed in \nthe course of the markup. We had similar kinds of clarifications with \nregard to certain procedures and filings.\n  As far as we are concerned, at least on our side, these particular \nprovisions have been dealt with in the legislation and we are prepared \nto move ahead with the consideration.\n  This is extraordinarily important legislation. It relates to not only \nthe quality of prescription drugs but accessibility and affordability \nof prescription drugs. We are seeing today the significant abuses of \nthe Hatch-Waxman legislation. If we were able to just go back to the \nfull intent of Hatch-Waxman, conforming with that, this legislation \nwould not be necessary. But it is necessary.\n  The best estimate is it would save consumers $71 billion over the \nperiod of 10 years. It is very important. We ought to be about it. I \nhope we can get to the legislation and start debating it.\n  We had a strong bipartisan vote in the committee, and we are ready to \ngo and consider amendments. If there is further clarification that is \nnecessary, we are glad to consider it, but I regret very much we are \ngoing to have to delay legislation which is as important as this to our \nseniors as well as to other Americans who believe they need to be able \nto get fairness in the consideration of generic drugs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think I retain the floor. I will be happy to yield to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. That is why I was asking.\n  The question is this--rhetorical in nature. Unfortunately, in order \nto reach an agreement, you have to have both sides agree. Senator \nFrist, who is concerned about the bioequivalency, has not agreed to the \nlanguage. I have not agreed to the 45-day language. I am sure it could \nbe worked out, and worked out rather promptly, so we would not have to \ngo through the exercise of delaying this bill, and I would be happy to \ndo that. But until we have worked out that issue, I have to reserve my \nrights and object to the proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, obviously, I am disappointed. I looked at \nthe vote. I think it was 16 to 5--similar in magnitude, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to the Sarbanes bill that passed out of the Banking Committee. \nWe ended up with a unanimous vote on the floor.\n  I hope we can get the same kind of unanimity ultimately on this \nlegislation. But a 16-to-5 vote would seem to me to indicate very \nstrong bipartisan support for this legislation as well. Senators are \nwelcome to offer amendments. We oftentimes negotiate issues on the \nfloor and accommodate Senators' concerns, both in the managers' \namendment as well as in individual votes. So we will certainly have \nthat opportunity once again.\n  I have no doubt if there is an interest in resolving these \noutstanding questions, we ought to be able to do so. But we do need to \nmove on. That was my hope, that we could lay the bill down and begin \nthe debate and have these discussions.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no choice, of course, but to move \nto proceed to Calendar No. 491. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion \n     to proceed to Calendar No. 491, S. 812, the Greater Access to \n     Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2001:\n         Senators Harry Reid, Jon Corzine, Byron L. Dorgan, Ron \n           Wyden, Maria Cantwell, Paul Sarbanes, Debbie Stabenow, \n           Dick Durbin, Thomas Carper, Tom Daschle, Jack Reed, \n           Daniel K. Akaka, Kent Conrad, Zell Miller, Charles \n           Schumer, Ernest Hollings, and Hillary Clinton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLincoln and Hutchinson have the opportunity to speak for up to 8 \nminutes each with respect to the Smith nomination, to appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will include in this part of the Record \nthe sections relating to the bioequivalence. It is on page 53. The \neffect of the section is:\n  This section shall not be construed to alter the authority of the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to regulate biological products \nunder the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act. Any such authority shall be \nexercised under that Act as in effect on the day before the day of \nenactment of this Act.\n  Effectively, we are restating the current law.\n  I will also have printed in the Record the language which was \nquestioned earlier--I think an explanation and how it conforms with \nwhat we had agreed to in terms of the exchange.\n  If it is necessary, we will be glad to work with our friends and \ncolleagues on the other side during the remainder of the evening and \ncertainly tomorrow to try to find out, if this language is not \nsatisfactory, what language would be satisfactory.\n  We did have areas of differences, but not with regard to these two \nparticular provisions. There was an agreement on it. It was just trying \nto find the appropriate language which would reflect the opinion of the \ncommittee. We believed we had done so, and we are glad to work with our \ncolleagues on the other side. If that is not the case, we are glad to \nmake those adjustments and changes so we can begin the debate on this \nextremely important piece of legislation.\n  We recognized when this was introduced--and I give great respect to \nmy friends and colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, for \ndeveloping the basic legislation which was the core of the debate we \nhad in our committee--it was modified to try to respond to some of \nthose who had some concerns. We had Senator Edwards and Senator Collins \nin a bipartisan way develop an approach which had strong bipartisan \nsupport. We had good discussion and debate in our committee on this \nmatter and a strong committee outcome.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. It is one which deals, \nnot so much with the availability and the accessability of drugs but as \nto the question of whether they are going to be reasonably affordable \nalternatives to brand name drugs and whether we are going to follow the \nagreement that was made at the time of the Hatch-Waxman legislation, \nwhich was enacted, which really was based upon the idea that we would \nhave new breakthrough drugs rather than rehashing of older drugs.\n  What we have seen is in recent times those who have the patents are \nusing the Hatch-Waxman legislation in ways that work to the significant \ndisadvantage of the consumers in this country. It is to change those \nabuses that this legislation has been developed. It is very important. \nWe will continue to work with our colleagues to try to clarify any of \nthe language that needs to be clarified. We look forward to the debate \nat the earliest possible time.\n  I thank the majority leader for giving the attention and priority \nthat he has to this legislation. I think for most of us, as we travel \naround to our constituencies, we find the availability, the \naccessibility, and the cost of prescription drugs are on the minds of \njust about every family in this country.\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\nYou don't have to be sick, although that is certainly something that \nevery person who is ill understands very well. But it is the total \nfamily. So much of the challenge and the burden of health care costs \ngoes to all the members of the family.\n  As we are particularly in the period of what I consider to be the \nlife-science century where we have enormous opportunities for major \nbreakthroughs and extraordinary kinds of positive impact on the lives \nof people in this country, we must make sure these prescription drugs \nand the generics are going to be available and accessible. The faster \nthat we have a chance to engage in this debate and pass this \nlegislation, the better the health of the American people is going to \nbe.\n  I note on the floor the prime sponsor, the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer. He has probably heard that there was objection to taking up \nthis legislation because of certain language clarifications. We \nreviewed and put in the Record clarifications which, quite frankly, \nconform to the issues that were raised. They are not areas of \ndifference but areas of clarification. We sent those to our colleagues \nlast Thursday night indicating that we understand they would be \nsatisfactory unless we heard back. We did not hear back until just \nminutes ago.\n  We want to work with our colleagues. We certainly invite the Senator \nwho has been such a driving force on this issue. We hope that overnight \nand certainly in the early morning we could have a clarification which \nwould remove the reasons for not proceeding; that at some time tomorrow \nwe could begin the debate in full and move ahead to considering this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts who has been \nsuch a great leader on this issue. I guess, as I understand it, our \nfriend from New Hampshire has objected to moving forward.\n  We have spent a very long time talking about this issue--of course \nthe issue of availability of drugs, and of course the issue of the cost \nof drugs but even the specifics of the generic drugs.\n  We had extensive hearings on this bill 10 weeks ago or 8 weeks ago. \nThere has been a great deal of discussion. This is not a last minute \nsomething that someone wrote on the back of an envelope and said here, \ntake it. There has been tremendous discussion on this issue. There are \ndifferences of opinion. That is fair. That is legitimate. That is why \nwe have a Senate.\n  But to prevent the bill from moving forward when the cost of drugs \ngoes through the roof, when the people are clamoring for us to bring \ndown those costs, and when there is a proposal that passed in a very \nbipartisan way in Senator Kennedy's committee, it just strikes me as \nmissing the forest for the trees--the forest being the great need to do \nsomething and the trees being the details that we should be debating on \nthe floor in open debate.\n  I will just say to my colleague that I am as disappointed as he is--\nmaybe not quite as disappointed; nobody works harder than he does on \nbringing these issues to the floor, but almost as much.\n  Is this something that is brand new? Where do these objections come \nfrom? These are issues that we have discussed and agreed on. It is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from New Hampshire simply didn't have \nthe votes when he decided not to bring forward his amendments when the \ncommittee marked up.\n  Is that a correct or an unfair characterization?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The reason the Senator objects is in behalf of the \nSenator from Tennessee who wanted clarification in terms of the ability \nof the FDA to regulate biological products. We have included a new \nsection on page 52. This section shall not be construed to alter the \nauthority of the Secretary to regulate biological products under the \nFDA act. So we added that just for clarification.\n\n  It is difficult for me to understand why that doesn't work.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will in just a moment.\n  Then there was another question with regard to the timing and \nprocedures to be able to bring civil action. We added on page 35 a new \nsection for the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we don't have a difference. We would be glad \nto work through the evening, if we had the opportunity to proceed to \nthis on tomorrow.\n  If this language isn't clear--we are not facing a difference on it. \nWhat I am troubled by is the fact that there is objection to moving to \nthe legislation and moving to it in a timely way when it is legislation \nwhich is of such importance and relevance to every family in this \ncountry.\n  I see my friend from Michigan on the floor, but I will yield to the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask the Senator from Massachusetts. I pose the \nquestion because as a member of the committee and someone who was very \nglad to join in a positive way the bipartisan vote for the legislation, \nit was my clear understanding as we came to that decisive vote that a \npoint was reached in working out the two outstanding issues which \nSenator Gregg mentioned in his objection. There is no desire on \nanybody's part to slow this legislation down. But it was with the \nunderstanding that there would be that agreement.\n  While it seems the issues are relatively minor and that it can be \ndone in a very expeditious way, the fact is that Senator Frist and \nSenator Gregg have not yet signed off on that language.\n  So I can't stand here and listen to my colleague being characterized \nas obstructing the progress of this legislation when in fact they want \nto honor the agreement that was made at the time that bipartisan vote \ntook place.\n  I ask the chairman if that is his recollection of the vote that \noccurred.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No. The Senator has not understood correctly. I will \nstand by the record. There was never a conditioning of reporting this \nout for an agreement. I have been either chairman or ranking member for \nsome period of time. I know those words are stated. But there was never \na conditioning of reporting out based upon getting agreement. I would \nnot have accepted that. This is too important. There was not a \ndifference.\n  You will find that the language we have included with regard to \nbiologics basically is a restatement of what Senator Frist said. If it \nisn't, I am glad to make that kind of adjustment. What we did say--as \nwe say in virtually the passage of all legislation--is that we will \nauthorize technical corrections to be made by the staff.\n  If you have an agreement in principle, you do not have a difference. \nWe have an agreement in principle.\n  If this language isn't carried forward--and it is language which I \nbelieve should be--give us the language, and we will work on it \ntonight. But I think to delay something that is as important as this is \nnot justified. This subject matter is too important to families in my \nState, as I am sure it is in Arkansas. That is why I am surprised the \nSenator from Arkansas is standing with the Senator from New Hampshire \nand urging delay of this legislation, because it is of such importance. \nI welcome the fact that he supported it, but we want to get on with \nthis legislation. And I think the sooner we can get on it, the better.\n  If the Senator wants to work with us and be the agent for the other \nSenators and work through the evening, we would welcome his \nintervention in doing that because we want to get on it.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Michigan. Then I would \nbe glad to yield the floor and let the Senator speak.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank you the Senator.\n  First, I commend our chairman, Senator Kennedy, for his work in \nbringing this important bill to the floor. I also commend Senator \nSchumer for his leadership.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, it is my understanding the \nleader, because of the importance of the issue of not only lowering \ndrug prices for everyone but providing Medicare coverage for \nprescription drugs, has actually allocated up to 2 weeks on this \nsubject. I would assume we would have ample opportunity to work out any \nissues and problems that colleagues would have on the other side of the \naisle.\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\n  But the clock is ticking on the 2 weeks. The sooner we can get to the \nbill, the sooner we can begin to move through a number of different \namendments to be able to get this bill in good shape, to be able to \ndeal with a number of issues, such as those that deal with increasing \ncompetition and providing Medicare coverage, and so on.\n  This is so critical that our leader has, in fact, allocated 2 weeks. \nSo I am very surprised that our colleague from New Hampshire would stop \neven the beginning of the debate when he knows that it is not a 1-day \ndebate. We are talking about having 2 weeks and as many hours as it \ntakes in that time to be able to work out all of the kinks and to be \nable to get it right.\n  I know, coming from Michigan today, working and being in Battle Creek \nat a senior center and in Kalamazoo at a senior center, that they are \nwatching us very closely. We have had a lot of talk, and if talk bought \nmedicine, people would have a lot of medicine.\n  It is time to act. I commend the chairman of the committee for \nacting. I am looking forward to working with him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield the floor in just a moment. \nI want to be very clear on the Record; that is, that the language was \nprovided both to Senator Frist and Senator Gregg on Thursday afternoon \nat around 4:15. The first I have heard there was objection to it was 5 \nminutes before the majority leader's request. I did not hear any \nobjection to it Friday. There was not any objection to it Saturday. \nThere had been no objection to it today, Monday.\n  It seems to me that if there are objections to it, we ought to be \nable to clarify the language and move forward it. If people have \nobjections to this legislation, let's hear it. Let's debate it.\n  I pay special tribute to Senator Schumer and Senator McCain. Seniors \nhave been paying too high a price for too long. This is going to make a \ndifference. We have delayed too long in addressing this issue.\n  So I indicate that we are prepared to work on the language over the \nevening or tomorrow. But we believe we ought to get about the business \nof dealing with this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  First, a specific point. One of the objections was on the language \nfor what we call bioequivalence. In other words, what makes the drug \nthe same drug? I am not a member of the committee, but I sat there as \nChairman Kennedy presided. As I recall, there was a consensus on that \nissue, which was, let us codify what the FDA does now.\n  That is what the language was supposed to do. There was not supposed \nto be a change. There was not supposed to be a wrinkle. There was not \nsupposed to be anything different. And now, all of a sudden, we are \nhearing an objection based on that provision. I do not quite understand \nit because there was some discussion early on in the bill that the \nSenator from Arizona and I introduced about whether bioequivalence was \nthe same. We intended it to be the same, but we were silent. Adding \nthis provision just clarified it.\n  So there is no new change here, none. To not move forward on the bill \non that basis, when there seems to be a complete meeting of the minds \nof what to do, does not make sense.\n  The second point is this, and both my colleague from Massachusetts \nand my able colleague from Michigan, who has been such a leader on this \nbill, have made it clear: The people are waiting. Every day, every \nminute, someone--a senior citizen, a family with a child who is ill--\napproaches the prescription drugstore counter with trepidation \nwondering what that bill will be.\n  They want the best drugs for themselves and their loved ones. Yet \nthey are afraid they cannot afford it. They are afraid it means not \npaying the rent. They are afraid it will mean not buying gasoline for \ntheir car.\n  Here we have a solution. I would not say it is the most breathtaking \nsolution. I would like to see prescription drugs added to Medicare. We \nare going to have a big fight about that. But it is a solution that \nmakes a real difference, that reduces prices on a large number of \ndrugs, that has some consensus, that does not get into the free market \nversus price control argument that has plagued us as we have tried to \ncome to some kind of agreement.\n  So we have a proposal. We are ready to debate it. The majority \nleader, realizing its importance, has given us plenty of time. And the \nfirst thing we hear is objection to moving forward.\n  Again, as Senator Kennedy has said, I am willing, as a sponsor of the \nbill, to be amenable. The more, the merrier. I do not want a partisan \nvictory. I want to get something passed. We have spent a long time \ntrying to work this out, and it is complicated. We know that. But when \nI hear the first thing done is objection to proceeding--as opposed to \nsomebody calling up the chairman or myself and saying, what did you \nreally mean by this? Shouldn't we dot the i's, cross the t's, and put \ntogether an amendment?--I get a little worried.\n  So I hope this is not an indication of anything in the future. I hope \nthis is an indication that we can try to come together, despite some of \nour differing views, to work on how to reduce the costs of these \nwonderful drugs that are so expensive and together bring up a good \nbill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the majority leader \nfor his attempt to bring forward this possible solution to help our \nelderly address the enormous problem that seniors face in drug costs \nand in getting prescription drug care, to use that bill and that tool \nof generics and others to try to assist our seniors in dealing with the \nphenomenal cost and concerns they have in being able to provide for \nthemselves the prescription drugs they actually need for the quality of \nlife we all know they deserve.\n  We all have parents and grandparents, we have neighbors and loved \nones who are suffering from the unbelievable dealings of the increase \nin cost of prescription drugs. For us in Arkansas, where we don't have \nmany tools at all; we have lost all of the Medicare+Choice plans that \nserved Arkansas. The last two or three left in December, none of which \nprovided a prescription drug package, which means our seniors in \nArkansas are basically subsidizing other seniors across this country in \ntheir tax dollars. Other seniors in other areas, where a \nMedicare+Choice plan fits can actually get a prescription drug package \nbecause our seniors are subsidizing that. So our seniors in Arkansas \nare paying top dollar, more than you or I or anybody else who has \ninsurance or who has a program like Medicare+Choice or something else, \na Medigap program that is helping to pay for that, are paying more than \nanybody else for prescription drugs.\n  That is unheard of. Sixty percent of our seniors in Arkansas tend to \nneed more prescription drugs because, unfortunately, their availability \nto health care is less. The other thing is their availability to \nprescription drugs out in rural areas is a lot more difficult. These \nare people who need assistance. They don't need, as Senator Stabenow \nmentioned, a lot more discussion, a lot more talk, and a lot more \npromises. What they need is action.\n  Unfortunately, what happened tonight was a roadblock that would \nprevent the kind of action we need in moving forward. We have 2 weeks \nto debate and talk about the initiatives here for the generics bill and \nsome of the other proposals for prescription drugs but to move this \ndebate forward. That is what seniors are waiting on; they are waiting \non a solution. But more importantly, they are waiting on us to begin \nthe debate. Unfortunately, that is what was stopped tonight.\n  I hope we can all come together and work out whatever differences \nthey may have found from the committee, a bill that passed out in a \nbipartisan way, but work those details out, hopefully tonight, so maybe \nwe can bring forward, without having to go through the unusual \nprocedural cloture motion to bring something up, that we can begin the \ndebate in earnest and begin to honestly look at the ways we can help \nthe seniors of the Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to address the body quickly and briefly but \nimportantly on what is happening in North Korea and to North Korean \nrefugees coming out of that country.\n  Prior to the July 4th recess, my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Allen, and I brought to light the plight of North Korean \nrefugees in a hearing before the Immigration Subcommittee. The hearing \ncapped a month of activity that involved the passage of resolution on \nNorth Korean refugees in both the House and the Seante. Both \nresolutions strongly urged the Chinese government not to repatriate \nNorth Korean refugees back to North Korea. The House version passed by \n406 to 0 and our resolution passed by unanimous consent on June 19, \n2002.\n  At our hearing, we heard some very moving testimony from Ms. Lee \nSoon-Ok, a North Korean defector who suffered more than five years in a \nprison camp. We also heard from Ms. Helie Lee, a Korean American writer \nwhose memoir, In the Absence of the Sun, movingly highlighted a largely \nhidden and painful secret shared by hundreds of thousands of Korean \nAmericans and millions of Koreans--more than 50 years of separation \namong family members and loved ones since the outbreak of the Korean \nWar. Few other country and its people has suffered as much.\n  In addition, Mr. President, I urged Secretary Powell in both a formal \nconsultation and by correspondence on the need of our Department of \nState to allow the processing of North Korean refugees together with \nthe Chinese government and the Beijing office of the United Nations \nHigh Commissioner on Refugees.\n  The plight of North Korean refugees, of course, is merely a symptom \nof a far more pressing issue--how to deal with one of the most \nrepressive and totalitarian states in the world, the isolated country \nof North Korea ruled by one man, Kim Jong-il.\n  Although news regarding the efforts of many in the NGO community and \ncountless others working in North East China have been slowly filtering \ninto the West, the true nature of the North Korean regime is largely \nhidden and inaccessible.\n  It was not until the showing of a dramatic video of five members of \nthe Han-mee family being forcibly removed from the Japanese consulate \nin Beijing that the world began to pay attention. Since then, several \nother asylum bids have drawn the attention of mainstream media, \nincluding the horrifying story of baby-killings in North Korean prison \ncamps reported in the New York Times and based on the testimony of Ms. \nSoon Ok Lee, who, as I indicated before, testified at our hearing.\n  In June 2002, ABC Nightime broadcast a three-part documentary of the \nNorth Korean refugee in China by Ms. Kim Jung-eun whose schedule did \nnot permit her to testify before our committee. I was told by ABC News \nstaff that thousands of Americans have responded to the broadcast with \ne-mails in disbelief and in rage against the North Korean regime. I \nunderstand that the three programs drew high response from viewers.\n  It is estimated that between 2 to 3 million people died of starvation \nand persecution in North Korea from 1995 through 1998 and that up to up \nto 300,000 North Korean refugees in China are living a precarious and \ndangerous life, hiding by day, begging by night, in an effort to avoid \nbeing captured and repatriated back to North Korea by Chinese and North \nKorean agents brazenly operating inside China\n  Of the 300,000 refugees, only 518 refugees successfully defected to \nSouth Korea this year through June 2002, many of them by taking refuge \nat foreign missions in Beijing and in Shenyang, China.\n  These actions by the Chinese are simply unacceptable, not only to \nbasic principles and tenets of international human rights, but also by \nthe fact that China is a signatory of the International Refugees \nConvention. Hundreds of South Korean, Japanese and western NGO's are \nworking inside China to help the refugees, risking their lives and \ncapture by the Chinese police. A German doctor who also testified \nbefore our committee worked in North Korea for a year and a half but \nwas evicted by the North Korean regime for disclosing the tragedies of \nthe NK people. People like him and others on the ground in China and \nKorea have been some of the most vocal and active in their effort to \nmake the whole world aware of the conditions in North Korea and China. \nMany NGO's have taken care of refugee families full-time with their own \nmoney.\n  I've met with many of these people, all of whom are now effectively \nshut down from operating in China. And what they tell me over and over \nis that they simply cannot not ignore what they saw. All of them said \nto me that they could not look away and ignore the refugees, many of \nwhom were too scared to even beg for help.\n  These NGO's from South Korea, Japan, the U.S., France, and Germany, \nfirst reported the tragedy of the North Koreans to the outside world. \nThese NGOs who are in the best position to know report that food aid \nfrom South Korea, the U.S., and Japan, simply are not reaching the \ndying people. As I mentioned in a previous statement, I believe it is \nabsolutely necessary to condition stringent monitoring of the delivery \nof food aid by NGOs in an effort to determine that they are being \ndistributed appropriately. Much of this aid is apparently being \ndiverted to feed the million-plus North Korean army and to reward the \nelites and the inner circle around Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. For this \nreason, many well-respected NGOs, including Doctors Without Borders \nhave withdrawn from North Korea.\n  More troubling is that these NGO's have confirmed reports of more \nthan a dozen prison camps in North Korea, where the prisoners are \nstarved, forced to work at hard labor, and tortured to death.\n  Aside from the troubling refugee issue, we cannot forget that North \nKorea is a threat to regional and global security. North Korea \ncontinues its procurement of materials and components for its ballistic \nmissile programs from foreign sources, especially through North Korean \nfirms based in China. In addition, North Korea has become a ``secondary \nsupplier'' of missile technology and expertise to several countries in \nthe Middle East, South Asia and North Africa. The CIA's 2001 report \nassesses that North Korea is capable of producing and delivering via \nmissile warheads or other munitions a variety of chemical agents and \npossibly some biological.\n  Furthermore, North Korea refuses to carry out its obligations under \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT and the 1994 Agreed Framework. \nInitial IAEA, International Atomic Energy Agency, inspections and \nintelligence reports in the early 1990s triggered concerns regarding a \nclandestine nuclear weapons program. U.S. and foreign intelligence have \nconcluded that the DPRK government of North Korea probably has \nsufficient plutonium for 1 to 5 nuclear weapons. Despite its \nobligations under the NPT and the Agreed Framework, North Korea \ncontinues to refuse inspections.\n  So while it would be reason enough to continue our pressure on North \nKorea and China for the humanitarian violations alone, there are also \nthe pressing security threats that the current North Korean government \nposes to U.S. interests which must be dealt with. While refugee and \nnuclear weapons issues will necessitate very different responses--the \nthing they share in common is the alarms they raise about ignoring the \nNorth Korean problem in all its complexity.\n  While I am mindful of the diplomatic sensitivities regarding the need \nto reach out to the North Korean regime, there comes a time when we \nhave to confront the truth and tell the truth. Moreover, reconciliation \nefforts have yet to yield any results. There was\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\nmuch hope after the historic meeting between President Kim Dae Jung and \nJong-il in June 2000, that such a gesture would bring about some \nmeaningful change.\n  As the naval skirmish last month and the continuing problems with the \nNorth Korean refugees show, the North Korean issue has simply worsened. \nIt's time for the North Korean regime to immediately allow \ninternational monitoring of food aid into the country and to work with \nthe international NGO community to alleviate the suffering of its \npeople. That may at least stem the tide of refugees crossing over into \nChina and being prey to human traffickers and other difficulties faced \nby refugees. But more fundamentally, the North regime itself must begin \nto change itself and join the rest of the world in giving hope and \nfreedom to its people.\n  The U.S. can not afford to give into the slow-walking of reforms in \nNorth Korea. For our own security, for the stability of the region and \nfor the sake of basic human rights--North Korea must remain a top \npolicy focus for U.S. foreign policy. We must keep clear and constant \npressure on NK and neighboring countries to bring new leadership into \nbeing. This is a daunting task, but one that we can not afford to \nshirk.\n  We have significant refugee flight taking place out of North Korea. \nWe have had hearings in the Senate Immigration Committee on this \nparticular topic. We have a humanitarian crisis, probably the largest \nin the world, that is taking place. We estimate that there are between \n2 to 3 million people who have died of starvation and persecution in \nNorth Korea from 1995 to 1998, in a 3-year time period--2 to 3 million \npeople. Nobody knows for sure because outside observers are not \nallowed.\n  This Nation is the most repressive, closed regime in the world today. \nThe world community is feeding those who are left in North Korea. The \nUnited States and a number of other donating countries are feeding \nabout half of the population in North Korea. Much of the food aid we \nare giving North Korea is not getting out to where it is needed. It is \nstill held by the leadership in that country.\n  We estimate that some 300,000 North Korean refugees are living in \nChina today in a precarious and dangerous lifestyle. They are hiding by \nday and begging by night, trying to keep from being caught and sent \nback into North Korea, which is what China does. If they catch people \nfrom North Korea, they treat them as economic migrants and ship them \nback into starvation, refugee camps, persecution, and probably death.\n  Of the 300,000 refugees in China, only 518 refugees have successfully \ndefected, gotten out of China and into South Korea or into another \nthird country--that is this year, through June of 2002. Many of them \nhave done it by taking refugee status at foreign missions in Beijing \nand Shenyang, China. They have rushed embassies in those communities, \ngotten inside, asked for political asylum, it has been granted, and \nthey passed to South Korea, generally through a third country--many \ntimes through the Philippines. I say only 518 this year. If you look at \nthe history since the Korean conflict has ended--now 50 years ago--\nthere have been only several thousand who have defected from North \nKorea into South Korea. Generally, each year, it has been a trickle--\nmaybe in the teens.\n  The North Korean regime has been able to keep people in a dogmatic \nsystem, saying this regime is the best in the world and saying they are \nbeing fed by the President and the leadership. Now that trickle is \nbeginning to really move. They believe it may be up to a thousand; \nthere may be a thousand or more defecting this year alone, which is a \nmassive number considering the history.\n  Mr. President, the issue I want to bring to light is the role of \nChina and the importance of China in allowing these people to live. If \nChina will allow these people to pass through, or if China will allow \nthe U.N. Commission, or the High Commission on Refugees to establish a \nprocessing center to determine if these are people who need to be \nallowed to pass into third countries, thousands if not millions of \npeople will not have to live in North Korea. If China does not, you are \ngoing to see thousands, possibly millions more, die of starvation, \npersecution, and other causes.\n  China has a choice. They will choose what the status is going to be, \nwhether these people will live or die. They need to be confronted \ndirectly and asked to let these people live, to let them pass through. \nLet them pass through to Mongolia, to South Korea, to other places; but \ndon't send them back. If they don't want to have them stay in China, \nallow some place for them to go through, such as a refugee center. But, \nChina, make the choice. It is your responsibility and their blood that \nwill be on your call as to what you determine you are going to do in \nthis particular situation.\n  North Korea is a country that is difficult for us or anybody else in \nthe world to influence. China is the only country in the world that has \nsome influence on North Korea. So it is going to be their choice as to \nwhether these people will live or die.\n  North Korea needs to change its regime. I don't need to remind \nMembers of the Senate of the other problems we have with North Korea. \nThey are a supplier of weapons. North Korea has become a secondary \nsupplier of missile technology and expertise to several countries in \nthe Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa. The CIA's 2001 report \nassesses that North Korea is capable of producing and delivering via \nmissile warheads, or other munitions, a variety of chemical agents and \npossibly some biological agents as well.\n  Mr. President, I draw this to the attention of my colleagues because \nwe need to allow refugees to pass and come into the United States as \nwell. We will be bringing this issue up again in front of this body. I \nhope we will put pressure on China, which doesn't have a good human \nrights record, so that they can act to save people's lives--if they \nwill only allow these people to pass through.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very hopeful the Senate will be able \nto get on the issue of prescription drug coverage very soon. This is an \nurgent issue for seniors and the people of this country. I want to \nspend a few minutes tonight talking about why this is so important and \nwhat I think the real challenge is to the Senate in the next couple of \nweeks.\n  Mr. President, for the last quarter of the 20th century, the standard \nGovernment line on prescription drugs for older people was a little bit \nlike the marquee of the big, old-fashioned theaters you would see \ndowntown. The marquee sign was all lit up and it always read: ``Coming \nsoon.'' But, for seniors, that ``soon'' just never seems to arrive.\n  Years ago, when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers--I had the \nhonor to be co-director for about 7 years before I was elected to the \nHouse--I got many of the questions then that all of us in the Senate \nget now. Seniors asked then, just as they do now at our town meetings, \nif anybody in Washington is ever going to provide some real help in \npaying for prescription medicines.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Daschle has made this a priority issue \nfor the Senate. He has made it very clear to me that he is willing to \nwork with anybody in the Senate to finally get this job done and to get \nit done right.\n  I think we know what this issue is all about for seniors, and that is \nthe cost of medicine and coverage for medicine. In effect, cost and \ncoverage really go hand in hand because if you are able to get seniors \ncoverage, but you have not held down the cost, then you are not getting \na whole lot for the Government's money. Of course, if you take steps to \ncontrol costs, but many seniors still don't have the ability to meet \neven those costs, we will continue to have more and more older people \nfall between the cracks.\n\n  So it is important that the Senate addresses both of these issues and \naddresses them right. I want to talk for a few minutes about what I \nthink some of the key components are first of holding costs down. \nFirst, I think it is important that it be done with bargaining power in \nthe private sector. In discussing this--and we will do this over\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nthe next couple of weeks--I want to describe what I was involved in \nback in the 1970s when I was co-director of the Oregon Gray Panthers.\n  I remember one rainy night standing with a swarm of seniors around a \nlabor union pharmacy that was barely bigger than a pill box. We were \nkicking off a program that night where seniors, through labor unions \nand others in the community, had been able to bargain with \npharmaceutical concerns, and seniors were able to get their drugs at \ncost, plus a small monthly fee. It worked for the company, it worked \nfor the seniors.\n  The community pulled together, and in this little pharmacy, which I \nhave said was really no bigger than a pill box, we saw that you could \nset up bargaining power right in the private sector. I think tonight, \nhow many more older people in this country need the benefits of \nbargaining power today? So I am very hopeful that on this question of \ncost containment we focus on bargaining power.\n  Senator Daschle made it clear that it is a priority to him. He will \nwork with all our colleagues to make sure that is in a final bill and \nthat we remember that across this country, and that what happened in \nEugene, OR, more than 25 years ago has been duplicated elsewhere, and \nthat what happened there is all about making sure people could have \nbargaining power in the private sector so that senior citizens can \nafford their medicine.\n  The underlying legislation that is going to give all Americans--not \njust seniors, but all Americans--quicker access to generic drugs is \nanother step toward private sector cost containment. I commend my \ncolleagues--Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, and others--who have \nworked so hard on this legislation.\n  After I had the honor of serving as codirector of the Gray Panthers, \nI served on the Health Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, \nand we had a chance to work on what I thought was historic legislation. \nIt was drafted by our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nUtah, Orrin Hatch, and Congressman Waxman. It struck a good balance \nbetween holding down costs for seniors by making it easier to get \naccess to generic medicine, while at the same time promoting innovation \nand research in the breakthrough products that are so important to \nseniors in this country.\n  I believed the Congress got it right in that Hatch-Waxman legislation \nand that the legislation we will be considering over the next couple of \nweeks is going to continue that kind of balance. We may try to refine \nit, and I am certainly open to that, but I think it will continue that \ncrucial balance that was put together in the historic Hatch-Waxman \nlegislation of helping to contain the costs for seniors and others \nthrough access to generic medicine, while at the same time promoting \nthe new cures, the new research, the exciting breakthrough products \nthat are so important.\n  What I have tried to contribute to the Senate on prescription drugs \nhas been an effort to come up with solutions that are going to work in \nthe real world for Americans trying to navigate our health care system. \nIn the past two sessions of the Congress, Senator Snowe and I have \nintroduced bipartisan legislation. Tonight for just a few minutes, I \nwant to express my appreciation to Senator Daschle and others in the \nleadership because the bill they will try to offer when we get to the \nquestion of Medicare coverage for seniors has been a genuine effort to \naddress each of the concerns Senator Snowe and I have focused on in our \nlegislation.\n  When we get to that question, we are sure to have Members say this \ncountry cannot afford such coverage. They are going to say that the \ncosts have already accelerated today; that we are having a demographic \ntsunami coming in just a few years, with millions of more older people \nin 2009, 2010, and 2011 retiring, and they are going to say the country \ncannot afford for the Congress to cover prescription drugs for older \npeople.\n  I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, the Congress cannot \nafford not to cover senior citizens, and I want to give a short example \nof why this is so urgently needed.\n  Not long ago, a physician in Hillsboro, OR, in the metropolitan area \nsurrounding Portland, wrote to me that he put a senior citizen in a \nhospital for a 6-week course of antibiotics because it was the only way \nthe patient could afford the treatment.\n  Of course, when the senior goes into the hospital, Medicare Part A, \nwhich covers institutional services, picks up the bill, no questions \nasked. The check gets written by the program to cover the costs in the \nhospital. Of course, that same condition could have been treated under \nMedicare Part B, the outpatient portion of Medicare. Our assessment is \nthat to spend 6 weeks in an Oregon hospital probably cost the Medicare \nProgram $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, to pick up those huge costs for an \nindividual who had to be hospitalized to get the benefit, whereas it \nprobably would have cost a few hundred dollars to have treated that \nperson on an outpatient basis under Part B of the Medicare Program.\n\n  When we hear in this Chamber and elsewhere that America cannot afford \nto cover prescription drugs for seniors, I am going to do my best to \nremind people about what I heard from that physician in Hillsboro, OR, \nand it has been repeated all over this country, because I think it is \nclear we cannot afford not to have this important program.\n  We know what needs to be done in the next few weeks. We ought to \npromote easier access to generics. It is one of the key parts of the \nequation of doing this right. We ought to make sure that seniors have \nbargaining power in the private sector.\n  The model that will be used in the legislation Senator Graham and \nSenator Miller have drafted incorporated much of what I and Senator \nSnowe have been concerned about, and that is to make sure that \nbargaining power is structured in the private sector so that costs are \nnot shifted to millions of other Americans. There is no Senator who \nwants, in the effort to come up with a prescription drug proposal for \nseniors, to end up shifting costs on to their children and their \ngrandchildren. That is why private sector bargaining power, something \nabout which I and Senator Snowe have felt strongly, and Senator Daschle \nhas graciously worked with us on, is included in what the Senate is \ngoing to have a chance to vote for.\n  Those are some of the key questions. I will wrap up by way of saying \nthat as we move into this discussion over the next couple of weeks, we \nhave one principal challenge as we try to pass a comprehensive bill and \nthen have it go to discussions with our colleagues in the House, and \nthat is to make it clear to the country that this is a real effort to \nhelp, and not just an exercise in election-year rhetoric. The seniors \nwho have come to us at our meetings have watched this Congress and \nother Congresses debate this topic and come back to it sporadically \nfrom time to time. They want to know: Is this on the level? Is this a \nreal effort now to do the job right? I believe it is. I believe the \ncommitment is there now and that this is not just an election-year \nexercise.\n  There are key principles. We have an opportunity to address the \nquestions of cost and coverage in a way that can win the support of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. The question of private sector \nbargaining power, ensuring that the program is voluntary so that any \nsenior who is comfortable with their existing coverage can continue it \nif they choose to do otherwise--these are principles that are going to \nbe in the Graham-Miller proposal that can win the support of colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  These are principles that can bring the Senate together.

Mr. President, this is not a happy day for America. On \nthis day occurs a memorial service for Lew Wasserman, who died in his \n89th year. He is one of the two giants of the American free enterprise \nsystem who for over 60 years helped shape and build one of America's \ngreatest export trade prizes and an extraordinary engine of economic \nand creative growth: The American film industry. He was a pioneer of \ngreat intellect and innovation. He could see what others could not, for \nhe had the gift of vision, both rare and valuable.\n  He was more than that. He was a patriot in a shining sense of that \nword. He cared about his country and all who live in it. He believed in \nthe American free market system. He was appalled at the behavior of \nthose executives who knowingly soiled the honor and integrity of that \nsystem.\n  He and his wife, Edie, believed in young people and lavished millions \nof dollars in scholarships on them at a dozen universities on a \ncontinuing basis. His heart and his purse went without hesitation to \nthe Motion Picture Home and Hospital, giving it millions of dollars so \nthat those in the movie industry, hard-working craftsmen, artisans, and \ncreators, when they became old and sick, could be cared for.\n  More millions were conferred anonymously. Lew never sought the \nspotlight because fame was not his goal nor publicity his guide. He had \nan old-fashioned view about loyalty. He never turned his back on a \nfriend nor did he ever break his word once given to an individual, to a \ncause, to his country. Those who worked with him revered him because he \nnever considered himself their leader but, rather, one who served his \nemployees and their company.\n  There are many in this Congress today who can bear personal witness \nto his commitment to be of service to the Nation. He was the personal \nfriend of Presidents from John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, to Bill \nClinton. I daresay if God granted him the time, he would have known and \nserved George W. Bush. To me, personally, he was invariably kind, \nthoughtful, responsive to my requests for counsel and his wise \njudgment. He never asked me for a thing. He was, to my mind, the \nexemplar of the man who wants to give back more than he gained, to give \nback to his neighborhoods, his industry, to the young whose hopes are \nslender, to offer more than he has asked for, to strive always to try \nto make the future of this country a favorite and favorable place for \ngenerations of Americans yet unborn.\n  He shunned tributes, but he was proud of the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom bestowed on him by President Clinton. If he had not just bought \nUniversal Studios, he would have accepted the Cabinet post offered to \nhim by President Johnson. He is truly one of those unique human beings \nwhose like is seldom found, which is why his loss is so profound to \nthis Nation. I miss him. I thank him for being my friend. And I wish \nhis family Godspeed during these difficult times.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on June 3, our Nation lost one of its \nfinest citizens. Lew Wasserman, long time president and chairman of MCA \nand friend of Presidents, died at the age of 89.\n  Lew came from humble roots, but never forgot those less fortunate \nthan he. An entertainment industry visionary and modern day mogul, Lew \nWasserman, along with his wonderful wife, Edie, used their position and \nresources to support hospitals and cultural institutions; to provide \nscholarships to young people; to fund research to prevent blindness; \nand to support political candidates in whose leadership they believed. \nIn a rough and tumble industry, he believed in fairness and thoughtful \nmediation, and he cared passionately about our political system and \ndemocratic ideals.\n  Lew Wasserman was a mentor and role model to an entire industry and a \ngreat friend to Presidents of both parties, including my husband. I was \nhonored that he was my friend; but, even more than that, I was grateful \nfor his many contributions to America.\n  On September 29, 1995, my husband awarded Lew Wasserman the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom. In his remarks, the President said of \nLew:\n\n       I have met a lot of philanthropists and successful people \n     in my life. I don't know that I ever met anybody that more \n     consistently every day looked for another opportunity to do \n     something for somebody else, to give somebody else the chance \n     to enjoy the success that he had in life. I thank you, Lew \n     Wasserman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6804-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNIVERSITY OF DREAMS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 10, \n2000, in Albuquerque, NM. A man in a minivan yelling obscenities ran \ndown participants in a gay pride parade. One victim was hit twice in \nthe knees and thrown off the hood. The perpetrator tried to swerve into \nthe crowd three times before police finally pulled him out of the \nvehicle and arrested him.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to note the release on July 15, \n2002 of the first annual report of the U.S.-China Security Review \nCommission.\n  Shortly after the enactment in the year 2000 of legislation giving \nChina Permanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, the Congress, thanks to \nthe leadership of Senator Robert C. Byrd, passed legislation creating \nthe U.S.-China Security Review Commission. According to the law that \nestablished the Commission, its purpose is to ``monitor, investigate \nand report to the Congress on the national security implications of the \nbilateral trade and economic relationship between the\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\nUnited Stats and the People's Republic of China''. The legislation \nwhich created the Commission charges it to submit an annual report to \nthe Congress with recommendations for action, if any.\n  The bi-partisan Commission is composed of twelve commissioners, three \nof whom were appointed by each of the Congressional leaders in both the \nHouse and Senate. To prepare itself to issue its first Report the \nCommission held nine open hearings and took testimony from 115 \nwitnesses on 35 separate panels. It also contracted for new research on \nChina from a variety of sources including extensive translation and \nanalysis of articles on economic, political, and trade issues that are \nappearing in influential Chinese publications. Members of the \nCommission also traveled to China, Taiwan, Japan, and the headquarters \nof the World Trade Organization, WTO, in Geneva. During its \ndeliberations the Commission developed a broad bi-partisan agreement on \nthe issues it was charged by Congress to study, and it adopted its \nfirst report by a vote of 11-1.\n  Among its key findings are that the United States, by acting as \nChina's largest export market and a key investor in the Chinese \neconomy, has been a major contributor to China's rise as an economic \npower. It further notes that our trade relationship with China is not \nonly our largest trade deficit in absolute terms, but is the most \nunbalanced trading relationship maintained by the United States.\n  The Report further notes that while U.S. imports from China \nconstitute over 40 percent of China's exports, U.S. exports to China \nrepresent only two percent of our total exports. It finds that the U.S. \ntrade deficit with China is not only in low-skilled labor intensive \nitems, but also in a majority of items found on the Commerce \nDepartment's list of advanced technology products. It further finds \nthat there is plausible evidence that our burgeoning trade deficit with \nChina will worsen regardless of China's entry into the WTO.\n  The Report also discusses the fast increasing trade and investment \nlinkages between China and Taiwan which the Commission notes ``could \nameliorate tensions between the two'', but which are also increasing \n``U.S. dependence on the items made in China for our computer \nelectronics and other high technology products''.\n  The Report makes a number of recommendations to better the chances \nfor building a better long-term mutually beneficial economic and \npolitical relationship with China. Among these are: 1. That we put in \nplace new programs to build a much wider expertise about China both in \nour society and among policymakers, and 2. that we take new measures to \nkeep our industrial, scientific, and technological base from eroding as \na result of our economic relations with a China whose government has \nadopted policies to expand its own base even at our expense.\n  I think this first Report of the Commission makes a very valuable \ncontribution to our policy deliberations on China. It will be very \nhelpful to the Congress as we examine how to respond to the challenges \nto our country posed by China's strengthening economic, military, and \npolitical profiles. We can best craft sensible policies if we better \nunderstand the perceptions that Chinese leaders have of us and what \ntheir long-term goals are. Judging the Commission's Report will help us \ndo both.\n  I salute Senator Byrd for his wisdom in calling for the creation of \nthe Commission and thank all of its Commissioners for the important \ncontributions that their first Report makes to our knowledge of the \nU.S.-China economic and political relationship. I commend the Report to \nmy fellow Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6805-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLEARING THE AIR IN THE SMOKIES\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is \ntruly the crown jewel of our national park system. With towering \nmountains, clear streams, and a diversity of wildlife, Tennessee is \nfortunate to have such a tremendous treasure in our own backyard. \nDuring the Senate's July break, I returned to the Smokies, to once \nagain hike Mt. LeConte, this year with my oldest son, Harrison. Our \nhike up the Alum Cave trail was exhilirating, and we spent the night at \nLeConte Lodge, watching the sunset, and enjoying the hearty meals and \ngood fellowship of fellow hikers.\n  My trip to the Smokies this month had another purpose, too. This \nyear, I invited EPA Administrator Christie Whitman to join me in order \nfor her to see first-hand the air quality problem that plagues our \nbeautiful park. Over the coming months, Congress and President Bush's \nAdministration will analyze and pursue policies to improve our nation's \nair quality. As this process moves forward, I wanted to make sure that \nthe President's top official responsible for protecting our environment \nheard directly from park officials and saw for herself the unique \nchallenge facing the Smokies.\n  As the first EPA Administrator to ever visit the park, Administrator \nWhitman demonstrated her personal commitment to address the pollution \nproblem. We hiked to the park's highest point, Clingman's Dome, where \nAdministrator Whitman looked out on a vista where natural visibility \nshould be about 77 miles, but on the hot July day we visited, was \nreduced to only 15 miles. Air entering the southern Appalachians is \ntrapped by geography and weather patterns, capturing pollution and \nharmful emissions in the park, and no where is that point made more \nclear than at Clingman's Dome.\n  Any plan to clean up the air in the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark must contain two essential elements. First, we must reduce harmful \nemissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. President Bush has \nproposed a plan, the Clear Skies Initiative, that contains the most \ndramatic reductions in these harmful emissions ever proposed by an \nadministration. The plan would reduce power plant emissions by 70 \npercent by the year 2018. I will continue to closely study the Clear \nSkies Initiative and its potential impact on our mountains and across \nour state.\n  Second, we must reduce emissions in the most efficient and effective \nmanner possible. Our quality of life and future economic development \ndepends on how we pursue these reductions. Tennessee's families, \nbusinesses and communities depend on affordable and reliable energy. A \nthoughtful and responsible approach to address the park's air quality \nissue requires us to closely examine any proposal and to ensure it is \nbased on sound science. Tennesseans and all Americans deserve no less \nfrom their elected officials.\n  It is also important to remember that air quality is a comprehensive \nproblem that requires a comprehensive response. Roughly, one-half of \nthe problems in the Smokies are caused by power plants, one third by \ncars and trucks, and the rest from various other sources. As we review \nsolutions, we must address every source of emissions. For example, I \nwant to commend local officials for Pigeon Forge's recent Clean Air \nWeek which promoted reducing emissions through the use of low emissions \npublic transportation. Park officials are looking at alternatives to \ntransportation problems in the park, which will not only clean up the \nair, but enhance the overall visitor's experience. Continued discussion \nby all, local, State and federal officials along with concerned \ncitizens, will ensure the most innovative, common-sense solutions and \nensure we do what's right for the Smokies.\n  Tennesseans are blessed with an abundance of natural resources, and \nthe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is world-renowned. However, we \nmust be mindful that if we are to continue to enjoy the Smokies, all of \nus have a responsibility to be good stewards of the park. I am \ncommitted to fight for what is best for the Smokies, and I am \nencouraged by Administrator Whitman's recent visit. The Smokies are a \nunique American experience that must be preserved for generations to \ncome, so that fathers and sons, just like Harrison and I, can know the \njoys of spending time together on a hike in the woods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6805-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6805-S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CRIMINAL PENALTIES RELATING TO TERRORIST ATTACKS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

VAN KIRKE NELSON\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \noutstanding Montanan whose distinguished career has literally changed \nthe course of two generations of families in the Flathead Valley. In \nthe 1950's a college student from Southern California came to Montana \nto be a camp counselor on Flathead Lake. As many do, he fell in love \nwith the area and pledged to return after completing medical school to \nbegin his practice in Kalispell, MT.\n  True to his word, Dr. Van Kirke Nelson, his wife Helen and their \nchildren Greg, Julie and Kathy packed all their belongings in a beer \ntruck and moved to Kalispell where Kirke became the town's first \nmedical specialist, opening his practice as an OB-GYN in 1962.\n  Forty years, two children, Nancy and Doug, and ten grandchildren \nlater, my dear friend Kirke Nelson retired from active medical practice \non July 1, 2002, leaving behind a legacy that has enriched the very \nfabric of the community to which he and his family mean so much.\n  For 40 years, Dr. Van Kirke Nelson delivered the town's babies. Lots \nof babies. So many, in fact, that it is not unusual for him to look at \na list of Flathead High graduates and determine that he has delivered a \nmajority of them.\n  Think of it this way. At 10 babies a month, 12 months a year, for 41 \nyears, Kirke delivered roughly 4,920 babies in his career. To put that \nin perspective, those 4,920 new Montanans are a larger group than the \nentire population of 22 of Montana's 56 counties.\n  But the quality of Kirke's career cannot be measured in numbers. \nEvery day he changed lives and made the Flathead Valley and Montana a \nbetter place to live. Partners, co-workers, patients and their families \nall know what I mean. There are more stories than one can possibly \ntell, and you can be assured that although he is retired, there will be \nmany, many more stories yet to come.\n  Because you see, Kirke Nelson will never retire from making a \ndifference in the world around him. The phone may not ring in the \nmiddle of the night anymore, but knowing Kirke as I do, that just means \nhe'll just be better rested for the challenges that lay ahead.\n  I know no better Montanans than Kirke and Helen Nelson. I wish for \nthem in this retirement an enriched life with each other and their \nwonderful family. There are not thanks enough for this kind of career \nthat Kirke has shared with us, but that's what makes America so great. \nOurs is a country where dreams come true. Where promises are our bond. \nAnd where ordinary careers become extraordinary because of the people \nwho live them.\n  Kirke Nelson's career has been truly extraordinary. And on behalf of \na grateful community, State and nation, it is my honor to rise today to \nsay thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6806-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF WESLEY COLLEGE ATHLETICS, COACH RICK McCALL AND CHRIS \n                NOLL, 2002 NCAA NATIONAL GOLF CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Wesley \nCollege's Chris Noll, the 2002 NCAA National Golf Champion. His victory \ndemonstrates the success that comes from hard work, perseverance, \nexperience of a remarkable team, a dedicated coach, and the support of \nan outstanding college.\n  The championship competition held in Nebraska last month ended a \ndramatic, record-breaking season for the Wolverines. After a stellar \noverall performance throughout the year, the Wolverines were selected \nby a committee to play in the NCAA Championships. At the championship, \nthey scored their highest finish in both Wesley records and in \nPennsylvania Athletic Conference history. The team dominated the \nConference and won the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference Tournament.\n  Throughout the season, Chris Noll set Wesley College records. He \nfinished first in the Glen Health Ship Builders, the Wesley College \nInvitational, the King's College National Invitational tournaments and \nthe District II Championships. The Dover sophomore was named \nPennsylvania Athletic Conference Player of the Week for four \nconsecutive weeks in addition to a Ping All-American. He closed the \nseason as the 2002 NCAA National Golf Champion.\n  For the past decade Wolverine Coach Rick McCall has worked tirelessly \nto successfully build and strengthen the men's golf program. McCall was \nnamed All-Middle Atlantic Region Coach of the Year this season, as well \nas the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference Coach of the Year. In 1989 he \nwon the Delaware State Golf Association Annual Golf Award. Later he was \ngiven the Pat Knight Award for his lifetime contribution to junior golf \nand two Philadelphia P.G.A. Junior Golf Awards.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncourtesies, as always.\n  Mr. President, I serve on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee and am pleased that we reported out a bill to improve generic \ndrug competition in America and to address the high cost of \nprescription drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act, which passed in 1984, is \nconsidered to be a remarkable piece of legislation. It strives to \nprovide patent protection to companies that invests hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to develop new drugs. At the same time, it limits \nthat protection by allowing generic competition. It allows generic drug \nmanufacturers to take a patented drug, produce it, and sell it at a \nmuch lower price, a competitive price, driving down the price of the \ndrug for consumers.\n  Since 1984 the scales, it appears, have tilted too much in favor of \nthe name-brand producer of the drug, the patent holder of the drug, and \ntoo much against the generic manufacturers. There have been some \nproblems on both sides of this issue. Loopholes of the Hatch-Waxman Act \nare being exploited, giving one side an advantage over the other. In \nfact, one of the things that has occurred is some generic companies \nhave challenged patents and have gotten the right to produce patented \ndrugs, because they have challenged it using the procedures of the act. \nThen they enter into an agreement with the original patent holder to \nnot produce the generic drug--thereby agreeing to not compete with the \nname-brand manufacturer. This is a loophole that needs to be \neliminated.\n  I believe S.812 will help recover the delicate balance that was \noriginally intended by the Hatch-Waxman Act. I believe it will help \ncontain the rising costs of prescription drugs. I believe it will also \nencourage production of drugs the way we intended, but at the same time \nwill eliminate unfair patent extensions. I believe that by reporting \nthis bill out of committee, we are moving in the right direction. I \nsalute Senators Edwards, Collins, Schumer, and McCain who have worked \nto produce this legislation. I think it is going to be something we can \nall support.\n  I know we will be beginning to talk about prescription drugs in \ngeneral later this week, and I think it is time to do so. This Congress \nvoted--I voted--for a budget last year that set aside $300 billion for \na prescription drug benefit. However, we were not able to pass a \nprescription drug benefit last year, and it remains to be seen whether \nwe will be successful this year.\n\n  There are a lot of different views about how prescription drugs \nshould be handled. Over the Fourth of July weekend, I visited two \nassisted care living facilities in Alabama: Chateau Vestavia near \nBirmingham and Westminster in Mobile, Alabama. I talked with seniors \nwho have high drug bills and listened to what they had to say. I wanted \nto have their input as the Senate moved toward considering a \nprescription drug proposal. They told me that they are most concerned \nabout high drug prices. I spoke with seniors that are struggling to pay \nfor their drugs.\n  My mother is in her eighties. She has a $300-a-month drug bill. She \nis in relatively good health, although she has arthritis and high blood \npressure. Her sister's drug bill is even higher than that each month. \nThey are both in an assisted living center. They are getting by, but it \nis not easy. For people who\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nrely on their Social Security as their sole income, they are not able \nto get by with those drug prices.\n  We know we have a problem. The theory is this: If this federal \ngovernment, through Medicare, will pay for the removal of a kidney, or \nwill pay for the amputation of a leg, is it not irrational that we \nwould not pay to fund drugs that would keep people from having to have \na kidney removed or keep people from having to have an amputation \nbecause they are diabetic?\n  We are at a point where drugs are such a central part of health care \nin America, that we cannot leave them out of Medicare.\n  The seniors I visited with in Alabama want us here in the Senate to \naddress the high cost of drugs. They believe they are higher than they \nneed to be--and I agree. They would like to see less paperwork in the \nprocess, less bureaucracy, and less fraud. They would also like to see \nthat they can go to their local pharmacy and buy the drugs there and \ntalk to a pharmacist about them if they choose. They would like to be \nable to buy through direct mail and mail order if they choose. Those \nare things we will have to wrestle with. I intend to be talking with \nmore seniors as time goes by so we can listen to their concerns and \ndesires and see what we can do to pass a responsible bill.\n  We are not doing anything to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for \ndrugs today. We should not fail to act at all and do nothing simply \nbecause we can't do everything we would like to do today.\n  We need to have some relief now. We have people this day who are \nhaving to choose between food and rent and drugs. They often are not \nable to buy the drugs they need to keep themselves healthy, and that \nleads to complications and even greater health care costs.\n  We need to quit putting this off. If we cannot afford the Cadillac, \nwe need a Ford. We need to do something to move forward. Seniors need \nhelp now.\n  People who need drugs, seniors who need drugs, all Medicare \nbeneficiaries who need them and simply cannot afford them need help. We \ncan do that through the budget we passed last year. There is, through \nPresident Bush's plan, an idea of using group purchasing power to \nreduce the cost through a prescription drug discount card. A number of \nmy pharmacist friends are concerned that could hurt them. That was not \nthe intent. They have challenged this card. But a card plan should not \nharm our pharmacists. We ought to be able to drive down the cost of \nprescription drugs by up to 20, 30, or 40 percent. That would be a \ntremendous savings. It would be good if we could do that today--and not \nwait any longer. It would be a monumental step forward.\n  We want our seniors to have choice and to not have to give up their \ncurrent coverage plans. We do not want them to have to enter into some \nsort of mandatory plan that costs them more and provides less benefits.\n  Beneficiaries should have information and the choice to choose \nbetween whether they want generic drugs or name-brand drugs. That is a \nchoice that many can make. We need to make sure that option is \navailable to them.\n  We did vote for a budget last year that provides for $300 billion for \nprescription drugs. We have allowed our spending here to get out of \ncontrol. Our discretionary spending last year hit about a 7 percent \nincrease. This year, likewise, with defense and supplementals, it could \nbe greater than that. If we get our spending under control and contain \nexcessive spending, we ought to be able to fund a plan that would meet \nthe needs of thousands of seniors who are in a crisis situation today.\n  Politics should be put on the back burner. It is time to ask \nourselves how we can accomplish passing a piece of legislation that we \nall can support, that the American people would like to see passed, and \nthat we can afford. We can do this, if we watch our cost and do not let \nit get out of control. If we are smart and work at it and do it in a \nway that is bipartisan as this generic bill we passed out of the HELP \nCommittee last week, we can make good progress for America. I look \nforward to the debate and hope we can achieve that before the recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/15/senate-section/article/S6812-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
